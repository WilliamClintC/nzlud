by amending such provisions by specific reference to the section number of
this Code in the following language: "That section of the Code of Ordinances

such amendment contains provisions for which a penalty, other than the
aforementioned general penalty, is provided in another section in the same

thereof from reprinted pages.

(meaning the person, agency or organization authorized to prepare the
supplement) may make formal, nonsubstantive changes in ordinances and parts
of ordinances included in the supplement, insofar as it is necessary to do so
to embody them in a unified code. For example, the codifier may:



      (1)   Organize the ordinance material into appropriate
subdivisions;



      (2)   Provide appropriate catchlines, headings and titles for
sections and other subdivisions of the Code printed in the supplement, and
make changes in such catchlines, headings and titles;



      (3)   Assign appropriate numbers to sections and other
subdivisions to be inserted in the Code and, where necessary to accommodate
new material, change existing section or other subdivision numbers;



      (4)   Change the words "this ordinance" or words of the same
meaning to "this chapter," "this article," "this division," etc., as the case

incorporated into the Code); and



      (5)   Make other nonsubstantive changes necessary to preserve
the original meaning of ordinance sections inserted into the Code; but, in no
case, shall the codifier make any change in the meaning or effect of
ordinance material included in the supplement or already embodied in the Code.

of the provisions of this Code or any ordinance of the city shall be deemed a
public nuisance and shall be subject to abatement by the city.

provisions of this Code, or ordinance of the city, shall be construed, deemed
and taken as a separate and distinct violation of such provisions of this
Code, and in every event that a violation of this Code, or any of the
provisions hereof, shall continue, each day of such continuance shall be
deemed, construed and taken as a separate and distinct violation of the
provisions of this Code. Each day a violation exists shall constitute a
separate offense and shall be subject to a separate penalty. (Ord. No.
99-10-6, §1, 10-26-99)



   (e)   All persons imprisoned after conviction in the county court

DIVISION 2. EXPENSE REIMBURSEMENT



Sec. 2-31. Title.



   This division is entitled the "Cooper City Commissioners' Expense
Reimbursement Ordinance."



Sec. 2-32. Applicability of state law.



   As to all matters not specifically covered in this division, F.S. §
112.061 and any and all other state statutes pertaining to the subject matter
of this division shall control. It is the specific intent of the city to
adhere to all state standards as promulgated in reference to reimbursement of
expenses to public officials and standards for travel expenses, meal expenses
and all other forms of reimbursements for expenses incurred by public
officials. (Ord. No. 83-4-2, § 1, 4-12-83)



Sec. 2-33. Definitions.



   The definitions contained in F.S. § 112.061 are hereby adopted in full
without modification. To supplement these definitions, the following shall
apply:



   Agency or public agency means the city.



   Agency head or head of agency means the city commission.



Cross reference-Definitions and rules of construction generally, § 1-2.



Sec. 2-34. Travel expenses.



   (a)   Travel to be authorized in advance. All travel except within
Broward, Dade and Palm Beach Counties, Florida must be authorized by the city
commission in advance. No reimbursement for travel is authorized outside of
Broward, Dade or Palm Beach Counties unless approved in advance by the city
commission.



      (1)   Exceptions. The following city-related travel do not
require prior city commission approval, provided that the expenses do not
exceed the approved travel budget for that individual commissioner:  travel
in conjunction with the Florida League of Cities Annual Conference, Florida
League of Cities Legislative Delegation Committee Meetings, Broward Days, the
Florida League of Mayors Annual Conference, and the National League of Mayors
Annual Conference, or travel to Tallahassee or Washington D.C. to participate
in state and federal lobbying efforts on behalf of the city.



   (b)   Reimbursement for official travel only. Traveling expenses of
travelers shall be limited to those expenses necessarily incurred by them in
the performance of a public purpose authorized by law to be performed by the
agency. A traveler who combines personal and official travel is permitted
reimbursement only for the portion of the travel which is official in nature.



   (c)   Headquarters of city. In order to comply with state statutes
the official headquarters of the city is deemed to be the city hall of the
city, 9090 SW 50th Place, Cooper City, Florida, 33328, or other official city
hall location designation within the city.



   (d)   Computation of travel time for reimbursement. For purposes of
reimbursement and method of calculating fractional days of travel, the
principles set forth in F.S. § 112.061 shall apply. However, for a Broward
County League of Cities dinner deemed to be in the performance of the duties
of the members of the city commission, reimbursement for that meal
specifically may be made up to the amount of the meal for commissioner and
spouse.



   (e)   Rates of per diem and subsistence allowance. For purposes of
reimbursement rates and methods of calculations, per diem and subsistence
allowances are as follows: All travelers may be allowed reimbursement for
subsistence when traveling to a convention or conference or when traveling
outside the state in order to conduct bona fide public business, which
convention, conference or business serves a direct and lawful public purpose
with relation to the city. Either of the following, but not both, shall be
the method of reimbursement. A selection of the method to be used must be
made by the traveler prior to the travel incurred, in writing, by memorandum
to the finance director:



      (1)   Reimbursement for actual expenses incurred upon
presentation of receipts therefor. For each day of planned travel, fifty
dollars ($50.00) per day may be provided prior to departure to be used
towards payment of actual expenses. Should actual expenses be less than funds
provided prior to travel, same shall be refunded to the city. Should actual
expenses exceed the funds provided prior to travel, such expenses shall be
reimbursed upon presentation of receipts; or



      (2)   Up to the aggregate amount permitted by state statute
for meals, plus actual expenses for lodging at a single occupancy rate, to be
substantiated by paid bills therefor.

Sec. 2-35. Means of transportation.



   (a)   All travel must be by a usually traveled route. In case a
person travels by an indirect route for his own convenience, any extra cost
shall be borne by the traveler and reimbursement for expenses shall be based
only on such charges as would have been incurred by a usually traveled route.
The city commission shall designate the most economical method of travel for
each trip for members of the commission, keeping in mind the following
conditions:



      (1)   The nature of the business;



      (2)   The most efficient and economical means of travel
(considering time of the traveler, cost of transportation and per diem or
subsistence required);



      (3)   The number of persons making the trip, and the amount of
equipment or material to be transported.



   (b)   Transportation by common carrier when traveling on official
business and paid for personally by the traveler shall be substantiated by a
receipt therefor. If transportation other than the most economical class as
approved by the city commission is provided by a common carrier on a flight
check or credit card, the charges in excess of the most economical class
shall be refunded by the traveler to the city.

the plan and shall discharge its responsibilities solely in the interest of
the members and beneficiaries of the plan for the exclusive purpose of
providing benefits to the members and their beneficiaries and to defray the
reasonable expenses of the plan. The trustees shall exercise those fiduciary
responsibilities with the care, skill, prudence and diligence under the
circumstances then prevailing that a prudent person acting in a like capacity
and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a
similar character and with similar aims.

board in the performance of its duties. The board may act without independent
investigation upon the professional advice of the advisors retained by the
plan.



   (m)   The board is authorized to prosecute or defend actions, claims
or proceedings of any nature or kind for the protection of the fund assets or
for the protection of the board in the performance of its duties.

individually and the board as a whole shall be entitled to the protections in
Section 768.28, Fla. Stat. The trustees shall also be authorized to purchase
from the assets of the fund, errors and omission insurance to protect the
trustees in the performance of their duties. Such insurance shall not provide

   (c)   Expenses, charges and fees attributable to the management of
the plan shall be paid from the fund.



   (d)   The city shall have no right, title or interest in the fund or

plan.

the advice and counsel of such advisors as the board deems necessary, and
said investment policy shall set forth the types of securities and other
types of investments into which shall be placed the assets of the fund. The

ARTICLE VII SERVICE RETIREMENT BENEFITS



   (a)   A general employee member may retire on the first day of the
month coincident with or next following the attainment of age fifty-five (55)
and the completion of six (6) years of credited service. There shall be no
mandatory retirement age. (Ord. No. 00-9-5, §1, 9-27-00; Ord. No.
2002-10-02, § 1, 10-22-02)



   (b)   A normal retirement benefit for general employees shall be:



      (1)   an amount equal to two (2%) percent of final monthly
compensation multiplied by the number of years of credited service; provided,
however, that the computation of retirement benefits for service accrued
prior to September 30, 1981, shall be one (1%) percent, and that the
computation of retirement benefits for service accrued from October 1, 1981,
through September 30, 1993, shall be one and three-quarters (1-3/4%);



      (2)   Effective October4, 2004, the normal retirement benefit
shall be an amount equal to two and one quarter (2.25%) percent of final
monthly compensation multiplied by the number of years of credited service
for all general employees on the city payroll on October4, 2004. The 2.25%
multiplier which shall take effect on October4, 2004 shall not apply to
Broward Sheriff's Office employees who were transferred as a result of the
merger of services with the Broward Sheriff's Office unless the employee
elects to purchase the higher multiplier as permitted by Section 15.06; or
(Ord. No. 2004-08-03, §4, 08-24-04; Ord. No. 07-12-1, §2, 12-11-07)



      (3)   Effective October 1, 2007, the normal retirement benefit
shall be an amount equal to two and one-half percent (2.5%) of final monthly
compensation multiplied by the number of years of credited service for all
general employees on the city payroll on October1, 2007. (Ord. No. 07-12-1,
§2, 12-11-07)



   In addition to the other benefits provided in this section, members
shall, upon commencing a service retirement, receive a supplemental benefit,
to be paid on a monthly basis, equal to $20.00 multiplied by the number of
years of credited service. In the event that an employee has a fractional
year of service, the benefit attributable to that year shall be calculated on
a pro rata basis. Notwithstanding any other provision of this plan, and in
addition to the contributions otherwise provided for in this plan, members
shall contribute an additional sum equal to one-half of the actuarial cost of
this benefit. The actual rate of contribution shall be determined by the
Board, on an annual basis, in consultation with its actuary. Employee
contributions for this supplemental benefit shall be picked up in the same
manner as any other employee contribution. (Ord. No. 03-7-1, § 2, 7-22-03)



   (c)   A service retirement benefit shall be payable on the first day
of each month. The benefit shall commence on the first day of the month
coincident with or next following the member's actual retirement and shall
continue until the death of the member.



   (d)   A member entitled to a normal service retirement benefit shall
have the right at any time prior to the date upon which the first payment is
received to elect to have the benefit payable under one of the options
provided in this plan. A member shall be permitted to revoke any such
election and to elect a new option at any time prior to the receipt of the
first payment. Each retirement option shall be the actuarial equivalent of
the other retirement options available. Election of the retirement option
shall be on a form prescribed by the board.



(Ord. No. 2002-10-02, § 1, 10-22-02)



      (1)   Joint and Last Survivor Option with Actuarial Equivalent
Pop-up. (Ord. No. 10-4-3, § 2, 4-27-10)



   A member may elect to receive a benefit for life and to have the
benefit (or a designated fraction of the benefit) continued after the
member's death and during the lifetime of a designated survivor. A designated
survivor may be any natural person, but need not be the spouse of the member.



         a.   In the event that the designated survivor dies
before the member's benefit payments begin, this option shall be canceled
automatically and a retirement income shall be payable to the member as if
the election had never been made.



         b.   In the event that the designated survivor
pre-deceases the member, after the member's benefit payments have commenced,
then the member's benefit shall revert to the actuarial equivalent life
annuity, normal form of retirement benefit, as of the date of death of the
designated survivor. By electing this option, the member consents to the
actuarial adjustment of the member's retirement benefits sufficient to cover
the cost of this option. This subsection (b) shall only apply prospectively
for joint and last survivor elections made after May 11, 2010. (Ord. No.
10-4-3, § 2, 4-27-10)



      (2)   Ten (10) Year Certain and Life Thereafter.



   A member may elect to receive a reduced life annuity with one hundred
twenty (120) guaranteed payments. If the member shall die prior to receiving
one hundred twenty (120) payments, the remaining benefits shall be paid to
the beneficiary designated by the member. In the event that no beneficiary
has been designated, the member's estate shall be the recipient of the
remaining balance of payments.



      (3)   Other Options.



   The trustees may authorize the payment of the retirement benefit in any
form which is the actuarial equivalent of the other forms of retirement
provided in this plan.



   (e)   Early retirement shall be available to a general employee
member on the first day of the month coincident with or next following the
attainment of age fifty-three (53) and the completion of ten (10) years of
credited service. Effective October4, 2004, early retirement shall be
available to a general employee member on the first day of the month
coincident with or next following the attainment of age fifty-three (53) and
the completion of ten (10) years of credited service.



(Ord. No. 2004-08-03, §5, 08-24-04)



   (f)   A member electing early retirement may receive either a
deferred payment or an immediate payment under the following formula:



      (1)   An immediate retirement benefit may commence on the
first day of the month coincident with or next following the date of early
retirement. The benefit shall be determined for normal retirement and then
actuarially reduced for the number of actual years and months at which the
starting date of the benefit precedes the normal retirement date. The early
retirement reduction is five-tenths of one (0.5%) percent for each month at
which the early retirement date precedes the normal retirement date.
Effective October 4, 2004, the early retirement reduction shall be four
percent (4%) per year, or three hundred and thirty-three one hundreds of one
percent (0.333%) for each month at which the early retirement date precedes
the normal retirement date. (Ord. No. 2004-08-03, §5, 08-24-04)



ARTICLE VIII BUY-BACK FOR MILITARY SERVICE



   (a)   Any member of the plan who is employed by the city prior to
entry into military service and who takes a leave of absence for the purpose
of entering into military service in the Armed Forces of the United States
and thereafter re-enters the employ of the city, shall be entitled to
purchase service credits for the period of absence by contributing the amount
that would have been contributed by the member as if the member continued in
city employment for the period of military service based on the salary in
effect on the date of the leave of absence, for each year being purchased.



   (b)   A member who is receiving, or will receive the pension benefit
for military service in any other pension plan supported by public funds, may
not use that service for this pension plan. A member who is receiving, or
will receive any other pension in which time served in the military was used
by the employee in that other pension plan shall not be eligible for military
buy-back as provided in this section.



   (c)   The contribution for military buy-back required of the
employee may be made in one lump sum or may be made by payroll deductions in
installments for a period of time which shall not exceed the number of years
being purchased. An employee making installment payments shall complete all
required payments prior to payment of any benefit under this section. If
installment payments are not completed at the time an employee retires, the
employee shall not receive military credit for the remaining period for which
payments were not made. An employee making installment payments shall pay a
uniform rate of interest as determined by the board.



ARTICLE IX DISABILITY



   (a)   A member shall be disabled under the terms of the plan if the
member has suffered an illness, injury or disease which renders the member
permanently and totally incapacitated, physically or mentally, from regular
and continuous duty as an employee of the city. Disability shall not be
determined based solely on the fact that a member cannot perform all of the
duties of his or her job grouping as set forth in the job description. The
City shall be required to accommodate disabled workers in accordance with
state and federal law and shall not withhold assignment to vacant positions
on the basis that a member is not capable of performing all of the tasks of
his or her job grouping. A disability benefit cannot be based on a condition
which pre-existed membership in the plan unless the course of the disability
would reasonably be expected to give rise to a disability in a person without
the pre-existing condition.



   (b)   A member shall be eligible for a service-incurred disability
retirement from the entry date into the plan. A service-incurred disability
retirement shall mean that the disability arose as a result of an act
occurring in the performance of service with the city.



   (c)   A member shall be eligible for a non-service incurred
disability retirement upon the completion of ten (10) years of credited
service. A non-service incurred disability shall be an illness, injury, or
disease, which did not occur as a result of an act in the performance of
service with the city.



   (d)   The service-incurred disability benefit of a general employee
shall be based upon the member's accrued benefit to date.



   (e)   The non-service incurred disability benefit shall be paid on
the same basis as normal retirement in an amount equal to the member's
accrued benefit to date of disability. For the purposes of a non-service
incurred disability benefit, final monthly compensation shall be determined
as of the last day the member was actively at work for the city.



   (f)   Disability benefits shall be paid on the first day of each
month. No benefit shall be paid until the board of trustees has actually
considered and voted upon entitlement to disability.



   (g)   Disability retirement income shall continue until the death of
the member, or recovery from disability. An employee on disability retirement
may, upon reaching normal retirement age, elect to convert the disability
retirement to a service retirement. In the case of such an election, the
member may receive credited service for the years during which the member was
disabled by contributing to the retirement plan the monies the employee would
have contributed had the employee remained continuously in service. In the
case of such an election, average compensation shall be based upon salary
being paid to member at the time of disability. In the event of the death of
a member who is retired on a disability benefit, and has not received
payments equal to the value of the member's accumulated contributions, the
remaining unpaid benefits shall be paid to a designated beneficiary selected
by the member and communicated to the board on the form prescribed by the
board. In the event that there is no designated beneficiary, the remaining
unpaid benefits shall be paid to the estate of the deceased member. During
the period of disability, member contributions shall be suspended unless the
member is receiving a pay supplement in addition to disability benefits
provided under the Florida Workers' Compensation Act. In such event, there
shall be a member contribution from that amount representing the supplemental
pay. In the event a member's disability is converted to a service retirement
as set forth in this section, the member shall be accorded credited service
for the period of disability.



   (h)   The board of trustees shall have the continuing right to
require disabled members to submit to a medical examination to determine that
the member remains disabled. In order for a member to be deemed recovered,
the medical committee must recommend to the board of trustees that the member
has sufficiently recovered to again engage in the duties of a general
employee, depending on the member's classification, and that the city has
certified that it has a position within the city available for the member
consistent with the member's medical condition.



   (i)   Upon finding that a member is no longer disabled, the member
shall return to work for the city at the same rank and position previously
occupied and shall be placed into the appropriate step in the pay plan which
the member would have occupied but for the disability. The member shall again
become an active member of the plan but shall receive no credited service for
any period of time in which the member was receiving disability benefits. If
the member declines re-employment within the city, the member shall be deemed
to have terminated employment on the date that the disability benefit
commenced.



   (j)   No member shall be eligible to receive disability benefits
from the retirement plan during any period of time that the member is
receiving a salary from the city. This section shall not apply to the receipt
of worker's compensation benefits.



   (k)   Any former member who is in receipt of service connected
disability benefits shall have those benefits subject to offset as provided
in this section. There shall be a deduction made from the monthly retirement
payment of fifty (50%) percent of compensation from non-city employment,
provided that there shall be no offset until the outside earnings are greater
than two hundred percent (200%)of the difference between the gross monthly
salary of the disabled person last paid by the city as of the time of the
disability retirement and the disability benefit, and provided further, that
the disability pension benefit shall never be reduced below twenty-five (25%)
percent of the original benefit or that which may be provided through normal
retirement. Former members in receipt of a service connected disability shall
be obligated, on an annual basis, to provide proof of income in such form as
required by the board of Trustees, including, but not limited to, copies of
federal income tax returns, in order to remain eligible for continued
benefits under this plan. Failure to provide the requested information shall
constitute consent to the suspension of benefits from this plan, provided
written notice has been given to the former member of the suspension of
benefits at least thirty (30) days prior to the suspension.



   (l)   Application for disability retirement shall be made on a form
prescribed by the board of trustees. The member shall execute such medical
releases as are necessary to permit the board of trustees to review the
medical records needed to determine the question of disability and to discuss
said records at a public meeting. Upon receipt of an application for
disability, the board shall appoint a medical committee to be composed of not
less than one nor more than three licensed physicians. The applicant for
disability shall be required to submit to examination by the medical
committee. The medical committee shall report its findings to the board of
the trustees which shall include a determination, to the extent reasonably
possible, the origin of the disability, whether the disability is permanent,
and whether the disability is total. In making that determination, the
medical committee shall be bound by the definition of disability set forth in
this plan.



   (m)   Upon receipt of the report of the medical committee, the
trustees shall schedule a public hearing at which time the board shall review
all reports of the medical committee, together with any such documentary
evidence as the applicant may wish to submit. The board shall conduct a
preliminary determination as to whether the member is permanently and totally
disabled based upon the written documentation presented. If the board does
not grant the application based on the written documentation, it shall inform
the member in writing of the reasons for the denial of the application. The
member may, within thirty (30) days of receipt of the board's preliminary
denial, request a full evidentiary hearing before the board. Said hearing
will be conducted consistent with the principles of due process and the rules
of evidence generally applicable to administrative proceedings shall apply.
The board shall have the power to issue subpoenas compelling the attendance
of witnesses. At said hearing the applicant may present such oral and written
evidence as the applicant deems necessary to establish his or her burden of
proof. The board may appoint special counsel as an advocate to cross-examine
witnesses and to offer argument in opposition to the application. The
attorney for the board shall not serve both as advocate and as advisor to the
board in the same proceeding. The applicant and the board shall have the
right to examine and cross-examine all witnesses. The decision of the board
shall be based solely upon the evidence presented and the law applicable to
this plan. Following the conclusion of the hearing, the board shall render an
opinion in writing setting forth the reasons for the grant or denial of the
benefit. In the event that the disability benefit is denied, the applicant
shall have the right to judicial review by complaint for common law
certiorari in the Circuit Court of Broward County.



   (n)   The board of trustees may prescribe rules of procedure to
implement the provisions of this plan relating to the conduct of disability
hearings.



   (o)   No member shall be granted a disability pension upon a
determination by the Board that the disability resulted



from:



      (1)   Excessive and habitual use of drugs, intoxicants or
narcotics;



      (2)   Injury or disease sustained while willfully and
illegally participating in fights, riots, civil insurrections or while
committing a crime;



      (3)   Intentionally self-inflicted wounds, injuries or
ailments;



      (4)   Any occurrence arising from compensable employment
unrelated to regular city employment, and such employment having been
undertaken without prior permission of the appropriate department head having
been granted to such member in writing.



      (5)   A pre-existing condition, which condition was revealed
by a medical examination conducted upon entry into the retirement plan.



   (p)   The term city, for purposes of this Article, shall be
interpreted to include the Broward Sheriff's Office for former city employees
who were transferred to full time positions within the Broward Sheriff's
Office following the transfer of public safety services to the Broward
Sheriff's Office. (Ord. No. 2004-08-03, §6, 08-24-04)



ARTICLE X VESTING AND TERMINATION



   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, all rights to
benefits under this plan shall terminate when a member's employment
terminates for any reason other than normal service retirement, or disability
retirement. Any member who completes six (6) years of credited service and
whose contributions remain in the plan has a vested right to accrued benefits
from the plan. No member who has completed less than six (6) years of
credited service shall have a vested interest in any accrued benefit.



   (b)   A member who shall leave the service of the city prior to the
completion of six (6) years of service shall receive a refund of accumulated
contributions, with interest thereon. The return of such contributions shall
operate as a release and discharge of the City of Cooper City and the
retirement plan from the right to any other benefits from the plan.



   (c)   A member who shall leave the service of the city prior to
eligibility for normal service retirement, but who has completed six (6)
years of credited service shall be entitled to receive retirement benefits
commencing at the regular normal service retirement date. Such benefits will
be based on final monthly compensation and credited service as of the date of
termination.



   (d)   Every member shall have the right to elect to receive, in lieu
of all benefits under the plan, a return of the member's accumulated
contributions, with interest.



   (e)   A member who elects a lump sum return of contributions
releases and discharges the City of Cooper City and the retirement plan from
the right to any other benefits from the plan.



(Ord. No. 2002-10-02, § 1, 10-22-02)



   (f)   Service for vesting purposes shall include employment with the
Broward Sheriff's Office for former city employees who were transferred to
full time positions within the Broward Sheriff's Office following the
transfer of public safety services to the Broward Sheriff's Office.



(Ord. No. 2004-08-03, §7, 08-24-04)



ARTICLE XI DEATH BENEFITS



   (a)   In the event of the death of a member prior to the time of
becoming fully vested for early or normal retirement, the member's designated
beneficiary shall be paid from the fund an amount equal to the member's
accumulated contributions together with interest thereon. In the event that
the member was fully vested for early or normal retirement, but died before
actual retirement, a death benefit shall be paid from the fund to the
beneficiary. The amount of the benefit shall be computed as though the member
had retired on the date of death and had chosen the one hundred (100%)
percent joint and survivor option. The board may, in its discretion, pay the
benefit in another form if the board deems it to be in the best interest of
the beneficiary. The actuarial value of any other form of benefit may not
exceed the actuarial value of the one hundred (100%) percent joint and last
survivor option.



   (b)   In the event of the death of a retiree, death benefits, if
any, shall be paid in accordance with the optional form of benefit chosen at
the time of retirement



   (c)   In the event that a designated beneficiary predeceases the
member, or in the case of dissolution of marriage where the spouse is the
designated beneficiary, the member may designate a new beneficiary as set
forth in this subsection. No replacement beneficiary may receive a benefit
which is greater than the actuarial equivalent of the benefit which would
have been paid to the person named as designated beneficiary at the time of
retirement. In the case of re-marriage, the spouse must have been married to
the member for at least one (1) year prior to the death of member to qualify
for benefits under this subsection.



ARTICLE XII COMPLIANCE WITH THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE



   (a)   It is the intention of the city and of the board that the plan
remain at all times a qualified plan, as that term is defined under the
Internal Revenue Code.



   (b)   No member's annual benefit may exceed the maximum benefit
allowed pursuant to section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code.



   (c)   In no event may a member's retirement benefit be delayed
beyond the later of April 1st following the calendar year in which the member
attains age seventy and one-half (70-1/2), or April 1st of the year following
the calendar year in which the member retires.



   When a distribution of the participant's entire interest is not made in
a lump sum, the distribution will be made in one or more of the following
ways: over the life of the participant; over the life of the participant and
designated beneficiary; over a period certain not extending beyond the life
expectancy of the participant; or over a period certain not extending beyond
the joint life and last survivor expectancy of the participant and a
designated beneficiary.



   (d)   If the distribution has commenced before the participant's
death, the remaining interest will be distributed at least as rapidly as
under the method of distribution being used as of the date of the
participant's death.



   The method of distribution, if the participant dies before distribution
is commenced, must satisfy the following requirements:



      (1)   Any remaining portion of the participant's interest that
is not payable to a beneficiary designated by the participant will be
distributed within five (5) years after the participant's death;



      (2)   Any portion of the participant's interest that is
payable to a beneficiary designated by the participant will be distributed
either: (i) within five (5) years after the participant's death; or (ii) over
the life of the beneficiary, or over a period certain not extending beyond
the life expectancy of the beneficiary, commencing not later than the end of
the calendar year following the calendar year in which the participant died
(or, if a designated beneficiary is the participant's surviving spouse,
commencing not later than the end of the calendar year following the calendar
year in which the participant would have attained age seventy and one-half
(70-1/2)).



   (e)   Notwithstanding any provision of this pension plan to the
contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this
section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by
the board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution made
directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a
direct rollover. For this purpose, an eligible rollover distribution is any
distribution made on or after December 1, 1994, of all or any portion of the
balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover
distribution does not include: any periodic payments (not less frequently
than annually) made for life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the
joint lives (or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and designated
beneficiary or for a specified period of ten (10) years or more; any
distribution to the extent such distribution is required under section
401(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code; and the portion of any distribution
that is not includable in gross income. An eligible retirement plan is an
individual retirement account described in section 408(b) of the Internal
Revenue Code, and an individual retirement annuity described in section
408(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, or a qualified trust described in
section 401(a) of the Internal Revenue Code, that accepts the distributee's
eligible rollover distribution. In the case of a rollover distribution to a
surviving spouse, an eligible retirement plan is only an individual
retirement account or individual annuity. A distributee includes a member or
former member. A distributee with regard to the interest of a spouse or
former spouse refers to a distributee's surviving spouse or a former spouse
who has an interest in the distribution of benefits under the fund as the
result of a domestic relations order. A direct rollover is payment by the
plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee.



ARTICLE XIII AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION OF THE SYSTEM



   (a)   It is the intention of the city and the board that this
pension plan shall constitute an irrevocable trust and no portion of the
assets may revert to the employer until all other obligations of the plan,
including the payment to the last surviving member and beneficiary has been
paid.



   (b)   In the event of termination or partial termination of the
plan, each participant's accrued pension benefit shall become nonforfeitable
(100 percent vested) to the extent funded.



   (c)   In the event that the plan is terminated, the assets of the
plan shall first be distributed to retired members and their beneficiaries.
If there is any asset value remaining after the apportionment to retired
members and their beneficiaries, apportionment shall next be made to each
member in the service who has completed at least ten (10) years of credited
service and has contributed to the fund for at least ten (10) years and who
is not otherwise eligible to retire. If there is any asset value after the
apportionments to retirees and their beneficiaries and to vested members of
the plan, apportionment shall lastly be made in respect of each member in the
service of the city in an amount not to exceed the total value of the
member's contributions.



ARTICLE XIV DISTRIBUTION OF MARITAL INTERESTS IN THE PLAN



   (a)   In the event that the board is served with a domestic
relations order or other legal process purporting to require the payment of
any portion of a member's benefit to another person as a result of a
dissolution of marriage, the board shall cause such order to be reviewed to
determine compliance with the provisions of the plan.



   (b)   The board of trustees shall be authorized to intervene in any
such dissolution of marriage proceeding to ensure that such domestic
relations order is otherwise consistent with the distribution of an interest
in a public employees retirement plan under state law.



   (c)   Any cost associated with the modification or correction of
such domestic relations orders shall be the responsibility of the plan member.



ARTICLE XV MISCELLANEOUS



   (a)   The present or future right of a person to money in the
pension fund or to a retirement allowance, an optional allowance, a death
benefit, the return of contributions, or any other right accrued or accruing
under the provisions of this plan shall not be assignable and shall not be
subject to execution, garnishment, attachment, the operation of bankruptcy or
insolvency law or any other process of law whatsoever, except with respect to
alimony, child support or medical payments to a former spouse.



   (b)   The board shall have the power to examine into the facts upon
which any pension has been granted under any prior or existing law or which
may be granted in the future or obtained erroneously, fraudulently, or
illegally for any reason. The board is empowered to purge the pension rolls
of any person who has been granted a pension under a prior or existing law,
or who is hereafter granted a benefit under this ordinance if the granting of
that pension is found to be erroneous, fraudulent, or illegal for any reason;
and to reclassify any pensioner who has under any prior or existing law or
who may under this ordinance be erroneously, improperly or illegally
classified.



   (c)   Should any change or error in retirement system records be
discovered or result in any member or beneficiary receiving from the
retirement plan more or less than he or she would have been entitled to
receive had the records been correct, the board shall have the power to
correct such error and, as far as possible, adjust the payments in such a
manner that the actuarial equivalent of a benefit to which such member or
beneficiary was correctly entitled shall be paid.



   (d)   If any member or beneficiary is a minor or is under any other
legal disability, the board of trustees shall have the power to withhold
payment of benefits until the board is presented with proof satisfactory to
the board of the appointment of a guardian. If the board becomes aware that
any member or beneficiary is incapable of personally receiving and giving a
valid receipt for any payment due under the plan, the board shall cause
notice to be given to that participant or beneficiary of a hearing to
determine whether said benefits should continue to be paid until the
appointment of a guardian. During the pendency of any such hearing, however,
the board may continue to pay benefits to the member or beneficiary and that
such payment shall be a complete discharge of any liability under the plan
for such payment.



   (e)   Members entitled to a pension shall not forfeit same upon
dismissal from the city, but shall be retired as herein described.



   (f)   For one calendar year following the adoption of this
ordinance, former city employees who were transferred to full time positions
within the Broward Sheriff's Office following the transfer of public safety
services shall be permitted to purchase the new 2.25% multiplier as set forth
in Section 7.02. If purchased, the 2.25% multiplier shall apply to all years
of prior service with the city and to all future service with the Broward
Sheriff's Office.



   Transferred employees electing to purchase the 2.25% multiplier shall
execute all forms required by the Board of Trustees. Benefits shall not be
calculated under the 2.25% multiplier unless the transferred employee has
paid to the Pension Fund the full actuarial cost, as determined by the
actuary for the Plan.



   The contribution by the transferred employee of the actuarially
determined cost of the buyback may be made



by lump sum cash payment or by payroll deductions by the Broward Sheriff's
Office in installments for a period of time which shall not exceed three (3)
years. A transferred employee electing to make installment payments shall be
charged interest based on the actuarially assumed rate of return for the
Plan. A transferred employee making installment payments shall complete all
required payments prior to payment of any benefit under this section. A
member who terminates service prior to vesting in the Plan shall be entitled
to a refund of all money paid to purchase the higher multiplier. (Ord. No.
2004-08-03, §8, 08-24-04)



ARTICLE XVI DEFERRED RETIREMENT OPTION PLAN



   (a)   Any active general employee may participate in the DROP
pursuant to the requirements of this section. All applications for DROP shall
be in writing on the form promulgated by the board. Beginning with the first
pay period after June 1, 2014, any member who is eligible for normal
retirement, as set forth in subsection (a) of Article VII "Service Retirement
Benefits," may elect to participate in the DROP in accordance with this
section. A member who elects to participate in the DROP may participate in
the DROP for a maximum of five (5) years from the date that he/she enters the
DROP. (Ord. No. 14-2-3, §2, 2-25-14)



   Any member who is participating in the DROP as of June 1, 2014, shall
be eligible to participate in the DROP for a continuous period of up to 5
years from the date the member's participation in the DROP began. Members who
are participating in the DROP as of June 1, 2014, who wish to extend their
DROP for a total of up to 5 years from the date that their participation in
the DROP began must notify the board of trustees in writing by July 15, 2014.
Failure to timely notify the board of trustees will result in such members
not being allowed to extend their DROP for a total of up to 5 years from the
date that their participation in the DROP began. (Ord. No. 14-2-3, §2,
2-25-14)



   (b)   A member electing DROP participation shall execute such forms
as the board of trustees shall require. The DROP election shall be effective
on the first day of the month following the date of election. Applications
must be filed with the board (with a copy to the city) not less than five (5)
business days prior to the effective date.



   (c)   DROP election shall be irrevocable at the time the member
executes the applicable forms. Also, members may participate in DROP only
once. After DROP participation commences, a member may not rejoin the
retirement system as an active member nor shall the member be eligible to
receive disability or pre-retirement death benefits from the system.



   (d)   Upon DROP commencement, both the city and member contributions
to the system for the normal cost of benefits shall cease.



   (e)   For all retirement system purposes, the average monthly
earnings and continuous service of a member participating in DROP shall
remain as they existed on the date of commencement of participation in the
DROP. Service, earnings, or increases in earnings thereafter shall not be
recognized by the Retirement System or be used for the calculation or
determination of any benefits payable by the retirement system.



   Upon commencement of DROP participation, the member will continue to
accrue or be paid for sick leave, holiday leave and annual leave in
accordance with the terms of the applicable collective bargaining agreement
and/or city rules and regulations, as applicable.



   (f)   Payments shall be made monthly by the retirement system to a
member's DROP account in the amount which would be paid had the member
separated from the city and commenced normal retirement.



   (g)   Member accounts shall be credited or debited, as appropriate,
with the investment earned/lost at a rate equal to the fund's actual
investment return, net of investment and administrative expenses. Accounts
may be credited monthly or quarterly at the discretion of the board of
trustees. Investment earnings/losses will be posted up to the last date of
the members' DROP period. DROP participants by virtue of their participation
authorize the retirement board to invest their DROP assets in the same manner
as other assets of the pension fund.



   Alternatively, DROP participants may elect to self-direct their DROP
account using mutual funds offered by the Board of Trustees. DROP
participants shall be offered a range of mutual funds to permit
diversification among different asset classes. The Board of Trustees shall be
responsible for the selection and monitoring of mutual funds offered under
the self-directed DROP program. DROP participants shall be responsible for
all individual investment decisions and the allocation of DROP funds under
the self-directed program. DROP participants shall be required to acknowledge
that they have been advised to consult with a financial planner, accountant
or other investment professional in selecting self-directed investments which
are consistent with their financial needs and risk tolerance. Participants
shall also be required to acknowledge that they have been advised to monitor
the performance of their self-directed DROP account as they would their
personal investment portfolio.



(Ord. No. 03-5-1, §1, 5-13-03)



   By participation in the DROP, DROP participants agree to hold the board
of trustees, the retirement fund and the City of Cooper City harmless from
any liability claims associated with investment losses which may occur in the
ordinary course of the investment of assets of the retirement system.



   The city and the board of trustees may seek a favorable determination
letter from the IRS concerning the retirement plan, including all provisions
of the DROP. In the event that the IRS should hold that this section does not
meet the "definitely determinable benefit" rule, participant accounts will be
credited at a fixed rate based upon the actuarially assumed rate of return as
determined by the board of trustees during the period of DROP participation.
No member shall receive a DROP payment until actually separated from the city.



   (h)   To compensate the system for the costs and expenses of
administering the DROP, each member's DROP account shall be charged an
administrative fee of one-half (1/2) of one percent (1%), which will be
deducted from the member's DROP account. The administrative fee may be
adjusted on a uniform basis from time to time by the board of trustees.



   (i)   Upon termination of employment for any reason, DROP
participation shall cease and any future retirement
benefits shall be paid directly to the member, or in the case of death, to
the designated beneficiary.



   Payment shall be made from the DROP account no more than ninety (90)
days after separation from the city. The form of payment may be altered upon
written notice to the board to take effect not more than ninety (90) days
from the date of notice. Payment shall be made:



      (1)   in a single lump sum;



      (2)   in annual installments;



      (3)   in equal monthly installments;



      (4)   any combination of lump sum and periodic payments; or



      (5)   by rollover to another qualified retirement plan.



   The board of trustees may accelerate or alter any payment schedule as
may be required to comply with the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code
Section 401(a)(9) and 415.



   No DROP payment may be made in a manner inconsistent with state or
federal law.



   DROP balances shall continue to be credited or debited with earnings
until fully paid to the member.



   (j)   Should a member die during DROP participation, or before the
account balance is paid in full, the member's designated beneficiary shall
have the same rights as the member to elect and receive the payout options
set forth above.



   (k)   All benefits payable under this DROP program shall be paid
solely from DROP assets. Neither the city nor the board of trustees shall
have any liability or duty to pay the member or to furnish the DROP with any
funds, securities or assets except to the extent required by applicable law.



   (l)   In the event an employee sustains an on-the-job injury during
DROP participation (or before said participation, but where the employee is
still experiencing the effects of said injury when he/she elects DROP
participation) and misses time from work, the employee will be subject to
applicable provisions of the city's rules and regulations, provided that no
such provisions of the rules and regulations conflicts with the requirements
of this DROP plan ordinance. The fact that the employee is a DROP participant
will not prevent the city from separating the employee from employment or
from offering the employee work outside of the employee's normal position.
Participation in the DROP is not a guarantee of continued employment.



   DROP participants shall not be eligible to apply for nor receive
disability retirement. Upon separation all DROP participants will receive
normal retirement benefits only.



   (m)   The provisions of the city's manual of personnel policies will
be generally applicable to DROP participants. However, once an employee
elects to participate in the DROP, the employee will no longer be eligible
for promotion, nor will they be eligible to receive pay for educational
reimbursement (other than the cost of training and education necessary to
maintain certification).



   (n)   Once a member reaches the end of their participation in the
DROP, they shall be automatically separated from employment with the city.



   (o)   The deferred retirement option plan will be implemented
subject to the state and federal laws. (Ord. No. 2000-1-11, § 2, 1-25-2000)



   (p)   The term city, for purposes of this Article, shall be
interpreted to include the Broward Sheriff's Office for former city employees
who were transferred to full time positions within the Broward Sheriff's
Office following the transfer of public safety services to the Broward
Sheriff's Office. (Ord. No. 2004-08-03, §9, 08-24-04)



ARTICLE XVII FLORIDA RETIREMENT SYSTEM (FRS)



   (a)   All general employees hired on or after the effective date of
the City's participation in the Florida Retirement System, except those
excluded by law, shall be ineligible for membership in the plan and shall
become compulsory members of the Florida Retirement System.



   (b)   Any member of the plan employed by the City on the effective
date of the City's participation in the Florida Retirement System shall have
the option to elect in writing to either remain in the plan or to join the
Florida Retirement System. Further, any member of the plan electing to join
the Florida Retirement System shall designate one of the following choices on
the election notices provided by FRS.



      1.   The member's contributions shall remain in the plan and
the member will retain any vested membership credit in the plan. The member
will be ineligible to purchase past service credit in the Florida Retirement
System to the extent that the employee retains vested membership credit in

(2) Broward County deputy sheriffs who are active members of the plan or in
DROP elected by a majority of the Broward County deputy sheriffs who are

member of the board shall be chosen by a majority of the other four (4)
members of the board and approved as a ministerial act by the City

sheriff member of the plan who is elected by active and retired members of
the plan. If there are no active or retired participants remaining in the
plan or capable of serving as a trustee, the remaining trustees may elect any

County deputy sheriff member seat. Upon receipt of such person's name, the
City Commission shall, as a ministerial duty, appoint such person to the

travel expenditures. (Ord. No. 02-10-01, §1, 10-8-02)



   (f)   The board of trustees shall bi-annually select a chairman and

the plan and shall discharge its responsibilities solely in the interest of

February 14, 2004, the city or the Broward Sheriff's Office shall pick up
from each member's pay eight and thirteen one hundredths (8.13%) of earnings,
which shall be deposited into the Fund each pay period. (Ord. No. 02-10-01,

   (b)   All benefits payable under this plan are in lieu of a refund
of accumulated contributions. In any event, however, each member or
designated beneficiary shall be guaranteed the payment of benefits at least
equal in total amount to the member's accumulated contributions.



   (c)   Any monies received or receivable by reason of the laws of the

No. 02-10-01, § 1, 10-8-02)



   (d)   The city shall make such required quarterly contributions
under the Florida Protection of Public Employee Retirement Benefits Act and
chapter185, Florida Statutes, which together with contributions picked-up on
behalf of members, plan earnings and state insurance premium tax rebates,
will maintain the fund on a sound actuarial basis, as determined by the board
in conjunction with its actuary. The city and the membership, as represented
by the FOP, have agreed that all additional premium tax revenues (after the
final "minimum" benefit of ten years certain and life



has been fully funded by such premium tax revenues or by the city, if it
elects to fund any part of this "minimum" benefit) will be used to pay for
reducing Final Average Compensation from five years to three years
(hereinafter "the extra benefit"). The city shall fund the remainder of the
costs of these benefits, provided however, it may reduce its contribution as
Chapter money increases up to the full cost of the benefits. (Ord. No.

ARTICLE VII SERVICE RETIREMENT BENEFITS



   (a)   Police officers may retire on the first day of the month
coincident with or next following the attainment of age fifty (50) and the
completion of ten (10) years of credited service. There shall be no mandatory
retirement age. Effective February 14, 2004, the normal retirement age shall
be the earlier of the attainment of age fifty (50) and the completion of ten
(10) years of credited service, or upon the completion of twenty-five (25)
years of credited service; provided, however, that if a member separates from
service with more than ten (10) years of credited service but less than
twenty-five (25) years of credited service, retirement benefits shall not
commence until the first day of the month following the separated member's
attainment of age fifty (50). (Ord. 2002-05-03, § 1, 5-28-02; Ord.
2002-10-01, § 1, 10-8-02; Ord. 2004-08-01, § 3, 08-24-04 )



   (b)   For police officers the monthly retirement benefit shall be an
amount equal to three (3%) percent of final monthly compensation multiplied
by the number of years of credited service. In the event a member has
combined service as a general employee and police officer, the benefit shall
be determined using the appropriate multiplier for each completed year and
month in the applicable class of employment and the respective funds shall
coordinate benefits, provided the police officer attains a vested interest in
this plan.



   (c)   A service retirement benefit shall be payable on the first day
of each month. The benefit shall commence on the first day of the month
coincident with or next following the member's actual retirement and shall
continue until the death of the member.



   (d)   Early retirement shall be available to police officer members
on the first day of the month coincident with or next following the
attainment of age fifty (50) and the completion of ten (10) years of
continuous credited service.



   (e)   A member electing early retirement may receive either a
deferred payment or an immediate payment under the following formula:



      (1)   A deferred payment shall be equal to the normal
retirement benefit. This shall mean the date upon which the member attains
normal retirement age with ten (10) years of continuous credited service.



      (2)   An immediate retirement benefit may commence on the
first day of the month coincident with or next following the date of early
retirement. The benefit shall be determined for normal retirement and then
actuarially reduced for the number of actual years and months at which the
starting date of the benefit precedes the normal retirement date. The early
retirement reduction is twenty-five hundredths of one (0.25%) percent for
each month at which the early retirement date precedes the normal retirement
date.



   (f)   The payment of the early retirement income shall be subject to
the same conditions as normal retirement income.

formula in effect on the early retirement date shall be applicable to the
member.



   (h)   A member entitled to a normal or early service retirement
benefit shall have the right at any time prior to the date upon which the
first payment is received to elect to have the benefit payable under one of
the options provided in this plan. A member shall be permitted to revoke any
such election and to elect a new option at any time prior to the receipt of
the first payment. Each retirement option shall be the actuarial equivalent
of the normal retirement form which is ten years certain and life thereafter.
Election of the retirement option shall be on a form prescribed by the board.
(Ord. No. 04-08-01, §3, 08-24-04)



      (1)   Ten (10) year certain and life thereafter.



         A member may elect to receive a life annuity with one
hundred twenty (120) guaranteed payments. If the member shall die prior to
receiving one hundred twenty (120) payments, the remaining benefits shall be
paid to the beneficiary designated by the member. In the event that no
beneficiary has been designated, the member's estate shall be the recipient
of the remaining balance of payments. This shall be the normal form of
retirement. (Ord. No. 04-08-01, §3, 08-24-04)



      (2)   Joint and last survivor option.



         A member may elect to receive a reduced benefit for life
and to have the benefit continued after the member's death and during the
lifetime of a designated survivor. Joint and last survivor annuities shall be
available in the amount of one hundred (100) percent, seventy-five (75)
percent, sixty-six and two-thirds (66 2/3) percent, or fifty (50) percent
options. A designated survivor may be any natural person, but need not be the
spouse of the member. In the event that the designated survivor dies before
the member's benefit payments begin, this option shall be canceled
automatically and a retirement income shall be payable to the member as if
the election had never been made. In the event that the designated survivor
pre-deceases the member, after the member's benefit payments have commenced,
then the member's benefit shall revert to the normal form of retirement
benefit as of the date of death of the designated survivor. Election of a
joint and last survivor option and its accompanying pop-up protection shall
be the actuarial equivalent of the normal form, ten year certain and life
benefit. A retired member may change his or her designated survivor up to two
times without the approval of the Board or the current designated survivor.
The retiree member need not provide proof of the good health of the
designated survivor being removed, and the designated survivor being removed
need not be living. (Ord. No. 2004-08-01, §3, 08-24-04; Ord. No. 08-2-1,
§2, 02-26-08; Ord. No. 10-1-2, §4, 01-26-2010)



      (3)   Other options.



         The trustees may authorize the payment of the retirement
benefit in any form which is the actuarial equivalent of the normal forms of
retirement provided in this plan. (Ord. No. 2004-08-01, §3, 08-24-04)



   (i)   Post-Retirement Supplemental Benefit.



      (1)   In addition to the monthly retirement benefits provided
by this Plan, effective February 14, 2004, a monthly post-retirement
supplemental benefit shall be paid to all eligible retirees. For purposes of
this section, eligible retirees entitled to payment of post-retirement
supplemental benefit shall be all members who were employed by the city as
members of the Plan on September 5, 2002 and all members hired between
September 5, 2002 and March31, 2004, provided that the member retires with a
normal or early retirement benefit and separates from service on or after
February 14, 2004. Disability retirees who are eligible retirees shall be
entitled to receive the post-retirement supplemental benefit only if they had
satisfied the requirements for normal or early retirement on or prior to the
date of the award of their disability retirement. Deferred vested members are
not eligible to receive the supplement.



      (2)   Eligible retirees satisfying all criteria who have
completed a minimum often (10) years of credited service shall be eligible to
receive a maximum monthly supplemental benefit of two hundred and thirty-six
dollars ($236.00) per month, based on the member's years of credited service.
The full supplement of $236.00 shall be paid to eligible retirees who have
completed twenty-five (25) or more years of credited service. The supplement
for eligible retirees with less than twenty-five years of service credit
shall be calculated as follows: eligible retirees who have completed a
minimum of ten (10) years of credited service shall be eligible for forty
percent (40%) of the monthly supplement; eligible retirees shall receive an
additional four percent (4%) for each additional year of service, not to
exceed two hundred thirty-six dollars ($236.00) per month. This benefit shall
commence on the first day of the month following separation from service. The
post-retirement supplemental benefit shall not be paid to terminated vested
members or to members who retired prior to February 14, 2004, but will be
payable to eligible members upon entry into the DROP.



      (3)   The supplemental benefit shall commence upon separation
from employment or entry in the DROP and will continue until the earlier of
the member reaching eligibility age for Medicare benefits or age sixty-seven
(67). Ord. No. 2004-08-01, §4, 08-24-04)



   (j)   Creation of Thirteenth Check.



      (a)   A contingent cost of living adjustment payable in the
form of a thirteenth (13th) check, is hereby created for members who



         (i)   entered normal retirement on or after February 14,
2004 and



         (ii)   have received retirement benefits for at least
twelve (12) months, exclusive of DROP participation. DROP participants shall
be eligible for the 13th check after having completed DROP participation for
at least twelve (12) months.



      The cost of living adjustment shall be determined on an annual
basis by the Board of Trustees based upon the criteria set forth in this
section and shall not constitute a vested benefit. If all criteria are
satisfied, the benefit shall be payable within sixty (60) days after the
receipt and adoption of the annual actuarial valuation by the Board of
Trustees.



      (b)   Availability of thirteenth checks. The cost of living
adjustment shall be based upon cumulative net actuarial gains, as determined
in the annual actuarial valuation report. No cost of living adjustment may be
paid in any year in which they Plan failed to experience a cumulative net
actuarial gain as determined in the annual actuarial valuation report.



      (c)   Amount of thirteenth check. The cost of living
adjustment shall not exceed the regular monthly retirement benefit of the
member. In the event that the cumulative net actuarial gain is insufficient
to pay each eligible member a full monthly benefit, the Board shall
distribute the available funds on a pro-rata basis. Unused funds shall be
absorbed back into the Plan in the event that the cumulative net actuarial
gain is greater than required to pay each eligible member a full monthly
benefit.



      (d)   Eligibility to receive thirteenth check. If criteria for
payment of the cost of living adjustment are satisfied, a thirteenth check
shall be paid to all eligible retirees, as set forth in paragraph (a) above.
No retroactive payments shall be permitted.



      (e)   The city and the membership, as represented by the FOP,
have agreed that all additional premium tax revenues (after the final
"minimum" benefit of ten years certain and life has been fully funded by such
premium tax revenues or by the city, if it elects to fund any part of this
"minimum" benefit) will be used to pay for "the extra benefit". The city
shall fund the remainder of these benefits, provided however, it may reduce
its contributions as Chapter money increases, up to the full cost of the
benefits. When these benefits are fully funded as agreed to below and in
Section 5.04, future additional/excess premium tax monies received thereafter
shall be used to fund or partially fund a 13th check benefit in years that
the Pension Plan's investment gains are insufficient to fully fund the 13th
check benefit. The city and membership, as represented by the FOP, agree that
future premium tax monies shall not be available to fund any part of a 13th
check benefit unless there are sufficient future additional premium tax
monies received to fully fund the cost of "the extra benefit" set forth in
Section 2.14 and the "minimum" benefit set forth in Section 7.08 above, and
the city contribution to fund "the extra benefit" and "minimum" benefit has
been reduced to zero. (Ord. No. 04-08-01, §5, 08-24-04)



   (k)   Premium Tax Revenues/Supplemental Retirement Benefit. If there
are additional premium tax revenues remaining in any year after all
obligations and payment of the 13th check provided in subsection (j) above
have been satisfied, such additional premium tax monies received in that year
shall be used to fund a Supplemental Retirement Benefit as set forth below.
This Supplemental Retirement Benefit shall not be funded in any year unless
and until there is sufficient premium tax revenues for that year to fund all
costs of the extra benefits, minimum benefits, the 13th check, and the city's
cost to fund said extra benefits and minimum benefits has been reduced to
zero, as set forth in subsection (j).



      There is hereby created a Supplemental Retirement Benefit to be
paid pro rata to all members who made an irrevocable written election to
remain in the plan prior to the merger of services with BSO and who
thereafter enter normal or disability retirement from the plan (hereinafter
"eligible members"). The share plan benefit shall be funded exclusively with
additional premium tax revenues as described in the preceding paragraph.



      Once it is determined by the pension board, in consultation with
its actuary, that there are additional premium tax revenues available in any
year to fund this Supplemental Retirement Benefit, the value of such
remaining additional premium tax revenues shall be calculated for that year.
For that year, each active member and normal or disability retiree shall
receive one share for each year of his or her service under this Plan (i.e.,
excluding any years of service for the City or BSO for which the Member
receives credit under the Florida Retirement System). Shares shall not be
granted to vested terminated members. The annual share credit for each Member
shall be equal to: (1) the quotient of the total amount of additional premium
tax revenues that are available for funding this Supplemental Retirement
Benefit during that year divided by the total number of shares granted that
year; multiplied by: (2) the Member's number of shares for that year.
Entitlement to this Supplemental Retirement Benefit shall be determined
annually, but payments under this section may only be paid to eligible
members who have retired and commenced receipt of normal or disability
retirement benefits immediately after separating from covered employment by
the City or BSO. The Supplemental Retirement Benefit credit, if any, for
eligible members who have not retired and commenced receipt of normal or
disability retirement benefits shall be held in trust by the plan and
invested separately in government money market funds or government bonds,
with the interest thereon credited to each member's account, until the
eligible member has entered normal or disability retirement. After
commencement of retirement benefits, each eligible member shall receive a
lump sum balance of any accumulated Supplemental Retirement Benefit credits
and shall thereafter receive annual payment for any future Supplemental
Retirement Benefit credits granted during the member's lifetime. If a member
terminates employment by the City or BSO before reaching normal retirement
age or receiving a disability pension, except by death, the member's
Supplemental Retirement Benefit credits shall be reallocated among those
eligible to receive Supplemental Retirement Benefit credits in the year of
termination. The Supplemental Retirement Benefit credits of a member who dies
shall be paid to her or his designated beneficiary. (Ord. No. 10-1-2, §5,
01-26-2010)



ARTICLE VIII BUY-BACK FOR PRIOR SERVICE



(Ord. No. 10-1-2, §6, 01-26-2010)



   (a)   Any member of the plan who is employed by the city prior to
entry into military service and who takes a leave of absence for the purpose
of entering into military service in the Armed Forces of the United States
and thereafter re-enters the employ of the city, shall be entitled to
purchase service credits for the period of absence by contributing the amount
that would have been contributed by the member as if the member continued in
city employment for the period of military service based on the salary in
effect on the date of the leave of absence, for each year being purchased.



   (b)   A member who is receiving, or will receive the pension benefit
for military service in any other pension plan supported by public funds, may
not use that service for this pension plan. A member who is receiving, or
will receive any other pension in which time served in the military was used
by the employee in that other pension plan shall not be eligible for military
buy-back as provided in this section.



   (c)   The contribution for military buy-back required of the
employee may be made in one lump sum or may be made by payroll deductions in
installments for a period of time which shall not exceed the number of years
being purchased. An employee making installment payments shall complete all
required payments prior to payment of any benefit under this section. If
installment payments are not completed at the time an employee retires, the
employee shall not receive military credit for the remaining period for which
payments were not made.



(Ord. No. 02-10-01, § 1, 10-8-02)



   (d)   For a Member who has completed ten years of credited service,
as defined in Article II, Section 2-157 herein, the years or fractional parts
of years that such a member served full-time active duty in the military
service of the Armed Forces of the United States, voluntarily or
involuntarily, or performed law enforcement service prior to the Member's
first or initial employment with the City, shall be added to the Member's
years of credited service under the following terms and conditions:



      (1)   The Member contributes to the Retirement Fund the full
actuarial cost of all service credits purchased hereunder. A Member may make
such contributions as may be required, however, the service purchased shall
not be recognized or credited by the Retirement Fund until the Member has
completed ten years of credited service. If the Member terminates employment
before completing ten years of service, all contributions made by the Member
for prior military or law enforcement service shall be refunded to the Member.



      (2)   The purchase of credited service under this subsection
by a Member shall be paid in full no later than the December 31st prior to
retirement in accordance with the terms, rules, procedures, and regulations
established by the Board of Trustees. If full payment is not made prior to
the December 31st prior to retirement, then the Member, upon retirement,
shall not receive credited service for the actuarial equivalent of the
balance owed.



      (3)   For purchase of military service:



         a.   the Member did not receive a dishonorable discharge
from such service from the Armed Forces.



         b.   the Member did not receive credited servicer for
the time spent in the Armed Forces or other law enforcement service from any
other governmental pension system.



      (4)   The maximum credit which may be purchased by a Member
for prior military service in the Armed Forces of the United States or other
law enforcement service under this section shall not exceed a combined total
of five years.



      (5)   Payment for the benefits provided in this section may be
made in one or more of the following manners:



         a.   Cash lump sum payment



         b.   Direct transfer or rollover of an eligible rollover
distribution from a qualified or eligible plan, in accordance with Article
XII, Section 2-157. (Ord. No. 10-1-2, §6, 01-26-2010)



   (e)   Purchase of early Normal Retirement Date and increased benefit
level. In lieu of the purchase of credited service for prior military or law
enforcement services, as provided above, a Member may purchase a Normal
Retirement Date which is up to five (5) years earlier than otherwise provided
for in Article VII comprised of eligibility for an earlier Normal Retirement
Date combined with an increased benefit level for the member's credited
service, provided that the Member pays the full actuarial cost thereof, under
the following terms and conditions:



         i.   The Member shall contribute to the Retirement Fund
the full actuarial cost of the earlier Normal Retirement Date and increased
benefit level purchased. The Member's payment of such full actuarial cost
shall be made prior to the date that the Member's first monthly pension
benefit payment is due. The earlier Normal Retirement Date and increased
benefit shall not be recognized or credited by the Retirement Fund until the
Member has made payment of the full actuarial cost and has entered the DROP,
retired, or terminated from employment with at least ten (10) years of
credited service. If the Member terminates employment before making full
payment or completing ten (10) years of service, all contributions made by
the Member for purchase of the earlier Normal Retirement Date and increased
benefit level shall be refunded to the Member.



         ii.   For each month's actuarial equivalent for the
increased benefit level purchased hereunder, the member's multiplier will be
increased by one-quarter of one percent (0.25%) for the final year of
credited service.



         iii.   Years and months of earlier Normal Retirement
Date eligibility purchased under this section will be treated as credited
service for the purpose of determining eligibility for Normal Retirement,
under Article VII(a) or entry into DROP, under Article XVI.



         iv.   The maximum equivalent credit which may be
purchased by a Member for an increased benefit level hereunder shall be five
(5) years.



         v.   Payment for the earlier Normal Retirement Date and
increased benefit level may be made by one or more of the following manners:



            a.   Lump sum payment.



            b.   Direct transfer or rollover of an eligible
rollover distribution from a qualified or eligible retirement or deferred
compensation plan as defined by the Internal Revenue Service. (Ord. No.
10-1-2, §7, 01-26-2010)



ARTICLE IX DISABILITY



   (a)   A member shall be disabled under the terms of the plan if the
member has suffered an illness, injury or disease which renders the member
permanently and totally incapacitated, physically or mentally, from regular
and continuous duty as a police officer. Disability shall not be determined
based solely on the fact that a member cannot perform all of the duties of
his or her job grouping as set forth in the job description. The city shall
be required to accommodate disabled workers in accordance with state and
federal law and shall not withhold assignment to vacant positions on the
basis that a member is not capable of performing all of the tasks of his or
her job grouping. A disability benefit cannot be based on a condition which
pre-existed membership in the plan unless the course of the disability would
reasonably be expected to give rise to a disability in a person without the
pre-existing condition.



   (b)   A member shall be eligible for a service-incurred disability
retirement from the entry date into the plan. A service-incurred disability
retirement shall mean that the disability arose as a result of an act
occurring in the performance of service with the city.



   (c)   A member shall be eligible for a non-service incurred
disability retirement upon the completion of ten (10) years of credited
service. A non-service incurred disability shall be an illness, injury, or
disease, which did not occur as a result of an act in the performance of
service with the city.



   (d)   The service-incurred disability benefit for a police officer
shall be paid in equal monthly installments in an amount equal to sixty (60%)
percent of the member's final monthly compensation as of the date of
disability retirement, together with any additional accrued benefits in
excess of sixty (60%) percent which have been earned by the member as the
result of additional service.



   (e)   The non-service incurred disability benefit shall be paid on
the same basis as normal retirement in an amount equal to the member's
accrued benefit to date of disability, but shall be not less than twenty-five
(25%) percent of final monthly compensation. For the purposes of a
non-service incurred disability benefit, final monthly compensation shall be
determined as of the last day the member was actively at work for the city.



   (f)   Disability benefits shall be paid on the first day of each
month. No benefit shall be paid until the board of trustees has actually
considered and voted upon entitlement to disability.



   (g)   Disability retirement income shall continue until the death of
the member, or recovery from disability. An employee on disability retirement
may, upon reaching normal retirement age, elect to convert the disability
retirement to a service retirement. In the case of such an election, the
member may receive credited service for the years during which the member was
disabled by contributing to the retirement plan the monies the employee would
have contributed had the employee remained continuously in service. In the
case of such an election, average compensation shall be based upon salary
being paid to member at the time of disability. In the event of the death of
a member who is retired on a disability benefit, and has not received
payments equal to the value of the member's accumulated contributions, the
remaining unpaid benefits shall be paid to a designated beneficiary selected
by the member and communicated to the board on the form prescribed by the
board. In the event that there is no designated beneficiary, the remaining
unpaid benefits shall be paid to the estate of the deceased member. During
the period of disability, member contributions shall be suspended unless the
member is receiving a pay supplement in addition to disability benefits
provided under the Florida Workers' Compensation Act. In such event, there
shall be a member contribution from that amount representing the supplemental
pay. In the event a member's disability is converted to a service retirement
as set forth in this section, the member shall be accorded credited service
for the period of disability.



   (h)   The board of trustees shall have the continuing right to
require disabled members to submit to a medical examination to determine that
the member remains disabled. In order for a member to be deemed recovered,
the medical committee must recommend to the board of trustees that the member
has sufficiently recovered to again engage in the duties of a police officer,
and that the city has certified that it has a position within the city
available for the member consistent with the member's medical condition.



   (i)   Upon finding that a member is no longer disabled, the member
shall return to work for the city at the same rank and position previously
occupied and shall be placed into the appropriate step in the pay plan which
the member would have occupied but for the disability. The member shall again
become an active member of the plan but shall receive no credited service for
any period of time in which the member was receiving disability benefits. If
the member declines re-employment within the city, the member shall be deemed
to have terminated employment on the date that the disability benefit
commenced.



   (j)   No member shall be eligible to receive disability benefits
from the retirement plan during any period of time that the member is
receiving a salary from the city. This section shall not apply to the receipt
of worker's compensation benefits.



   (k)   Any former member who is in receipt of service connected
disability benefits, granted prior to January 1, 2013, shall have those
benefits subject to offset as provided in this section. There shall be a
deduction from the monthly disability retirement of fifty percent (50%) of
compensation due from non-city employment, provided that there shall be no
offset until the outside earnings are greater than two hundred percent (200%)
of the difference between the gross monthly salary of the disabled person
last paid by the city as of the time of disability retirement and the
disability benefit and further provided that the disability pension benefit
shall never be reduced below forty-two percent (42%) of the gross monthly
salary at time of disability. Former members in receipt of a service
connected disability may be required, on an annual basis, to provide proof of
income in such form as required by the board of trustees, including, but not
limited to, copies of federal income tax returns, in order to remain eligible
for continued benefits under this plan. Failure to provide the requested
information shall constitute consent to the suspension of benefits from this
plan, provided written notice has been given to the former member of the
suspension of benefits at least thirty (30) days prior to the suspension.



      Effective January 1, 2013, a member who is granted a service
connected disability pension by the board of trustees for this plan and who
is receiving benefits for the same disability under social security or
worker's compensation, or who is receiving another retirement benefit from
another plan of the city, shall have a deduction made from the monthly
disability pension payment in an amount necessary to bring the total of all
disability payments to no more than one hundred percent (100%) of the gross
monthly salary of the disabled person last paid by the former member's
employer under this plan as of the time the disability retirement occurred.
However, in no event will the benefit be reduced below the greater of the
accrued normal retirement benefit or forty-two percent (42%) of average
monthly earnings. Any member who was receiving a service connected disability
pension from this plan prior to January 1, 2013 shall not be affected and
shall continue to have their benefit offset in the manner originally
prescribed.



   (l)   Application for disability retirement shall be made on a form
prescribed by the board of trustees. The member shall execute such medical
releases as are necessary to permit the board of trustees to review the
medical records needed to determine the question of disability and to discuss
said records at a public meeting. Upon receipt of an application for
disability, the board shall appoint a medical committee to be composed of not
less than one nor more than three licensed physicians. The applicant for
disability shall be required to submit to examination by the medical
committee. The medical committee shall report its findings to the board of
the trustees which shall include a determination, to the extent reasonably
possible, the origin of the disability, whether the disability is permanent,
and whether the disability is total. In making that determination, the
medical committee shall be bound by the definition of disability set forth in
this plan.



   (m)   Upon receipt of the report of the medical committee, the
trustees shall schedule a public hearing at which time the board shall review
all reports of the medical committee, together with any such documentary
evidence as the applicant may wish to submit. The board shall conduct a
preliminary determination as to whether the member is permanently and totally
disabled based upon the written documentation presented. If the board does
not grant the application based on the written documentation, it shall inform
the member in writing of the reasons for the denial of the application. The
member may, within thirty (30) days of receipt of the board's preliminary
denial, request a full evidentiary hearing before the board. Said hearing
will be conducted consistent with the principles of due process and the rules
of evidence generally applicable to administrative proceedings shall apply.
The board shall have the power to issue subpoenas compelling the attendance
of witnesses. At said hearing the applicant may present such oral and written
evidence as the applicant deems necessary to establish his or her burden of
proof. The board may appoint special counsel as an advocate to cross-examine
witnesses and to offer argument in opposition to the application. The
attorney for the board shall not serve both as advocate and as advisor to the
board in the same proceeding. The applicant and the board shall have the
right to examine and cross-examine all witnesses. The decision of the board
shall be based solely upon the evidence presented and the law applicable to
this plan. Following the conclusion of the hearing, the board shall render an
opinion in writing setting forth the reasons for the grant or denial of the
benefit. In the event that the disability benefit is denied, the applicant
shall have the right to judicial review by complaint for common law
certiorari in the Circuit Court of Broward County.



   (n)   The board of trustees may prescribe rules of procedure to
implement the provisions of this plan relating to the conduct of disability
hearings.



   (o)   No member shall be granted a disability pension upon a
determination by the board that the disability resulted



from:



      (1)   Excessive and habitual use of drugs, intoxicants or
narcotics;



      (2)   Injury or disease sustained while willfully and
illegally participating in fights, riots, civil insurrections or while
committing a crime;



      (3)   Injury or disease sustained while serving in the armed
forces;



      (4)   Any occurrence arising from compensable employment
unrelated to regular city employment, and such employment having been
undertaken without prior permission of the appropriate department head having
been granted to such member in writing.



      (5)   Injury or disease sustained after employment terminated.



(Ord. No. 02-10-01, § 1, 10-8-02; Ord. No. 16-4-2, § 2, 4-12-16)



ARTICLE X VESTING AND TERMINATION



   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, all rights to
benefits under this plan shall terminate when a member's employment
terminates for any reason other than normal service retirement, early service
retirement, or disability retirement. Any member who completes ten (10) years
of credited service and whose contributions remain in the plan has a vested
right to accrued benefits from the plan. No member who has completed less
than ten (10) years of credited service shall have a vested interest in any
accrued benefit.



   (b)   A member who shall leave the service of the city prior to the
completion of ten (10) years of service shall receive a refund of accumulated
contributions, with interest thereon. The return of such contributions shall
operate as a release and discharge of the City of Cooper City and the
retirement plan from the right to any other benefits from the plan.



   (c)   A member who shall leave the service of the city prior to
eligibility for normal service retirement or early service retirement, but
who has completed ten (10) years of credited service shall be entitled to
receive retirement benefits commencing at the regular normal service
retirement date. Such benefits will be based on final monthly compensation
and credited service as of the date of termination. Benefits may also be paid
at the member's early retirement date; provided, however, that the benefit
shall be subject to the early retirement reduction.



   (d)   Every member shall have the right to elect to receive, in lieu
of all benefits under the plan, a return of the member's accumulated
contributions, with interest.



   (e)   A member who elects a lump sum return of contributions
releases and discharges the City of Cooper City and the retirement plan from
the right to any other benefits from the plan.



ARTICLE XI DEATH BENEFITS



   (a)   In the event of the death of a member prior to the time of
becoming fully vested for early or normal retirement, the member's designated
beneficiary shall be paid from the fund an amount equal to the member's
accumulated contributions together with interest thereon. In the event that
the member was fully vested for early or normal retirement, but died before
actual retirement, a death benefit shall be paid from the fund to the
beneficiary. The amount of the benefit shall be computed as though the member
had retired on the date of death and had chosen the one hundred (100%)
percent joint and survivor option. The board may, in its discretion, pay the
benefit in another form if the board deems it to be in the best interest of
the beneficiary. The actuarial value of any other form of benefit may not
exceed the actuarial value of the one hundred (100%) percent joint and last
survivor option.



   (b)   In the event of the death of a retiree, death benefits, if
any, shall be paid in accordance with the optional form of benefit chosen at
the time of retirement



   (c)   In the event that a designated beneficiary predeceases the
member, or in the case of dissolution of marriage where the spouse is the
designated beneficiary, the member may designate a new beneficiary as set
forth in this subsection. No replacement beneficiary may receive a benefit
which is greater than the actuarial equivalent of the benefit which would
have been paid to the person named as designated beneficiary at the time of
retirement. In the case of re-marriage, the spouse must have been married to
the member for at least one (1) year prior to the death of member to qualify
for benefits under this subsection.



ARTICLE XII COMPLIANCE WITH THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE



   It is the intention of the city and of the board that the plan remain
at all times a qualified plan, as that term is defined under the Internal
Revenue Code.



   (a)   Maximum Pension. Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to
the contrary, the Annual Pension that is accrued by or paid to a participant
shall not exceed the Dollar Limitation set forth below. If the benefit the
participant would otherwise accrue in a Limitation Year would produce an
Annual Pension in excess of the Dollar Limitation, the benefit shall be
limited to a benefit that does not exceed the Dollar Limitation.



      (1)   Definitions Used in this Section



         (A)   "Annual Pension" means the benefits received by a
participant under this Plan expressed in the form of a straight life annuity.
In determining whether benefits payable exceed the Dollar Limitation set
forth below, benefits payable in any form other than a straight life annuity
shall be adjusted to the larger of:



            (i)   The annual amount of the straight life
annuity (if any) payable to the participant under the plan commencing at the
same annuity starting date as the form of benefit payable to the participant;
or



            (ii)   The annual amount of the straight life
annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same
actuarial present value as the form of benefit payable to the participant,
computed using a 5 percent interest assumption and the applicable mortality
table described in §1.417(e)-1(d)(2) for that annuity starting date.



         No actuarial adjustment to the benefit shall be made for
benefits that are not directly related to retirement benefits (such as a
qualified disability benefit, preretirement incidental death benefits, and
postretirement medical benefits); or the inclusion in the form of benefit of
an automatic benefit increase feature, provided the form of benefit is not
subject to §417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and would otherwise
satisfy the limitations of this Subsection (a), and the amount payable under
the form of benefit in any Limitation Year shall not exceed the limits of
this Subsection (a) applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in
subsequent years pursuant to § 415(d) of the Code. For this purpose, an
automatic benefit increase feature is included in a form of benefit if the
form of benefit provides for automatic, periodic increases to the benefits
paid in that form.



         (B)   "Dollar Limitation" means $160,000 (subject to the
annual adjustments provided under Section 415(d) of the IRC). Said amount
shall be adjusted based on the age of the participant when benefits begin, as
follows:



            (i)   Except with respect to a participant who is
a "Qualified Participant" as defined in Section 415(b)(2)(H) of the Code, for
benefits (except survivor and disability benefits as defined in Section
415(b)(2)(I) of the Code) beginning before age 62 the Age-Adjusted Dollar
Limitation is equal to the lesser of



               (I)   the actuarial equivalent of the annual
amount of a straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date
that has the same actuarial present value as a deferred straight life annuity
commencing at age 62, where annual payments under the straight life annuity
commencing at age 62 are equal to the Dollar Limitation (as adjusted pursuant
to section 415(d) for the limitation year), and where the actuarially
equivalent straight life annuity is computed using a 5 percent interest rate
and the applicable mortality table under §1.417(e)-1(d)(2) that is effective
for that annuity starting date (and expressing the participant's age based on
completed calendar months as of the annuity starting date); and



               (II)   the Dollar Limitation (as adjusted
pursuant to section 415(d)) multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of
the straight life annuity under the plan to the annual amount of the straight
life annuity under the plan commencing at age 62, with both annual amounts
determined without applying the rules of section 415.



            (ii)   For benefits beginning after the age of 65,
the age-adjusted Dollar Limitation is equal to the lesser of:



               (I)   the actuarial equivalent of the annual
amount of a straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date
that has the same actuarial present value as a straight life annuity
commencing at age 65, where annual payments under the straight life annuity
commencing at age 65 are equal to the dollar limitation of section
415(b)(1)(A) (as adjusted pursuant to section 415(d) for the limitation
year), and where the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity is computed
using a 5 percent interest rate and the applicable mortality table under
§1.417(e)-1(d)(2) that is effective for that annuity starting date (and
expressing the participant's age based on completed calendar months as of the
annuity starting date); and



               (II)   the section 415(b)(1)(A) Dollar
limitation (as adjusted pursuant to section 415(d) and §1.415(d)-1 for the
limitation year) multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the adjusted
immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan to the adjusted
age 65 straight life annuity. The adjusted immediately commencing straight
life annuity means the annual amount of the immediately commencing straight
life annuity payable to the participant, computed disregarding the
participant's accruals after age 65 but including actuarial adjustments even
if those actuarial adjustments are applied to offset accruals. For this
purpose, the annual amount of the immediately commencing straight life
annuity is determined without applying the rules of section 415. The adjusted
age 65 straight life annuity means the annual amount of the straight life
annuity that would be payable under the plan to a hypothetical participant
who is 65 years old and has the same accrued benefit (with no actuarial
increases for commencement after age 65) as the participant receiving the
distribution (determined disregarding the participant's accruals after age 65
and without applying the rules of section 415).



            (iii)   There shall be no age adjustment of the
Dollar Limitation with respect to benefits beginning between the ages of 62
and 65.



      (2)   The limitations set forth in this Subsection (a) shall
not apply if the Annual Pension does not exceed $10,000 provided the
participant has never participated in a Defined Contribution Plan maintained
by the City.



      (3)   Cost-of-living adjustments in the Dollar Limitation for
benefits shall be limited to scheduled annual increases determined by the
Secretary of the Treasury under Subsection 415(d) of the Code.



      (4)   In the case of a participant who has fewer than 10 years
of participation in the Plan, the Dollar Limitation set forth in Paragraph
(1)(B) of this Subsection (a) shall be multiplied by a fraction - (i) the
numerator of which is the number of years (or part thereof) of participation
in the Plan, and (ii) the denominator of which is 10.



      (5)   Any portion of a participant's benefit that is
attributable to mandatory employee contributions (unless picked-up by the
City) or rollover contributions, shall be taken into account in the manner
prescribed in the regulations under Section 415 of the Code.



      (6)   Should any participant participate in more than one
defined benefit plan maintained by the City, in any case in which the
participant's benefits under all such defined benefit plans (determined as of
the same age) would exceed the Dollar Limitation applicable at that age, the
accrual of the participant's benefit under this Plan shall be reduced so that
the participant's combined benefits will equal the Dollar Limitation.



      (7)   For a participant who has or will have distributions
commencing at more than one annuity starting date, the Annual Benefit shall
be determined as of each such annuity starting date (and shall satisfy the
limitations of this Section as of each such date), actuarially adjusting for
past and future distributions of benefits commencing at the other annuity
starting dates. For this purpose, the determination of whether a new starting
date has occurred shall be made without regard to § 1.401(a)-20, Q&A 10(d),
and with regard to § 1.415(b)1(b)(1)(iii)(B) and (C) of the Income Tax
Regulations.



      (8)   The determination of the Annual Pension under Paragraph
(a)(1) of this Subsection (a) shall take into account (in the manner
prescribed by the regulations under Section 415 of the Code) social security
supplements described in § 411(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code and
benefits transferred from another defined benefit plan, other than transfers
of distributable benefits pursuant § 1.411(d)-4, Q&A-3(c) of the Income Tax
Regulations.



      (9)   The above limitations are intended to comply with the
provisions of Section 415 of the Code, as amended, so that the maximum
benefits provided by plans of the City shall be exactly equal to the maximum
amounts allowed under Section 415 of the Code and regulations thereunder. If
there is any discrepancy between the provisions of this Subsection (a) and
the provisions of Section 415 of the Code and regulations thereunder, such
discrepancy shall be resolved in such a way as to give full effect to the
provisions of Section 415 of the Code. The value of any benefits forfeited as
a result of the application of this Subsection (a) shall be used to decrease
future employer contributions.



      (10)   For the purpose of applying the limitations set forth
in Sections 401(a)(17) and 415 of the Internal Revenue Code, Earnings shall
include any elective deferral (as defined in Code Section 402(g)(3) of the
Internal Revenue Code), and any amount which is contributed or deferred by
the employer at the election of the Member and which is not includible in the
gross income of the Member by reason of Section 125 or 457 of the Internal
Revenue Code. For limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2001,
for the purposes of applying the limitations described in this Subsection (a)
of Section 42-33, compensation paid or made available during such limitation
years shall include elective amounts that are not includible in the gross
income of the Member by reason of Section 132(f)(4) of the Internal Revenue
Code.



   (b)   Required Beginning Date:



   Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, payment of a
participant's retirement benefits under the Plan shall commence not later
than the participant's Required Beginning Date, which is defined as the later
of:



   April 1 of the calendar year that next follows the calendar year in
which the participant attains or will attain the age of 70 1/2 years; or



   April 1 of the calendar year that next follows the calendar year in
which the participant retires.



   (c)   Required Minimum Distributions.



      (1)   Required Beginning Date. The participant's entire
interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the participant
no later than the participant's Required Beginning Date as defined in
Subsection (b) of this Article XII.



      (2)   Death of participant Before Distributions Begin.



         (A)   If the participant dies before distributions
begin, the participant's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be
distributed, no later than as follows:



            (i)   If the participant's surviving spouse is the
participant's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the
surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately
following the calendar year in which the participant died, or by December 31
of the calendar year in which the participant would have attained age 70 1/2,
if later.



            (ii)   If the participant's surviving spouse is
not the participant's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the
designated beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year
immediately following the calendar year in which the participant died.



            (iii)   If there is no designated beneficiary as
of September 30 of the year following the year of the participant's death,
the participant's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the
calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the participant's death.



         (B)   The participant's entire interest shall be
distributed as follows:



            (i)   participant Survived by Designated
Beneficiary. If the participant dies before the date distribution of his or
her interest begins and there is a designated beneficiary, the participant's
entire interest will be distributed, beginning no later than the time
described in Subparagraph (2)(A) above, over the life of the designated
beneficiary or over a period certain not exceeding:



               (I)   unless the annuity starting date is
before the first distribution calendar year, the life expectancy of the
designated beneficiary determined using the beneficiary's age as of the
beneficiary's birthday in the calendar year immediately following the
calendar year of the participant's death; or



               (II)   if the annuity starting date is
before the first distribution calendar year, the life expectancy of the
designated beneficiary determined using the beneficiary's age as of the
beneficiary's birthday in the calendar year that contains the annuity
starting date.



            (ii)   No Designated Beneficiary. If the
participant dies before the date distributions begin and there is no
designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of
the participant's death, distribution of the participant's entire interest
will be completed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth
anniversary of the participant's death.



      (C)   Death of Surviving Spouse Before Distributions to
Surviving Spouse Begin. In any case in which (i) the participant dies before
the date distribution of his or her interest begins, (ii) the participant's
surviving spouse is the participant's sole designated beneficiary, and (iii)
the surviving spouse dies before distributions to the surviving spouse begin,
Subparagraphs (2)(A) and 2(B) above shall apply as though the surviving
spouse were the participant.



      (3)     Requirements For Annuity Distributions That Commence
During participant's Lifetime.



         (A)   Joint Life Annuities Where the Beneficiary Is Not
the participant's Spouse. If the participant's interest is being distributed
in the form of a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the
participant and a nonspousal beneficiary, annuity payments to be made on or
after the participant's Required Beginning Date to the designated beneficiary
after the participant's death must not at any time exceed the applicable
percentage of the annuity payment for such period that would have been
payable to the participant using the table set forth in Q&A-2 of Section
1.401(a)(9)-6T of the Treasury regulations. If the form of distribution
combines a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the participant
and a nonspousal beneficiary and a period certain annuity, the requirement in
the preceding sentence will apply to annuity payments to be made to the
designated beneficiary after the expiration of the period certain.



         (B)   Period Certain Annuities. Unless the participant's
spouse is the sole designated beneficiary and the form of distribution is a
period certain and no life annuity, the period certain for an annuity
distribution commencing during the participant's lifetime may not exceed the
applicable distribution period for the participant under the Uniform Lifetime
Table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations for the
calendar year that contains the annuity starting date. If the annuity
starting date precedes the year in which the participant reaches age 70, the
applicable distribution period for the participant is the distribution period
for age 70 under the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in Section
1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations plus the excess of 70 over the age
of the participant as of the participant's birthday in the year that contains
the annuity starting date. If the participant's spouse is the participant's
sole designated beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain
and no life annuity, the period certain may not exceed the longer of the
participant's applicable distribution period, as determined under this
Subparagraph (3)(B), or the joint life and last survivor expectancy of the
participant and the participant's spouse as determined under the Joint and
Last Survivor Table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury
regulations, using the participant's and spouse's attained ages as of the
participant's and spouse's birthdays in the calendar year that contains the
annuity starting date.



      (4)   Form of Distribution. Unless the participant's interest
is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company
or in a single sum on or before the Required Beginning Date, as of the first
distribution calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with
Subparagraphs (4)(A), (4)(B) and (4)(C) below. If the participant's interest
is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company,
distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of
Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and the Treasury regulations. Any part of the
participant's interest which is in the form of an individual account
described in Section 414(k) of the Code will be distributed in a manner
satisfying the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and the Treasury
regulations that apply to individual accounts.



         (A)   General Annuity Requirements. If the participant's
interest is paid in the form of annuity distributions under the Plan,
payments under the annuity will satisfy the following requirements:



            (i)   the annuity distributions will be paid in
periodic payments made at intervals not longer than one year;



            (ii)   the distribution period will be over a life
(or lives) or over a period certain, not longer than the distribution period
described in Paragraphs 2 or 3 above, whichever is applicable, of this
Subsection (c) ;



            (iii)   once payments have begun over a period
certain, the period certain will not be changed even if the period certain is
shorter than the maximum permitted;



            (iv)   payments will either be non-increasing or
increase only as follows:



               (I)   by an annual percentage increase that
does not exceed the annual percentage increase in a cost-of-living index that
is based on prices of all items and issued by the Bureau of Labor Statistics;



               (II)   to the extent of the reduction in the
amount of the participant's payments to provide for a survivor benefit upon
death, but only if the beneficiary whose life was being used to determine the
distribution period dies or is no longer the participant's beneficiary
pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order within the meaning of
Section 414(p) of the Code;



               (III)   to provide cash refunds of employee
contributions upon the participant's death; or



               (IV)   to pay increased benefits that result
from a Plan amendment.



         (B)   Amount Required to be Distributed by Required
Beginning Date. The amount that must be distributed on or before the
participant's Required Beginning Date (or, if the participant dies before
distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under
Subparagraph (2)(A)(i) or (2)(A)(ii), whichever is applicable) is the payment
that is required for one payment interval. The second payment need not be
made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval
ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which
payments are received, e.g., bi-monthly, monthly, semi-annually, or annually.
All of the participant's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first
distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount
of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the
participant's Required Beginning Date.



         (C)   Additional Accruals After First Distribution
Calendar Year. Any additional benefits accruing to the participant in a
calendar year after the first distribution calendar year will be distributed
beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year
immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues.



      (5)   For purposes of this Subsection (c), distributions are
considered to begin on the participant's Required Beginning Date. If annuity
payments irrevocably commence to the participant (or to the participant's
Surviving Spouse) before the participant's Required Beginning Date (or, if to
the participant's Surviving Spouse, before the date distributions are
required to begin in accordance with Subparagraph (2)(A) above), the date
distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually
commence.



      (6)   Definitions.



         (A)   Designated beneficiary. The individual who is
designated as the beneficiary under the Plan and is the designated
beneficiary under Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and Section 1.401(a)(9)-1,
Q&A-4, of the Treasury regulations.



         (B)   Distribution calendar year. A calendar year for
which a minimum distribution is required. For distributions beginning before
the participant's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar
year immediately preceding the calendar year which contains the participant's
Required Beginning Date. For distributions beginning after the participant's
death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year in which
distributions are required to begin pursuant to Paragraph (2) of this
Subsection (c).



         (C)   Life expectancy. Life expectancy as computed by
use of the Single Life Table in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury
regulations.



   (d)   (1)   Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the
contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election, a distributee
may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the Administrator, to
have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an
eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover.



      (2)   Definitions. The following definitions apply to this
Subsection:



         (A)   Eligible rollover distribution: An eligible
rollover distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the
balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover
distribution does not include:



            (i)   any distribution that is one of a series of
substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually)
made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives
(or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's
designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of 10 years or more;



            (ii)   any distribution to the extent such
distribution is required under Section 401(a)(9) of the Code;



            (iii)   the portion of any distribution that is a
hardship distribution described in Section 401(k)(2)(B)(i)(IV) of the Code;
and



            (iv)   the portion of any distribution that is not
includible in gross income (determined without regard to the exclusion for
net unrealized appreciation with respect to employer securities), provided
that a portion of a distribution shall not fail to be an eligible rollover
distribution merely because the portion consists of after-tax Employee
contributions which are not includible in gross income. However, such portion
may be transferred only to an individual retirement account or annuity
described in Section408(a) or (b) of the Code, or to a qualified defined
contribution plan described in Section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Code that
agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred, including separately
accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross
income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible.



      (3)   Eligible retirement plan: An eligible retirement plan is
an individual retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the Code, an
individual retirement annuity described in Section408(b) of the Code, an
annuity plan described in Section403(a) of the Code, an annuity contract
described in Section403(b) of the Code, a qualified trust described in
Section 401 (a) of the Code, an eligible plan under Section457(b) of the Code
which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any
agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and
which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan
from this Plan, or a Roth IRA (subject to the limitations of Code
Section408A(c)(3)) that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover
distribution.



      (4)   Distributee: A distributee includes an Employee or
former Employee. In addition, the Employee's or former Employee's surviving
spouse and the Employee's or former Employee's spouse or former spouse who is
the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in
Section 414(p) of the Code, are distributees with regard to the interest of
the spouse or former spouse. Furthermore, effective January 1, 2007, a
surviving designated beneficiary as defined in Section 401(a)(9)(E) of the
Code who is not the surviving spouse and who elects a direct rollover to an
individual retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the Code or an
individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the Code shall
be considered a distributee.



      (5)   Direct rollover: A direct rollover is a payment by the
Plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee.



   (e)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, the maximum
amount of any mandatory distribution, as defined in Section 401(a)(31) of the
Code, payable under the Plan shall be $1000.



   (f)   Compensation Limitations Under 401(a)(17):



   In addition to other applicable limitations set forth in the Plan, and
notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, the annual
compensation of each participant taken into account under the Plan shall not
exceed the EGTRRA annual compensation limit for limitation years beginning
after December31, 2001. The EGTRRA annual compensation limit is $200,000, as
adjusted by the Commissioner for increases in the cost of living in
accordance with Section 401(a)(17)(B) of the Code. The cost-of-living
adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to any period, not exceeding
12 months, over which Compensation is determined (determination period)
beginning in such calendar year. If a determination period consists of fewer
than 12 months, the EGTRRA annual compensation limit will be multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the determination
period, and the denominator of which is 12.



   Any reference in the Plan to the limitation under Section 401 (a)(17)
of the Code shall mean the EGTRRA annual compensation limit set forth in this
provision.



   (g)   At no time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under
the plan with respect to members and their spouses or beneficiaries, shall
any part of the corpus or income of the fund be used for or diverted to any
purpose other than for their exclusive benefit. (Ord. No. 10-01-02, §9,
01-26-10)



ARTICLE XIII AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION OF THE SYSTEM



   (a)   It is the intention of the city and the board that this
pension plan shall constitute an irrevocable trust and no portion of the
assets may revert to the employer until all other obligations of the plan,
including the payment to the last surviving member and beneficiary has been
paid.



   (b)   In the event of termination or partial termination of the
plan, each participant's accrued pension benefit shall become nonforfeitable
(100 percent vested). The Board shall determine the date of distribution and
the asset value required to fund all of the nonforfeitable benefits. The
Board shall inform the City, or then current Fund sponsor, if additional
assets are required, in which event, the City, or then current Fund sponsor,
shall continue to financially support the Retirement Plan until all
nonforfeitable benefits have been fully funded. At such time, the funds shall
be appropriated and distributed in accordance with the provisions of Florida
Statutes, Chapter 185. (Ord. No. 10-01-02, §10, 01-26-10)



ARTICLE XIV DISTRIBUTION OF MARITAL INTERESTS IN THE PLAN



   (a)   In the event that the board is served with a domestic
relations order or other legal process purporting to require the payment of
any portion of a member's benefit to another person as a result of a
dissolution of marriage, the board shall cause such order to be reviewed to
determine compliance with the provisions of the plan.



   (b)   The board of trustees shall be authorized to intervene in any
such dissolution of marriage proceeding to ensure that such domestic
relations order is otherwise consistent with the distribution of an interest
in a public employees retirement plan under state law.



   (c)   Any cost associated with the modification or correction of
such domestic relations orders shall be the responsibility of the plan member.



ARTICLE XV MISCELLANEOUS



   (a)   The present or future right of a person to money in the
pension fund or to a retirement allowance, an optional allowance, a death
benefit, the return of contributions, or any other right accrued or accruing
under the provisions of this plan shall not be assignable and shall not be
subject to execution, garnishment, attachment, the operation of bankruptcy or
insolvency law or any other process of law whatsoever, the recipient of any
monthly benefit may authorize the board of trustees to withhold from the
monthly benefit those funds necessary to pay for the benefits being received
through the city or BSO, to pay the certified bargaining agent of BSO, and to
make any payments for child support or alimony. Further, the recipient of any
monthly benefit may authorize the board of trustees upon written request, to
withhold from the monthly benefit those funds necessary to pay for accident,
health, and long-term care insurance premiums for the recipient, the
recipient's spouse and the recipient's dependents. The Pension Fund shall not
incur any liability for participation in such permissive program if its
action is taken in good faith. (Ord. No. 04-08-01, §7, 08-24-04; Ord. No.
10-01-02, §11, 01-26-10)



   (b)   The board shall have the power to examine into the facts upon
which any pension has been granted under any prior or existing law or which
may be granted in the future or obtained erroneously, fraudulently, or
illegally for any reason. The board is empowered to purge the pension rolls
of any person who has been granted a pension under a prior or existing law,
or who is hereafter granted a benefit under this ordinance if the granting of
that pension is found to be erroneous, fraudulent, or illegal for any reason;
and to reclassify any pensioner who has under any prior or existing law or
who may under this ordinance be erroneously, improperly or illegally
classified.



   (c)   Should any change or error in retirement system records be
discovered or result in any member or beneficiary receiving from the
retirement plan more or less than he or she would have been entitled to
receive had the records been correct, the board shall have the power to
correct such error and, as far as possible, adjust the payments in such a
manner that the actuarial equivalent of a benefit to which such member or
beneficiary was correctly entitled shall be paid.



   (d)   If any member or beneficiary is a minor or is under any other
legal disability, the board of trustees shall have the power to withhold
payment of benefits until the board is presented with proof satisfactory to
the board of the appointment of a guardian. If the board becomes aware that
any member or beneficiary is incapable of personally receiving and giving a
valid receipt for any payment due under the plan, the board shall cause
notice to be given to that participant or beneficiary of a hearing to
determine whether said benefits should continue to be paid until the
appointment of a guardian. During the pendency of any such hearing, however,
the board may continue to pay benefits to the member or beneficiary and that
such payment shall be a complete discharge of any liability under the plan
for such payment.



   (e)   Members entitled to a pension shall not forfeit same upon
dismissal from the city, but shall be retired as herein described.



ARTICLE XVI DEFERRED RETIREMENT OPTION PLAN



   (a)   Any active police officer may participate in the DROP pursuant
to the requirements of this section. All applications for DROP shall be in
writing on the form promulgated by the board.



      (1)   Eligibility. A member is eligible to participate in DROP
on the first day of the month following the attainment of the normal
retirement age as defined in Article VII.



      (2)   Maximum Period of DROP Participation. A member's maximum
period of participation in the DROP shall be upon the earlier of the last day
of the Member's employment by the Broward Sheriffs Office, or ii.  the first
day of the limitation year, as defined in Section 415 of the Internal Revenue
Code, in which the continued participation of the Member in the DROP would
cause the Member's Annual Benefit for said limitation year to exceed the
applicable Section 415 limitation. (Ord. No. 10-01-02, §8, 01-26-10)



   (b)   A member electing DROP participation shall execute such forms
as the Board of Trustees shall require to include a letter of resignation
dated as of the DROP termination. The DROP election shall be effective on the
first day of the month following the date of election. Applications must be
filed with the board (with a copy to the city) not less than five (5)
business days prior to the effective date. (Ord. No. 02-10-01, § 1, 10-8-01)



   (c)   DROP election shall be irrevocable at the time the member
executes the applicable forms. Also, members may participate in DROP only
once. After DROP participation commences, a member may not rejoin the
retirement system as an active member nor shall the member be eligible to
receive disability or pre-retirement death benefits from the system.



   (d)   Upon DROP commencement, both the city and member contributions
to the system for the normal cost of benefits shall cease.



   (e)   For all retirement system purposes, the average monthly
earnings and continuous service of a member participating in DROP shall
remain as they existed on the date of commencement of participation in the
DROP, service, earnings, or increases in earnings thereafter shall not be
recognized by the retirement system or be used for the calculation or
determination of any benefits payable by the retirement system.



   Upon commencement of DROP participation, the member will continue to
accrue or be paid for sick leave, holiday leave and annual leave in
accordance with the terms of the applicable collective bargaining agreement
and/or city rules and regulations, as applicable.



   (f)   Payments shall be made monthly by the retirement system to a
member's DROP account in the amount which would be paid had the member
separated from the city and commenced normal retirement.



   (g)   Members of the DROP who have elected to participate in the
DROP Loan program, as detailed herein, shall not receive any earnings on
outstanding loan balances until such time as a repayment is made. Repayments
are qualified as principal and interest with the latter being reflected on
member DROP accounts as "earnings." (Ord. No. 13-10-1, §2, 10-22-13)



   Accounts may be credited monthly or quarterly at the discretion of the
board of trustees. Returns on DROP accounts will be posted up to 90 days
after the last date of the members' DROP period. DROP participants by virtue
of their participation authorize the retirement board to invest their DROP
assets in the same manner as other assets of the pension fund. By
participation in the DROP, DROP participants agree to hold the board of
trustees, the retirement fund and the City of Cooper City harmless from any
liability claims associated with investment losses which may occur in the
ordinary course of the investment of assets of the retirement system. The
city and the board of trustees may seek a favorable determination letter from
the IRS concerning the retirement plan, including all provisions of the DROP.
In the event that the IRS should hold that this section does not meet the
"definitely determinable benefit" rule, participant accounts will be credited
at a fixed rate based upon the actuarially assumed rate of return as
determined by the board of trustees during the period of DROP participation.
This rate of interest shall continue to apply unless and until the city and
the applicable collective bargaining unit negotiate a different rate of
return. No member shall receive a DROP payment until actually separated from
the city.



   (h)   Each member's DROP account may be charged an administrative
fee of one-half (1/2) of one percent (1%), which will be deducted from the
member's DROP account. The administrative fee may be adjusted on a uniform
basis from time to time by the board of trustees. (Ord. No. 10-01-02, §8,
01-26-10)



   (i)   Upon termination of employment for any reason, DROP
participation shall cease and any future retirement
benefits shall be paid directly to the member, or in the case of death, to
the designated beneficiary.



   Payment shall be made from the DROP account no more than ninety (90)
days after separation from the city. The form of payment may be altered upon
written notice to the board to take effect not more than ninety (90) days
from the date of notice. Payment shall be made:



      (1)   in a single lump sum;



      (2)   in annual installments;



      (3)   in equal monthly installments;



      (4)   any combination of lump sum and periodic payments; or



      (5)   by rollover to another qualified retirement plan.



   The board of trustees may accelerate or alter any payment schedule as
may be required to comply with the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code
Section 401(a)(9) and 415.



   No DROP payment may be made in a manner inconsistent with state or
federal law.



   DROP balances shall continue to be credited or debited with earnings
until fully paid to the member.



   (j)   Should a member die during DROP participation, or before the
account balance is paid in full, the member's designated beneficiary shall
have the same rights as the member to elect and receive the payout options
set forth above.



   (k)   All benefits payable under this DROP program shall be paid
solely from DROP assets. Neither the city nor the board of trustees shall
have any liability or duty to pay the member or to furnish the DROP with any
funds, securities or assets except to the extent required by applicable law.



   (l)   In the event an employee sustains an on-the-job injury during
DROP participation (or before said participation, but where the employee is
still experiencing the effects of said injury when he/she elects DROP
participation) and misses time from work, the employee will be subject to
applicable provisions of the city's rules and regulations as well as the
provisions of the collective bargaining agreement, provided that no such
provisions of the rules and regulations and/or collective bargaining
agreement conflicts with the requirements of this DROP plan ordinance. The
fact that the employee is a DROP participant will not prevent the city from
separating the employee from employment or from offering the employee work
outside of the employee's normal position. Participation in the DROP is not a
guarantee of continued employment.



   DROP participants shall not be eligible to apply for nor receive
disability retirement. Upon separation all DROP participants will receive
normal retirement benefits only.



   (m)   The provisions of the collective bargaining agreement between
the city and the applicable union will be generally applicable to DROP
participants. However, once an employee elects to participate in the DROP,
the employee will no longer be eligible for promotion, nor will they be
eligible to receive pay for educational reimbursement (other than the cost of
training and education necessary to maintain certification).



   (n)   Once a member reaches the end of their participation in the
DROP, they shall be separated from employment with the city in accordance
with their letter of resignation.



   (o)   The deferred retirement option plan will be implemented
subject to the state and federal laws. (Ord. No. 2000-1-12, § 2, 1-25-2000;
Ord. No. 2002-10-01, § 1, 10-8-02)



   (p)   DROP Loan Program



      (a)   DROP participants may apply to the Board of Trustees to
borrow from the Retirement Fund up to fifty percent (50%) of the total
balance in their respective DROP Account, up to a maximum of $50,000. The
Board of Trustees shall approve or deny any such application in accordance
with the terms and conditions specified herein. The Board of Trustees shall
not have the authority to deny Member loan applications that satisfy
requirements outlined herein. All loans to DROP participants shall be secured
by the Member's DROP Account and no payments from the Member's DROP Account
shall be made to the Member, survivor or beneficiary while a loan balance
remains outstanding. Should any loan balance remain unpaid after the balance
in the Member's DROP Account has been exhausted, then that balance shall be
secured and paid by offsetting such Member, survivor or beneficiary's other
benefits payable by the Retirement Fund. The loan must be evidenced by the
Member's promissory note payable to the Retirement Fund and shall have a
definite interest rate, repayment schedule, and maturity date. The promissory
note shall provide that in the event that the loan is not repaid, at a time
when the Member is entitled to a distribution, any unpaid balance of the
loan, plus interest, shall be retained by the Board of Trustees out of such
distribution. The Board of Trustees shall be authorized to take any and all
necessary action to reinforce such Member's obligations.



      (b)   In making its determination with respect to eligibility
for, terms and conditions of, and interest rates on any loan, the Board of
Trustees shall act in a uniform and nondiscriminatory manner. The outstanding
principal of any loan to a Member shall not exceed fifty percent of the
Member's vested amount in the DROP account, provided, that the maximum loan
amount shall not exceed $50,000.00. The promissory note shall bear interest
at the annual interest rate quoted as the "prime rate" in the Wall Street
Journal on the day which the Member files all necessary forms for his DROP
loan with the Board of Trustees.



      (c)   If a Member or beneficiary, directly or indirectly,
receives any amount as a loan from the Retirement Fund, such amount shall be
treated as a taxable distribution from the Retirement Fund to the individual
if:



         i   The amount of the loan exceeds the lesser of: (i)
$50,000.00 (reduced to the extent that the Member or beneficiary's highest
balance for plan loans outstanding during the preceding 12 months exceeds the
current balance for plan loans); or (ii) one-half of the Member's DROP
account (or $10,000 if greater); and



         ii   The loan by its terms is not required to be repaid
within five years of the date the funds are actually received by the borrower
(i.e. Member).



      (d)   Loan Amount and Term: The Board of Trustees may loan to
a DROP participant Member a minimum of$5,000.00 and a maximum of $50,000.00.
The loan shall be repaid by the Member over a period of time not to exceed
five years, as elected by the Member at the time of the loan, with
installment payments to be paid on a biweekly or monthly basis, as chosen by
the Member, with each payment being comprised of principal and interest. The
Member may elect that the loan installment payments be automatically deducted
from either, his or her account with the City County Credit Union of Ft.
Lauderdale, or his or her monthly pension benefit from the Retirement Fund.



         i.   Suspension of Loan Repayment-Leave for Military
Absence: In accordance with IRC section 414(u)(4), the Retirement Fund shall
permit postponement of loan repayments for military service personnel while
performing military service. Any such postponement shall not alter the
accrual of interest. Any such suspension of loan repayments during a leave of
absence for military service will not cause the loan to be deemed a taxable
distribution so long as:



            1.   Loan repayments resume upon the completion of
the military service; and



            2.   The amount remaining due on the loan is
repaid in substantially level installments; and



            3.   The loan is fully repaid by the end of the
original term of the loan plus the period of military service.



      (e)   Loan Costs and Expenses: The electing Member shall pay
all costs of the loan, including documentary stamps, intangible taxes, loan
servicing fees, and all other costs associated with loan.



      (f)   Default: Events of Default under the terms of the loan
shall include, but are not limited to:



         i   Bankruptcy, insolvency, or failure to make any
installment loan payment when due.



         ii   In the event that the loan is used to acquire,
construct, reconstruct or substantially rehabilitate the principal residence
of the Member or a member of his or her family, upon the sale or transfer of
such principal residence.



      (g)   Grace Period: In the event of a default due to a
participating Member's failure to make an installment payment when due, then
the Retirement Fund, at its sole discretion, may provide written notice to
such Member of the occurrence of such default, and afford such Member a grace
period not to exceed ten days from the date upon which the subject payment(s)
was due, within which such Member may make payment to the Retirement Fund to
cure such default.



      (h)   Attorney's Fees and Costs: In the event of a default,
and should the Board of Trustees determine that it is required to pursue
legal relief to enforce a Member's loan repayment obligations hereunder, then
such Member shall be held responsible for any and all attorney's fees and
costs incurred by the Retirement Fund to enforce such Member's obligations.

   (d)   The board of trustees shall prescribe a uniform election
procedure for the selection of the active member trustees.



   (e)   All trustees shall serve without compensation, but they shall

the terms of the plan. Three (3) concurring votes shall be required of the
board to take action.



   (h)   The board shall keep minutes of all meetings and a record of
any action taken by the board shall be kept in written form and maintained by
the board.



   (i)   The board of trustees shall have the authority to make such
uniform rules and regulations and to take such action as may be necessary to
carry out the provisions of the plan and all decisions of the board of
trustees, made in good faith, shall be final, binding and conclusive on all
parties.



   (j)   The board of trustees shall be deemed the named fiduciary of
the plan and shall discharge its responsibilities solely in the interest of
the members and beneficiaries of the plan for the exclusive purpose of
providing benefits to the members and their beneficiaries and to defray the
reasonable expenses of the plan. The trustees shall exercise those fiduciary
responsibilities with the care, skill, prudence and diligence under the
circumstances then prevailing that a prudent person acting in a like capacity
and familiar with such matters would use in the conduct of an enterprise of a
similar character and with similar aims.



   (k)   The board of trustees shall have the following administrative
duties:



      (1)   To maintain such records as are necessary for
calculating and distributing retirement benefits;



      (2)   To maintain such records as are necessary for financial
accounting and reporting of retirement plan funds;



      (3)   To maintain such records as are necessary for actuarial
evaluation of the retirement plan, including investigations into the

   (l)   The board shall have the authority to retain its own legal

   (m)   The board is authorized to prosecute or defend actions, claims
or proceedings of any nature or kind for the protection of the fund assets or
for the protection of the board in the performance of its duties.



   (n)   Neither the board nor any of its individual members shall have
any personal liability for any action taken in good faith. The trustees
individually and the board as a whole shall be entitled to the protections in
section 768.28, Florida Statutes. The trustees shall also be authorized to
purchase from the assets of the fund, errors and omission insurance to
protect the trustees in the performance of their duties. Such insurance shall
not provide protection against a trustee's fraud, intentional
misrepresentation, willful misconduct or gross negligence.



   (o)   No trustee shall be responsible at his or her own expense, to
take legal action to correct the misconduct of any other member of the board
of trustees. A trustee shall have an affirmative obligation, however, to
publicly reveal any misfeasance, malfeasance or nonfeasance by a co-trustee,
and upon making such revelation in a public meeting, shall be relieved
further individual responsibility of the actions of that co-trustee.



ARTICLE V CONTRIBUTIONS



   (a)   The city shall pick-up, rather than deduct from each member's
pay, beginning with the first date of membership in the plan, the sum of five
(5%) percent of the earnings of firefighters. For members who:



      (1)   made an irrevocable written election by February 13,
2004 to remain in the Plan after the transfer of fire and rescue services to
the Broward County Sheriff's Office and



      (2)   enter normal or disability retirement from the Plan
after the effective date of this amendment.



   The Broward Sheriff's Office shall pick-up the former
(non-supplemental) employee contribution of five percent (5%), but shall not
deduct that contribution from the member's pay. These non-supplemental
contributions shall not, however, be considered part of an employee's
pensionable compensation for the purpose of pension benefit calculations.



   Based upon the actuarial study dated February 12, 2004, the
"supplemental" employee contributions for each member who elects to remain in
the plan shall be in the amount of 3.45%. These contributions shall be picked
up by the Broward County Sheriff's Office from employee compensation as
provided in section 414(h)(2) of the Internal Revenue Code. The sums picked
up shall be derived from a reduction in the employee's compensation which,
for income tax purposes only, shall be reported on the employee's W-2 form
net of the "supplemental" employee contribution. The amount picked up shall
not be a reduction from base pay for the purposes of determining overtime,
wage increases, sick/vacation leave calculation, social security taxes, or
inclusion as compensation for pension calculation purposes. In the event that
the Broward County Sheriffs Office pays these supplemental contributions
without a reduction in a member's pay, such sums shall cease to be counted as
compensation for pension calculation purposes. (Ord. No. 04-10-09, §3;
10-26-04)



   (b)   All benefits payable under this plan are in lieu of a refund
of accumulated contributions. In any event, however, each member or
designated beneficiary shall be guaranteed the payment of benefits at least
equal in total amount to the member's accumulated contributions.



   (c)   Any monies received or receivable by reason of the laws of the
State of Florida for the express purpose of funding or paying for retirement
benefits for firefighters shall be deposited into the fund within five (5)
business days of receipt by the city.



   (d)   The city shall make such contribution under the Florida
Protection of Public Employee Retirement Benefits Act and chapter 175,
Florida Statutes, which together with contributions picked-up on behalf of
members, plan earnings and state insurance premium tax rebates, will maintain
the fund on a sound actuarial basis, as determined by the board in
conjunction with its actuary. The city and the membership, as represented by
the IAFF, have agreed that the new extra benefits negotiated in connection
with the BSO merger will (according to a study by the plan's actuary)
increase the Annual Regular Employer Contribution (ARC) to the plan by the
amount of $237,550. The increased cost of these benefits, enacted in
connection with the Memorandum of Understanding between the city and the IAFF
dated October 26, 2004, shall be funded by a combination of the existing
excess premium tax revenues and $130,000 from the city (on a declining basis
against future increases in premium tax revenues, and, if permitted by a
change in the law or the Division of Retirement's interpretation of the law,
subject to the offsets/credits from additional future excess premium tax
revenues described in section 15.06) and the "supplemental" employee
contributions described in section 5.01.



(Ord. No. 04-10-09, §4; 10-26-04)



   (e)   Expenses, charges and fees attributable to the management of
the plan shall be paid from the fund.



   (f)   The city shall have no right, title or interest in the fund or
in any part thereof, and no contribution made thereto shall revert to the
city, except such part of the fund, if any, which remains therein after the
satisfaction of all liabilities to persons entitled to benefits under the
plan.



ARTICLE VI FUND MANAGEMENTAND INVESTMENTS



   (a)   The plan is hereby established as an irrevocable trust fund
into which shall be deposited all of the assets of the plan of every kind and
description.

the advice and counsel of such advisors as the board deems necessary, and
said investment policy shall set forth the types of securities and other
types of investments into which shall be placed the assets of the fund. The
policy shall further set forth appropriate limitations on those investments,
including, but not limited to, anticipated rate of return, quality of
investment, class of investment and acceptable risk. The board shall identify
and publicly report any direct or indirect holdings it may have in any
scrutinized company, as defined in Florida Statutes, Section215.473, and
proceed to sell, redeem, divest, or withdraw all publicly traded securities
it may have in such company beginning January 1, 2010 and shall thereafter be
prohibited from purchasing or holding such securities. The divestiture of any
such security must be completed by September 30, 2010. In accordance with Ch.
2009-97, Laws of Florida, no person may bring any civil, criminal, or
administrative action against the board or any employee, officer, director,
or advisor of such board based upon the divestiture of any security pursuant
to this paragraph. The board shall have the authority to invest and reinvest
the assets of the plan in such securities or property, real or personal, as
the board deems appropriate, including, but not limited to:

      (2)   Accounts or certificates of deposit in any bank or other
financial institution incorporated under the laws of the State of Florida, or

      (3)   Notes secured by first mortgages on real property

Administration;



      (4)   Interest-bearing obligations with a fixed maturity of
any corporation organized under the laws of the United States, any state or
organized territory of the United States and the District of Columbia;
provided that such obligations are rated by at least two (2) nationally
recognized ratings services in any one of the four highest classifications
approved by the Comptroller of the Currency for the investment of funds of
national banks or, if only one nationally recognized ratings service shall
rate such obligations, such ratings service must have rated such obligation
in any one of the three highest rating classifications as set forth in this
subsection;



      (5)   Bonds issued by the State of Israel;



      (6)   Real estate, which may be in the form of commingled
ownership:



      (7)   Common stock, preferred stock and interest-bearing
obligations of domestic corporations having an option to convert into common
stock issued by a corporation organized under the laws of the United States,

portfolio to be held in equities.



      (8)   Foreign securities, not to exceed twenty-five percent
(25%) on a market-value basis of the portfolio. (Ord. No. 10-4-1, §4;
4-13-10)



   (d)   The board shall determine the percentage of each type of
investment to be held.



   (e)   The board shall be authorized to retain one or more money
managers for the management of property held in the plan, and the board make
available the plan assets to such money managers for investment and
reinvestment in accordance with the terms of this ordinance and the
investment policies established by the board. Any such money manager
contracting with the board for the investment of its assets shall be deemed a
fiduciary of the plan.



   (f)   The board shall have a continuing duty to observe and evaluate
the performance of any money manager retained by the board. The board shall,
in selecting a money manager or other investment counsel, exercise all
judgment and care in the circumstances then prevailing which persons of
prudence, discretion and intelligence exercise in the management of their own
affairs.



   (g)   The board shall require that any money manager or other agent
who has custody or control of any property of the plan to keep accurate and
detailed accounts of all investments, receipts, disbursements and other
transactions pertaining to such trust property, and the board shall further
require that all accounts, books and records pertaining thereto be open for
inspecting and audit at all reasonable times by the city, the board or the
designees.



   (h)   The board shall also keep accurate and detailed accounts of
all investments, receipts, disbursements or other transactions pertaining to
the trust property and all accounts, books and records pertaining thereto
shall be open to inspection and audit at all reasonable times by the city or

ARTICLE VII SERVICE RETIREMENTBENEFITS



   (a)   Firefighters may retire on the first day of the month
coincident with or next following the attainment of age fifty (50) and the
completion of ten (10) years of credited service. There shall be no mandatory
retirement age. For members who:



      (1)   made an irrevocable written election by February 13,
2004 to remain in the Plan after the transfer of fire and rescue services to
the Broward County Sheriff's Office and



      (2)   enter normal or disability retirement from the Plan
after the effective date of this amendment, normal retirement eligibility
shall begin on the first day of the month coincident with or next following
the earlier of the attainment of age fifty (50) and the completion of ten
(10) years of credited service, or the completion of twenty-five (25) years
of credited service, without regard to age. This benefit shall be treated as
an extra benefit, as defined by section 175.351, Florida Statutes (2003).
(Ord. No. 01-1-1, § 2, 1-9-01; Ord. No. 04-10-09, §5, 10-26-04)



   (b)   For firefighters the monthly retirement benefit shall be an
amount equal to three (3%) percent of final monthly compensation multiplied
by the number of years of credited service. In the event a member has
combined service as a general employee and firefighter, the benefit shall be
determined using the appropriate multiplier for each completed year and month
in the applicable class of employment and the respective funds shall
coordinate benefits, provided the firefighter attains a vested interest in
this plan.



   (c)   A service retirement benefit shall be payable on the first day
of each month. The benefit shall commence on the first day of the month
coincident with or next following the member's actual retirement and shall
continue until the death of the member.



   (d)   Early retirement shall be available to firefighter members on
the first day of the month coincident with or next following the attainment
of age fifty (50) and the completion of ten (10) years of continuous credited
service.



   (e)   A member electing early retirement may receive either a
deferred payment or an immediate payment under the following formula:



      (1)   A deferred payment shall be equal to the normal
retirement benefit. This shall mean the date upon which the member attains
normal retirement age with ten (10) years of continuous credited service.



      (2)   An immediate retirement benefit may commence on the
first day of the month coincident with or next following the date of early
retirement. The benefit shall be determined for normal retirement and then
actuarially reduced for the number of actual years and months at which the
starting date of the benefit precedes the normal retirement date. The early
retirement reduction is twenty-five hundredths of one (0.25%) percent for
each month at which the early retirement date precedes the normal retirement
date.



   (f)   The payment of the early retirement income shall be subject to
the same conditions as normal retirement income.



   (g)   In the event a member elects early retirement, the benefit
formula in effect on the early retirement date shall be applicable to the
member.



   (h)   A member entitled to a normal or early service retirement
benefit shall have the right at any time prior to the date upon which the
first payment is received to elect to have the benefit payable under one of
the options provided in this plan. A member shall be permitted to revoke any
such election and to elect a new option at any time prior to the receipt of
the first payment. Each retirement option shall be the actuarial equivalent
of the other retirement options available. Election of the retirement option
shall be on a form prescribed by the board.



      (1)   Joint and last survivor option.



         A member may elect to receive a reduced benefit for life
and to have the benefit (or a designated fraction of the benefit) continued
after the member's death and during the lifetime of a designated survivor. A
designated survivor may be any natural person, but need not be the spouse of
the member. In the event that the designated survivor dies before the
member's benefit payments begin, this option shall be canceled automatically
and a retirement income shall be payable to the member as if the election had
never been made. If a member has elected an option with a joint survivor or
designated beneficiary and the member's retirement income benefits have
commenced, such member may thereafter change his designated joint survivor or
beneficiary up to two times as provided in Section 175.333, Florida Statutes,
without the approval of the board of trustees or the current joint survivor
or designated beneficiary. The member need not provide proof of the good
health of the joint survivor or beneficiary being removed, and the joint
survivor or beneficiary being removed need not be living. After any such
change in joint survivor or beneficiary, the member's pension benefit will be
recalculated accordingly by the actuary and retirement income shall be
payable to the member based on the new calculation. (Ord. No.
10-4-1,§5;4-13-10)



      (2)   Ten (10) year certain and life thereafter.



         A member may elect to receive a life annuity with one
hundred twenty (120) guaranteed payments. If the member shall die prior to
receiving one hundred twenty (120) payments, the remaining benefits shall be
paid to the beneficiary designated by the member. In the event that no
beneficiary has been designated, the member's estate shall be the recipient
of the remaining balance of payments. This shall be the normal form of
retirement.



      (3)   Other options.



         The trustees may authorize the payment of the retirement
benefit in any form which is the actuarial equivalent of the other forms of
retirement provided in this plan.



   (i)   Post Retirement Supplemental Benefit. A post-retirement
supplemental benefit shall be established for
members who:



      (1)   made an irrevocable written election by February 13,
2004 to remain in the Plan after the transfer of fire and rescue services to
the Broward County Sheriff's Office and (2) enter normal or disability
retirement from the Plan after the effective date of this amendment.



      The post retirement supplemental benefit shall be paid monthly
upon retirement (including any period of DROP participation) in the amount of
five dollars ($5) per year of completed credited service. This benefit shall
be treated as an extra benefit, as defined by section 175.351, Florida
Statutes (2003).



(Ord. No. 04-10-09, §6, 10-26-04)



   (j)   Thirteenth Check. A contingent cost of living adjustment (a
"13th check") shall be established for members



who:



      (1)   made an irrevocable written election by February 13,
2004 to remain in the Plan after the transfer of fire and rescue services to
the Broward County Sheriff's Office and



      (2)   enter normal or disability retirement from the Plan
after the effective date of this amendment.



         The payment of a 13th check in any year shall be based upon
the cumulative net actuarial gains over the past three (3) year period, as
determined in the annual actuarial valuation report, subject to an overall
limitation in cumulative net actuarial gain not to exceed two percent (2%)
over the plan's assumed rate of investment return. No 13th check shall be
paid in any year in which the plan fails to experience a cumulative net
actuarial gain as determined in the annual actuarial valuation report. In the
event that the cumulative net actuarial gain is insufficient to pay each
eligible member a full monthly benefit, the Board shall distribute the
available funds on a pro-rata basis. In the event that there are more funds
available than required to pay all eligible members in any year, the unused
funds will be absorbed back into the plan. The 13th check shall be paid, if
funds are available, within sixty (60) days after receipt and adoption of the
annual actuarial valuation report by the Board of Trustees. The 13th check
paid to any eligible retiree shall not exceed the retiree's regular monthly
benefit. No retiree shall be eligible for his/her first 13th check until at
least twelve (12) full months have elapsed after the eligible retiree entered
normal or disability retirement without participating in DROP, or for those
retirees who participate in DROP, at least twelve (12) full months have
elapsed after the retiree has completed such participation in DROP; however,
there shall be no retroactive payment to any member who is retired and/or
completed participation in DROP more than twelve (12) months before becoming
eligible. This benefit shall be treated as an extra benefit, as defined by
section 175.351, Florida Statutes (2003).

10-04-01, §6, 4-13-10)



   (a)   Any member of the plan who is employed by the city prior to
entry into military service and who takes a leave of absence for the purpose
of entering into military service in the Armed Forces of the United States
and thereafter re-enters the employ of the city, shall be entitled to
purchase service credits for the period of absence by contributing the amount
that would have been contributed by the member as if the member continued in
city employment for the period of military service based on the salary in
effect on the date of the leave of absence, for each year being purchased.



   (b)   A member who is receiving, or will receive the pension benefit
for military service in any other pension plan supported by public funds, may
not use that service for this pension plan. A member who is receiving, or
will receive any other pension in which time served in the military was used
by the employee in that other pension plan shall not be eligible for military
buy-back as provided in this section.



   (c)   The contribution for military buy-back required of the
employee may be made in one lump sum or may be made by payroll deductions in
installments for a period of time which shall not exceed the number of years
being purchased. An employee making installment payments shall complete all
required payments prior to payment of any benefit under this section. If
installment payments are not completed at the time an employee retires, the
employee shall not receive military credit for the remaining period for which
payments were not made. An employee making installment payments shall pay a
uniform rate of interest as determined by the board.



   (d)   For a Member who has completed ten years of credited service,
as defined in Article II, Section 2-158 herein, the years or fractional parts
of years that such a member served full-time active duty in the military
service of the Armed Forces of the United States, voluntarily or
involuntarily, or performed firefighter service prior to the Member's first
or initial employment with the City, shall be added to the Member's years of
credited service under the following terms and conditions:



      1.   The Member contributes to the Retirement Fund the full
actuarial cost of all service credits purchased hereunder. A Member may make
such contributions as may be required, however, the service purchased shall
not be recognized or credited by the Retirement Fund until the Member has
completed ten years of credited service. If the Member terminates employment
before completing ten years of service, all contributions made by the Member
for prior military or firefighter service shall be refunded to the Member.



      2.   The purchase of credited service under this subsection by
a Member shall be paid in full no later than the December 31st prior to
retirement in accordance with the terms, rules, procedures and regulations
established by the Board of Trustees. If full payment is not made prior to
the December 31st prior to retirement, then the Member, upon retirement,
shall not receive credited service for the actuarial equivalent of the
balance owed.



      3.   For purchase of military service:



         a.   the Member did not receive a dishonorable discharge
from such service from the Armed Forces.



         b.   The Member did not receive credited service for the
time spent in the Armed Forces or other firefighter service from any other
governmental pension system.



      4.   The maximum credit which may be purchased by a Member for
prior military service in the Armed Forces of the United States or other
firefighter service under this section shall not exceed a combined total of
five years.



      5.   Payment for the benefits provided in this section may be
made in one or more of the following manners:



         a)   Cash lump sum payment.



         b)   Direct transfer or rollover of an eligible rollover
distribution from a qualified or eligible plan, in accordance with Article
XII, Section 2-158. (Ord. No. 10-04-01, §6, 4-13-10)



BUY-BACKFOR PRIOR SERVICE



(Ord. No. 10-04-01, §6, 4-13-10)



   (e)   Purchase of early Normal Retirement Date and increased benefit
level. In lieu of the purchase of credited service for prior military or
firefighter services, as provided above, a Member may purchase a Normal
Retirement Date which is up to five (5) years earlier than otherwise provided
for in Article VII, comprised of eligibility for an earlier Normal Retirement
Date combined with an increased benefit level for the Member's credited
service, provided that the Member pays the full actuarial cost thereof under
the following terms and conditions:



      i.   The Member shall contribute to the Retirement Fund the
full actuarial cost of the earlier Normal Retirement Date and increased
benefit level purchased. The Member's payment of such full actuarial cost
shall be made prior to the date that the Member's first monthly pension
benefit payment is due. The earlier Normal Retirement Date and increased
benefit level purchased shall not be recognized or credited by the Retirement
Fund until the Member has made payment of the full actuarial cost and has
entered the DROP, retired, or terminated from employment with at least ten
(10) years of credited service. If the Member terminates employment before
making full payment or completing ten (10) years of service, all
contributions made by the Member for purchase of the earlier Normal
Retirement Date and increased benefit level shall be refunded to the Member.



      ii.   For each month's actuarial equivalent for the increased
benefit level purchased hereunder, the member's multiplier will be increased
by one-quarter of one percent (0.25%) for the final year of credited service.



      iii.   Years and months of earlier Normal Retirement Date
eligibility purchased under this section will be treated as credited service
for the purpose of determining eligibility for Normal Retirement, under
Article VII (a) or entry into DROP, under Article XVI.



      iv.   The maximum equivalent credit which may be purchased by
a Member for an increased benefit level hereunder shall be five (5) years.



      v.   Payment for the earlier Normal Retirement Date and
increased benefit level may be made by one or more of the following manners:



         a.   Lump sum payment.



         b.   Direct transfer or rollover of an eligible rollover
distribution from a qualified or eligible retirement or deferred compensation
plan as defined by the Internal Revenue Service. (Ord. No. 10-04-01, §7,
4-13-10)



ARTICLE IX DISABILITY



   (a)   A member shall be disabled under the terms of the plan if the
member has suffered an illness, injury or disease which renders the member
permanently and totally incapacitated, physically or mentally, from regular
and continuous duty as a firefighter. Disability shall not be determined
based solely on the fact that a member cannot perform all of the duties of
his or her job grouping as set forth in the job description. The city shall
be required to accommodate disabled workers in accordance with state and
federal law and shall not withhold assignment to vacant positions on the
basis that a member is not capable of performing all of the tasks of his or
her job grouping.



   (b)   A member shall be eligible for a service-incurred disability
retirement from the entry date into the plan. A service-incurred disability
retirement shall mean that the disability arose as a result of an act
occurring in the performance of service with the city.



   (c)   A member shall be eligible for a non-service incurred
disability retirement upon the completion of ten (10) years of credited
service. A non-service incurred disability shall be an illness, injury, or
disease, which did not occur as a result of an act in the performance of
service with the city.



   (d)   The service-incurred disability benefit for a firefighter
shall be paid in equal monthly installments in an amount equal to sixty (60%)
percent of the member's final monthly compensation as of the date of
disability retirement, together with any additional accrued benefits in
excess of sixty (60%) percent which have been earned by the member as the
result of additional service.



   (e)   The non-service incurred disability benefit shall be paid on
the same basis as normal retirement in an amount equal to the member's
accrued benefit to date of disability, but shall be not less than twenty-five
(25%) percent of final monthly compensation. For the purposes of a
non-service incurred disability benefit, final monthly compensation shall be
determined as of the last day the member was actively at work for the city.



   (f)   Disability benefits shall be paid on the first day of each
month. No benefit shall be paid until the board of trustees has actually
considered and voted upon entitlement to disability.



   (g)   Disability retirement income shall continue until the death of
the member, or recovery from disability. An employee on disability retirement
may, upon reaching normal retirement age, elect to convert the disability
retirement to a service retirement. In the case of such an election, the
member may receive credited service for the years during which the member was
disabled by contributing to the retirement plan the monies the employee would
have contributed had the employee remained continuously in service. In the
case of such an election, average compensation shall be based upon salary
being paid to member at the time of disability. In the event of the death of
a member who is retired on a disability benefit, and has not received
payments equal to the value of the member's accumulated contributions, the
remaining unpaid benefits shall be paid to a designated beneficiary selected
by the member and communicated to the board on the form prescribed by the
board. In the event that there is no designated beneficiary, the remaining
unpaid benefits shall be paid to the estate of the deceased member. During
the period of disability, member contributions shall be suspended unless the
member is receiving a pay supplement in addition to disability benefits
provided under the Florida Workers' Compensation Act. In such event, there
shall be a member contribution from that amount representing the supplemental
pay. In the event a member's disability is converted to a service retirement
as set forth in this section, the member shall be accorded credited service
for the period of disability.



   (h)   The board of trustees shall have the continuing right to
require disabled members to submit to a medical examination to determine that
the member remains disabled. In order for a member to be deemed recovered,
the medical committee must recommend to the board of trustees that the member
has sufficiently recovered to again engage in the duties of a firefighter,
and that the city has certified that it has a position within the city
available for the member consistent with the member's medical condition.



   (i)   Upon finding that a member is no longer disabled, the member
shall return to work for the city at the same rank and position previously
occupied and shall be placed into the appropriate step in the pay plan which
the member would have occupied but for the disability. The member shall again
become an active member of the plan but shall receive no credited service for
any period of time in which the member was receiving disability benefits. If
the member declines re-employment within the city, the member shall be deemed
to have terminated employment on the date that the disability benefit
commenced.



   (j)   No member shall be eligible to receive disability benefits
from the retirement plan during any period of time that the member is
receiving a salary from the city. This section shall not apply to the receipt
of worker's compensation benefits.



   (k)   Application for disability retirement shall be made on a form
prescribed by the board of trustees. The member shall execute such medical
releases as are necessary to permit the board of trustees to review the
medical records needed to determine the question of disability and to discuss
said records at a public meeting. Upon receipt of an application for
disability, the board shall appoint a medical committee to be composed of not
less than one nor more than three licensed physicians. The applicant for
disability shall be required to submit to examination by the medical
committee. The medical committee shall report its findings to the board of
the trustees which shall include a determination, to the extent reasonably
possible, the origin of the disability, whether the disability is permanent,
and whether the disability is total. In making that determination, the
medical committee shall be bound by the definition of disability set forth in
this plan.



   (l)   Upon receipt of the report of the medical committee, the
trustees shall schedule a public hearing at which time the board shall review
all reports of the medical committee, together with any such documentary
evidence as the applicant may wish to submit. The board shall conduct a
preliminary determination as to whether the member is permanently and totally
disabled based upon the written documentation presented. If the board does
not grant the application based on the written documentation, it shall inform
the member in writing of the reasons for the denial of the application. The
member may, within thirty (30) days of receipt of the board's preliminary
denial, request a full evidentiary hearing before the board. Said hearing
will be conducted consistent with the principles of due process and the rules
of evidence generally applicable to administrative proceedings shall apply.
The board shall have the power to issue subpoenas compelling the attendance
of witnesses. At said hearing the applicant may present such oral and written
evidence as the applicant deems necessary to establish his or her burden of
proof. The board may appoint special counsel as an advocate to cross-examine
witnesses and to offer argument in opposition to the application. The
attorney for the board shall not serve both as advocate and as advisor to the
board in the same proceeding. The applicant and the board shall have the
right to examine and cross-examine all witnesses. The decision of the board
shall be based solely upon the evidence presented and the law applicable to
this plan. Following the conclusion of the hearing, the board shall render an
opinion in writing setting forth the reasons for the grant or denial of the
benefit. In the event that the disability benefit is denied, the applicant
shall have the right to judicial review by complaint for common law
certiorari in the Circuit Court of Broward County.



   (m)   The board of trustees may prescribe rules of procedure to
implement the provisions of this plan relating to the conduct of disability
hearings.



   (n)   No member shall be granted a disability pension upon a
determination by the board that the disability resulted from:



      (1)   Excessive and habitual use of drugs, intoxicants or
narcotics;



      (2)   Injury or disease sustained while willfully and
illegally participating in fights, riots, civil insurrections or while
committing a crime;



      (3)   Intentionally self-inflicted wounds, injuries or
ailments;



      (4)   Any occurrence arising from compensable employment
unrelated to regular city employment.



ARTICLE X VESTING AND TERMINATION



   (a)   Except as otherwise provided in this section, all rights to
benefits under this plan shall terminate when a member's employment
terminates for any reason other than normal service retirement, early service
retirement, or disability retirement. Any member who completes ten (10) years
of credited service and whose contributions remain in the plan has a vested
right to accrued benefits from the plan. No member who has completed less
than ten (10) years of credited service shall have a vested interest in any
accrued benefit.



   (b)   A member who shall leave the service of the city prior to the
completion of ten (10) years of service shall receive a refund of accumulated
contributions, with interest thereon. The return of such contributions shall
operate as a release and discharge of the City of Cooper City and the
retirement plan from the right to any other benefits from the plan.



   (c)   A member who shall leave the service of the city prior to
eligibility for normal service retirement or early service retirement, but
who has completed ten (10) years of credited service shall be entitled to
receive retirement benefits commencing at the regular normal service
retirement date. Such benefits will be based on final monthly compensation
and credited service as of the date of termination. Benefits may also be paid
at the member's early retirement date; provided, however, that the benefit
shall be subject to the early retirement reduction.



   (d)   Every member shall have the right to elect to receive, in lieu
of all benefits under the plan, a return of the member's accumulated
contributions, with interest.



   (e)   A member who elects a lump sum return of contributions
releases and discharges the City of Cooper City and the retirement plan from
the right to any other benefits from the plan.



ARTICLE XI DEATH BENEFITS



   (a)   In the event of the death of a member prior to the time of
becoming fully vested for early or normal retirement, the member's designated
beneficiary shall be paid from the fund an amount equal to the member's
accumulated contributions together with interest thereon. In the event that
the member was fully vested for early or normal retirement, but died before
actual retirement, a death benefit shall be paid from the fund to the
beneficiary. The amount of the benefit shall be computed as though the member
had retired on the date of death and had chosen the one hundred (100%)
percent joint and survivor option. The board may, in its discretion, pay the
benefit in another form if the board deems it to be in the best interest of
the beneficiary. The actuarial value of any other form of benefit may not
exceed the actuarial value of the one hundred (100%) percent joint and last
survivor option.



   (b)   In the event of the death of a retiree, death benefits, if
any, shall be paid in accordance with the optional form of benefit chosen at
the time of retirement



   (c)   In the event that a designated beneficiary predeceases the
member, or in the case of dissolution of marriage where the spouse is the
designated beneficiary, the member may designate a new beneficiary as set
forth in this subsection. No replacement beneficiary may receive a benefit
which is greater than the actuarial equivalent of the benefit which would
have been paid to the person named as designated beneficiary at the time of
retirement. In the case of re-marriage, the spouse must have been married to
the member for at least one (1) year prior to the death of member to qualify
for benefits under this subsection.



ARTICLE XII COMPLIANCE WITH THE INT ERNAI REVENUE CODE



   It is the intention of the City and of the Board that the Plan remain
at all times a qualified plan, as that term is defined under the Internal
Revenue Code



   (a)   Maximum Pension. Notwithstanding any provision of this Plan to
the contrary, the Annual Pension that is accrued by or paid to a participant
shall not exceed the Dollar Limitation set forth below. If the benefit the
participant would otherwise accrue in a Limitation Year would produce an
Annual Pension in excess of the Dollar Limitation, the benefit shall be
limited to a benefit that does not exceed the Dollar Limitation.



      (1)   Definitions Used in this Section



         (A)   "Annual Pension" means the benefits received by a
participant under this Plan expressed in the form of a straight life annuity.
In determining whether benefits payable exceed the Dollar Limitation set
forth below, benefits payable in any form other than a straight life annuity
shall be adjusted to the larger of:



            (i)   The annual amount of the straight life
annuity (if any) payable to the participant under the plan commencing at the
same annuity starting date as the form of benefit payable to the participant;
or



            (ii)   The annual amount of the straight life
annuity commencing at the same annuity starting date that has the same
actuarial present value as the form of benefit payable to the participant,
computed using a 5 percent interest assumption and the applicable mortality
table described in §1.417(e)-1(d)(2) for that annuity starting date.



         No actuarial adjustment to the benefit shall be made for
benefits that are not directly related to retirement benefits (such as a
qualified disability benefit, preretirement incidental death benefits, and
postretirement medical benefits); or the inclusion in the form of benefit of
an automatic benefit increase feature, provided the form of benefit is not
subject to §417(e)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code and would otherwise
satisfy the limitations of this Subsection (a), and the amount payable under
the form of benefit in any Limitation Year shall not exceed the limits of
this Subsection (a) applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in
subsequent years pursuant to § 415(d) of the Code. For this purpose, an
automatic benefit increase feature is included in a form of benefit if the
form of benefit provides for automatic, periodic increases to the benefits
paid in that form.



         (B)   "Dollar Limitation" means $160,000 (subject to the
annual adjustments provided under Section 415(d) of the IRC). Said amount
shall be adjusted based on the age of the participant when benefits begin, as
follows:



            (i)   Except with respect to a participant who is
a "Qualified Participant" as defined in Section 415(b)(2)(H) of the Code, for
benefits (except survivor and disability benefits as defined in Section
415(b)(2)(I) of the Code) beginning before age 62 the Age-Adjusted Dollar
Limitation is equal to the lesser of—



               (I)   the actuarial equivalent of the annual
amount of a straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date
that has the same actuarial present value as a deferred straight life annuity
commencing at age 62, where annual payments under the straight life annuity
commencing at age 62 are equal to the Dollar Limitation (as adjusted pursuant
to section 415(d) for the limitation year), and where the actuarially
equivalent straight life annuity is computed using a 5 percent interest rate
and the applicable mortality table under §1.417(e)-1(d)(2) that is effective
for that annuity starting date (and expressing the participant's age based on
completed calendar months as of the annuity starting date); and



               (II)   the Dollar Limitation (as adjusted
pursuant to section 415(d)) multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of
the straight life annuity under the plan to the annual amount of the straight
life annuity under the plan commencing at age 62, with both annual amounts
determined without applying the rules of section 415.



            (ii)   For benefits beginning after the age of 65,
the age-adjusted Dollar Limitation is equal to the lesser of:



               (I)   the actuarial equivalent of the annual
amount of a straight life annuity commencing at the annuity starting date
that has the same actuarial present value as a straight life annuity
commencing at age 65, where annual payments under the straight life annuity
commencing at age 65 are equal to the dollar limitation of section
415(b)(1)(A) (as adjusted pursuant to section 415(d) for the limitation
year), and where the actuarially equivalent straight life annuity is computed
using a 5 percent interest rate and the applicable mortality table under
§1.417(e)-1(d)(2) that is effective for that annuity starting date (and
expressing the participant's age based on completed calendar months as of the
annuity starting date); and



               (II)   the section 415(b)(1)(A) Dollar
limitation (as adjusted pursuant to section 415(d) and §1.415(d)-1 for the
limitation year) multiplied by the ratio of the annual amount of the adjusted
immediately commencing straight life annuity under the plan to the adjusted
age 65 straight life annuity. The adjusted immediately commencing straight
life annuity means the annual amount of the immediately commencing straight
life annuity payable to the participant, computed disregarding the
participant's accruals after age 65 but including actuarial adjustments even
if those actuarial adjustments are applied to offset accruals. For this
purpose, the annual amount of the immediately commencing straight life
annuity is determined without applying the rules of section 415. The adjusted
age 65 straight life annuity means the annual amount of the straight life
annuity that would be payable under the plan to a hypothetical participant
who is 65 years old and has the same accrued benefit (with no actuarial
increases for commencement after age 65) as the participant receiving the
distribution (determined disregarding the participant's accruals after age 65
and without applying the rules of section 415).



            (iii)   There shall be no age adjustment of the
Dollar Limitation with respect to benefits beginning between the ages of 62
and 65.



      (2)   The limitations set forth in this Subsection (a) shall
not apply if the Annual Pension does not exceed $10,000 provided the
participant has never participated in a Defined Contribution Plan maintained
by the City.



      (3)   Cost-of-living adjustments in the Dollar Limitation for
benefits shall be limited to scheduled annual increases determined by the
Secretary of the Treasury under Subsection 415(d) of the Code.



      (4)   In the case of a participant who has fewer than 10 years
of participation in the Plan, the Dollar Limitation set forth in Paragraph
(1)(B) of this Subsection (a) shall be multiplied by a fraction - (i) the
numerator of which is the number of years (or part thereof) of participation
in the Plan, and (ii) the denominator of which is 10.



      (5)   Any portion of a participant's benefit that is
attributable to mandatory employee contributions (unless picked-up by the
City) or rollover contributions, shall be taken into account in the manner
prescribed in the regulations under Section 415 of the Code.



      (6)   Should any participant participate in more than one
defined benefit plan maintained by the City, in any case in which the
participant's benefits under all such defined benefit plans (determined as of
the same age) would exceed the Dollar Limitation applicable at that age, the
accrual of the participant's benefit under this Plan shall be reduced so that
the participant's combined benefits will equal the Dollar Limitation.



      (7)   For a participant who has or will have distributions
commencing at more than one annuity starting date, the Annual Benefit shall
be determined as of each such annuity starting date (and shall satisfy the
limitations of this Section as of each such date), actuarially adjusting for
past and future distributions of benefits commencing at the other annuity
starting dates. For this purpose, the determination of whether a new starting
date has occurred shall be made without regard to § 1.401(a)-20, Q&A 10(d),
and with regard to § 1.415(b)1(b)(1)(iii)(B) and (C) of the Income Tax
Regulations.



      (8)   The determination of the Annual Pension under Paragraph
(a)(1) of this Subsection (a) shall take into account (in the manner
prescribed by the regulations under Section 415 of the Code) social security
supplements described in § 411(a)(9) of the Internal Revenue Code and
benefits transferred from another defined benefit plan, other than transfers
of distributable benefits pursuant § 1.411(d)-4, Q&A-3(c) of the Income Tax
Regulations.



      (9)   The above limitations are intended to comply with the
provisions of Section 415 of the Code, as amended, so that the maximum
benefits provided by plans of the City shall be exactly equal to the maximum
amounts allowed under Section 415 of the Code and regulations thereunder. If
there is any discrepancy between the provisions of this Subsection (a) and
the provisions of Section 415 of the Code and regulations thereunder, such
discrepancy shall be resolved in such a way as to give full effect to the
provisions of Section 415 of the Code. The value of any benefits forfeited as
a result of the application of this Subsection (a) shall be used to decrease
future employer contributions.



      (10)   For the purpose of applying the limitations set forth
in Sections 401(a)(17) and 415 of the Internal Revenue Code, Earnings shall
include any elective deferral (as defined in Code Section 402(g)(3) of the
Internal Revenue Code), and any amount which is contributed or deferred by
the employer at the election of the Member and which is not includible in the
gross income of the Member by reason of Section 125 or 457 of the Internal
Revenue Code. For limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2001,
for the purposes of applying the limitations described in this Subsection (a)
of Section 42-33, compensation paid or made available during such limitation
years shall include elective amounts that are not includible in the gross
income of the Member by reason of Section 132(f)(4) of the Internal Revenue
Code.



   (b)   Required Beginning Date:



   Notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan, payment of a
participant's retirement benefits under the Plan shall commence not later
than the participant's Required Beginning Date, which is defined as the later
of:



   April 1 of the calendar year that next follows the calendar year in
which the participant attains or will attain the age of 70 1/2 years; or



   April 1 of the calendar year that next follows the calendar year in
which the participant retires.



   (c)   Required Minimum Distributions.



      (1)   Required Beginning Date. The participant's entire
interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the participant
no later than the participant's Required Beginning Date as defined in
Subsection (b) of this Article XII.



      (2)   Death of participant Before Distributions Begin.



         (A)   If the participant dies before distributions
begin, the participant's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be
distributed, no later than as follows:



            (i)   If the participant's surviving spouse is the
participant's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the
surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately
following the calendar year in which the participant died, or by December 31
of the calendar year in which the participant would have attained age 70 1/2,
if later.



            (ii)   If the participant's surviving spouse is
not the participant's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the
designated beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year
immediately following the calendar year in which the participant died.



            (iii)   If there is no designated beneficiary as
of September 30 of the year following the year of the participant's death,
the participant's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the
calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the participant's death.



         (B)   The participant's entire interest shall be
distributed as follows:



            (i)   participant Survived by Designated
Beneficiary. If the participant dies before the date distribution of his or
her interest begins and there is a designated beneficiary, the participant's
entire interest will be distributed, beginning no later than the time
described in Subparagraph (2)(A) above, over the life of the designated
beneficiary or over a period certain not exceeding:



               (I)   unless the annuity starting date is
before the first distribution calendar year, the life expectancy of the
designated beneficiary determined using the beneficiary's age as of the
beneficiary's birthday in the calendar year immediately following the
calendar year of the participant's death; or



               (II)   if the annuity starting date is
before the first distribution calendar year, the life expectancy of the
designated beneficiary determined using the beneficiary's age as of the
beneficiary's birthday in the calendar year that contains the annuity
starting date.



            (ii)   No Designated Beneficiary. If the
participant dies before the date distributions begin and there is no
designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of
the participant's death, distribution of the participant's entire interest
will be completed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth
anniversary of the participant's death.



         (C)   Death of Surviving Spouse Before Distributions to
Surviving Spouse Begin. In any case in which (i) the participant dies before
the date distribution of his or her interest begins, (ii) the participant's
surviving spouse is the participant's sole designated beneficiary, and (iii)
the surviving spouse dies before distributions to the surviving spouse begin,
Subparagraphs (2)(A) and 2(B) above shall apply as though the surviving
spouse were the participant.



      (3)   Requirements For Annuity Distributions That Commence
During participant's Lifetime.



         (A)   Joint Life Annuities Where the Beneficiary Is Not
the participant's Spouse. If the participant's interest is being distributed
in the form of a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the
participant and a nonspousal beneficiary, annuity payments to be made on or
after the participant's Required Beginning Date to the designated beneficiary
after the participant's death must not at any time exceed the applicable
percentage of the annuity payment for such period that would have been
payable to the participant using the table set forth in Q&A-2 of Section
1.401(a)(9)-6T of the Treasury regulations. If the form of distribution
combines a joint and survivor annuity for the joint lives of the participant
and a nonspousal beneficiary and a period certain annuity, the requirement in
the preceding sentence will apply to annuity payments to be made to the
designated beneficiary after the expiration of the period certain.



         (B)   Period Certain Annuities. Unless the participant's
spouse is the sole designated beneficiary and the form of distribution is a
period certain and no life annuity, the period certain for an annuity
distribution commencing during the participant's lifetime may not exceed the
applicable distribution period for the participant under the Uniform Lifetime
Table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations for the
calendar year that contains the annuity starting date. If the annuity
starting date precedes the year in which the participant reaches age 70, the
applicable distribution period for the participant is the distribution period
for age 70 under the Uniform Lifetime Table set forth in Section
1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury regulations plus the excess of 70 over the age
of the participant as of the participant's birthday in the year that contains
the annuity starting date. If the participant's spouse is the participant's
sole designated beneficiary and the form of distribution is a period certain
and no life annuity, the period certain may not exceed the longer of the
participant's applicable distribution period, as determined under this
Subparagraph (3)(B), or the joint life and last survivor expectancy of the
participant and the participant's spouse as determined under the Joint and
Last Survivor Table set forth in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury
regulations, using the participant's and spouse's attained ages as of the
participant's and spouse's birthdays in the calendar year that contains the
annuity starting date.



      (4)   Form of Distribution. Unless the participant's interest
is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company
or in a single sum on or before the Required Beginning Date, as of the first
distribution calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with
Subparagraphs (4)(A), (4)(B) and (4)(C) below. If the participant's interest
is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company,
distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of
Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and the Treasury regulations. Any part of the
participant's interest which is in the form of an individual account
described in Section 414(k) of the Code will be distributed in a manner
satisfying the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and the Treasury
regulations that apply to individual accounts.



         (A)   General Annuity Requirements. If the participant's
interest is paid in the form of annuity distributions under the Plan,
payments under the annuity will satisfy the following requirements:



            (i)   the annuity distributions will be paid in
periodic payments made at intervals not longer than one year;



            (ii)   the distribution period will be over a life
(or lives) or over a period certain, not longer than the distribution period
described in Paragraphs 2 or 3 above, whichever is applicable, of this
Subsection (c) ;



            (iii)   once payments have begun over a period
certain, the period certain will not be changed even if the period certain is
shorter than the maximum permitted;



            (iv)   payments will either be non-increasing or
increase only as follows:



               (I)   by an annual percentage increase that
does not exceed the annual percentage increase in a cost-of-living index that
is based on prices of all items and issued by the Bureau of Labor Statistics;



               (II)   to the extent of the reduction in the
amount of the participant's payments to provide for a survivor benefit upon
death, but only if the beneficiary whose life was being used to determine the
distribution period dies or is no longer the participant's beneficiary
pursuant to a qualified domestic relations order within the meaning of
Section 414(p) of the Code;



               (III)   to provide cash refunds of employee
contributions upon the participant's death; or



               (IV)   to pay increased benefits that result
from a Plan amendment.



         (B)   Amount Required to be Distributed by Required
Beginning Date. The amount that must be distributed on or before the
participant's Required Beginning Date (or, if the participant dies before
distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under
Subparagraph (2)(A)(i) or (2)(A)(ii), whichever is applicable) is the payment
that is required for one payment interval. The second payment need not be
made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval
ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which
payments are received, e.g., bi-monthly, monthly, semi-annually, or annually.
All of the participant's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first
distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount
of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the
participant's Required Beginning Date.



         (C)   Additional Accruals After First Distribution
Calendar Year. Any additional benefits accruing to the participant in a
calendar year after the first distribution calendar year will be distributed
beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year
immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues.



      (5)   For purposes of this Subsection (c), distributions are
considered to begin on the participant's Required Beginning Date. If annuity
payments irrevocably commence to the participant (or to the participant's
Surviving Spouse) before the participant's Required Beginning Date (or, if to
the participant's Surviving Spouse, before the date distributions are
required to begin in accordance with Subparagraph (2)(A) above), the date
distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually
commence.



      (6)   Definitions.



         (A)   Designated beneficiary. The individual who is
designated as the beneficiary under the Plan and is the designated
beneficiary under Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and Section 1.401(a)(9)-1,
Q&A-4, of the Treasury regulations.



         (B)   Distribution calendar year. A calendar year for
which a minimum distribution is required. For distributions beginning before
the participant's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar
year immediately preceding the calendar year which contains the participant's
Required Beginning Date. For distributions beginning after the participant's
death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year in which
distributions are required to begin pursuant to Paragraph (2) of this
Subsection (c).



         (C)   Life expectancy. Life expectancy as computed by
use of the Single Life Table in Section 1.401(a)(9)-9 of the Treasury
regulations.



   (d)



      (1)   Notwithstanding any provision of the Plan to the
contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election, a distributee
may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the Administrator, to
have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an
eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover.



      (2)   Definitions



   The following definitions apply to this Subsection:



      (A)   Eligible rollover distribution: An eligible rollover
distribution is any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the
credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does
not include:



         (i)   any distribution that is one of a series of
substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually)
made for the life (or life expectancy) of the distributee or the joint lives
(or joint life expectancies) of the distributee and the distributee's
designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of10 years or more;



         (ii)   any distribution to the extent such distribution
is required under Section 401(a)(9) of the Code;



         (iii)   the portion of any distribution that is a
hardship distribution described in Section 401(k)(2)(B)(i)(IV) of the Code;
and



         (iv)   the portion of any distribution that is not
includible in gross income (determined without regard to the exclusion for
net unrealized appreciation with respect to employer securities), provided
that a portion of a distribution shall not fail to be an eligible rollover
distribution merely because the portion consists of after-tax Employee
contributions which are not includible in gross income. However, such portion
may be transferred only to an individual retirement account or annuity
described in Section408(a) or (b) of the Code, or to a qualified defined
contribution plan described in Section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Code that
agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred, including separately
accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross
income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible.



      (3)   Eligible retirement plan: An eligible retirement plan is
an individual retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the Code, an
individual retirement annuity described in Section408(b) of the Code, an
annuity plan described in Section403(a) of the Code, an annuity contract
described in Section403(b) of the Code, a qualified trust described in
Section 401 (a) of the Code, an eligible plan under Section457(b) of the Code
which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any
agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state and
which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan
from this Plan, or a Roth IRA (subject to the limitations of Code
Section408A(c)(3)) that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover
distribution.



      (4)   Distributee: A distributee includes an Employee or
former Employee. In addition, the Employee's or former Employee's surviving
spouse and the Employee's or former Employee's spouse or former spouse who is
the alternate payee under a qualified domestic relations order, as defined in
Section 414(p) of the Code, are distributees with regard to the interest of
the spouse or former spouse. Furthermore, effective January 1, 2007, a
surviving designated beneficiary as defined in Section 401(a)(9)(E) of the
Code who is not the surviving spouse and who elects a direct rollover to an
individual retirement account described in Section408(a) of the Code or an
individual retirement annuity described in Section408(b) of the Code shall be
considered a distributee.



      (5)   Direct rollover: A direct rollover is a payment by the
Plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee.



   (e)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this Plan, the maximum
amount of any mandatory distribution, as defined in Section 401(a)(31) of the
Code, payable under the Plan shall be $1000.



   (f)   Compensation Limitations Under 401(a)(17):



   In addition to other applicable limitations set forth in the Plan, and
notwithstanding any other provision of the Plan to the contrary, the annual
compensation of each participant taken into account under the Plan shall not
exceed the EGTRRA annual compensation limit for limitation years beginning
after December 31, 2001. The EGTRRA annual compensation limit is $200,000, as
adjusted by the Commissioner for increases in the cost of living in
accordance with Section 401(a)(17)(B) of the Code. The cost-of-living
adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to any period, not exceeding
12 months, over which Compensation is determined (determination period)
beginning in such calendar year. If a determination period consists of fewer
than12 months, the EGTRRA annual compensation limit will be multiplied by a
fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the determination
period, and the denominator of which is 12.



   Any reference in the Plan to the limitation under Section 401 (a)(17)
of the Code shall mean the EGTRRA annual compensation limit set forth in this
provision.



   (g)   At no time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under
the plan with respect to members and their spouses or beneficiaries, shall
any part of the corpus or income of the fund be used for or diverted to any
purpose other than for their exclusive benefit. (Ord. No. 10-04-01, §9,
4-13-10)



ARTICLE XIII AMENDMENT OR TERMINATION OF THE SYSTEM



   (a)   It is the intention of the city and the board that this
pension plan shall constitute an irrevocable trust and no portion of the
assets may revert to the employer until all other obligations of the plan,
including the payment to the last surviving member and beneficiary has been
paid.



   (b)   In the event of termination or partial termination of the
plan, each participant's accrued pension benefit shall become nonforfeitable
(100 percent vested). The board shall determine the date of distribution and
the asset value required to fund all nonforfeitable benefits after taking
into account the expenses of such distribution. The board shall inform the
then current Plan sponsor if additional assets are required in which event
the then current Plan sponsor shall continue to financially support the
pension plan until all nonforfeitable benefits have been funded. At such
time, the funds shall be appropriated and distributed in accordance with the
provisions of chapter 175, Florida Statutes.



(Ord. No. 10-04-01, §10, 4-13-10)



ARTICLE XIV DISTRIBUTION OF MARITAL INTERESTS IN THE PLAN



   (a)   In the event that the board is served with a domestic
relations order or other legal process purporting to require the payment of
any portion of a member's benefit to another person as a result of a
dissolution of marriage, the board shall cause such order to be reviewed to
determine compliance with the provisions of the plan.



   (b)   The board of trustees shall be authorized to intervene in any
such dissolution of marriage proceeding to ensure that such domestic
relations order is otherwise consistent with the distribution of an interest
in a public employees retirement plan under state law.



   (c)   Any cost associated with the modification or correction of
such domestic relations orders shall be the responsibility of the plan member.



ARTICLE XV MISCELLANEOUS



   (a)   The present or future right of a person to money in the
pension fund or to a retirement allowance, an optional allowance, a death
benefit, the return of contributions, or any other right accrued or accruing
under the provisions of this plan shall not be assignable and shall not be
subject to execution, garnishment, attachment, the operation of bankruptcy or
insolvency law or any other process of law whatsoever, except with respect to
alimony, child support or medical payments to a former spouse. The Board of
Trustees may, upon the written request of the retiree of the pension plan,
authorize the plan administrator to withhold from the retirement payment
those funds that are necessary to pay for premiums for accident, health, and
long-term care insurance for the retiree and the retiree's spouse and
dependents. The pension plan, and its Board of Trustees, shall not incur any
liability for participation in this permissive program should its actions be
taken in good faith. (Ord. No. 10-04-01, §11, 4-13-10)



   (b)   The board shall have the power to examine into the facts upon
which any pension has been granted under any prior or existing law or which
may be granted in the future or obtained erroneously, fraudulently, or
illegally for any reason. The board is empowered to purge the pension rolls
of any person who has been granted a pension under a prior or existing law,
or who is hereafter granted a benefit under this ordinance if the granting of
that pension is found to be erroneous, fraudulent, or illegal for any reason;
and to reclassify any pensioner who has under any prior or existing law or
who may under this ordinance be erroneously, improperly or illegally
classified.



   (c)   Should any change or error in retirement system records be
discovered or result in any member or beneficiary receiving from the
retirement plan more or less than he or she would have been entitled to
receive had the records been correct, the board shall have the power to
correct such error and, as far as possible, adjust the payments in such a
manner that the actuarial equivalent of a benefit to which such member or
beneficiary was correctly entitled shall be paid.



   (d)   If any member or beneficiary is a minor or is under any other
legal disability, the board of trustees shall have the power to withhold
payment of benefits until the board is presented with proof satisfactory to
the board of the appointment of a guardian. If the board becomes aware that
any member or beneficiary is incapable of personally receiving and giving a
valid receipt for any payment due under the plan, the board shall cause
notice to be given to that participant or beneficiary of a hearing to
determine whether said benefits should continue to be paid until the
appointment of a guardian. During the pendency of any such hearing, however,
the board may continue to pay benefits to the member or beneficiary and that
such payment shall be a complete discharge of any liability under the plan
for such payment.



   (e)   Members entitled to a pension shall not forfeit same upon
dismissal from the city, but shall be retired as herein described.



   (f)   Premium Tax Revenues/Supplemental Retirement Benefit. The City
and the membership, as represented by the IAFF agree that all new benefits,
enacted in connection with the BSO merger, are "extra" pension benefits as
defined in section 175.351, Florida Statutes (2003). The City and the
membership, as represented by the IAFF, have agreed that all current excess
premium tax revenues will be used to fund these additional "extra" benefits.



   The City and the membership, as represented by the IAFF, agree that all
additional premium tax revenues (after the extra benefits enacted in
connection with the Memorandum of Understanding between the city and the IAFF
dated October 26, 2004, have been fully funded) will be used to pay a
supplemental retirement benefit as set forth below. The city shall continue
to fund the additional actuarial cost (above the currently available premium
tax revenues and the supplemental employee contributions) of the extra
benefits, provided however, it may reduce its contributions to fund the extra
benefits as premium tax revenues increase up to the full cost of the extra
benefits. When these extra benefits are fully funded, future additional
premium tax monies received thereafter shall be used to fund the supplemental
retirement benefit set forth below. This supplemental retirement benefit
shall not be funded until there is sufficient premium tax money to fund the
entire cost of the extra benefits.



   There is hereby created a supplemental retirement benefit to be paid
pro rata to all members who made an irrevocable written election to remain in
the plan prior to the merger of services with BSO and who thereafter enter
normal or disability retirement from the plan (hereinafter "eligible
members"). The supplemental retirement benefit shall be funded exclusively
with additional premium tax monies. The supplemental retirement benefit under
this section shall not be paid unless and until there are sufficient
additional premium tax monies to fully fund the cost of extra benefits.



   Once it is determined by the pension board, in consultation with its
actuary, that the cost of extra benefits has been fully funded with
additional premium tax monies, the value of any remaining additional premium
tax monies shall be calculated annually. Each member shall thereafter receive
an annual supplemental retirement benefit, in an amount equal to the quotient
of: the total amount of all additional premium tax revenues received by the
plan during that calendar year, regardless of the year to which the revenues
relate, divided by the number of eligible members (hereinafter the "pro rata
allocation"). Entitlement to supplemental retirement benefits shall be
determined annually, but supplemental retirement benefit payments under this
section may only be paid to eligible members who have retired and commenced
receipt of normal or disability retirement benefits. The pro rata allocation,
if any, for eligible members who have not retired and commenced receipt of
normal or disability retirement benefits shall be held in trust by the plan,
until the eligible member has entered normal or disability retirement. After
commencement of retirement benefits, each eligible member shall receive a
lump sum balance of any accumulated pro rata allocations and shall thereafter
receive annual pro rata allocations during the member's lifetime.



   The city and the membership, as represented by the IAFF, agree that,
unless state law provides otherwise, the city will not obtain any credit or
offset for funding any part of the extra benefits in advance of the
availability of sufficient premium tax revenues to fully fund such benefits.
However, the city and the membership, as represented by the IAFF, agree that
in the event there is a change in state law (or the Division of Retirement's
interpretation of state law) that permits the city to obtain a credit or
offset against future premium tax increases for its previous funding of the
extra benefits in advance of the availability of sufficient premium tax
revenues to fully fund the extra benefits, then the city may immediately
begin receiving an offset or credit from previous tax revenue increases from
the city's previous funding of the extra benefits. In the event that the city
begins receiving such offsets or credits from future increases to premium tax
revenue as stated in this section, then from that point forward, additional
increased premium tax revenues shall be split on an annual basis at a rate of
70% - 30%.



   The 70% portion of that split shall be used each year to fund the extra
benefits and/or to provide an offset/ credit to the city for its prior
funding of the extra benefits in years before the premium tax revenues become
available to fully fund the extra benefits. The remaining 30% of the split
shall be used each year to create the supplemental retirement benefit set
forth above for eligible members who elected to stay in the plan.



   The city and the membership, as represented by the IAFF, also agree
that in the event that future express premium tax revenues reach an amount
that will fully fund the extra benefits and the city has recovered all funds
it has previously advanced to fund the extra benefits before the extra
benefits became fully funded by future excess premium tax revenues, then the
70% - 30% split of the further additional excess premium tax revenues will
stop and thereafter 100% of any new additional excess premium tax revenues
will be devoted to this supplemental retirement.



ARTICLE XVI BAC-DROP



   Benefit Actuarially Calculated Deferred Retirement Option Plan
(BAC-DROP).



   (a)   A benefit actuarially calculated deferred retirement option
plan (BAC-DROP) is hereby created.



   (b)   The purpose of this option is to permit the immediate
separation from service with the opportunity to receive a partial lump sum
distribution of benefits payable under this plan. To accomplish this purpose,
the BAC-DROP shall allow a member to receive a partial lump sum distribution,
with a lower monthly annuity, which shall take into account the actuarial
impact of the lump sum distribution on the actuarial value of the member's
benefits under this plan.



   (c)   Any member who is eligible for normal retirement may elect to
participate in the BAC-DROP.



   (d)   The amount of the BAC-DROP may not exceed the amount of
benefits payable over twenty-four (24) months. A member may elect a smaller
amount.



   (e)   A member shall elect the form of retirement payment set forth
in the plan together with the number of months of BAC-DROP participation. The
member's remaining monthly benefit shall be re-calculated to be the actuarial
equivalent of the payment which would have been received had the member not
elected participation in the BAC-DROP.



   (f)   Election to participate in the BAC-DROP may be made at any
time after a member reaches eligibility for normal retirement.



   (g)   Distribution from the BAC-DROP must commence not later than
six (6) months following separation from service. Distribution may take any
of the forms approved for the DROP provided for in this plan.



   (h)   A member electing the BAC-DROP shall separate employment with
the city prior the first day of the month immediately following election to
participate in the BAC-DROP.



   (i)   The board of trustees may promulgate uniform rules for the
implementation of this section.



(Ord. No. 2000-1-13, § 2, 1-25-2000)



ARTICLE XVII DEFERRED RETIREMENT OPTION PLAN



   (a)   Any active fire fighter may participate in the DROP pursuant
to the requirements of this section. All applications for DROP shall be in
writing on the form promulgated by the board.



   A member is eligible to participate in DROP on the first day of the
month following the attainment of normal retirement age. In the event the
member has completed less than fifteen (15) years of credited service at the
time of initial eligibility for normal retirement, the entry into the DROP
must commence not later than the first day of the month following the
completion of fifteen (15) years of credited service. For members who:



      (1)   made an irrevocable written election by February 13,
2004 to remain in the Plan after the transfer of fire and rescue services to
the Broward County Sheriff's Office and



      (2)   enter normal or disability retirement from the Plan
after the effective date of this amendment, the member shall be eligible to
enter the DROP at any time after the attainment of age fifty (50) with a
minimum of ten (10) years of credited service, or twenty-five (25) years of
credited service regardless of age. This benefit shall be treated as extra
benefit, as defined by section 175.351, Florida Statutes (2003).



(Ord. No. 04-10-09, §8, 10-26-04)



   A member's maximum period of participation in the DROP shall be upon
the earlier of:



         (i)   the last day of the Member's employment by the
Broward Sheriff's Office; or



         (ii)   the first day of the limitation year, as defined
in Section 415 of the Internal Revenue Code, in which the continued
participation of the Member in the DROP would cause the Member's Annual
Benefit for said limitation year to exceed the applicable Section 415
limitation.



   Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, effective for a
period of ninety (90) days following the adoption of this section, any member
who is eligible for normal retirement may participate in the DROP for the
remainder of the five (5) year period, with a minimum of two (2) years of
eligible participation.



   (b)   A member electing DROP participation shall execute such form
as the board of trustees shall require. The DROP election shall be effective
on the first day of the month following the date of election. Applications
must be filed with the board (with a copy to the city) not less than five (5)
business days prior to the effective date.



   (c)   DROP election shall be irrevocable at the time the member
executes the applicable forms. Also, members may participate in DROP only
once. After DROP participation commences, a member may not rejoin the
retirement system as an active member nor shall the member be eligible to
receive disability or pre-retirement death benefits from the system.



   (d)   Upon DROP commencement, both the city and the member
contributions to the system for the normal cost of benefits shall cease.



   (e)   For all retirement system purposes, the average monthly
earnings and continuous service of a member participating in DROP shall
remain as they existed on the date of commencement of participation in the
DROP, service, earnings or increases in earnings thereafter shall not be
recognized by the retirement system or be used for the calculation or
determination of any benefits payable by the retirement system.



   Upon commencement of DROP participation, the member will continue to be
paid for sick leave, holiday leave and annual leave in accordance with the
terms of the applicable collective bargaining agreement and/or city rules and
regulations, as applicable.



   (f)   Payments shall be made monthly by the retirement system to a
member's DROP account in the amount which would be paid had the member
separated from the city and commenced normal retirement.



   (g)   Member accounts shall be credited or debited, as appropriate,
with the investment earned/lost at a rate equal to the fund's actual
investment return, net of investment and administrative expenses. DROP
participants by virtue of their participation authorize the retirement board
to invest their DROP assets in the same manner as other assets of the pension
fund. As an alternative, each current member of the DROP and each future
member of the DROP may elect, instead of receiving the "net investment
return" as set forth above, to direct a one-time irrevocable election, at any
time during the DROP period, that his or her DROP account be invested in a
self-directed fund as may be made available from time to time by the Board.
The electing member's DROP account shall be credited or debited in accordance
with the self-directed agreement entered into by the member. Accounts may be
credited monthly or quarterly at the discretion of the board of trustees.
Investment earnings/losses will be posted upon to the last date of the
member's DROP period. By participation in the DROP, DROP participants agree
to hold the board of trustees, the retirement fund, and the city harmless
from any liability claims associated with investment losses which may occur
in the ordinary course of the investment of assets of the retirement system.
(Ord. No. 11-10-2, §2, 10-25-11)



   The city and the board of trustees may seek a favorable determination
letter from the IRS concerning the retirement plan, including all provisions
of the DROP. In the event that the IRS should hold that this section does not
meet the "definitely determinable benefit" rule, participant accounts will be
credited at a fixed rate based upon the actuarially assumed rate of return as
determined by the board of trustees during the period of DROP participation.
This rate of interest shall continue to apply unless and until the city and
the applicable collective bargaining unit negotiate a different rate of
return. No member shall receive a DROP payment until actually separated from
the city.



   (h)   To compensate the system for the costs and expenses of
administering the DROP, each member's DROP account may be charged an
administrative fee of one-half (1/2) of one percent (1%), which will be
deducted from the member's DROP account. The administrative fee may be
adjusted on a uniform basis from time to time by the board.



   (i)   Upon termination of employment for any reason, DROP
participation shall cease and any future retirement
benefits shall be paid directly to the member, or in the case of death, to
the designated beneficiary.



   Payment shall be made from the DROP account no more than ninety (90)
days after separation from the city. The form of payment may be altered upon
written notice to the board to take effect not more than ninety (90) days
from the date of notice. Payment shall be made:



      (1)   in a single lump sum;



      (2)   in annual installments;



      (3)   in equal monthly installments;



      (4)   any combination of lump sum and periodic payments; or



      (5)   by rollover to another qualified retirement plan.



   The board of trustees may accelerate or alter any payment schedule as
may be required to comply with the provisions of the Internal Revenue Code
Section 401(a)(9) and 415.



   No DROP payment may be made in a manner inconsistent with state or
federal law.



   DROP balances shall continue to be credited or debited with earnings
until fully paid to the member.



   (j)   Should a member die during DROP participation, or before the
account balance is paid in full, the member's designated beneficiary shall
have the same rights as the member to elect and receive payout options set
forth above.



   (k)   All benefits payable under this DROP program shall be paid
solely from DROP assets. Neither the city nor the board of trustees shall
have any liability or duty to pay the member or to furnish the DROP with any
funds, securities or assets except to the extent required by applicable law.



   (l)   In the event an employee sustains an on-the-job injury during
DROP participation (or before said participation, but where the employee is
still experiencing the effects of said injury when he/she elects DROP
participation) and misses time from work, the employee will be subject to
applicable provisions of the city's rules and regulations as well as the
provisions of the collective bargaining agreement, provided that no such
provisions of the rules and regulations and/or collective bargaining
agreement conflicts with the requirements of this DROP plan ordinance. The
fact that the employee is a DROP participant will not prevent the city from
separating the employee from employment or from offering the employee work
outside of the employee's normal position. Participation in the DROP is not a
guarantee of continued employment.



   DROP participants shall not be eligible to apply for nor receive
disability retirement. Upon separation, all DROP participants will receive
normal retirement benefits only.



   (m)   The provisions of the collective bargaining agreement between
the city and the applicable union will be generally applicable to DROP
participants. However, once an employee elects to participate in the DROP,
the employee will no longer be eligible for promotion, nor will they be
eligible to receive pay for educational reimbursement (other than the costs
of training and education necessary to maintain certification).



   (n)   Once a member reaches the end of their participation in the
DROP, they shall be automatically separated from employment with the city.



   (o)   The deferred retirement option plan will be implemented
subject to state and federal laws. (Ord. No. 01-1-1, § 1, 1-9-01; Ord. No.
10-4-1, § 8, 4-13-10)

purchase of, or letting of a contract for the procurement of personal
property, materials, contractual services and construction of City facilities
or construction of improvements or repairs to real property or existing

made or contracts executed under emergency or under non-competitive
situations (including authorized sole source purchases) or for litigation
related services.



      (2)   Applications of local preference to a particular
purchase, contract or category of contracts for which the City Commission is
the awarding authority may be waived upon written justification and
recommendation by the City Manager and approval of the City Commission.



      (3)   The preference established in this Section does not
prohibit the City Commission or other authorized purchasing authority to
compare quality or fitness for use of supplies, materials, equipment and
services proposed for purchase and compare qualifications, character,
responsibility and fitness of all persons, firms, or corporations submitting
bids or proposals.



      (4)   The preference established in this Section does not
prohibit the City Commission or other authorized purchasing authority from
giving any other preference permitted by law in addition to any preference

Sec. 2-233. Lobbyist Registration.



   (A)   Prior to engaging in any lobbying activities, whether or not
compensation is paid or received in connection with those activities, each
lobbyist shall:



      1.   File with the City Clerk, in form prescribed by the City
Clerk, an annual registration statement under oath containing the following
information:



         a.   The lobbyist's full name, residence address,
business name, business address, email address, and nature of business.



         b.   The full name and address of all persons on whose
behalf the lobbyist will be lobbying. If, after filing the registration
statement, the lobbyist intends to lobby on behalf of any person(s) not
listed on the registration statement, the lobbyist shall, prior to engaging
in any lobbying activities on behalf of such unlisted person(s), file an
amendment to the registration statement in form prescribed by the City Clerk,
containing all the information required in the annual registration statement.



         c.   The general and specific subject matters which the
lobbyist seeks to influence.



         d.   The extent of any direct business association by
the lobbyist with any current elected or appointed official or employee of
City. For the purposes of this article, the term "direct business
association" shall mean any mutual endeavor undertaken for profit or

         e.   A lobbyist representing a group, association, or
organization shall, prior to engaging in lobbying, receive appropriate
authorization from said group, association, or organization to lobby on its
behalf upon a particular subject matter. A copy of the applicable minutes,
motion, or other documentation of the action providing such authorization
shall be attached to the registration statements.



         f.   A lobbyist representing a principal or employer
shall file a copy of a written statement of the principal or employer
confirming authorization to lobby for the principal or employer.



      2.   Pay to the City Clerk's Office an annual Fifty Dollar
($50) registration fee for each employer or principal, identified on an
annual or amended registration statement, on whose behalf he or she intends
to lobby, whether he or she was retained directly by the employer or
principal or by another Lobbyist retained by the employer or principal. The
registration fees required by this section shall be expended by the City
Clerk's Office solely for the purpose of defraying the administrative costs
of implementing, monitoring, and otherwise ensuring compliance with this
section. A lobbyist, who is lobbying as a volunteer for a non-profit
organization, without any compensation, is not required to pay a registration
fee in connection with those uncompensated lobbying activities, but shall be
required to register.



   (B)   A lobbyist is required to promptly amend any filed
registration statement if any information in the statement changes.



   (C)   Registration statements shall cover the time period of January
1 of a given year through December 31 of the same year. Registration fees
paid under (A)(2) above cover lobbying activities during the effective period
of the registration statement. A new registration statement shall be filed,
and all required fees shall be paid, prior to engaging in any lobbying
activities after expiration of a previously-filed registration statement.



   (D)   Disclosure Statement Required.



      1.   On or before January 15 of each year, each lobbyist shall
submit to the City Clerk's Office, in form prescribed by the City Clerk, a
signed statement under oath, disclosing all lobbying expenditures, and the
sources from which funds for making such expenditures have come. The
statement shall provide such information with respect to all lobbying
activities undertaken from January 1 of the prior year through December 31 of
that year.



   Lobbying expenditures shall not include personal expenses for lodging,
meals, and travel. A statement shall be filed even if there have been no
expenditures during a reported period. A public official acting in his or her
official capacity shall not be required to file the statement required by
this subsection.



      2.   The City Clerk shall provide for a procedure by which a
lobbyist who fails to timely file a disclosure statement shall be notified
and assessed fines. The procedure shall provide for the following:



         a.   Upon determining that the statement is late, the
person designated to review the timeliness of the statement shall promptly
notify the lobbyist as to the failure to timely file the statement and that a
fine is being assessed for each late day. The fine shall be Fifty Dollars
($50) per day for each late day.



         b.   Upon receipt of the late-filed statement, the
person designated to review the timeliness of the statement shall determine
the amount of the fine due.



         c.   Such fine shall be paid within twenty (20) days
after receipt of the notice of payment due, unless timely appeal is made to
the City Commission.



         d.   A fine shall not be assessed against a lobbyist the
first time any statement for which the lobbyist is responsible is not timely
filed, provided all statements for which the lobbyist is responsible are
filed within twenty (20) days after receipt of notice that any statements
have not been timely filed. A fine shall be assessed for any subsequent
late-filed statement.



         e.   Any lobbyist may appeal a fine, based upon unusual
circumstances surrounding the failure to file by the designated due date, and
may request and shall be entitled to a hearing before the City Commission,
which shall have the authority to waive the fine in whole or in part for good
cause shown. To be entitled to such appeal, the lobbyist must, within twenty
(20) days after receipt of the notice of payment due, deliver a letter
requesting a hearing to the person designated to review the timeliness of
statements.



   (E)   List of Current Lobbyists. The City Clerk's Office shall keep
a current list of registered lobbyists and their respective statements
required under this article, all of which shall be open for public
inspection. The City Clerk shall routinely provide a copy of the lobbyist
registration list to City Commission members.



   (F)   Partial Year Filing Required. Discontinuance of lobbying
activities during a year shall not relieve the lobbyist of the requirement to
file the statement required by subsection (D)(1) above for that portion of
the year during which the lobbyist was engaged in lobbying activities.



Sec. 2-234. Reporting of Lobbying Activities.



   (A)   To promote full and complete transparency, lobbyists who lobby
a City Commissioner must contemporaneously with the lobbying activity or as
soon thereafter as is practicable (but in any event within three (3) business
days after the lobbying activity occurs), legibly complete a contact log
which contains the following information:



      1.   The lobbyist’s name;



      2.   The name of the entity by which the lobbyist is employed;



      3.   The name of the person or entity for whom or which the
lobbyist is lobbying;



      4.   The name of each City Commissioner lobbied by the
lobbyist;



      5.   The name of each person attending or participating in any
portion of the meeting or communication during which the lobbying activity
occurred;



      6.   The date and time of the meeting or other communication
during which the lobbying activity occurred;



      7.   The location of the meeting and mode of communication, as
applicable (e.g., in person, by telephone, by email exchange); and



      8.   The specific subject matter discussed in such meeting or
communication.



   The obligation to complete the contact log referenced above applies
regardless of the location of the lobbying activity and applies whether the
activity occurs in person, by telephone, by electronic communication, by
video conference, or in writing.  The contact log shall be filed for public
inspection.



(Ord. 16-4-1, § 2, 4-12-16)



Sec. 2-235.    Penalties; Enforcement.



   (A)   The City Clerk, or their designee, shall be informed of any
person engaged in lobbying activities who has failed to comply with the
provisions of Section 2-233, and, in each such instance, shall conduct such
investigation as he, she, or they shall deem necessary under the
circumstances. The results of each investigation shall be reported to the
City Commission.



   (B)   The Commission shall warn, reprimand, suspend, or prohibit the
violator from appearing on behalf of any person before the City Commission or
any decision-making body under the jurisdiction of the City Commission or
from otherwise lobbying the City for any person in any fashion for a period
of time; provided, however, that any suspension or prohibition may not exceed
a period of two (2) years, and any of said sanctions shall not be imposed
unless the lobbyist (or the employer or principal of the lobbyist, as
applicable) allegedly in violation has been afforded reasonable notice and an
opportunity to be heard. The penalties provided in this section shall be the
exclusive penalties imposed for violations of Section 2-233, except as
provided in Section 2-233(D). Further, the intentional failure or refusal of
any lobbyist to  comply with any order of the City Commission suspending or
prohibiting the lobbyist from lobbying shall be punishable as provided by law
and shall otherwise be subject to such civil remedies as the City may pursue,
including injunctive relief.



   (C)   The validity of any action taken by the City Commission, City
employees, or any decision-making body under the jurisdiction of the City
Commission, shall not be affected by the failure of any person to comply with
the provisions of this Article.



   (D)   In addition to all other penalties in this section, an
employer or principal who has retained a lobbyist(s) to lobby in connection
with a competitive solicitation shall be deemed non-responsive unless the
employer or principal, in responding to the competitive solicitation,
certifies that each lobbyist retained has timely filed the registration or
amended registration required under Section 2-233. If, after awarding a
contract in connection with the solicitation, the City learns that the
certification was erroneous, and upon investigation determines that the error
was willful or intentional on the part of the employer or principal, the City
may, on that basis, exercise any contractual right to terminate the contract
for convenience.



   (E)   Except where a specific penalty or sanction is otherwise
provided for above in this Article VIII, this Article VIII shall be subject
to enforcement under the Local Government Code Enforcement Act, Chapter 162,
F.S., as amended, and Article VI of Chapter 13 of the City Code, as amended.
Enforcement may also be by suit for declaratory, injunctive or other
appropriate relief in a court of competent jurisdiction. The City hereby
expressly reserves its right, power and authority to act as the civil or
administrative agency having jurisdiction concerning an alleged violation of
this Article VIII, and this reservation shall serve to fully preserve City's
investigative and enforcement authority.



Sec. 2-236. Certain County Code Amendments.



   In the event that the County Code is subsequently amended to require a
disclosure log of lobbyist meetings and/or communications with other covered
individuals of the City, as that term "covered individuals" is defined in
this Article, beyond that which is required by Section 2-234(A), the
provisions of Section 2-234 shall be deemed to be amended accordingly so as
to include those additional disclosure log requirements as to other covered
individuals of the City.



Sec. 2-237 - 2-240. Reserved.



ARTICLE IX. COST RECOVERY



Sec. 2-241. Cost recovery; intent and purpose.



   (A)   Intent and purpose. The intent and purpose of Article IX "Cost
Recovery" is to ensure that the various costs incurred by the city in
reviewing and processing applications by city staff, the city attorney and
outside consultants retained by the city, are borne by the applicants which
derive the financial benefits of this review, rather than by the taxpayers of
the city.



   (B)   Building permit fee schedule and application fee schedules not
affected. The schedules of building permit and Growth Management Department
application fees, as otherwise provided for and authorized by this Code,
shall not be affected by this article and shall apply in addition to the fees
required by this article.



   (C)   Advertising and mailing costs required. Advertising and
mailing costs shall also be charged to an applicant as required by this Code,
in addition to the fees and charges required by this article.



Sec. 2-242. Cost recovery for city attorney and outside consultant review.



   (A)   Applications subject to cost recovery for costs for city
attorney and outside consultant review. The following types of applications
authorized under Chapter 22 "Planning and Public Facilities", Chapter 23
"Zoning Districts", Chapter 24 "Subdivision and Site Plan Review" and Chapter
25 "Development Standards" shall be subject to the requirements of this
section: comprehensive plan amendments, rezonings, variances, plats and plat
amendments, appeals of administrative decisions, land development regulation
amendments, and conditional uses. The cost recovery charges required by this
section shall not apply to applications that are initiated by the city.



   (B)   Charges for additional review by the city attorney and outside
consultants. Where the Growth Management Director determines that an
application subject to this section requires review by the city attorney
which is anticipated to require in excess of a period of one (1) hour, or
requires review by an outside consultant hired by the city, the applicant
shall pay a cost recovery deposit prior to further processing and review of
the application. Persons who file any applications for which cost recovery is
applicable, and which necessitates additional review by the city attorney or
an outside consultant as provided for in this subsection, shall pay, prior to
or at the time that the application is filed, an initial cost recovery
deposit which shall be credited toward the actual charges of the city
attorney or outside consultant which are incurred as the review proceeds. The
amount of the initial cost recovery deposit for an application which is
subject to this subsection shall be determined by the Growth Management
Director, and shall be commensurate with the anticipated costs of review by
the city attorney and necessary outside consultants.



   (C)   Charges against cost recovery deposit. A debit based on the
actual time expended by the city attorney or an outside consultant in
reviewing the application shall be charged against the cost recovery deposit.
Outside consultant and city attorney services shall be charged at the hourly
rates specified in the applicable agreement between the city and the city
attorney, or the city and the outside consultant, as applicable. The Growth
Management Director shall provide the applicant with an itemized invoice of
the costs for any services charged against the applicant's cost recovery
deposit.



   (D)   Supplemental cost recovery deposit. The Growth Management
Director shall monitor the cost recovery deposit required by this subsection,
and may require a supplemental deposit to be made by the applicant, if the
cost recovery deposit balance is reduced to or below ten (10) percent of the
original deposit balance during the review of the application. The amount of
the supplemental deposit shall be determined by the Growth Management
Director, and shall be equal to the amount anticipated to be required to
complete the review and processing of the application. If the supplemental
deposit is not made by the applicant within thirty (30) days of the mailing
of the notification requesting such supplemental deposit by the Growth
Management Director, the city may suspend further processing of the
application. Any notification of a request for a supplemental deposit shall
be deemed sufficient if such notification is made by certified letter from
the Growth Management Director.



   (E)   Refund of cost recovery deposit balance. Within sixty (60)
days from the date that the applicant receives a certificate of occupancy or
other final approval from the city, or upon the date that the Growth
Management Director determines that no further action is necessary for the
review and processing of the subject application, or the applicant
voluntarily withdraws the application, the Growth Management Director shall
refund the remaining cost recovery deposit balance on the application to the
applicant.



   (F)   Records of work performed. The Growth Management Director
shall maintain records of the time expended by the city attorney and outside
consultants related to applications which are subject to this section. These
records shall be provided to the applicant upon request, and upon the closing
of the cost recovery account and refund of the cost recovery deposit balance
to the applicant.



   (G)   Review and appeal procedure. In the event that an applicant
believes that the city has miscalculated the required cost recovery amount
for work performed in reviewing and processing an application, the applicant
may request that the city manager or designee review the charges, and issue a
credit or refund of a portion of the cost recovery charges.



   (H)   Contacts; notification. It shall be the duty of persons who
initiate applications to provide on the filed application a continuously
updated address and telephone number where said persons or their agents may
be reached for purposes of notification under this section.



   (I)   Interest charge; enforcement. Unpaid costs and fees payable to
the city under this section, which are more than thirty (30) days overdue,
shall be considered delinquent and shall accumulate interest at the rate of
one and one-half (1.5) percent per month upon the unpaid balance until paid.
Overdue costs, fees and interest accrued thereon may be collected and
enforced in any manner that is allowed by law, and the city shall be
authorized to recover its reasonable attorney's fees incurred in such
collection.



Sec. 2-243. Cost recovery for staff review of administrative amendment
applications.



   (A)   The intent of this section is to provide for cost recovery for
administrative amendments to previously-approved development orders. These
administrative amendments do not require review by the planning and zoning
board or the city commission, and include but are not limited to applications
seeking minor lot line shifts, driveway design modifications, relocation of
sidewalks and minor changes to architectural elevations.



   (B)   The amount charged for review which results from the submittal
of applications subject to administrative cost recovery charges, as provided
in subsection (A) of this section, shall be calculated as follows, as
determined by the Growth Management Director or his or her designee.



      (1)   An administrative amendment application which requires
in excess of four (4) hours of review and processing by one or more Growth
Management Department planners shall result in a charge of $194.00 per
application. If an amendment to a previously-approved plat or site plan is
determined to require less than four (4) hours of review by one or more
Growth Management Department planners, such application may be subject to
Sec. 24-9(a)(4) of the Code.



      (2)   An administrative amendment application which requires
review by a city arborist shall result in a charge of$63.00 per application.



      (3)   An administrative amendment application which requires
review by a staff member of the Utilities Department shall result in a charge
of $86.00 per application.



      (4)   In accordance with Sec. 7-9(d) of the Code,
administrative amendment applications requiring fire plan re-inspections
shall be subject to Section43.55 of Part XIII "Fire Rescue and Safety
Services Fees" of the Broward County Administrative Code, as amended by the
County from time to time.



   (C)   Depending on the nature of the administrative amendment
application, the administrative review fee amounts set forth in subsection
(B) of this section may apply individually or cumulatively. The
administrative review fee schedule set forth in subsection (B) of this
section may be amended as necessary by resolution of the city commission.



   (D)   Unpaid costs and fees payable to the city under this section,
which are more than thirty (30) days overdue shall be considered delinquent
and shall accumulate interest at the rate of one and one-half (1.5) percent
per month upon the unpaid balance until paid. Overdue costs, fees and
interest accrued thereon may be collected and enforced in any manner that is
allowed by law, and the city shall be authorized to recover its reasonable
attorney's fees incurred in such collection.



   (E)   Administrative amendment applications may also be subject to
required payment for cost recovery for city attorney and outside consultant
review costs, as provided for in Sec. 2-242.



   (F)   As of October 1, 2013, and each October 1 thereafter, the
administrative cost recovery charges established in subsection (B) of this
section, excluding the fire plan re-inspection fees provided for in
subsection (B)(4), shall automatically increase, by the percentage increase,
if any, of the Consumer Price Index ("CPI"). This percentage increase shall
be determined by subtracting the CPI for June of the prior year from the CPI
for June of the current year, and dividing this difference by the CPI for
June of the prior year. The CPI shall be the Department of Labor Consumer
Price Index for All Urban Consumers (CPI U); region Miami/Ft. Lauderdale.

cables, wires, lines, optical fiber, underground conduit, ducts, conductors,
amplifiers, vaults and other facilities as necessary and pertinent to operate
a cable system within a specified area of the City, but does not expressly or
implicitly authorize the franchisee to provide service to, or install cables,
wires, lines, underground conduit, or any other equipment or facilities upon
private property without owner consent (except for use of compatible
easements pursuant to Section 621 of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. §541(a)(2)),
or to use publicly or privately owned conduits without a separate agreement
with the owners.



   (2)   A franchise is nonexclusive, and will not expressly or
implicitly preclude the issuance of other franchises to operate cable systems
within the City, or affect the City's right to authorize use of City streets
to other persons to operate cable systems or for other purposes as it
determines appropriate.



   (3)   Once a franchise agreement has been accepted and executed by
the City and a franchisee, such franchise agreement shall constitute a
contract between the franchisee and the City and the terms, conditions and
provisions of such franchise agreement, together with this Chapter and all
other duly enacted and applicable laws, shall define the rights and
obligations of the franchisee and the City relating to the franchise.



   (4)   All privileges prescribed by a franchise shall be subordinate
to any prior lawful occupancy of the streets and the City reserves the right
to reasonably designate where a franchisee's facilities are to be placed
within the streets.



   (5)   A franchise shall be a privilege which is in the public trust
and is personal to the original franchisee. No transfer of a franchise shall
occur without the prior consent of the city and unless application is made by
the franchisee and city approval obtained, pursuant to section 4-24 hereof
and the franchise agreement.

times be subject to all lawful exercise of the police power of the city.

under the terms of a franchise agreement and subject to the Cable Act, the
failure of the city, upon one or more occasions, to exercise a right or to
require compliance or performance under this chapter or a franchise agreement
shall not be deemed to constitute a waiver of such right or a waiver of
compliance or performance.



Sec. 4-21. Interpretation of franchise terms.



   (1)   The provisions of this chapter shall apply to a franchise
agreement as if fully set forth in the franchise agreement and the express
terms of this chapter will prevail over conflicting or inconsistent
provisions in a franchise agreement unless such franchise agreement expresses
an explicit intent to waive a requirement of this chapter.



   (2)   This chapter is not intended to create private rights of a
contractual nature enforceable against the city.



   (3)   Except as to matters which are governed by federal law or
regulation, a franchise agreement will be governed by and construed in
accordance with the laws of the State of Florida.

   (1)   Any franchisee affected by this ordinance may file a written
petition, at any time, with the city commission seeking relief from one or
more of the provisions of this ordinance. A franchisee may specifically
request that a specific provision of the ordinance apply for a specified
period of time. The petition shall set forth the relief requested and the
basis thereof with such supporting information and material as may be
applicable.



   (2)   In order to receive any relief from one (1) or more of the
provisions of this ordinance, a franchisee must satisfactorily demonstrate to
the city commission that at least one of the following facts exist:



      (a)   the provision and/or requirement is expressly prohibited
by Federal law, the FCC, or State law; or



      (b)   where applicable, that the provision in question
materially affects, and is in conflict with, an expressed right that is
specifically noted in an existing franchise agreement (but only for the term
of the existing franchise)--(this provision covers situations where a
franchisee seeks, and is granted modification of an existing franchise
agreement under section 625 of the Cable Act (codified at 47 USC 545); or



      (c)   that compliance with a particular provision and/or
requirement will be commercially impracticable for a franchisee; or



      (d)   that one (1) or more time frames listed in this
ordinance are either impossible to meet, or impractical to meet in light of
the franchisee's operational policy; or



      (e)   that the franchisee has its own construction,
maintenance, operation, or customer service policy, which the city commission
deems comparable to, or exceeding, the provisions and/or requirement from
which the franchisee seeks relief; or



      (f)   that the health, safety and welfare interests of the
city otherwise warrant the granting of such relief.



   (3)   The city commission shall have the responsibility for
determining whether a franchisee's construction, maintenance, operation, or
customer service policy, is comparable to, or exceeds, a similar provision in
this ordinance.



   (4)   As an alternative to seeking an exemption, or requesting
relief, a franchisee may petition for clarification concerning the precise
intent and effect that one (1) or more provisions or sections of this
ordinance have on a petitioning franchisee.



   (5)   In those instances in which a franchisee submits a petition
for relief or clarification, in accordance with this section, the city
commission reserves its right to charge the petitioning franchisee with the
actual and reasonable costs for processing such a petition, including costs
incurred by outside consultants who are retained by the city commission to
review a franchisee's petition and who provide a degree of skill and
experience not found within either the staff of the city commission or the
city.



   (6)   In those instances where the city commission grants an
exemption or relief to a franchisee, or deems a franchisee's operational
policy to be comparable to an ordinance provision, then the franchise
agreement (initial, existing or renewal) shall be amended within sixty (60)
days to reflect the exact extent of such exemption and/or relief. It should
be specifically noted that the benefit of such exemption, relief,
clarification, or comparable policy extends only to the franchisee granted
such exemption, relief, clarification, or comparable policy.

upon receipt of an unsolicited application, the applicant may submit an
amended application in response to the request for proposals, or may inform

      (a)   For a new or initial franchise:   $1,000



      (b)   For renewal of a franchise:   $1,000

      (e)   For modification of a franchise agreement pursuant to 47
U.S.C. §545:   $1,000



   The purpose of the filing fee is to defray a portion of the city's cost
in processing an application. The filing fee is therefore intended to be a
charge incidental to the awarding or enforcing of a franchise within the
meaning of section622(g)(2)(D) of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. subsection
542(g)(2)(d), and may not be deducted from the franchise fee imposed in a
franchise agreement.



Sec. 4-24. Grant of franchises.



   (1)   The city may grant a franchise for a period not to exceed
fifteen (15) years.



   (2)   The city may make the grant of a franchise conditioned upon
the completion of construction within a reasonably prescribed time or upon
the performance of other specific obligations which are to be set forth in
the franchise agreement, specifying that failure to comply with the condition
will cause the franchise to become null and void without further action by
the city.



   (3)   In evaluating an application for a franchise, the city may
consider, among other things, the following factors: the applicant's
technical, financial and legal qualifications to construct and operate the
proposed system; the adequacy of the proposed construction arrangements,
facilities, equipment and services based on the public convenience, safety
and welfare; the applicant's experience in constructing and operating cable
systems and providing cable service in other communities, if any; the ability
of city streets to accommodate the proposed system; the potential disruption
to users of city streets and any resultant inconvenience to the public; and
whether the proposal will meet reasonably anticipated community needs and
serve the public interest. Evaluation by the city shall not be based on the
content of the programming the applicant proposes to provide.



   (4)   The city may hold a public hearing to consider an application
or applications. The applicant(s) shall be notified of the hearing and shall
be given an opportunity to be heard. Based upon the application(s), the
testimony presented at the public hearing, any recommendations of the city
manager or staff and any other information relevant to the application(s),
the City shall decide by resolution whether to grant or deny a franchise
application(s) and decide the terms and conditions of any franchise(s)
granted. Upon the grant of a franchise, the grantee's application shall
become an integral part of said franchise and the grantee shall be bound by
the representations therein made.



   (5)   If the City grants a franchise application, the city and the
grantee shall agree on the terms of a franchise agreement within thirty (30)
calendar days from the date of the city resolution making the grant. This
period may be extended for good cause by the city. If agreement is not
reached with the city within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the
city resolution making the grant, or if the period is not extended by the
city, the franchise grant will be null and void without further action by the
city.



   (6)   Following at least ten (10) days prior notice to the grantee
and the public, the city commission may hold a public hearing at which it
will receive comment on the proposed franchise agreement.



   (7)   After complying with the above requirements, the city
commission shall approve or disapprove the proposed franchise agreement by
resolution, or may direct that it be subject to further negotiation.



   (8)   The grant of an initial franchise, a renewed franchise, an
application to modify a franchise agreement, or an application to transfer a
franchise may be subject to a processing fee in an amount not to exceed the
reasonable and justifiable out-of-pocket costs incurred by the city in
considering the application, less the amount of the filing fee set pursuant
to section 4-23(e). Within thirty (30) calendar days from the date of the
resolution approving or denying the franchise agreement or modification or
transfer thereof by the city commission, the city shall notify the grantee of
the amount of any processing fee and its method of calculation. If the
processing fee is not paid to the city within sixty (60) calendar days of the
date of the city commission resolution approving or denying the franchise
agreement or a modification or transfer thereof, any approval granted by such
resolution will be null and void. Amounts paid under this subsection shall
not exceed $10,000.



Sec. 4-25. Insurance, surety, indemnification.



   (1)   A franchisee shall maintain, and by its acceptance of the
franchise specifically agrees that it will maintain, throughout the entire
term of the franchise including any renewals thereof, the following liability
insurance coverage insuring the city and the franchisee: worker's
compensation and employer liability insurance to meet all requirements of
Florida law and general comprehensive liability insurance with respect to the
construction, operation and maintenance of the cable system and the conduct
of franchisee's business in the city, in the minimum amounts of:



      (a)   $250,000 for property damage in any one accident;



      (b)   $500,000 for personal bodily injury to any one person;
and



      (c)   $1,500,000 for personal bodily injury in any one
accident.



   (2)   All insurance policies shall be with sureties qualified to do
business in the State of Florida; shall be with sureties with a minimum
rating of A-1 in Best's Key Rating Guide, Property/Casualty Edition; and in a
form approved by the city manager. The city may require coverage and amounts
in excess of the above minimums where necessary to reflect changing liability
exposure and limits or where required by law.



   (3)   A franchisee shall keep on file with the city certificates of
insurance and upon reasonable notice and request, shall make all insurance
policies available for city inspection.



   (4)   All insurance policies shall name the city, its officers,
boards, commissions, commissioners, agents and employees, as additional
insureds and shall further provide that any cancellation or reduction in
coverage shall not be effective unless thirty (30) days prior written notice
thereof has been given to the city. A franchisee shall not cancel any
required insurance policy without submission of proof that the franchisee has
obtained alternative insurance satisfactory to the city which complies with
this chapter.



   (5)   A franchisee shall, at its sole cost and expense, indemnify,
hold harmless and defend the city, its officials, boards, commissions,
commissioners, agents and employees, against any and all claims, suits,
causes of action, proceedings, judgments for damages or equitable relief and
costs and expenses arising out of the construction, maintenance or operation
of its cable system, the conduct of franchisee's business in the city, or in
any way arising out of the franchisee's enjoyment or exercise of a franchise
granted hereunder, regardless of whether the act or omission complained of is
authorized, allowed or prohibited by this chapter or a franchise agreement,
provided, however, that franchisee's obligation hereunder shall not extend to
any claims caused by intentional misconduct or sole gross negligence of the
city, its officials, boards, commissioners, agents or employees. This
provision includes, but is not limited to, the city's reasonable attorneys'
fees incurred in defending against any such claim, suit or proceedings; and
claims arising out of copyright infringements or a failure by the franchisee
to secure consents from the owners, authorized distributors, or franchisees
of programs to be delivered by the cable system, claims arising out of
Section 638 of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 558 and claims against the
franchisee for invasion of the right of privacy, defamation of any person,
firm or corporation, or the violation or infringement of any copyright, trade
mark, trade name, service mark or patent, or of any other right of any
person, firm or corporation. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the city
from participating in the defense of any litigation by its own counsel and
obtaining indemnification of the reasonable costs associated therewith.



Sec. 4-26. Security fund.



   (1)   A franchise agreement may provide that, prior to the franchise
becoming effective, the franchisee shall post with the city a cash security
deposit or shall pledge the full faith and credit of the franchisee company's
assets, at the sole discretion of the city, to be used as a security fund to
ensure the franchisee's faithful performance of and compliance with all
provisions of this chapter, the franchise agreement, and other applicable law
and compliance with all orders, permits and directions of the city and the
payment by the franchisee of any claims, liens, fees, or taxes due the city
which arise by reason of the construction, operation or maintenance of the
system. The amount of the security fund shall be the amount that the city
determines, under circumstances existing at the time, that is necessary to
protect the public, to provide adequate incentive to the franchisee to comply
with this chapter and the franchise agreement and to enable the city to
effectively enforce compliance therewith. The franchise agreement shall
provide for the procedures to be followed with respect to the security fund.



   (2)   In any franchise agreement entered into before March 22, 1994
(the effective date of this ordinance), a franchisee may, in lieu of the
security fund, file and maintain with the city a bond with an acceptable
surety in the amount of One Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000) to indemnify
the city against any losses it may suffer in the event the franchisee fails
to comply with one or more of the provisions of its franchise. Said bond
shall be obtained at the sole expense of the franchisee and remain in effect
for the full term of the franchise plus an additional six (6) months
thereafter. The franchisee and its surety shall be jointly and severally
liable under the terms of the bond for any damages or loss suffered by the
city as a result of the franchisee's nonperformance, including the full
amount of any compensation, indemnification or cost of removal of any
property of the franchisee in the event of default, a reasonable allowance
for attorney's fees and costs, up to the full amount of the bond. The bond
shall provide for thirty (30) days' prior written notice to the city of any
intention on the part of the grantee to cancel, fail to renew, or otherwise
materially alter its terms. Neither the filing of an indemnity bond with the
city, nor the receipt of any damages recovered by the city thereunder, shall
be construed to excuse faithful performance by the franchisee or limit the
liability of the franchisee under the terms of its franchise for damages,
either to the full amount of the bond or otherwise.



   (3)   The rights reserved to the city with respect to the security
fund or an indemnity bond are in addition to all other rights of the city,
whether reserved by this chapter or authorized by other law or the franchise
agreement and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to
such security fund or indemnity bond will affect any other right the City may
have.



Sec. 4-27. Construction bond.



   (1)   A franchise agreement may provide that, prior to any cable
system construction, upgrade, or other work in the streets, a franchisee
shall establish in the city's favor a construction bond in an amount
specified in the franchise agreement or other authorization as necessary to
ensure the franchisee's faithful performance of the construction, upgrade, or
other work, but the amount of such construction bond shall not exceed One
Hundred Thousand Dollars ($100,000).



   (2)   In the event a franchisee subject to such a construction bond
fails to complete the cable system construction, upgrade or other work in the
streets in a safe, timely and competent manner in accord with the provisions
of the franchise agreement, there shall be recoverable, jointly and severally
from the principal and surety of the bond, any damages or loss suffered by
the city as a result, including the full amount of any compensation,
indemnification or cost of removal or abandonment of any property of the
franchisee, or the cost of completing or repairing the system construction,
upgrade or other work in the streets, plus a reasonable allowance for
attorneys' fees, up to the full amount of the bond. The city may also recover
against the bond any amount recoverable against the security fund pursuant to
section 4-26 hereof where such amount exceeds that available under the
security fund.



   (3)   The franchise agreement may specify that upon completion of
the system construction, upgrade or other work in the streets and payment of
all construction obligations of the cable system to the satisfaction of the
city, the city may eliminate the bond or reduce its amount. However, the city
may subsequently require an increase in the bond amount for any subsequent
construction, upgrade or other work in the streets. In any event, the total
amount of the bond shall not exceed the amount specified in subsection (1) of
this section.



   (4)   The construction bond shall be issued by a surety having a
minimum rating of A-1 in Best's Key Rating Guide, Property/ Casualty Edition;
shall be subject to the approval of the city attorney; and shall contain the
following endorsement:



      "This bond may not be canceled, or allowed to lapse, until sixty
(60) days after receipt by the city, by certified mail, return receipt
requested, of a written notice from the issuer of the bond of intent to
cancel or not to renew."



   (5)   The rights reserved by the city with respect to any
construction bond established pursuant to this section are in addition to all
other rights and remedies the city may have under this chapter, the franchise
agreement, or at law or equity.



Sec. 4-28. Minimum facilities and services.



   (1)   The following minimum requirements for facilities and services
apply to all franchises granted by the city. The city may require in a
franchise agreement that a franchisee exceed these minimum requirements where
it determines, under circumstances existing at the time of the application,
that the additional requirements are necessary to meet the city's future
cable related needs and interests or to serve the public interest.



      (a)   Any cable system constructed, upgraded, or reconstructed
after the effective date of this ordinance shall have a minimum capacity of

additional service outlets to such facilities.



      (f)   Standard installation shall consist of a drop, not
exceeding one hundred fifty (150) feet from the local distribution line to

   (3)   At the times specified in the franchise agreement or as
required by FCC rules, the franchisee shall perform at its expense proof of
performance tests designed to demonstrate compliance with the requirements of
this chapter, the franchise agreement and FCC requirements. The franchisee
shall provide proof of performance test results promptly to the city. The
city shall have the right to inspect the cable system facilities during and
after their construction to ensure compliance with the requirements of the
franchise agreement, this chapter and FCC standards.



   (4)   The city may require an annual proof of performance test, or
other tests as specified in a franchise agreement or applicable law or
regulation, to be performed at the expense of the franchisee. The franchisee

   (5)   The franchisee shall provide the city ten (10) days advance
written notice when a proof of performance test required in subsections (3)

   (6)   A franchisee shall not design, install or operate its
facilities in a manner that will interfere with the signals of any broadcast
station, the facilities of any public utility, the cable system of another

a franchise for the use of the city's streets to construct and operate a
cable system, shall pay to the city a franchise fee to be determined in the
franchise agreement. In the event that the franchise agreement states that
the "maximum allowed by law" shall be charged as a franchisee fee, then and
in that event, any changes in the maximum amount permitted by amendment to
the cable act or other applicable law shall go into effect in the city thirty
(30) days from the effective date of such law.



   (2)   A franchisee shall pay the franchise fee due to the city on a
quarterly basis. Payment for each quarter shall be made to the city not later
than forty-five (45) calendar days after the end of each calendar quarter.



   (3)   A franchisee shall file with the city, within ninety (90) days
after the expiration of each calendar year or portion thereof during which
its franchise is in force, a financial statement setting forth the
computation of gross revenues used to calculate the franchise fee for the
preceding year or portion thereof and a detailed explanation of the method of
computation. The statement shall be certified by a certified public
accountant or the franchisee's chief financial officer or other duly
authorized financial officer. The franchisee will bear the cost of the
preparation of such financial statements.



   (4)   No acceptance by the city of any franchise fee payment shall
be construed as an accord that the amount paid is in fact the correct amount,
nor shall such acceptance of payment be construed as a release of any claim
the city may have for additional sums payable.



   (5)   The franchise fee payment is not a payment in lieu of any
other fee, or any tax or assessment.



   (6)   The city may, from time to time, and upon reasonable notice,
inspect, copy and audit any and all books and records of the franchisee
relevant to the determination of gross revenues and the computation of
franchise fees due and may recompute any amounts determined to be payable
under the franchise. The cost of the audit will be borne by the franchisee
if, as a result of the audit, the city determines that the franchisee has
underpaid the franchise fees owed in an amount exceeding three percent (3%)
of the franchise fees actually paid. A franchise shall make all books and
records necessary to satisfactorily perform the audit readily available to
the auditors in Broward or Dade County, for inspection and copying.



   (7)   In the event that a franchise fee payment is not received by
the city on or before the due date set forth in subsection (3) above, or is
underpaid, the franchisee will be charged interest from the due date at an
interest rate equal to three percent (3%) above the rate for three-month
federal Treasury Bills at the most recent United States Treasury Department
sale of such Treasury Bills occurring prior to the date of the due date of
the franchise fee payment.



   (8)   When a franchise terminates for whatever reason, the
franchisee shall file with the city within ninety (90) calendar days of the
date its operations in the city cease a financial statement, certified by a
certified public accountant or the franchisee's chief financial officer,
showing the gross revenues received by the franchisee since the end of the
previous fiscal year. Adjustments will be made at that time for franchise
fees due to the date that the franchisee's operations ceased.



Sec. 4-33. Reports and records.



   (1)   Within three (3) months of a request from the city manager, or
city commission, a franchisee shall provide the City with annual reports for

instituting any investigation, civil or criminal proceeding issued by any

directly or indirectly affect or bear on franchisee's operations in the city.

   (3)   Upon written request by the franchisee and to the extent
allowed by applicable law, information of a proprietary nature submitted by
the franchisee to the city pursuant to this chapter or a franchise agreement
will not be made available for public inspection to the extent permitted by
law.



Sec. 4-34. Customer service requirements.



   (1)   A franchisee shall maintain at least one business office
either in the city or within ten (10) miles of the city that is open during
normal business hours, including 8:00 a.m. to 7:00 p.m., Monday through
Friday and 8:00 a.m. to 4:30 p.m., on Saturday. If a franchisee satisfies
this requirement with an office located within ten (10) miles of the city
rather than an office located in the city, then such a franchisee shall also
ensure that its ability to respond to city subscribers is not adversely
affected by the absence of a business office in the city, including, without
limitation, employing a sufficient number of service technicians whose
primary responsibility is to respond to service requests and complaints of
city subscribers and upon a showing of sufficient need or demand, shall open
an office within the city limits.



   (2)   A franchisee shall maintain a listed local, toll-free
telephone number and employ a sufficient number of telephone lines, personnel
and answering equipment or service to allow reasonable access by subscribers
and members of the public to contact the franchisee on a full-time basis,
twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days a week including holidays.
Telephone answering time (including hold and transfer time) shall not exceed
thirty (30) seconds or four (4) rings. This standard shall be met ninety
percent (90%) of the time. When the business office is closed, an answering
machine or service capable of receiving and recording service complaints and
inquiries shall be employed. The after hours answering service shall comply
with the same telephone answer time standard set forth in this subsection
(2). Each franchisee shall, upon city request, supply monthly statistical
data measuring its compliance with the standards set forth herein for the
year preceding the city's request.



   (3)   A franchisee shall employ and maintain sufficient qualified
personnel and equipment to be available:



      (a)   to accept payments;



      (b)   to exchange or accept converters or other equipment;



      (c)   to receive subscriber complaints or requests for service
or repairs on a full-time basis, twenty-four (24) hours a day, seven (7) days
a week;



      (d)   to initiate service installations, undertake normal
repairs and initiate action with respect to subscriber service complaints on
Monday through Friday, from 9:00 a.m. to 6:00 p.m., and on Saturday from 9:00
a.m. through 6:00 p.m.; and to enable a service technician to respond to any
service call received between 8:00 a.m. and 7:00 p.m., Monday through Friday
and 9:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. on Saturdays, by the end of the next business day.



   (4)   Standard installation work shall be performed within seven (7)
calendar days after an order has been placed except in those instances where
a subscriber specifically requests an installation date beyond the seven (7)
calendar day period. If scheduled installation is neither started nor
completed as scheduled, the subscriber will be telephoned by an employee of
the franchisee the same day. Evening personnel shall also attempt to call
subscribers at their homes between the hours of 5:30 and 8:00 p.m. If the
call to the subscriber is not answered, an employee of the franchisee shall
telephone the subscriber the next day.



   (5)   Subscribers who have experienced two (2) missed installation
or service appointments due to the fault of franchisee shall receive
installation free of charge. If the installation was to have been provided
free of charge or if the appointment was for service or repair, the
subscriber shall receive one month of the most widely subscribed to service
tier free of charge.



   (6)   All appointments for service, installation, or disconnection
shall be specified by date. The franchisee shall offer a choice of morning
(8:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m.), afternoon (12:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m.) or all-day
(8:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m.) appointment opportunities. If at any time an
installer or technician believes it impossible to make a scheduled
appointment time, an attempt to contact the customer will be made prior to
the time of appointment and the appointment rescheduled.



   (7)   Disconnection.



      (a)   Voluntary disconnection.



         1.   A subscriber may terminate service at any time.



         2.   A franchisee shall promptly disconnect any
subscriber who so requests from the franchisee's cable system. No period of
notice prior to voluntary termination of service may be required of
subscribers by any grantee. So long as the subscriber returns equipment
within three (3) business days of the disconnection, no charge may be imposed
by any franchisee for such voluntary disconnection, or for any cable services
delivered after the date of disconnect request.



         3.   A subscriber may be asked, but not required, to
disconnect the franchisee's equipment and return it to the business office.



         4.   Any security deposit and/or other funds due the
subscriber shall be refunded on disconnected accounts after the converter has
been recovered by the franchisee. The refund process shall take a maximum of
forty-five (45) days from the date disconnection was requested to the date
the customer receives the refund.



      (b)   Involuntary disconnection. If a subscriber fails to pay
a monthly subscriber or other fee or charge, the franchisee may disconnect
the subscriber's service outlet; however, such disconnection shall not be
effected until forty-five (45) days after the due date of the monthly
subscriber fee or other charge, and ten (10) days advance written notice of
intent to disconnect to the subscriber in question. If the subscriber pays
within forty-five (45) days of the due date and after notice of disconnection
has been given, the franchisee shall not disconnect. After disconnection,
upon payment by the subscriber in full of all proper fees or charges,
including the payment of the reconnection charge, if any, the franchisee
shall promptly reinstate service.



      (c)   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent
the franchisee from removing its property from a subscriber's premises upon
the termination of service. At the subscriber's request, a franchisee shall
remove all of its facilities and equipment from the subscriber's premises
within thirty (30) calendar days of the subscriber's request. Where removal
is impractical, such as with buried cable or internal wiring, facilities and
equipment may be disconnected and abandoned rather than removed, unless there
is a written agreement stating otherwise, provided, however, that such
agreement must be consistent with applicable law and FCC rules.



   (8)   A franchisee shall have available at all times personnel,
equipment and procedures capable of locating and correcting system
malfunctions. Major system malfunctions shall be corrected without delay and
corrective measures initiated immediately, except where such malfunctions are
caused by an act of God, natural disaster, or other event not within the
franchisee's control pursuant to the provisions of Section 4-47. In such
cases the franchisee shall take all reasonable measures to restore service as
soon as practicable. Corrective action for all other malfunctions shall be
initiated as provided for in the franchise agreement, but not later than the
next business day after the subscriber service call is received. Any service
complaint shall be resolved within five (5) working days.



   (9)   A franchisee shall develop written procedures for the
investigation and resolution of all subscriber or city resident complaints,
including, but not limited to, those regarding the quality of service and
equipment malfunction, which procedures shall be submitted to the city
manager. A subscriber or city resident who has not been satisfied by
following the franchisee's procedures may file a written complaint with the
city manager, who will investigate the matter and in consultation with the
franchisee as appropriate, attempt to resolve the matter. A franchisee's good
faith or lack thereof in attempting to resolve subscriber and resident
complaints in a fair and equitable manner will be considered in connection
with the franchisee's renewal application.



   (10)   A franchisee shall provide each subscriber at the time cable
service is installed and at least annually thereafter, written instructions
for placing a service call, filing a complaint, or requesting an adjustment.
Each subscriber shall also be provided with a schedule of the subscriber's
rates and charges, a copy of the service contract, delinquent subscriber
disconnect and reconnect procedures and a description of any other of the
franchisee's policies in connection with its subscribers. Copies of these
instructions shall be provided to the city.



   (11)   A franchisee shall provide subscribers, the city manager and
the city commission with at least thirty (30) days advance written notice of
any changes in rates, charges, channel lineup, or initiations or
discontinuations or changes of service or services offered over the cable
system.



   (12)   A franchisee may intentionally interrupt service on the cable
system only for good cause and for the shortest time possible and except in
emergency situations, only after a minimum of forty-eight (48) hours prior
notice to subscribers and the city of the anticipated service interruption;
provided, however, planned maintenance which does not require more than two
hours interruption of service and which occurs between the hours of 12:00
a.m. and 6:00 a.m. shall not require such notice. In the latter circumstance,
notice shall be given to the city no less than twenty-four (24) hours prior
to the anticipated service interruption.



   (13)   A franchisee shall maintain a complete record of all service
complaints received, whether written, verbal, or telephonic and action taken.
These records shall be maintained in Broward County and, subject to
exclusions of those portions of the records subject to protection by State
and Federal privacy laws, shall be available for inspection and copying by
the city during normal business hours upon reasonable prior notice. Such
records shall be subject to the provisions of section 4-33 of this chapter.
Such records shall be retained for at least one (1) year after their
recordation. If, after one (1) year, franchisee wishes to dispose of such
records, franchisee shall notify the city and at the city's request, turn
such records over to the city.



   (14)   A franchisee shall provide a pro-rated 24-hour credit to the
subscriber's account for any period of four hours or more within a 24-hour
period during which a subscriber experienced an outage of service or
substantial impairment of service, whether due to a system malfunction or
other cause.



   (15)   Billing.



      (a)   The franchisee's first billing statement after a new
installation or service change shall be pro-rated as appropriate and shall
reflect any security deposit.



      (b)   The franchisee's billing statement must itemize each
category of service and equipment provided to the subscriber and state
clearly the charge therefor.



      (c)   The franchisee must notify the subscriber that he or she
can remit payment in person at the franchisee's office and inform the
subscriber of the address of that office.



      (d)   Subscribers shall not be charged a late fee or otherwise
penalized for any failure by the franchisee, its employees, or contractors,
including failure to timely or correctly bill the subscriber, or failure to
properly credit the subscriber for a payment timely made.



      (e)   In the event of a billing dispute, the franchisee shall
waive a late fee during the period until a final resolution of the dispute is
agreed upon between the franchisee and the city.



      (f)   A franchisee may bill for basic, cable programming, a la
carte and/or premium services up to thirty (30) days in advance of receiving
such services.



      (g)   However, a subscriber shall not be considered delinquent
in payment until at least--



         1.   forty-five (45) days have elapsed since the posting
of the bill in question to the subscriber;



         2.   services for the first thirty (30) day period
billed for has been delivered; and



         3.   payment for said thirty (30) day period has not
been received by the franchisee.



      (h)   Before disconnection of a subscriber's cable service
(either physically or electronically) takes place, the following must occur:



         1.   the subscriber must in fact be delinquent in
payment for cable service; and



         2.   at least two (2) days have elapsed after a separate
written notice of impending disconnection has been personally served upon the
subscriber or deposited at his or her residence; or



         3.   at least five (5) days have elapsed after mailing a
separate written notice of impending disconnection to the subscriber; or



         4.   at least two days have elapsed after the subscriber
has either signed for, or refused to accept, a separate written notice of
impending disconnection.



      (i)   The written notice of disconnection must expressly and
clearly state the amount that is owed by the subscriber to the franchisee,
the minimum amount required to be paid in order to avoid disconnection and
the date and place where such payment must be made.



      (j)   Disconnection of service must occur both on a normal
service day and within normal business hours of the franchisee, unless the
subscriber is given the opportunity to pay the full amount of the past due
and delinquent amount.



      (k)   A franchisee who physically retrieves its equipment
(including but not limited to, converter, remote control device, or digital
audio tuner), from a subscriber, must do so within both a normal service day
and normal service of a franchisee, unless otherwise agreed to by the
subscriber.



      (l)   Receipt of a "bad check" from a subscriber, in response
to a written notice of disconnection, does not constitute payment and the
affected franchisee need not give the subscriber further notice prior to
disconnecting cable service.



      (m)   A franchisee may add a reasonable collection charge to
the subscriber's bill if the applicable provisions of this ordinance and any
applicable State regulation, are followed.



      (n)   Any refund due a subscriber after such a disconnection
shall be made within sixty (60) days of the disconnection for non-payment.



   (16)   Format of subscriber invoices.



      (a)   Each periodic subscriber invoice generated by, or on
behalf of a franchisee shall contain at a minimum, the following:



         1.   the billing or invoice period;



         2.   the amount of the current billing;



         3.   appropriate credits or past due balances; and



         4.   the FCC's Community Unit Identifier.



      (b)   If the periodic invoice contains a special insert that
has customer service information required by either the FCC, the State, this
ordinance, or (where applicable) a franchise agreement, then the periodic
invoice should contain on its face a highlighted notification that such
special insert is included within the envelope.



      (c)   Franchisees may identify and/or note as a separate line
item on each periodic subscriber invoice the following:



         (1)   the amount of the total bill assessed as a
franchise fee and that such franchise fee is paid to the city, if indeed such
franchisee pays a franchise fee to the city;



         (2)   the amount of the total bill necessary to satisfy
any requirements imposed on a franchisee in a franchise agreement in order to
support public, educational, or governmental (PEG) channels or their use, if
indeed such franchisee pays monies to the City or another agency in order to
satisfy such PEG requirements contained in a franchise agreement; and;



         (3)   the amount of the total bill necessary to satisfy
other fees, taxes, or assessments that are directly imposed by the city
commission on a transaction between the franchisee and the subscriber, or
assessments to the city commission.



      (d)   To the extent both permitted by Federal law (including
FCC rules and regulations) and consistent with subsection (c) of this
section, a franchisee may (on the periodic invoice) note or identify (in the
aggregate) the amount that the franchisee pays in copyright fees, property
taxes, business license fees and the like. However, in order to lessen
subscriber confusion or misimpression, such notation or identification shall
not be contained as a separate line item which is reduced to a per subscriber
amount and then added-on to from part of the total bill. Rather, the purpose
for such notification or notation (if permitted by Federal law) is to simply
inform the subscriber what part of the franchisee's overall costs are
expended on certain operational obligations.



      (e)   Should the franchisee identify or note what the
franchisee pays in copyright fee or the like, pursuant to subsection (d) of
this Section, then the franchisee shall also (on the periodic notice)
identify or note the franchisee's costs and/or expenses, in the aggregate,
the total for providing all cable services.



      (f)   Note well, that the charge identified or noted in the
subscriber bill as the total charge for cable service should include all fees
and costs identified or noted pursuant to subsection (c) of this Section.
Consequently, franchise fees should never be added-on to the other listed
charges in order to form part of the total charge for cable service.



      (g)   A franchisee shall not place on a periodic subscriber
invoice, any wording, identification, or notation which misleads or
misinforms a subscriber as to the precise nature and/or purpose of
information contained on the periodic subscriber invoice.



      (h)   If at least ten percent (10%) of the city's residents
speak a language other than English (e.g. Native American, Spanish, Italian
or Hebrew) and are non-English speaking, then the franchisee shall make the
periodic subscriber invoice available to the residents and/or customers in
that language.



      (i)   If not prohibited by either Federal or State law, a
franchisee may provide a subscriber with an option of receiving the periodic
subscriber invoice either through the mail or via the cable. Where offered
the choice remains solely with each individual subscriber.



   (17)   Alteration of service.



   A franchisee may not substantially alter the service being provided to
a subscriber (including by re-tiering, restructuring a tier or otherwise)
without the express permission of such subscriber, unless it complies with
this subsection.



      (a)   If a franchisee wishes to alter the service being
provided to a subscriber (including by re-tiering, restructuring a tier or
otherwise) in such a way that the subscriber will no longer be able to obtain
the same package of services (exclusive of programming additions or deletions
affecting no more than five (5) channels), then the franchisee must provide
the subscriber with sixty (60) days notice of such alteration, explain the
substance and full effect of the alteration and provide the subscriber the
right, to opt to receive any combination of services offered by the
franchisee.



      (b)   Except as provided herein, no charge may be made for any
service or product which the subscriber has not affirmatively indicated, in a
manner separate and apart from payment of the regular monthly bill, that he
or she wishes to receive.



   (18)   A franchisee shall comply with all customer service standards
applicable to cable systems of the FCC and any other applicable federal or
state law concerning customer service standards, consumer protection and
unfair or deceptive trade practices.



   (19)   Inter-local plan to alert subscribers in the event of an
emergency; standby power. All franchises shall cooperate with the city in the
development of an inter-local plan, which includes all local governmental
entities within Broward County, which makes provision, among other things, to
alert subscribers in the event of an impending, imminent or actual, natural
or man-made emergency and to provide for standby power. In order to implement
the inter-local plan, the cable system providing cable service of all, or
part, of the city shall be designed so as to permit an override of the audio
portion of all channels, by touch-tone phone (or functional equivalent) from
any location by the government officials designated in the plan, and pursuant
to the provisions of such plan.



Sec. 4-35. Subscriber privacy.



   (1)   A franchisee shall at all times protect the privacy of all
subscribers to the full extent required by section 631 of the Cable Act, 47
U.S.C. § 551 and state law. A franchisee shall not condition subscriber or
other service on the subscriber's grant of permission to disclose information
which, pursuant to federal or state law, cannot be disclosed without the
subscriber's explicit consent. No penalties or extra charges may be invoked
by the franchisee for a subscriber's failure to grant consent.



   (2)   Unless otherwise permitted by federal or state law, neither
the franchisee nor its agents or employees shall, sell, or otherwise make
available for any purposes the names, addresses or telephone numbers of any
subscriber or subscribers, or any information which identifies the individual
viewing habits of any subscriber or subscribers.



Sec. 4-36. Discrimination prohibited.



   (1)   No franchisee may in its rates or charges, or in the
availability of the services or facilities of its system, or in any other
respect, make or grant undue preferences or advantages to any subscriber,
potential subscriber, or group of subscribers or potential subscribers, nor
subject any such persons or group of persons to any undue prejudice or any
disadvantage. A franchisee shall not deny, delay, or otherwise burden service
or discriminate against subscribers or users on the basis of age, race,
creed, religion, color, sex, handicap, national origin, marital status, or
political affiliation, except for discounts for senior citizens, the
economically disadvantaged or handicapped that are applied in a uniform and
consistent manner. A franchisee may also offer promotional discounts to
potential subscribers and bulk discounts to multiple dwelling buildings if
such discounts are applied in a uniform and consistent manner, but only to
the extent such discounts are otherwise permissible by law.



   (2)   A franchisee shall not deny cable service to any potential
subscriber because of the income of the residents of the area in which the
subscriber resides.



   (3)   A franchisee shall not refuse to employ, nor discharge from
employment, nor discriminate against any person in compensation or in terms,
conditions or privileges of employment because of age, race, creed, religion,
color, sex, handicap, national origin, marital status, or political
affiliation. The franchisee shall comply with federal, state and local laws
and regulations governing equal employment opportunities, as the same may be
from time to time amended.



Sec. 4-37. Use of streets.



   (1)   Any pavements, sidewalks, curbing or other paved area taken up
or any excavations made by a franchisee shall be done under the supervision
and direction of the city under permits issued for work by the proper
officials of the city and shall be done in such manner as to give the least
inconvenience to the inhabitants of the city. A franchisee shall, at its own
cost and expense and in a manner approved by the city, replace and restore
any such pavements, sidewalks, curbing or other paved areas in as good a
condition as before the work involving such disturbance was done and shall
also make and keep full and complete plats, maps and records showing the
exact locations of its facilities located within the public streets, ways and
easements of the city. These maps shall be available for inspection and
copying at any time during business hours by the city.



   (2)   Except to the extent required by law, a franchisee shall, at
its expense, protect, support, temporarily disconnect, relocate, or remove,
any of its property when required by the city by reason of traffic
conditions, public safety, street construction, street resurfacing or
widening, change of street grade, installation of sewers, drains, water
pipes, power lines, signal lines, tracks, or any other type of municipal or
public utility improvements; provided, however, that the franchisee shall, in
all such cases, have the privilege of abandoning any property in place.



   (3)   A franchisee shall, on the request of any person holding a
building moving permit issued by the city, temporarily raise or lower its
wires to permit the moving of buildings. The expense of such temporary
removal or raising or lowering of wires shall be paid by the person
requesting same and the franchisee shall have the authority to require such
payment in advance, except in the case where the requesting person is the
city, in which case no such payment shall be required. The franchisee shall
be given not less than five (5) calendar days advance notice to arrange for
such temporary wire changes.



   (4)   A franchisee shall have authority to trim the trees or other
natural growth upon and overhanging the streets so as to prevent the branches
of such trees from coming in contact with the wires, cables and other
equipment of the franchisee, except that, at the option of the city, such
trimming may be done by it or under its supervision and direction at the
expense of the franchisee. The franchisee when trimming trees or other
natural growth shall comply with all other regulations for such activities,
specifically but not limited to chapter 18 of the city code, commonly
referred to as the "Tree Preservation Code".



(Ord. No. 00-1-10, § 1, 1-25-00)



   (5)   A franchisee shall use, with the owner's permission, existing
underground conduits or overhead utility facilities whenever feasible. Copies
of agreements for use of conduits or other facilities shall be filed with the
city as required by the franchise agreement or upon city request.
Notwithstanding the above, for franchises which are newly adopted subsequent
to the effective date of this section (1/25/00), or which file a Notice of
Acceptance with the city after that date, shall, subject to the approval of
the city engineer, install new facilities underground regardless of existing
facilities, unless such overhead facilities exist within the interior side
yards and/or rear yards of developed residential properties.



(Ord. No. 00-1-10, §2, 1-25-00)



   (6)   All wires, cable lines and other transmission lines, equipment
and structures shall be installed and located to cause minimum interference
with the rights and convenience of property owners. The city may issue such
rules and regulations concerning the installation and maintenance of a cable
system installed in, on, or over the streets, as may be consistent with this
chapter and the franchise agreement.



   (7)   All safety practices required by law shall be used during
construction, maintenance and repair of a cable system. A franchisee shall
not place facilities, equipment or fixtures where they will interfere with
any gas, electric, telephone, water, sewer or other utility facilities, or
obstruct or hinder in any manner the various utilities serving the residents
of the city of their use of any street or any other public right of way.



   (8)   A franchise shall, at all times:



      (a)   Install and maintain its wires, cables, fixtures and
other equipment in accordance with the requirements of the city's building
code and electrical safety ordinances and any other applicable building or
electrical safety code and in such manner that they will not interfere with
any installations of the city.



      (b)   Keep and maintain in a safe suitable, substantial
condition and in good order and repair, all structures, lines, equipment and
connections in, over, under and upon the streets, sidewalks, alleys and
public ways of places of the city, wherever situated or located.



   (9)   (a)  On streets where electrical and telephone utility wiring
is located underground, either at the time of initial construction of a cable
system or at any time thereafter, a franchisee's cable shall also be located
underground at the franchisee's expense. On streets where such wiring is
located overhead, for franchises which are newly adopted or approved or which
file a Notice of Acceptance subsequent to the effective date of this section
(1/ 25/00), new facilities and cables shall, subject to the approval of the
city engineer, be located underground. Notwithstanding the above, if existing
overhead lines lie in easements which are in interior side yards and/or rear
yards of developed residential property, the city engineer shall determine on
a case-by-case basis if new installations shall also be overhead.



      (b)   Between an easement and a subscriber's residence, a
franchisee's cable must be located underground if both electrical and
telephone utility wiring are located underground. If either electric or
telephone utility wiring is aerial, a franchisee may install aerial cable
except where a property owner or resident requests underground installation
and agrees to bear the additional cost of such installation over and above
the cost of aerial installation.



(Ord. No. 00-1-10, §3, 1-25-00)



   (10)   In the event the use of any part of a cable system is
discontinued for any reason for a continuous period of twelve (12) months, or
in the event such system or property has been installed in any street without
complying with the requirements of this chapter or a franchise agreement, or
the franchise has been terminated, canceled or expired, the franchisee,
within thirty (30) days after written notice by the city, shall commence
removal from the streets of all such property as the city may require.



   (11)   The city may extend the time for the removal of franchisee's
equipment and facilities for a period not to exceed one hundred eighty (180)
days and thereafter such equipment and facilities may be deemed abandoned.



   (12)   In the event of such removal or abandonment, the franchisee
shall restore the area to as good a condition as prior to such removal or
abandonment.



   (13)   Whenever any franchisee must install any portion of their
facilities aboveground in the public right-of-way, other than when authorized
to mount such facilities on existing poles, such ground-mounted facilities
shall:



      (a)   be placed a minimum of six (6) feet from any paved area;



      (b)   be limited to a height no greater than two feet
(twenty-four inches);



      (c)   be spaced a minimum of forty (40) feet apart from like
facilities of the same franchisee or of other franchisees or occupants of the
public rights-of-way, or be grouped together within the public right-of-way
and/or easement and shielded by the required shrubbery;



      (d)   be shielded from the paved right-of-way by shrubs or
other plantings which shall be maintained at a minimum height of twenty-four
(24) inches and a maximum height of thirty (30) inches by the franchisee;



      (e)   be painted or manufactured in a green color;



      (f)   when installed within an easement on private property,
the property owner shall be consulted as to the appropriate location and the
required shrubs shall surround the facility installation; and



      (g)   be installed a minimum of ten (10) feet to the rear or
side of any City or subdivision entrance sign.



      (h)   Franchisees who cannot meet the requirements of this
subsection may request a waiver from the strict and literal terms hereof, at
the time of applying for required building permits, by submitting a request,
sealed by an engineer, detailing which provisions cannot be complied with,
the reasons for such non-compliance and suggested alternatives thereto. Said
submittal shall be reviewed by the City Engineer and approved or rejected by
the Engineer and the City Manager, in their sole and exclusive discretion.

   (1)   In addition to any other remedies available at law or equity,
the city may apply any one or combination of the following remedies in the
event a franchisee violates this chapter, its franchise agreement or
applicable state or federal law:



      (a)   Impose fines pursuant to the following schedule, which
fines shall be paid to the City, upon reasonable notice and after opportunity
to cure as provided by the city. Payment of fines by the franchisee will not
relieve the franchisee of its obligation to comply with the franchise
agreement and the requirements of this chapter.

   (2)   The City Manager or his/her designee shall have the authority
to assess the foregoing fines against a franchisee for violations of this
article. Provided, however, that any party aggrieved by a decision of the
City Manager or designee may appeal to the City Commission for hearing and

(Ord. No. 01-10-1,§ 2, 10-9-01)



Sec. 4-39. Renewal of franchise.



   Renewal shall be conducted in a manner consistent with Section626 of
the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 546. The following additional requirements shall
apply.



   (1)   Upon completion of the review and evaluation process set forth
in Section 626(a)(1)(2) of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 546, should that
process be invoked, the City shall notify the franchisee that it may file a
renewal application. The notice shall specify the information to be included
in the renewal application and the deadline for filing the application, which
shall be no earlier than twenty-one (21) calendar days following the date of
the notice.



      (a)   The application shall comply with the requirements of
Section 4-23 hereof and provide the specific information requested in the
notice. If the franchisee does not submit a renewal application by the date
specified in the city's notice to the franchisee given pursuant to this
subsection, the franchisee will be deemed not to be seeking renewal of its
franchise.



      (b)   Upon receipt of the renewal application, the city shall
publish notice of its receipt and make copies available to the public. The
city, following prior public notice, may hold one or more public hearings on
the renewal application.



   (2)   In the event a public hearing on the renewal application is
held, or in the event that the city commission considers the renewal
application without a public hearing, the city commission will either:



      (a)   Pass a resolution agreeing to renew the franchise,
subject to the negotiation of a franchise agreement satisfactory to the city
and the franchisee; or



      (b)   Pass a resolution that makes a preliminary assessment
that the franchise should not be renewed.



   (3)   If a preliminary assessment is made that a franchise should
not be renewed, at the request of the franchisee or on its own initiative,
the city will commence a proceeding in accordance with Section 626(c) of the
Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 546(c) to address the issues set forth in Section
626(c)(1)(A)-(D) of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 546(c) (1)(A)-(D).



   (4)   Any request to initiate a renewal process or proposal for
renewal not submitted within the time period set forth in Section 626(a) of
the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 546(a), shall be deemed an informal proposal for
renewal and shall be governed in accordance with Section 636(h) of the Cable
Act, 47 U.S.C. 546(h). The city may hold one or more public hearings or
implement other procedures under which comments from the public on an
informal proposal for renewal may be received. Following such public hearings
or other procedures, the city commission shall determine whether the
franchise should be renewed and the terms and conditions of any renewal.



   (5)   If the city commission grants a renewal application, the city
and the franchisee shall agree on the terms of a franchise agreement,
pursuant to the procedures specified in subsection 4-24(5), et supra, of this
chapter, before such renewal becomes effective.



   (6)   If renewal of a franchise is denied the city may acquire
ownership of the cable system or effect a transfer of ownership of the system
to another person upon approval of the city commission. Any such acquisition
or transfer shall be at fair market value, determined on the basis of the
cable system valued as a going concern but with no value allocated to the
franchise itself.



   (7)   If a renewal of a franchise is denied and the city does not
purchase the cable system or approve or effect a transfer of the cable system
to another person, the city may require the former franchisee to remove its
facilities and equipment at the former franchisee's expense. If the former
franchisee fails to do so within a reasonable period of time, the city may
have the removal done at the former franchisee's and/or surety's expense.



Sec. 4-40. Assignment of a Franchise.



   (1)   There shall be no assignment of a franchisee's franchise, in
whole or in part, without the prior express written approval by the city
commission.



   (2)   Except as noted in subsection (8) of this section, any
assignment or transfer without such prior express written consent shall
constitute a default of such franchise which may subject the franchisee's
franchise to revocation.



   (3)   At least forty-five (45) days before such a proposed
assignment of the franchisee's franchise is scheduled to become effective,
the franchisee shall petition in writing for the city commission's written
consent for such a proposed assignment. It is specifically noted that the
franchisee shall submit to the city commission (concurrently with the
submission of its written petition) an FCC 394 Form with the submission of
its written petition) an FCC 394 Form (or successor form) together with any
other information or documentation required by the state or federal
government (including the FCC).



   (4)   The city commission will not unreasonably without its consent
to such an assignment. However, in making such a determination, the city
commission may examine all relevant facts including the following:



      (a)   experience of the proposed assignee or transferee or
buyer;



      (b)   qualifications of the proposed assignee or transferee or
buyer;



      (c)   legal integrity of the proposed assignee or transferee
or buyer;



      (d)   financial ability and stability of proposed assignee or
transferee or buyer; and



      (e)   any other legitimate aspect of the proposed assignee's
or transferee's or buyer's background which could affect the healthy, safety,
or welfare of the citizenry of the city.



   (5)   Before the assignment is approved by the city commission, the
proposed assignee shall execute an affidavit, acknowledging that he has read,
understood and will abide by both this ordinance and the applicable
franchisee agreement.



   (6)   Notwithstanding the other subsections of this Section, nothing
shall prohibit the franchisee from making an assignment of a franchise to an
affiliate which controls, is controlled by or is under common ownership and
control of the franchisee without the prior consent of the city commission.
In addition, the following will not be considered an assignment or transfer
of the franchise and, therefore, shall not require the consent of the city:
(1) any change in ownership of the franchisee that does not result in a
change in voting control or of actual working control of the franchisee; and
(2) the mortgage or pledge by franchisee of the franchise for financing
purposes.



   (7)   Both the franchisee and the city will abide by the FCC's rules
and regulations concerning the transfer of ownership, the three-year holding
requirement and the assignment, transfer of sale of systems.



   (8)   The city commission must dispositively approve or not approve
a franchisee's written petition for assignment, transfer, or sale within
forty-five (45) days from receipt of the franchisee's written petition. If
the city commission fails to take any action within such forty-five (45) day
period, then the franchisee's written petition will be deemed formally
approved.



   (9)   Nothing prevents a franchisee from submitting an amended or
new written petition for assignment, transfer, or sale in the case where the
city commission does not approve the original or previous written petition.



Sec. 4-41. Revocation of termination of franchise.



   (1)   A franchise may be revoked by the city commission for a
franchisee's failure to construct, operate or maintain the cable system as
required by this chapter or the franchise agreement, or for any other
material violation of this chapter or material breach of the franchise
agreement. To invoke the provisions of this subsection (1), the city shall
give the franchisee written notice, by certified mail at the last known
address, the franchise is in material violation of this chapter or in
material breach of the franchise agreement and describing the nature of the
alleged violation or breach. If within thirty (30) calendar days following
receipt of such written notice from the city to the franchisee, the
franchisee has not cured such violation or breach, or has not commenced
corrective action and such corrective actions not being actively and
expeditiously pursued, the city may give written notice to the franchisee of
its intent to revoke the franchise, stating its reasons.



   (2)   Prior to revoking a franchise under subsection (1) hereof, the
city commission shall hold a public hearing, upon thirty (30) calendar days
notice, at which time the franchisee and the public shall be given an
opportunity to be heard. Following the public hearing the city commission may
determine whether to revoke the franchise based on the evidence presented at
the hearing and other evidence of record. If the city commission determines
to revoke a franchise, it shall issue a written decision setting forth the
reasons for its decision. A copy of such decision shall be transmitted to the
franchisee.



   (3)   Notwithstanding subsections (1) and (2) hereof, any franchise
may, at the option of the city following a public hearing before the city
commission, be revoked one hundred twenty (120) calendar days after an
assignment for the benefit of creditors of the appointment of a receiver or
trustee to take over the business of the franchisee, whether in a
receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy assignment for the benefit of
creditors, or other action or proceeding, unless within that one hundred
twenty (120) day period:



      (a)   Such assignment, receivership or trustee ship has been
vacated; or



      (b)   Such assignee, receiver or trustee has fully complied
with the terms and conditions of this chapter and the franchise agreement and
has executed an agreement, approved by a court having jurisdiction, assuming
and agreeing to be bound by the terms and conditions of this chapter and the
franchise agreement.



   (4)   In the event of foreclosure or other judicial sale of any of
the facilities, equipment or property of a franchisee, the city may revoke
the franchise, following a public hearing before the city commission, by
serving notice upon the franchisee and the successful bidder at the sale, in
which event the franchise and all rights and privileges of the franchise will
be revoked and will terminate thirty (30) calendar days after serving such
notice, unless:



      (a)   The city has approved the transfer of the franchise to
the successful bidder; and



      (b)   The successful bidder has covenanted and agreed with the
city to assume and be bound by the terms and conditions of the franchise
agreement and this chapter.



   (5)   If the city revokes a franchise, or if for any other reason a
franchisee abandons, terminates or fails to operate or maintain service to
its subscribers, the following procedures and rights are effective:



      (a)   The city may require the former franchisee to remove its
facilities and equipment at the former franchisee's expense. If the former
franchisee fails to do so within a reasonable period of time, the city may
have the removal done at the former franchisee's and/or surety's expense.



      (b)   The city, by resolution of the city commission, may
acquire ownership, or effect a transfer, of the cable system at any equitable
price.



      (c)   If a cable system is abandoned by a franchisee, the city
may sell, assign or transfer all or part of the assets of the system.



   (6)   Where the city has issued a franchise specifically conditioned
in the franchise agreement upon the completion of construction, system
upgrade or other specific obligation by a specified date, failure of the
franchisee to complete such construction or upgrade, or to comply with such
other specific obligation as required will result in the automatic forfeiture
of the franchise without further action by the city where it is so provided
in the franchise agreement, unless the city, at its discretion and for good
cause demonstrated by the franchisee, grants an extension of time.



   (7)   Except as provided in subsection (6), no adverse action
against a franchisee may be taken by the city pursuant to this section except
after a noticed public hearing at which the franchisee is given an
opportunity to participate.



Sec. 4-42. Continuity of service mandatory.



   (1)   It is the right of all subscribers to receive all available
services from the franchisee as long as their financial and other obligations
to the franchisee are satisfied.



   (2)   In the event of a termination or transfer of a franchise for
whatever reason, the franchisee shall ensure that all subscribers receive
continuous, uninterrupted service regardless of the circumstances. The
franchisee shall cooperate with the city to operate the system for a
temporary period following termination or transfer as necessary to maintain
continuity of service to all subscribers. The temporary period will not
exceed six (6) months without the franchisee's written consent. During such
period the cable system shall be operated under such terms and conditions as
the city and the franchisee may agree, or such other terms and conditions
that will continue, to the extent possible, the same level of service to
subscribers and that will provide reasonable compensation to the cable
operator.



   (3)   In the event a franchisee fails to operate the system for
seven (7) consecutive days without prior approval of the city or without just
cause, the city may, at its option, operate the system or designate an
operator until such time as the franchisee restores service under conditions
acceptable to the city or until a permanent operator is selected. If the city
is required to fulfill this obligation for the franchisee, the franchisee
shall reimburse the city for all costs or damages resulting from the
franchisee's failure to perform that are in excess of the revenues from the
system received by the city. Additionally, the franchisee will cooperate with
the city to allow city employees and/or city agents free access to the
franchisees' facilities and premises for purposes of continuing system
operation.



Sec. 4-43. Rates and charges.



   (1)   To the extent permitted by Federal law (including applicable
FCC rules and regulations), the city commission is authorized to, and may
choose to, regulate the rates for basic cable service, which includes basic
cable service and those charges (such as converter rental fees) associated
with the provision of cable service.



   (2)   Consistent with Federal law, before the city commission
exercises its right to impose, approve, or deny the rates and/ or charges for
basic cable service, the city commission must conduct a public hearing in
which to allow an affected franchisee or any other interested party an
opportunity to express its views concerning said proposed rate regulation.



Sec. 4-44. Performance evaluations.



   (1)   The city commission is authorized to design a performance
evaluation procedure which periodically monitors the compliance of the
franchisee with the terms and conditions of both this ordinance and any
applicable franchise agreement. Moreover, the city commission may
periodically review and examine whether a franchisee's financial, technical,
legal and character qualifications and its record of meeting community and
subscriber needs as particularly relate to matter of customer service
practices and consumer protection issues, continue to meet required
operational, maintenance and performance levels in order to ensure the
uninterrupted and acceptable provision of cable service. Such performance
evaluations may be conducted every three (3) years during the franchise term.



   (2)   If as a result of the evaluation, the city commission
determines that the franchisee has not complied with a provision of this
ordinance, then the city commission must give the franchisee an opportunity
to either correct the area of non-compliance, or submit documentation or
supporting data that resolves or explains the area of non-compliance.



   (3)   If the franchisee fails to correct or resolve an area of
non-compliance, then such failure may be treated as a material violation of
this ordinance.



Sec. 4-45. Administration.



   (1)   The city manager, either directly or through a duly appointed
designee, shall have the responsibility for overseeing the day-to-day
administration of this chapter and franchise agreements. The city manager
shall be empowered to take all administrative actions on behalf of the city,
except for those actions specified in this chapter that are reserved to the
city commission. The city manager may recommend that the commission take
certain actions with respect to the franchise. The city manager shall keep
the commission apprised of developments in cable and provide the commission
with assistance, advice and recommendations as appropriate.



   (2)   The city commission shall have the sole authority to regulate
rates for cable services, grant franchises, authorize the entering into of
franchise agreements, modify franchise agreements, renew or deny renewal of
franchises, revoke franchises and authorize the transfer of a franchise.



Sec. 4-46. Theft, Vandalism, Tampering; Violation.



   It is unlawful and a violation of this ordinance to:



   (1)   Willfully obtain or attempt to obtain cable services or cable

set forth in paragraphs (1), (2) and (3), whether or not such device or plan
actually has the ability to facilitate the commission of any acts set forth
in paragraphs (1), (2) and (3).



   (5)   Willfully sell, rent or lend, or promote or advertise for

Sec. 4-47. Force Majeure.



   In the event a franchisee's performance of or compliance with any of
the provisions of this chapter or the franchisee's franchise agreement is
prevented by a cause or event not within the franchisee's control, such
inability to perform or comply shall be deemed excused and no penalties or
sanctions shall be imposed as a result thereof, provided, however, that
franchisee uses all practicable means to expeditiously cure or correct any
such inability to perform or comply. For purposes of this chapter and any
franchise agreement granted or renewed hereunder, causes or events not within
a franchisee's control shall include, without limitation, acts of God,
floods, earthquakes, landslides, hurricanes, fires and other natural
disasters, acts of public enemies, riots or civil disturbances, sabotage,

operate a cable system to the full extent permitted by law.



Sec. 4-49. Applicability.



   (1)   Unless exempted entirely from this article, or exempted from
one or more provisions of this article, or granted relief or clarification
from one or more provisions of this article, then this article shall be
applicable to any affected cable operator which specifically includes any
franchisee and this article shall have full effect and be enforceable in its
entirety. Moreover, any affected cable operator shall be expected to comply

applicable, then the person providing cable service must abide by and comply
with all applicable provisions of this ordinance.



   (3)   It is also expressly understood that the exemption granted
extends only to this ordinance. Consequently, any person granted an exemption
from this ordinance, must nonetheless abide by and comply with, any other
applicable City, State or Federal laws and regulations, including any
applicable Federal or State consumer protection, or customer service laws and
regulations.



Sec. 4-51. Reservation of rights.



   (1)   The City reserves the right to amend this Chapter as it shall
find necessary in the lawful exercise of its police powers.

federal law including Section 337.401, Florida Statutes; City home-rule
authority and the Federal Communications Commission guidelines and
regulations in accordance with the provisions of the Telecommunications Act
of 1996 to provide for the payment of fees and other valuable consideration
by registrant to the City for the cost of establishing, maintaining and
regulating the use of the City's rights-of-way and for using the City's
rights-of-way for constructing and maintaining telecommunications facilities;
and to establish standards for the maintenance and regulation of
rights-of-way in the City for all users. In regulating rights-of-way, the
City shall be governed by and shall comply with all controlling federal,
state, and local laws and regulations.



Sec. 4-56. Name and scope.



   This article shall be known as the Cooper City Telecommunications

Sec. 4-58. Purpose and characteristics.



   (a)   In order to ensure as far as possible and appropriate that
persons providing similar services are treated similarly, considering
differences in circumstances, and to comply with requirements of state and
federal law, all operators of a telecommunications facility or owners of a
private communications system shall register before using City rights-of-way.
The revocation of a registration for one particular type of service in and of
itself will not affect the authority of an operator to continue to provide
other types of services for which it holds a franchise or license. No
registration acknowledged by the City shall be exclusive.



   (b)   A registration shall not convey title, equitable or legal, in
the rights-of-way. The right acknowledged by the City is only the right to
occupy rights-of-way for the purposes of constructing and/or repairing the
operator's telecommunications facility or the owner's private communications
system for the period stated in the registration, which may not be alienated,
assigned, or transferred without the prior written consent of the City.



   (c)   The fact that a particular telecommunications facility may be
used for multiple purposes does not obviate the need to obtain a license or
franchise for other purposes. By way of illustration and not limitation, a
cable operator of a cable system must obtain a cable franchise or license,
and, if the operator elects to provide telecommunications services over the
same facilities, the operator must first register in accordance with this
article.



Sec. 4-59. Registration required.



   (a)   An operator of a telecommunications facility covered by this
article shall register (in accordance with this article) prior to
constructing a telecommunications facility within the rights-of-way. An
operator of a telecommunications facility within the City rights-of-way on
the date of enactment of this article (July 10, 2001) shall be required to
Register on the effective date of this article except as provided in Section
4-70. The registration shall include the following information:



      (1)   name of the applicant;



      (2)   name, address and telephone number of the applicant's
primary contact person in connection with the registration, and the person to
contact in case of an emergency;



      (3)   for registrations submitted prior to October 1, 2001,
the applicant shall state whether it provides local service or toll service,
or both;



      (4)   evidence of the insurance coverage required under this
article and acknowledgment that registrant has received and reviewed a copy
of this article; which acknowledgment shall not be deemed an agreement; and



      (5)   the number of the applicant's certificate of
authorization or license to provide communications services issued by the
Florida Public Service Commission, the Federal Communications Commission, or
other federal or state authority, if any; or



      (6)   for an applicant that does not provide a Florida Public
Service Commission certificate of authorization number, if the applicant is a
corporation, proof of authority to do business in the State of Florida, such
as the number of the certificate from or filing with the Florida Department
of State.



   (b)   Every private communications system owner must register as
provided for in this article.



   (c)   No registration shall be transferred or assigned in whole or
in part by registrant without prior written approval of the City Manager or
designee, which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld. Any transfer of
a registration shall be subject to the requirements of this article. If the
transferee is already a Registrant, no such approval shall be required.



Sec. 4-60. Reseller.



   A reseller is a person who has entered into an agreement with a
registrant to utilize the registrant's telecommunications facility to provide
telecommunications services. A reseller is not required to register, so long
as it does not own underlying facilities in the rights-of-way and is not
involved in construction or repair of the underlying facilities in the
rights-of-way. Notwithstanding a registrant's right to permit a reseller to
use its telecommunications facility, the registrant shall remain responsible
for all terms and conditions contained in this article.



Sec. 4-61. Renewal/termination of registration.



   A registration shall become effective on the date of the written
acknowledgment by the City. A registration shall be renewed with the City by
April 1 of each even numbered year. Within thirty (30) days of any change in
the information required to be submitted pursuant to this Article, a
registrant shall provide updated information to the City. Failure to renew a
registration may result in the City restricting the issuance of additional
permits until the operator has complied with the registration provisions of
this article.



Sec. 4-62. Compensation required.



   (a)   The occupancy fee imposed herein became void and no longer in
effect on October 1, 2001, pursuant to Florida law.



Sec. 4-63. Registration for persons providing different types of services.



   The fact that any occupancy fee is paid on one type of service provided
over a telecommunications facility does not excuse an operator from its duty
to pay fees on other types of services provided over that same facility as
required by this article or other City ordinances. As an example, and not as
a limitation of the foregoing, a cable operator who pays a franchise fee on
revenues derived from the provision of cable services must pay an occupancy
fee under Section 4-62 of this article to the extent that the operator
maintains telecommunications facilities; likewise, the operator of a
telecommunications facility must pay a franchise fee under Chapter 4, Article
II of the City Code, to the extent it provides cable services to subscribers
via a cable system.



Sec. 4-64. General conditions upon use of rights-of-way.



   (a)   Responsibility for costs. An operator, or its contractors or
subcontractors, who is required to perform under this article, shall do so at
its own cost. If an operator fails to perform work that it is required to
perform within the time provided for performance, the City may perform the
work, and bill the operator therefor. The operator shall pay the amounts
billed within thirty (30) days. Prior to performing work pursuant to this
section, the City shall give the operator written notice and a reasonable
opportunity to cure; provided, however, that no notice shall be required in
the event that the failure presents an immediate threat to public health,
safety, or welfare as determined by the City in its sole discretion.



   (b)   Right to use rights-of-way not warranted. It is understood
that there may from time to time be within the City various rights-of-way
which the City does not have the unqualified right to authorize the operator
to use; therefore, registration under this article does not warrant or
represent that the City has the right, as to any particular right-of-way, or
portion of a right-of-way, to authorize the operator to install or maintain
portions of its facility therein, and in each case the burden and
responsibility for making such determination in advance of the installation
shall be upon the operator.



   (c)   Responsibilities of operator.



      (1)   In installing, maintaining, operating or removing its
telecommunications facility, in, upon, or from any City right-of-way, the
operator shall ensure:



         a.   That the safety, functioning and appearance of the
right-of-way and the convenience and safety of users of the rights-of-way and
other persons not be affected by the installation, construction, or removal
of the telecommunications facility.



         b.   That the cost of the installation, construction,
operation, or removal of the telecommunications facility shall be borne by
the operator or user, or a combination of such parties.



         c.   That the damages caused by the installation,
construction, operation, or removal of such telecommu-nications facility by
the operator shall be the responsibility of the operator.



      (2)   Nothing herein shall be construed to prohibit or prevent
any property owner from constructing, installing, or continuing to maintain
and operate a private communications facility subject to the provisions of
this article; provided, however, that the construction, installation,
maintenance, and operation of such private communications facility shall not
prevent an operator of a telecommunications facility from constructing,
installing, maintaining, and operating its facility.



      (3)   This section is not intended to, and nothing herein
shall be construed to, preclude appropriate payments, arrangements, or
agreements for the use by operators of other utilities' facilities and
equipment, including pole attachment and conduit agreements.



   (d)   Other agreements, permit, and easement requirements. The City
shall not be required to assume any responsibility for securing any
rights-of-way, easements, or other rights which may be required of the
registrant for the installation of a telecommunications facility, nor shall
the City be responsible for securing any permits or agreements with other
persons or utilities.



   (e)   No property rights conveyed. Nothing in this article or in the
registration shall grant to the holder any property rights in City-owned
property or rights-of-way, nor shall the City be compelled to maintain any of
its property or rights-of-way any longer than, or in any other fashion than,
the City, in its judgment, may require for its own needs. In addition, unless
otherwise provided by Florida law, the registrant shall not be entitled to
any compensation for damages from the City as a result of having to remove or
relocate its property, lines, and cables from such public property or
rights-of-way in the event the City determines, in its sole and absolute
discretion, that a necessity exists for such removal or relocation. The City
makes no warranties or representations regarding the fitness, suitability, or
availability of the City's public rights-of-way for the registrant's
communications facilities and any performance of work, costs incurred or
services provided by registrant shall be at registrant's sole risk. Nothing
in this article shall affect the City's authority to add, vacate or abandon
public rights-of-way, and the City makes no warranties or representations
regarding the availability of any added, vacated, or abandoned public
rights-of-way for communications facilities.



   (f)   Construction permits required. The registrant shall apply for
and obtain permits for construction as required by the City prior to the
commencement of construction. Pursuant to the provisions of Section
337.401(3)(c)b and Section 202.201(1) and (2), Florida Statutes, no fees
shall be charged for the processing and/or issuance of such permits.



   (g)   Prior approval by the City. The registrant must comply at all
times with all policies, procedures, and directives of the City's Public
Works Department, provided such policies, procedures, and directives are not
in conflict with the provisions of this article. The registrant shall not
erect any pole, run any cable, conduit, fiber optic, or other pathway, nor
shall any construction on rights-of-way related to the delivery of
telecommunications services be commenced without the prior written approval
of the City's Public Works Department. Prior to the issuance of such approval
and permit, the registrant shall submit to the City's Public Works
Department, the following:



      (1)   If required by the City, copies of construction plans in
a digital format acceptable to the City, if prepared, utilizing computer
aided drafting/geographic information systems ("CAD/GIS") or another
automated system capable of exporting a file compatible with CAD/GIS, of the
proposed telecommunications facility illustrating plant routing and utility
poles, if any, to be utilized.



   (h)   City's right to inspect. The City shall have and maintain the
right to inspect the installation and construction operations, as well as the
maintenance operations of the registrant's telecommunications facility to
ensure the proper performance of the terms of this article.



   (i)   Joint or common use of poles. The registrant shall be
encouraged to enter into agreements for the joint or common use of poles or
other wire holding structures where poles or other wire holding structures
already exist for use in serving the City or serving the public convenience,
if authorized by the City Engineer subject to Section 4-37 and Section 25-120
of the City Code. No location of any pole or wire holding structure of the
registrant shall be a vested interest, and such pole or structure shall be
removed or modified by the registrant at its own expense, to the extent
required by state or local law.



   (j)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, pledges
in trust or mortgages of the assets of a registrant's telecommunications
facility to secure the construction, operation or repair of the facility may
be made without application and without the City's prior written consent;
except, no such arrangement may be made if it would in any respect or under
any condition prevent the telecommunications facility operator or any
successor from complying with the registration and applicable law. Any
mortgage, pledge, or lease shall be subject and subordinate to the rights of
the City under this article or other applicable law.



   (k)   Location or relocation of facilities.



      (1)   The telecommunications facilities of any party who
registers with the City pursuant to the provisions of this article, shall,
subject to the approval of the city engineer and pursuant to the rules of the
Florida Public Service Commission and Chapter 25-4, Florida Administrative
Code, install new facilities and replacement facilities, where existing
aerial facilities are being retired and removed from service, underground
regardless of location of existing facilities, unless such overhead
facilities exist within interior side yards and/or rear yards of developed
residential properties, and shall be installed underground in areas where
existing power and other facilities are installed underground.



      (2)   A registrant shall not place any fixtures or equipment
where the same will unnecessarily interfere with any existing gas, electric,
CATV, telephone, sewer, drainage or water lines, fixtures or equipment or
other users having rights to place a facility within rights-of-way. The
registrant shall locate its lines and equipment in such a manner as not to
interfere unnecessarily with the usual travel on rights-of-way; with the
installation or operation of gas, electric, CATV, telephone, water, drainage,
or sewer lines equipment; or with the rights or reasonable convenience of
owners of property which abut any rights-of-way.



      (3)   A registrant shall have the authority to trim trees upon
or overhanging streets, alleys, sidewalks, and rights-of-way so as to prevent
the branches of such trees from coming in contact with the wires and cables
of the registrant in a manner approved by and acceptable to the City,
pursuant to the provisions of Section 18-3 of the City Code. If the City
notifies the registrant of the need for tree trimming and the registrant
fails to take the appropriate action within a time prescribed by the City,
the City may, at its option, cause such trimming to be done by the City or a
third party under the City's supervision and direction at the expense of the
registrant.



      (4)   A registrant shall promptly, at its own expense,
protect, temporarily disconnect, remove, modify, or relocate any part of its
facility when required by the City by reason of its unreasonably interfering
in any way with the convenient, safe, or continuous use, or the maintenance,
improvement, extension, or expansion of rights-of-way or for any other reason
required by applicable law, upon thirty (30) days’ written notice.



      (5)   A registrant shall, at the request of any person holding
a building moving permit issued by the City, temporarily raise or lower its
wires to permit the moving of the building(s). The expense of such temporary
removal or raising or lowering of wires shall be paid by the person
requesting same, and the registrant shall have the authority to require such
payment in advance.



      (6)   With regard to underground construction, all cables
shall be buried at a sufficient depth so that no portion of the service drop
is exposed or visible.



   (l)   Work in the rights-of-way. All materials, installations, and
construction in any rights-of-way under the City's jurisdiction shall be in
accordance with the Engineering Standards.



      (1)   A registrant shall obtain any required rights-of-way
permits before causing any damage or disturbance to rights-of-way as a result
of its construction or operations and shall restore the property to its
former condition in a manner approved by the City. If such restoration is not
performed or is not satisfactorily performed, the City, after ten (10) days'
prior written notice to the registrant, may cause the repairs to be made at
the expense of the registrant. Prior to performing work pursuant to this
section, the City shall give the operator notice and a reasonable opportunity
to cure; provided, however, that no notice shall be required in the event
that the failure presents an immediate threat to public health, safety, or
welfare as determined by the City in its sole discretion. All additional or
recurring repairs required as a result of the unsatisfactory work may also be
made by the City at the expense of the registrant.



      (2)   A registrant installing and operating a
telecommunications facility in Cooper City rights-of-way, except in the event
of an emergency, shall provide at least seven (7) days (or such shorter
period as the City may accept) prior notice to the residents of the affected
area, as determined by the City, when construction crews will be performing
construction or maintenance that will block a travel lane used by residents
of the affected rights-of-way for more than two (2) hours. Such notification
shall be by mail, through the placement of notices on the front doorknobs of
residences in the affected area, or by the posting of signs at locations
designated by the City, with such notices providing the name and telephone
number of the registrant.



      (3)   All vehicles utilized by a Registrant or its contractors
or subcontractors in the construction of a telecommunications facility shall
be clearly marked providing the name of the registrant, contractor or
subcontractor, and, if applicable, the Cooper City and Broward County
occupational license numbers as required by the both jurisdiction's Code of
Ordinances. All personnel employed by a registrant or its contractors or
subcontractors in the construction of a telecommunications facility shall
possess identification providing the employee's name, and the name and
telephone number of the registrant, or its contractors or subcontractors.



      (4)   The registrant must utilize the State authorized
underground locate service prior to any excavation or demolition activities
conducted in construction of the telecommunications facility. Only state
licensed and/or Broward County certified contractors may be utilized for this
construction.



      (5)   All underground crossings of paved roadways shall be
made by the directional bore method unless the City Engineering Division
approves an alternate method prior to the construction.



   (m)   Safety of the public.



      (1)   A registrant's work performance, equipment, and job
sites shall be in compliance at all times with all applicable county, state
and federal requirements and shall conform to the provisions of the
Engineering Standards. All work while in progress shall be properly protected
at all times with suitable barricades, flags, lights, flares, or other
devices as are required by the United States Department of Transportation's
Manual of Uniform Traffic Control Devices (MUTCD), latest edition, or any
requirements of the City's public works department, to protect all members of
the public while such work is being performed.



      (2)   A registrant shall at all times employ due care and
shall install, maintain, and use commonly accepted methods and devices for
preventing failures and accidents which are likely to cause damage, injuries,
or nuisances to the public. All structures and all lines, equipment and
connections in, over, under, and upon the rights-of-way of the City wherever
situated or located shall at all times be kept and maintained in a safe,
suitable, substantial condition, and in good order and repair.



   (n)   Removal required. To the extent that it is determined by the
City to be in the best interest of the health, safety, and welfare of the
public, a registrant shall at its own expense, upon notice, promptly remove
from the rights-of-way covered by this article all portions of the
telecommunications facility and its appurtenances.



   (o)   Restoration required.



      (1)   In the event of such removal as referenced in subsection
(n) above, the registrant shall promptly and reasonably restore the
rights-of-way area from which such property was removed to the condition
existing prior to the disruption of the rights-of-way area and in accordance
with the Engineering Standards.



      (2)   If a registrant fails to properly and promptly restore
the area, the City, at its election, may restore the rights-of-way area and
cause forfeiture of the permanent performance bond in order to reimburse the
City for any costs and expenses it incurs for restoring the area. Prior to
performing work pursuant to this section, the City shall give the operator
notice and a reasonable opportunity to cure as provided in Section 4-64(l)
(2); provided, however, that no notice shall be required in the event that
the failure presents an immediate threat to public health, safety, or
welfare, as determined by the City in its sole discretion.



   (p)   Wireless facilities; use of poles.



      (1)   A wireless facility that is a portion of a
communications facility, such as an antenna ("wireless facility(ies)"), which
is attached to a legally maintained vertical structure in the public
rights-of-way, such as a light pole or utility pole ("vertical
structure(s)"), shall be subject to the following criteria:



         (i)   such wireless facilities may not extend more than
twenty (20) feet above the highest point of the vertical structure;



         (ii)   such wireless facilities that are attached to a
vertical structure located in public rights-of-way that are fifteen (15) feet
or less in width and are located adjacent to real property used as a
single-family residence shall be flush mounted to the vertical structure;



         (iii)   such wireless facilities shall not have any type
of lighted signal, lights or illuminations unless required by an applicable
federal, state, or local rule, regulation, or law;



         (iv)   such wireless facilities shall comply with any
applicable Federal Communications Commission Emissions Standards;



         (v)   the design, construction, and installation of such
wireless facilities shall comply with the applicable provisions of the
Florida Building Code, as may be amended from time to time;



         (vi)   no commercial advertising or signage shall be
allowed on such wireless facilities;



         (vii)   Any accessory equipment and related housing in
the public rights-of-way that are used in conjunction with such a wireless
facility shall comply with any applicable local rules, regulations,
ordinances, or laws governing the placement and design of such equipment.



      (2)   Vertical structures, such as towers, whose sole purpose
is to serve as a mounting device for antennae, are expressly prohibited from
being placed in the public rights-of-way unless applicable zoning and land
use laws or regulations allow such structures to be placed within the zoning
district in which such public rights-of-way are located or to which they are
adjacent.



   (q)   Whenever any registrant must install any portion of their
facilities above-ground in the public rights-of-way, other than when
authorized to mount such facilities on existing poles, such ground mounted
facilities shall:



      (1)   be placed a minimum of six (6) feet from any paved area;



      (2)   be limited to a height no greater than two feet
(twenty-four inches);



      (3)   be spaced a minimum of forty (40) feet apart from like
facilities of the same registrant or of other registrants or be grouped
together within the public right-of-way and/or easement and shielded by the
required shrubbery;



      (4)   be shielded from the paved right-of-way by shrubs or
other plantings, which shall be maintained at a minimum height of twenty-four
(24) inches and a maximum height of thirty (30) inches by the registrant;



      (5)   be painted or manufactured in a green color; and



      (6)   when installed within an easement on private property,
the property owner shall be consulted as to the appropriate location and the
required shrubs shall surround the facility installation.



      (7)   Registrants who cannot meet the requirements of this
subsection may request a waiver from the strict and literal terms hereof, at
the time of applying for required building permits, by submitting a request,
sealed by an engineer, detailing which provisions cannot be complied with,
the reasons for such non-compliance and suggested alternatives thereto. Said
submittal shall be reviewed by the City Engineer and approved or rejected by
the Engineer and the City Manager, in their sole and exclusive discretion.



Sec. 4-64.1. Local communications services tax rate.



   (a)   The City hereby invokes its authority in accordance with
Section 337.401(3)(c)1, Florida Statutes, to adjust its local communications
services tax rates, as set forth in Section 202.20(1)(a) and (b), Florida
Statutes, and in Section 202.19(2)(a), Florida Statutes, upward by 0.12% in
lieu of requiring and collecting permit fees from any provider of
communications services, for the period beginning on October 1, 2001 and
continuing thereafter. The Florida Communications Services Tax Simplification
Act ("Act") is designed to be revenue neutral. Consistent with this specific
legislative intent of this Act, to maintain revenue neutrality, the City
hereby makes this adjustment.



   (b)   This upward adjustment shall be applied to the same
communication services subject to the local communications services tax rates
set forth in Section 202.20(1)(a) and (b), Florida Statutes, and in Section
202.19(2)(a), Florida Statutes. The City hereby declares that this adjustment
shall remain in effect until and unless otherwise expressly repealed by the
City.



   (c)   Section 337.401(3)(c)1, Florida Statutes, requires that the
City notify the Florida Department of Revenue, by certified mail postmarked
on or before July 16, 2001, of whether the City will elect to forego the
collection of permit fees. This statutory section permits the City to adjust
its local communications services tax rate by ordinance or resolution. In
accordance with these prerogatives, the City adopts this section. Likewise,
the City hereby declares that this article shall be its notice to the Florida
Department of Revenue of the City's election to require an upward adjustment
of the local communications services tax in lieu of collecting permit fees.



Sec. 4-65. Indemnification; insurance requirements.



   (a)   Indemnification.



      (1)   By operation of this article and as conditions precedent
to use of the City's rights-of-way and the effectiveness of its registration,
a registrant shall:



         a.   Release the City, its officers, elected officials,
agents and employees from and against any and all liability and
responsibility in or arising out of the construction, operation, or
maintenance of the telecommunications facility. No registrant shall sue the
City or seek any monetary damages or such other relief in connection with the
abovementioned matters, excepting situations involving the gross negligence
or willful misconduct of the City, its employees and/or agents;



         b.   Indemnify, hold harmless, and at the city
attorney's option, defend or pay for an attorney selected by the city
attorney to defend the City, its officers, agents and employees, against any
and all claims, losses, liabilities, and expenditures of any kind, including
attorney's fees, court costs, and expenses, accruing or resulting from any
and all claims, demands, or causes of action of any nature whatsoever
resulting from injuries or damage sustained by any person or property by
virtue of the registrant's construction, operation, or maintenance of the
telecommunications facility; and



         c.   Provide that the covenants and representations
relating to the indemnification provision shall survive the expiration or
termination of any registration with the City and continue in full force and
effect as to the registrant's responsibility to indemnify.



   (b)   Insurance; policy limits.



      (1)   Within thirty (30) days after the effective date of the
registration, and prior to any construction under the registration, the
registrant shall provide the City with proof of the required insurance either
through single policies or policies with an excess or umbrella rider. The
registrant shall maintain said insurance throughout the term of the
registration and said insurance shall include, at a minimum, the following
types of insurance coverage in amounts not less than shown:



         a.   Workers' compensation. Coverage to apply for all
employees for statutory limits in compliance with the applicable state and
federal laws. The policy must include employer's liability with a minimum
limits of $100,000.00 each accident.



         b.   Comprehensive general liability. Shall have minimum
limits of $1,000,000.00 per occurrence combined single limit for bodily
injury liability and property damage liability. This shall include premises
and/or operations, independent contractors, and subcontractors and/or
completed operations, broad form property damage, explosion, collapse and
underground (XCU) coverage and a contractual liability endorsement.



         c.   Business auto policy. Shall have minimum limits of
$500,000.00 per occurrence combined single limit for bodily injury liability
and property damage liability. This shall include owned, nonowned, and hired
vehicles.



         d.   In lieu of subsections (b)(1) a, through (1) c,
above, a registrant may self-insure the foregoing requirements. Self-insured
status must be confirmed with certification of same by presentation of
financial statements which are not more than one (1) year old, or a
certificate of coverage signed by an authorized representative of the
registrant. Information contained therein is subject to review and approval
by the city commission. A State of Florida self-insurance certification is
not satisfactory or adequate certification under this option.



      (2)   The insurance certificate obtained by a registrant in
compliance with this section shall be approved by the City and shall be filed
and maintained with the City Manager or designee during the term of the
registration. The certificate of insurance shall provide thirty (30) days
prior written notice to the City of any change, cancellation, and/or
non-renewal of the policy(ies).



      (3)   Upon thirty (30) days' notice, insurance requirements
may be changed and increased from time to time at the discretion of the
Commission to reflect changing liability exposure and limits.



      (4)   Nothing herein is intended as a limitation to the extent
of any legal liability of the registrant.



      (5)   Resident company and agent. All insurance policies,
letters of credit, and bonds as are required of a registrant in this section
shall be written by a company or companies authorized and qualified to do
business in the State of Florida, and have a minimum rating of "A" in Best's
Rating Guide.



      (6)   Certificates and renewals. Certificates and renewals of
all insurance coverage required shall be promptly filed by the registrant
with the City Manager or designee. Renewal certificates shall be filed with
the City no less than thirty (30) days prior to the policy expiration date.



      (7)   Additional insured. The City of Cooper City shall be
included as an additional insured on the comprehensive general liability.



      (8)   Premium payment. Companies issuing the insurance
policy(ies) shall have no recourse against the City for payment of any
premiums or assessments, and same shall be the sole responsibility of the
registrant.



      (9)   Neither the provisions of this section, nor the
acceptance of any bond by the City pursuant to this article, or any damages
received by the City thereunder, shall be construed to excuse performance by
a registrant or limit the liability of a registrant for damages to the full
amount of the bond or otherwise.



      (10)   If the operator has an existing certificate of
insurance filed with the City as a prerequisite to provide other services
such as cable television or open video systems, the operator's insurer may
amend the current certificate filed with the City to include the additional
related entities authorized by the City to provide telecommunications
services. The City may require an increase in the amount of coverage of
policy(ies) limits.



   (c)   Permanent performance and payment bond. Each registrant shall
within thirty (30) days of the effective date of its registration under this
article or within thirty (30) days of the City's written consent to the
transfer or assignment of a registration, furnish to the City a performance
bond in the form of cash or an irrevocable letter of credit issued by a
Florida bank or a federally insurance financial institution, a cashier's
check, a surety bond having a minimum rating of "A-1" in Best's Key Rating
Guide, or other negotiable instrument approved by the City Attorney in the
amount of one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00). The performance bond
shall be used to guarantee the compliance with performance requirements and
payment of all sums which may become due to the City under this article. The
performance bond shall be maintained in the full amount specified herein
throughout the term of the registration, and for one (1) year after the
registration expires or is terminated, without reduction or allowances for
any amounts which are withdrawn or paid pursuant to this article.



   (d)   All required insurance coverages and policies shall be without
a deductible unless approved by the City.



Sec. 4-66. Enforcement and remedies.



   (a)   The City Clerk is responsible for enforcing and administering
this article and the Clerk or designee is authorized to give any notice
required by law or under any registration. The City Clerk or designee is
authorized to seek information from any operator relative to this article, to
establish forms for submission of registrations and other information, and to
take all other actions necessary or appropriate to the administration of this
article. Registrations shall only be issued or revoked by action of the City
Manager or designee.



   (b)   Generally.



      (1)   The registration, or any provision thereof, shall not
constitute a waiver or bar to the exercise of any governmental right or
power, police power, or regulatory power of the City which may exist on the
effective date of the registration or which may become effective thereafter.



      (2)   The registration shall not convey title, equitable or
legal, in the rights-of-way. The registration is only to occupy rights-of-way
for the purposes stated in the registration and the registration may not be
alienated, assigned, or transferred except as permitted by this article.



      (3)   A transfer of a registration shall be submitted in
accordance with this article, except that, if the information provided by the
registrant/transferor under section 4-71 remains accurate, the transferee may
simply cross-reference the earlier registration.



Sec. 4-67. Theft, vandalism, tampering; violation.



   (a)   It is unlawful pursuant to section 812.14, Florida Statutes,
and a violation of this article for any person to:



      (1)   Willfully alter, tamper with, injure or knowingly suffer
to be injured any conduit, wire, line, cable, transformer, amplifier, or
other apparatus or device belonging to a utility line service in such a
manner as to cause loss or damage.



      (2)   Make or cause to be made any connection with any wire
without the consent of the utility.



      (3)   Use or receive the direct benefit from the use of a
utility knowing, or under such circumstances as would induce a reasonable
person to believe, that such direct benefits have resulted from any tampering
with, altering of, or injury to any connection, wire, conduit, line, cable,
transformer, amplifier, or other apparatus or device owned, operated, or
controlled by such utility, for the purpose of avoiding payment.



   This subsection shall not apply to permit the City to revoke a
registration to the extent such revocation is prohibited by federal
bankruptcy law.



   (b)   Procedures for revocation. A registration may be revoked by
the City in accordance with the following procedures:



      (1)   The City Manager or designee shall notify the
registrant, in writing, of the exact nature of the alleged violation(s)
constituting grounds for revocation and give the registrant sixty (60) days,
or such other greater amount of time as the City Manager or designee may
specify, to correct such violation(s) or to present facts and argument
refuting the alleged violation(s).



      (2)   If within the designated time the registrant does not
remedy and/or cease the alleged violation, or if corrective action is not
being actively and expeditiously pursued, the City Manager or designee may,
after giving the registrant an opportunity to meet upon not less than
fourteen (14) days written notice, revoke the registration if he/she
determines that such action is warranted.



      (3)   Prior to the meeting, the City Manager or designee may
order an administrative hearing. The City Manager shall initiate an
administrative proceeding by issuing an order which establishes the issue to
be addressed in the hearing and the procedures to be followed, and the City
Manager may appoint a hearing officer for the hearing. Said hearing officer
shall be a member of good standing of the Florida Bar engaged in the private
practice of law in Broward, Miami-Dade or Palm Beach County with experience
in areas related to telecommunications issues. Upon completion of the
hearing, the hearing officer shall issue a preliminary order. The Office of
the City Clerk shall publish notice in a newspaper of general circulation in
the county inviting public comment on the preliminary order. Parties to the
hearing and the public shall have thirty (30) calendar days to comment on the
preliminary order after publication of the notice. Within thirty (30) days
after the public comment period, the hearing officer shall decide whether or
not to revoke the registration in accordance with subsection 4, below.



      (4)   The hearing officer shall determine whether or not to
revoke the registration based on the comments provided, the evidence and
argument presented at the hearing, any recommendations of the City Manager or
designee, and other evidence of record. The hearing officer's determination
shall be reflected in a written opinion setting forth the reasons for his/her
decision.



      (5)   In the event of foreclosure or other judicial sale of
any of the facilities, equipment or property of the registrant located in the
City rights-of-way, the City Manager or designee shall, upon not less than
fourteen (14) days written notice, give a successful bidder an opportunity to
be heard prior to revoking the registration. If the City Manager or designee
decides to revoke the registration he/she shall do so by serving written
notice upon the registrant and the successful bidder, in which event the
registration and all rights and privileges of the registration will be
revoked ninety (90) calendar days after serving such notice, unless:



         a.   The City has approved the transfer of the
registration to the successful bidder; and



         b.   The successful bidder complies with the terms and
conditions of the registration and this article.



   (c)   Effect of termination or forfeiture. Upon termination of a
registration, whether by revocation, forfeiture, or otherwise, the registrant
shall be obligated to cease using the telecommunications facilities pursuant
to this article and to remove some or all of the registrant's facilities from
the rights-of-way and restore the rights-of-way to their proper condition.
Should the registrant neglect, refuse, or fail to remove such facility, the
City may remove the facility at the expense of the registrant. The obligation
of the registrant to remove facilities shall survive the termination of the
registration for a period of two (2) years. Notwithstanding the above, the
City may not require the registrant to remove any facilities that are used to
provide another service for which the registrant holds a valid franchise or
license issued by the City.



   (d)   Remedies cumulative. All remedies under this article and
pursuant to any registration are cumulative unless otherwise expressly
stated. The exercise of one remedy shall not foreclose use of another, nor
shall the exercise of a remedy or the payment of penalties relieve an
operator of its obligations to comply with its registration. Remedies may be
used singly or in combination; in addition, the City may exercise any rights
it has at law or equity. Recovery by the City of any amounts under insurance,
the performance bond, or otherwise does not limit an operator's duty to
indemnify the City in any way; nor shall such recovery relieve an operator of
its obligations under a registration, limit the amounts owed to the City, or
in any respect prevent the City from exercising any other right or remedy it
may have.



Sec. 4-69. Access to books and records.



   (a)   Each registrant shall provide the City access to all books and
records related to the construction, maintenance, or repair of the
telecommunications facility in the public right-of-way so that the City may
inspect and copy these books and records for the purpose of determining
compliance with this article. A registrant is responsible for obtaining or
maintaining the necessary possession or control of all books and records
related to the construction, maintenance, or repair of the telecommunications
facility, so that it can produce the documents upon request. Books and
records shall be maintained for a period of three (3) years, except that (1)
any record that is a public record shall be maintained for a greater period
of time if required by state law or (2) for a shorter period of time if not
in conflict with state law for certain categories of voluminous books and
records where the information contained therein can be derived simply from
other materials.



   (b)   For purposes of this article, the term "books and records"
shall be read expansively to include information in whatever format stored.
Books and records requested shall be produced to the City Manager or
designee, except as provided pursuant to subsection (c) below.



   (c)   If any books and records are too voluminous, or for security
reasons cannot be copied and moved, then a telecommunications facility
operator may request that the inspection take place at some other location
mutually agreed to by the City and the operator, provided that (1) the
operator must make necessary arrangements for copying documents selected by
the City after its review; and (2) the operator must pay all travel and
additional copying expenses incurred by the City (above those that would have
been incurred had the documents been produced in the City) in inspecting
those documents or having those documents inspected by a City designee.



   (d)   Without limiting the foregoing, the operator of a
telecommunications facility shall provide the City with the following
information or, in the case of documents created by the operator or its
affiliate, filing within ten (10) days of receipt:



      (1)   notices of deficiency or forfeiture related to the
operation of the telecommunications facility; and



      (2)   copies of any request for protection under bankruptcy
laws, or any judgment related to a declaration of bankruptcy by the
registrant or by any partnership or corporation that owns or controls the
registrant directly or indirectly.



   (e)   Retention of records; relation to privacy rights. Each
telecommunications facility operator shall take all reasonable steps
required, if any, to ensure that it is able to provide the City all
information which must be provided or may be requested under this article,
its registration, or applicable law. Each operator shall be responsible for
providing the City with only the information that it is permitted by law to
disclose.



   (f)   Reports. The City may require operators of telecommunications
facilities to maintain records and prepare reports relevant to determining
the compliance of the telecommunications facility operator with the terms and
conditions of this article and the registration.



   (g)   Maps. Each telecommunications facility operator shall maintain
accurate maps and improvement plans (it being understood that such maps and
plans may not be to scale) which show the location, size, and a general
description of all facilities installed in the rights-of-way and any power
supply sources (including voltages and connections). Maps shall be based upon
accurate up-dated data to verify location. The operator shall provide a map
to the City showing the location of its facilities as described in sections
4-64(f) and (g) as may be applicable. New maps shall be promptly submitted to
the City when the facility expands or is relocated. Copies of as-built maps
in a digital format acceptable to the City, if prepared, utilizing CAD/GIS or
other automated system capable of exporting a file compatible with CAD/GIS,
shall be submitted to the City's engineering division.



   (h)   Compliance with laws. Each operator shall comply with all
applicable laws heretofore and hereafter adopted or established during the
entire term of its registration.



   (i)   No waiver. The failure of the City to insist on timely
performance or compliance by any operator shall not constitute a waiver of
the City's right to later insist on timely performance or compliance by that
operator or any other person holding a registration.



   (j)   Powers reserved. The City expressly reserves the right to
amend this article from time-to-time in the exercise of its lawful powers and
shall, at a minimum, review all matters related to this article every three
(3) years.



Sec. 4-70. Transitional provisions.



   Within sixty (60) days from the effective date of this article, the
operator of a telecommunications facility who has executed a franchise
agreement with the City pursuant to Chapter 4 of this Code and/or is
currently occupying the right-of-way shall register with or provide the
Office of the City Clerk written notices that it desires to convert its
franchise agreement to a registration under this article. Any such operator
of a telecommunications facility who timely provides such notice shall be
provided written acknowledgment of registration from the Office of the City
Clerk, and shall be deemed to have converted its franchise to a registration
under this article as of the effective date of the registration. Such
registrant shall not be required to pay the registration fee required by
section 4-71(d) of this article for the first annual term of the registration.



DIVISION 2. REGISTRATION PROCESS FORTELECOMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES



Sec. 4-71. Registration, renewal, transfer.



   (a)   Registration required. In order to obtain an initial, renewal,
or transfer of a registration, an operator of a telecommunications facility
must complete and submit a registration to the Office of the City Clerk in
accordance with the requirements of this article. The registration must
contain such information as the City may from time to time require.



   (b)   Contents of a registration. All registrations, renewal, or
transfer shall be initiated by a submission of an original and two (2)
copies. All registrations shall be submitted to the City Clerk. The City has
the right to request additional information if the form is incomplete. All
completed registrations shall be available for public inspection and shall
include the names and addresses of persons authorized to act on behalf of the
operator with respect to the registration.



   (c)   A registration may be filed by any person on that person's own
initiative or in response to a request for proposals by the City.



   (d)   Registration filing fee.



      (1)   Except as provided in Section 4-70, every registration
shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable registration fee of two hundred fifty
dollars ($250.00).



      (2)   A registrant shall pay to the City a sum of money
sufficient to reimburse the City for all publication expenses it incurred, if
any, in connection with the granting of the specific registration pursuant to
the provisions of this article. Such payment shall be made to City within
thirty (30) days after the City furnishes the registrant with a written
statement of such expenses. All checks shall be made payable to the City of
Cooper City, and delivered to the Office of the City Clerk.



      (3)   Where the City's out-of-pocket costs in considering the
registration exceed the amount of the filing fee, such costs shall be paid by
the operator. Within thirty (30) calendar days of the effective date of the
registration, the City Manager or designee must notify the successful
registrant of the amount of any such costs and its method of calculation. If
the costs are not paid within sixty (60) calendar days of the effective date
of the registration, the registration shall be deemed null and void. Payment
under protest of the costs shall be a prerequisite to contesting the amount
of the out-of-pocket costs. Amounts paid under this subsection shall be
amortized over the term of the registration and shall be applied as a credit
against the occupancy fee.



   (e)   City review of application. The City Manager or designee shall
review the request for registration, or changes, renewal, or transfer
registration and may request such additional information as deemed necessary
in the review process and require such changes to the proposed use of the
City's rights-of-way as may be necessary and lawful in the exercise of the
City's authority over City roads and rights-of-way. Once the information
required by the City has been provided, the registration request shall be
promptly reviewed by the City and written acknowledgment of registration
shall be provided.



   (f)   In the case of a transfer of a registration, the City must
also determine that:



      (1)   proposed transferee agrees to be bound by all the
conditions of the registration and to assume all the obligations of its
predecessor; and



      (2)   any outstanding compliance and compensation issues are
resolved or preserved to the satis-faction of the City.



   (g)   An operator shall not be registered if it files or, in the
previous three (3) years, has filed materially misleading information in a
previous submission to the City, or a registration form is incomplete.



   (h)   Denial of a registration. The City's denial of a registration
shall be supported by written findings which may include, among other things,
past performance of the registrant and findings of a material violation of
this article, which shall be provided to the operator. The City shall provide
a reasonable opportunity for the operator to show that it would be
inappropriate for the City to deny the renewal, transfer or modification
under this article. A material violation of this article shall be deemed to
exist in the event any of the following exists or has occurred:



      (1)   Failure to pay registration filing fees pursuant to this
article;



      (2)   Operating in a manner inconsistent with the registration;



      (3)   Failure to perform work within the rights-of-way
pursuant to the requirements of Section 4-64 of this article;



      (4)   Failure to provide insurance and bonding requirements
pursuant to Section 4-65 of this article;



      (5)   Failure to comply with any provision of this article;
and/or



      (6)   Failure to reimburse City for any costs and expenses
incurred by City arising under this article.



   (i)   Acknowledgment of registration. Within thirty (30) calendar
days after the Office of the City Clerk's receipt of a completed registration
form, the Office of the City Clerk shall issue a written acknowledgment of
the registration when required by Section 4-71 of this article. All material
statements and declarations contained in the registration form shall be
incorporated in the operator's registration.



DIVISION 3. PRIVATE COMMUNICATIONS FACILITIES



Sec. 4-72. Private communications facilities.



   (a)   Submission of registration. A person desiring to construct,
install, operate, replace, reconstruct, or maintain a private communications
system in Cooper City is required to register with the City. The registration
shall only authorize placement of the facilities in a specific portion of the
rights-of-way for a limited and specific purpose in connection with the
person's business; however, it shall not encompass, in whole or in part, the
carriage of telecommunications for hire in the rights-of-way. Such request
shall be in the form identified in Section 4-71 of this article and must be
accompanied by the filing fee set forth in Section 4-71(d)(1).



   (b)   Conditions of registration. Any registration shall be subject
to such conditions as the City may from time to time establish, shall be
expressly subordinate to the use of the rights-of-way by operators of
telecommunications facilities, and shall otherwise conform to the
requirements of this article. Subject to the foregoing, the provisions of
this article shall be applicable to a private communications system as if it
were a telecommunications facility.



   (c)   Compensation. The owner of a private communications facility
shall pay an occupancy fee for the use of the rights-of-way. The fee for a
private communications facility shall be paid under the same terms and
conditions as established for registration fees in this article.

article. Such captions shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of this
article.

   Unless otherwise indicated, when the performance or doing of any act,
duty, matter, or payment is required under this article or any registration,
and a period of time for the fulfillment of same is prescribed herein, the
time shall be computed so as to exclude the first and include the last day of
the prescribed time period.



Sec. 4-75. Penalties.



   A violation of the provisions of this article shall subject a person to
civil penalties pursuant to Section 1-8 of this Code.



Sec. 4-76. Liability in case of emergency.



   If, at any time in case of fire, police action, disaster, or other
emergency, it shall appear necessary in the reasonable judgment of the City
to cut, move, or otherwise interfere with any of the wires, cables,
amplifiers, appliances, or appurtenances thereto of the registrant, the City
shall not be liable for any injury or damage to such property and equipment
of the registrant as a result of such cutting, moving, or interference. If
state or federal emergency funds are available, the City will reimburse
registrant to the extent possible.

considered the minimum reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on
scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur.
Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This ordinance
does not imply that land outside of mapped special flood hazard areas, or
that uses permitted within such flood hazard areas, will be free from
flooding or flood damage. The flood hazard areas and base flood elevations
contained in the Flood Insurance Study and shown on Flood Insurance Rate Maps
and the requirements of Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Sections 59 and
60 may be revised by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, requiring this
community to revise these regulations to remain eligible for participation in
the National Flood Insurance Program. No guaranty of vested use, existing
use, or future use is implied or expressed by compliance with this ordinance.



   (f)   Disclaimer of Liability. This ordinance shall not create
liability on the part of the City of Cooper City or by any officer or
employee thereof for any flood damage that results from reliance on this
ordinance or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder.



Sec. 6-69. Applicability.



   (a)   General. Where there is a conflict between a general
requirement and a specific requirement, the specific requirement shall be
applicable.



   (b)   Areas to which this ordinance applies. This ordinance shall
apply to all flood hazard areas within the City, as established in Section
6-69(c) of this ordinance.



   (c)   Basis for establishing flood hazard areas. The Flood Insurance
Study for Broward County, Florida and Incorporated Areas dated February 18,
2014, and all subsequent amendments and revisions, and the accompanying Flood
Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM), and all subsequent amendments and revisions to
such maps, are adopted by reference as a part of this ordinance and shall
serve as the minimum basis for establishing flood hazard areas. Studies and
maps that establish flood hazard areas are on file at the City of Cooper City
Growth Management Department, 9090 SW 50th Place, Cooper City, FL 33328.



   (d)   Submission of additional data to establish flood hazard areas.
To establish flood hazard areas and base flood elevations, pursuant to
Section 6-72 of this ordinance the Floodplain Administrator may require
submission of additional data. Where field surveyed topography prepared by a
Florida licensed professional surveyor or digital topography accepted by the
community indicates that ground elevations:



      (1)   Are below the closest applicable base flood elevation,
even in areas not delineated as a special flood hazard area on a FIRM, the
area shall be considered as flood hazard area and subject to the requirements
of this ordinance and, as applicable, the requirements of the Florida
Building Code.



      (2)   Are above the closest applicable base flood elevation,
the area shall be regulated as special flood hazard area unless the applicant
obtains a Letter of Map Change that removes the area from the special flood
hazard area.



   (e)   Other laws. The provisions of this ordinance shall not be
deemed to nullify any provisions of local, state or federal law.



   (f)   Abrogation and greater restrictions. This ordinance supersedes
any ordinance in effect for management of development in flood hazard areas.
However, it is not intended to repeal or abrogate any existing ordinances
including but not limited to land development regulations, zoning ordinances,
stormwater management regulations, or the Florida Building Code. In the event
of a conflict between this ordinance and any other ordinance, the more
restrictive shall govern. This ordinance shall not impair any deed
restriction, covenant or easement, but any land that is subject to such
interests shall also be governed by this ordinance.



   (g)   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this
ordinance, all provisions shall be:



      (1)   Considered as minimum requirements;



      (2)   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and



      (3)   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers
granted under state statutes.

   (h)   Conditions for issuance of variances. Variances shall be
issued only upon:



      (1)   Submission by the applicant, of a showing of good and
sufficient cause that the unique characteristics of the size, configuration,
or topography of the site limit compliance with any provision of this
ordinance or the required elevation standards;



      (2)   Determination by the Planning and Zoning Board that:



         a.   Failure to grant the variance would result in
exceptional hardship due to the physical characteristics of the land that
render the lot undevelopable; increased costs to satisfy the requirements or
inconvenience do not constitute hardship;



         b.   The granting of a variance will not result in
increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary
public expense, nor create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the
public or conflict with existing local laws and ordinances; and



         c.   The variance is the minimum necessary, considering
the flood hazard, to afford relief;



      (3)   Receipt of a signed statement by the applicant that the
variance, if granted, shall be recorded in the Broward County Public Records
in such a manner that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel
of land; and



      (4)   If the request is for a variance to allow construction
of the lowest floor of a new building, or substantial improvement of a
building, below the required elevation, a copy in the record of a written
notice from the Floodplain Administrator to the applicant for the variance
shall be provided, specifying the difference between the base flood elevation
and the proposed elevation of the lowest floor, stating that the cost of
federal flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk
resulting from the reduced floor elevation (up to amounts as high as $25 for
$100 of insurance coverage), and stating that construction below the base
flood elevation increases risks to life and property.



Sec. 6-75. Violations.

ARTICLE VII. NEIGHBORHOOD IMPROVEMENT PROGRAM.



Sec. 6-95. Purpose and uses.



   The purpose of this article is to provide guidelines for implementation
of the neighborhood improvement program (NIP). Implementation shall comply
with the intent and purposes as approved by the City Commission. The article
provides a description of the involvement and responsibilities of property
owners and City departments.



Sec. 6-96. Introduction.



   (a)   Neighborhood improvement program (NIP).



   It is the intent of the City Commission of the City of Cooper City to
implement a revolving loan program in order to promote proper maintenance of
properties throughout the City. The loan program is intended to assist
homeowners who have homes in disrepair and/or code violations who could not
otherwise afford to bring their properties up to City standards. The City
Commission has made a legislative finding that the expenditure of City funds
to assist in maintaining private property serves a legitimate public purpose
in enhancing and maintaining property values throughout the community.



   The program is a comprehensive code compliance and property improvement
program designed to help property owners improve properties and neighborhoods
with the assistance of interest-free loans and other incentives, as further
described in this article.



   The City has adopted Code standards that include paved driveways,
landscaping, and exterior housing conditions. Also, the City is required to
insure that properties meet Broward County's drainage codes.



   In addition, many owners have allowed their properties to deteriorate
due to the lack of sufficient funds to make required repairs and
improvements. As a result, signs of deterioration and blight are evident
throughout many of the City's older subdivisions. These negative effects
reduce property values and the standards of living.



   Owners of eligible properties will be financially assisted to achieve
compliance with code requirements and property maintenance.



   Property owners will be responsible for the following, as applicable:



      (1)   Compliance with parking requirements such as,
installation or repairs to new or existing parking and paved driveway aprons;



      (2)   Replacement of landscaping such as sod, shade trees and
perimeter hedges;



      (3)   Abate other apparent existing violations, such as zoning
and general property maintenance deficien-cies;



      (4)   Improve structure appearance and deterioration such as
cleaning and/or painting of exterior walls, repair or replace broken windows,
doors and roof.



   The City Manager improvements the program in accordance with City
Commission approvals. The City Manager is also authorized to resolve and
approve NIP issues and modifications which do not constitute a change in the
concept of the program.



   (b)   NIP elements.



   In order to address different types of code corrections and
improvements to properties in the priority areas, the City Commission
approved the following NIP program elements:



      (1)   Drainage and parking program. It assists property owners
in complying with the City's onsite parking, landscaping and drainage
requirements. It provides for:



         a.   installation of new or additional onsite paved
parking and driveway apron for the required number of parking spaces;



         b.   reconstruct asphalt or concrete pavement;



         c.   repair sidewalks;



         d.   wheel stops; and/or



         e.   re-grading of swales and installation of storm
drainage improvements.



      (2)   General property maintenance and repairs program. It
assists owners to improve the exterior condition of the property and
eliminate other code violations, such as:



         a.   repair or replace existing fences;



         b.   repair broken or energy deficient windows and
doors, and repair or replace roof;



         c.   replace sod;



         d.   replace shade trees;



         e.   replace hedges, including dead or missing plant
materials; and/or



         f.   repair existing irrigation systems.



      (3)   Exterior paint. It provides assistance for painting of
the exterior of the structure, including painting tile or cement roofs.
Interior painting is excluded.



   Under the paint program property owners would pressure clean, paint and
seal building exteriors to upgrade the appearance and durability of
structures. Pressure cleaning and sealant application are required to ensure
a quality and longer-lasting paint application.



   The loan limits for the program are as follows:



         a.   Parking, general property maintenance and repairs
(total for programs 1 and 2, above): $5,000 for single-family and residential
properties, up to four (4) units.



         b.   Painting (total for program 3, above): $1,500 for
single-family and residential properties, up to four (4) units.



   (c)   Program Administration. The Director of Growth Management is
the NIP project manager. The Director reports to the City Manager and is
responsible for the administration, monitoring, and all required coordination
to effectively implement the program.



   The Planning Division is the centralized point of contact and will
coordinate, maintain and provide all technical, legal and financial
information on properties participating in the NIP program.



Sec. 6-97. NIP program eligibility.



   (a)   Priority areas and properties. Properties which have
outstanding code compliance citations or a report of structural and/or code
deficiencies certified by the Building Division shall have priority over
other properties within the program.



   (b)   Types of properties. Eligible types of properties under the
NIP program, include the following:



      (1)   single family residences; and



      (2)   duplex and other structures containing up to four (4)
residential units.



   Residential units are defined as units providing complete, independent
living facilities for families, including permanent provisions for living,
sleeping, eating, cooking and sanitation.



   (c)   Building Division inspection and survey of eligible
properties. The Building Division is responsible for the enforcement of
health, safety, sanitation, and other City codes. It conducts daily
inspections in designated areas of the City, to ensure all residential and
nonresidential properties are maintained in accordance with City codes, and
to identify violations. When necessary, notices of violation are issued to
owners and tenants to obtain compliance with applicable codes. In cases of
noncompliance, the Division issues civil citations to violators.



   Owners of properties surveyed, regardless of the degree of
noncompliance exhibited, will be given notification of deficiencies, obtained
from the survey. They will also be provided notification packets containing
the corrective actions and available NIP program incentives and application
documentation.



   To be eligible for participation in the NIP program, property owners
must respond to the City's offer for a loan within ninety (90) days of
receipt of notice.



   Owners failing to apply for a loan within ninety (90) days will be
ineligible for that assistance, and may be subject to issuance of notices of
violation and further enforcement action to ensure compliance.



   (d)   Owner's inquiry on the NIP program. If a property owner has
not received notification of deficiencies from the City and is interested in
obtaining information on the NIP program and/or eligibility for his/her
property, he/she must contact the Planning Division and provide personal and
property information. The Planning Division will verify the information
received and the case will be referred to the Building Division for
inspection and survey.



   (e)   Waiting list. If NIP program funds are not available at the
time an application for loan is submitted to the City, owner's name and
location will be placed on a waiting list. The waiting list will be
maintained by the Planning Division and organized by the date the application
was received by the City. Processing of cases in the waiting list will be
subject to availability of funds. Priority will be given to those requests
involving health and welfare matters over aesthetics, i.e., roof repairs over
landscaping and/or painting.



Sec. 6-98. Loan application and processing.



   (a)   Application form and attachments. The application form
constitutes the main source of information to evaluate the applicant and the
property. A sample of the application form may be obtained in the offices of
the Planning Division during normal business hours. In addition to the
application form, the applicant must also submit photocopies of the following
documents:

the Broward County Property Appraiser's Office, or those with other
supportive legal documentation are allowed to complete and submit an
application for an NIP loan. Incomplete applications and/or missing
attachments will delay the acceptance and review of the loan application.



   (b)   Eligible work. The items listed in section 6-96(b) hereof are
eligible for funding under the neighborhood improvement program. Any item not
listed in the program can only be included, if such item is already installed
on the property and needs to be repaired or replaced. For example, the
improvement will not be a new addition to the property. Further, an item not
included on the list of eligible work and requested by the property owner,
must be reviewed and approved on a case-by-case basis by the Director of
Growth Management.



   (c)   Additional monies/funds from owner. Property owners must

proposed improvements. No final disbursement will be approved on the loan
until all the proposed improvements have been completed, including those not
directly funded by the NIP loan.



   (d)   Review of the application form. If the application is
complete, it will be reviewed by the Planning Division to determine
eligibility, property condition, and that improvements are in accordance with
program requirements. This review will include an inspection of the property
to verify proposed repairs and/or improvements are comprehensive of actual
work required to conform to the minimum code standards as well as Building
Division survey, and to substantiate that the loan amount requested by the
property owner is relative to the submitted cost estimates and scope of work.

      (1)   Finance.



      (2)   Growth Management.



      (3)   Public Works (if required by type of proposed
improvements), and/or



      (4)   Building.



   (e)   Loan approval. Upon the review and approval of all the
departments, the Planning Division will issue a conditional loan approval
letter. The loan closing will be subject to the receipt of contractor's
proposal(s), building permit(s), and signing of the loan promissory note.
From the date of notification of approval of the application, the property

categories:



      (1)   General contractors.



      (2)   Specialty contractors for paving, painting, roofing,
replacement of doors and windows.



   The City will not be responsible for any action, occurrence, negligence

and cause revocation of the loan approval.



   (c)   Promissory note and lien. As part of the requirements for
closing on the loan, owners must execute a loan promissory note. The Finance
Department may record a lien for the full amount of the loan in the public
records of Broward County.



   (d)   Inspections and disbursements. All requests and information
regarding property inspections, approvals, requests for payments and other

Division will send the permit information to the Broward County Property
Appraiser to properly update the assessed value of the property.



   (g)   Loan payments and responsibilities of property owner.



      (1)   Only 50% of the loan amount is to be paid interest free

construed to require that the assessment roll be in printed form if the
amount of the Fire Assessment for each parcel of property can be determined
by the use of a computer terminal available to the public.



(Ord. No. 10-7-1, §2, 7-20-10)

Sec. 7-30. Notice by mail.



   In addition to the published notice required by section 7-29, the city
manager shall provide notice, or direct the provision of notice, of the
proposed Fire Assessment by first class mail to the owners of each parcel of
property subject to the Fire Assessment. Such notice shall include (a) the
purpose of the Fire Assessment; (b) the rate of assessment to be levied

the assessment roll nor release or discharge any obligation for payment of a
Fire Assessment imposed by the city commission pursuant to this article.
Notwithstanding any provision of this section, the "Notice of Ad Valorem
Taxes and Non-Ad Valorem Assessments" which is sent to taxpayers within the
City by the Property Appraiser pursuant to the Uniform Collection Act shall
not be required to send any other or separate notice. (Ord. No. 10-7-1, §2,
7-20-10)

   At the time named in such notice, or to which an adjournment or
continuance may be taken by the city commission, the city commission shall
receive any written objections of interested persons, and may then, or at any
subsequent meeting of the city commission adopt the final assessment
resolution which shall (a) confirm, modify or repeal the initial assessment
resolution with such amendments, if any, as may be deemed appropriate by the
city commission; (b) establish the rate of assessment to be imposed in the
upcoming fiscal year and the maximum assessment for subsequent years, if
applicable; (c) approve the initial assessment roll, with such amendments as
it deems just and right; and (d) determine the method of collection. The
adoption of the final assessment resolution by the city commission shall
constitute a legislative determination that all parcels assessed derive a
special benefit from the fire services, facilities or programs to be provided
or constructed and a legislative determination that the Fire Assessments are
fairly and reasonably apportioned among the properties that receive the
special benefit. All objections to the final assessment resolution shall be
made in writing, and filed with the city clerk at or before the time or
adjourned time of such hearing. The final assessment resolution shall
constitute the annual rate resolution for the initial fiscal year in which
Fire Assessments are imposed or re-imposed hereunder. (Ord. No. 10-7-1, §2,
7-20-10)



Sec. 7-32. Effect on final assessment resolution.



   The Fire Assessments for the initial fiscal year shall be established
upon adoption of the final assessment resolution. The adoption of the final
assessment resolution shall be the final adjudication of the issues presented
(including, but not limited to, the determination of special benefit and fair
apportionment to the assessed property, the method of apportionment and
assessment, the initial rate of assessment, the initial assessment roll, and
the levy and lien of the Fire Assessments), unless proper steps shall be
initiated in a court of competent jurisdiction to secure relief within twenty
(20) days from the date of the city commission action on the final assessment
resolution. The initial assessment roll, as approved by the final assessment
resolution, shall be delivered to the tax collector, as required by the
Uniform Assessment Collection Act, or if the alternative method described in
section 7-40 hereof is used to collect the Fire Assessments, such other
official as the city commission by resolution shall designate. (Ord. No.
10-7-1, §2, 7-20-10)



Sec. 7-33. Adoption of annual rate resolution.



   (a)   The city commission shall adopt an annual rate resolution
during its budget adoption process for each fiscal year following the initial
fiscal year for which a Fire Assessment is imposed hereunder.



   (b)   The initial proceedings for the adoption of an annual rate
resolution shall be the adoption of a preliminary rate resolution by the city
commission (1) describing the method of assessing fire assessed costs against
assessed property located within the city; (2) directing the preparation of
an assessment roll; (3) providing for maximum assessments for subsequent
years, if applicable; and (4) authorizing a public hearing and directing the
provision of notice thereof.



   (c)   The annual rate resolution shall (1) establish the rate of
assessment to be imposed in the upcoming fiscal year and (2) approve the
assessment roll for the upcoming fiscal year with such adjustments as the
city commission deems just and right. The assessment roll shall be prepared
in accordance with the method of apportionment set forth in the initial
assessment resolution together with modifications, if any, and as confirmed
in the final assessment resolution or as provided in the preliminary rate
resolution.



   (d)   Nothing herein shall preclude the city commission from
providing annual notification to all owners of assessed property in the
manner provided in either or both sections 7-29 or 7-30 hereof.



   (e)   Nothing herein shall preclude the city commission from
establishing by resolution a maximum rate of assessment provided that notice
of such maximum assessment rate is provided pursuant to Sections 7-28 and
7-29 hereof.



   (f)   In the event (1) the proposed Fire Assessment for any fiscal
year exceeds the maximum rate of assessment adopted by the city commission
and included in notice previously provided to owners of assessed property
pursuant to sections 7-29 and 7-30 hereof, (2) the method of apportionment is
changed or the purpose for which the Fire Assessment is imposed is
substantially changed from that represented by notice previously provided to
the owners of assessed property pursuant to sections 7-29 and 7-30 hereof,
(3) assessed property is reclassified in a manner which results in an
increased Fire Assessment from that represented by notice previously provided
to the owners of assessed property pursuant to sections 7-29 and 7-30 hereof;
or (4) an assessment roll contains assessed property that was not included on
the assessment roll approved for the prior fiscal year, notice shall be
provided by publication and first class mail to the owners of such assessed
property. Such notice shall substantially conform with the notice
requirements set forth in sections 7-29 and 7-30 hereof and inform the owner
of the date, time and place for the adoption of the annual rate resolution.
The failure of the owner to receive such notice due to mistake or
inadvertence, shall not affect the validity of the assessment roll nor
release or discharge any obligation for payment of a Fire Assessment imposed
by the city commission pursuant to this article.



   (g)   As to any assessed property not included on an assessment roll
approved by the adoption of the final assessment resolution or a prior year's
annual rate resolution, the adoption of the succeeding annual rate resolution
shall be the final adjudication of the issues presented as to such assessed
property (including, but not limited to, the determination of special benefit
and fair apportionment to the assessed property, the method of apportionment
and assessment, the rate of assessment, the assessment roll, and the levy and
lien of the Fire Assessments), unless proper steps shall be initiated in a
court of competent jurisdiction to secure relief within twenty (20) days from
the date of the city commission action on the annual rate resolution. Nothing
contained herein shall be construed or interpreted to affect the finality of
any Fire Assessment not challenged within the required twenty (20) day period
for those Fire Assessments imposed against assessed property by the inclusion
of the assessed property on an assessment roll approved in the final
assessment resolution or any subsequent annual rate resolution.



   (h)   The assessment roll, as approved by the annual rate
resolution, shall be delivered to the tax collector as required by the
Uniform Assessment Collection Act, or if the alternative method described in
section 7-40 hereof is used to collect the Fire Assessments, such other
official as the city commission by resolution shall designate. If the Fire
Assessment against any property shall be sustained, reduced or abated by the
court, an adjustment shall be made on the assessment roll.



   (i)   The City Manager may, from time to time, cause a new Fire
Assessment rate study to be conducted so as to aid the City Commission in
considering and adopting a Final Assessment Resolution, and shall provide for
the final results of said rate study to be posted on the City's website for
convenient public access. (Ord. No. 10-7-1, §2, 7-20-10)



Sec. 7-34. Lien of Fire Assessments.



   Upon the adoption of the assessment roll, all Fire Assessments shall
constitute a lien against assessed property equal in rank and dignity with
the liens of all state, county, district or municipal taxes and special
assessments. Except as otherwise provided by law, such lien shall be superior
in dignity to all other prior liens, mortgages, titles and claims, until
paid. The lien for a Fire Assessment shall be deemed perfected upon adoption
by the city commission of the final assessment resolution or the annual rate
resolution, whichever is applicable. The lien for a Fire Assessment collected
under the Uniform Assessment Collection Act shall attach to the property
included on the assessment roll as of the prior January 1, the lien date for
ad valorem taxes imposed under the tax roll. The lien for a Fire Assessment
collected under the alternative method of collection provided in section 7-30
shall be deemed perfected upon adoption by the city commission of the final
assessment resolution or the annual rate resolution, whichever is applicable,
and shall attach to the property on such date of adoption. (Ord. No. 10-7-1,
§2, 7-20-10)



Sec. 7-35. Revisions to Fire Assessments.



   If any Fire Assessment made under the provisions of this article is
either in whole or in part annulled, vacated, or set aside by the judgment of
any court, or if the city commission is satisfied that any such Fire
Assessment is so irregular or defective that the same cannot be enforced or
collected, or if the city commission has omitted any property on the
assessment roll which property should have been so included, the city
commission may take all necessary steps to impose a new Fire Assessment
against any property benefited by the fire rescue assessed costs, following
as nearly as may be practicable, the provisions of this article and in case
such second Fire Assessment is annulled, vacated or set aside, the city
commission may obtain and impose other Fire Assessments until a valid Fire
Assessment is imposed. (Ord. No. 10-7-1, §2, 7-20-10)



Sec. 7-36. Procedural irregularities.



   Any informality or irregularity in the proceedings in connection with
the levy of any Fire Assessment under the provisions of this article shall
not affect the validity of the same after the approval thereof, and any Fire
Assessment as finally approved shall be competent and sufficient evidence
that such Fire Assessment was duly levied, that the Fire Assessment was duly
made and adopted, and that all other proceedings adequate to such Fire
Assessment were duly had, taken and performed as required by this article;
and no variance from the directions hereunder shall be held materials unless
it be clearly shown that the party objecting was materially injured thereby.
Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, any party objecting to a Fire
Assessment imposed pursuant to this article must file an objection with a
court of competent jurisdiction within the time periods prescribed herein.
(Ord. No. 10-7-1, §2, 7-20-10)



Sec. 7-37. Correction of errors and omissions.



   (a)   No act of error or omission on the part of the property
appraiser, tax collector, city manager, city commission or their deputies or
employees, shall operate to release or discharge any obligation for payment
of a Fire Assessment imposed by the city commission under the provisions of
this article.



   (b)   When it shall appear that any Fire Assessment should have been
imposed under this article against a parcel of property specially benefited
by the provision of fire services, facilities or programs, but that such
property was omitted from the assessment roll or was not listed on the tax
roll as an individual parcel of property as of the effective date of the
assessment roll approved by the annual rate resolution for any upcoming
fiscal year, the city commission may, upon provision of a notice by mail
provided to the owner of the omitted parcel in the manner and form provided
in section 7-30, impose the applicable Fire Assessment for the fiscal year in
which such error is discovered, in addition to the applicable Fire Assessment
due for the prior two fiscal years. Such Fire Assessment shall constitute a
lien against assessed property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of
all state, county, district, or municipal taxes and special assessments, and
superior in rank and dignity to all other prior liens, mortgages, titles and
claims in and to or against the real property involved, shall be collected as
provided herein, and shall be deemed perfected on the date of adoption of the
resolution imposing the omitted or delinquent assessments.



   (c)   Prior to the delivery of the assessment roll to the tax
collector in accordance with the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, the city
manager shall have the authority at any time, upon his or her own initiative
or in response to a timely filed petition from the owner of any property
subject to a Fire Assessment, to reclassify property based upon presentation
of competent and substantial evidence, and correct any error in applying the
Fire Assessment apportionment method to any particular parcel of property not
otherwise requiring the provision of notice pursuant to the Uniform
Assessment Collection Act. Any such correction shall be considered valid ab
initio and shall in no way affect the enforcement of the Fire Assessment
imposed under the provisions of this article. All requests from affected
property owners for any such changes, modifications or corrections shall be
referred to and processed by, the city manager and not the property appraiser
or tax collector.



   (d)   After the assessment roll has been delivered to the tax
collector in accordance with the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, any
changes, modifications or corrections thereto shall be made in accordance
with the procedures applicable to correcting errors and insolvencies on the
tax roll upon timely written request and direction of the city manager. (Ord.
No. 10-7-1, §2, 7-20-10)



Sec. 7-38. Interim assessments.



   An interim Fire Assessment shall be imposed against all property for
which a certificate of occupancy is issued after adoption of the annual rate
resolution. The amount of the interim Fire Assessment shall be calculated
upon a monthly rate, which shall be one-twelfth (1/12) of the annual rate for
such property computed in accordance with the annual rate resolution for the
fiscal year in which the certificate of occupancy is issued. Such monthly
rate shall be imposed for each full calendar month remaining in the fiscal
year. In addition to the monthly rate, the interim Fire Assessment shall also
include an estimate of the subsequent fiscal year's Fire Assessment. No
certificate of occupancy shall be issued until full payment of the interim
Fire Assessment is received by the city. Issuance of the certificate of
occupancy by mistake or inadvertence, and without the payment in full of the
interim Fire Assessment, shall not relieve the owner of such property of the
obligation of full payment. For the purpose of this provision, such interim
Fire Assessment shall be deemed due and payable on the date the certificate
of occupancy was issued and shall constitute a lien against such property as
of that date. Said lien shall be equal in rank and dignity with the liens of
all state, county, district or municipal taxes and special assessments, and
superior in rank and dignity to all other liens, encumbrances, titles and
claims in and to or against the real property involved and shall be deemed
perfected upon the issuance of the certificate of occupancy. (Ord. No.
10-7-1, §2, 7-20-10)



Sec. 7-39. Method of collection.



   (a)   Unless otherwise directed by the city commission, the Fire
Assessments shall be collected pursuant to the uniform method provided in the
Uniform Assessment Collection Act, and the city shall comply with all
applicable provisions of the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. Any hearing
or notice required by this article may be combined with any other hearing or
notice required by the Uniform Assessment Collection Act.



   (b)   The amount of a Fire Assessment to be collected using the
uniform method pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act for any
specific parcel of benefited property may include an amount equivalent to the
payment delinquency, delinquency fees and recording costs for a prior year's
assessment for a comparable service, facility or program provided, (1) the
collection method used in connection with the prior year's assessment did not
employ the use of the uniform method of collection authorized by the Uniform
Assessment Collection Act, (2) notice is provided to the owner as required
under the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, and (3) any lien on the affected
parcel for the prior year's assessment is supplanted and transferred to such
Fire Assessment upon certification of a non-ad valorem roll to the tax
collector by the city. (Ord. No. 10-7-1, §2, 7-20-10)



Sec. 7-40. Alternative method of collection.



   In lieu of utilizing the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, the city
may elect to collect the Fire Assessments by any other method which is
authorized by law or under the alternative collection method provided by this
section:



   (a)   The city shall provide Fire Assessment bills by first class
mail to the owner of each affected parcel of property. The bill or
accompanying explanatory material shall include (1) a brief explanation of
the Fire Assessment, (2) a description of the unit of measurement used to
determine the amount of the Fire Assessment, (3) the number of units
contained within the parcel, (4) the total amount of the Fire Assessment
imposed against the parcel for the appropriate period, (5) the location at
which payment will be accepted, (6) the date on which the Fire Assessment is
due, and (7) a statement that the Fire Assessment constitutes a lien against
assessed property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state,
county, district or municipal taxes and other non-ad valorem assessments.



   (b)   A general notice of the lien resulting from imposition of the
Fire Assessments shall be recorded in the official records of the county.
Nothing herein shall be construed to require that individual liens or
releases be filed in the official records.



   (c)   The city shall have the right to foreclose and collect all
delinquent Fire Assessments in the manner provided by law for the foreclosure
of mortgages on real property or appoint or retain an agent to institute such
foreclosure and collection proceedings. A Fire Assessment shall become
delinquent if it is not paid within thirty (30) days from the date any
installment is due. The city or its agent shall notify any property owner who
is delinquent in payment of his or her Fire Assessment within sixty (60) days
from the date such assessment was due. Such notice shall state in effect that
the city or its agent will either (1) initiate a foreclosure action or suit
in equity and cause the foreclosure of such property subject to a delinquent
Fire Assessment in a method now or hereafter provided by law for foreclosure
of mortgages on real property, or (2) cause an amount equivalent to the
delinquent Fire Assessment, not previously subject to collection using the
uniform method under the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, to be collected
on the tax bill for a subsequent year.



   (d)   All costs, fees and expenses, including reasonable attorney
fees and title search expenses, related to any foreclosure action as
described herein shall be included in any judgment or decree rendered
therein. At the sale pursuant to decree in any such action, the city may be
the purchaser to the same extent as any person. The city or its agent may
join in one foreclosure action the collection of Fire Assessment against any
or all property assessed in accordance with the provisions hereof. All
delinquent owners whose property is foreclosed shall be liable for an
apportioned amount of reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the city and
its agents, including reasonable attorney fees, in collection of such
delinquent Fire Assessments and any other costs incurred by the city as a
result of such delinquent Fire Assessments and the same shall be collectible
as a part of or in addition to the costs of the action.



   (e)   In lieu of foreclosure, any delinquent Fire Assessment and the
costs, fees and expenses attributable thereto, may be collected pursuant to
the Uniform Assessment Collection Act; provided, however, that (1) notice is
provided to the owner in the manner required by the Uniform Assessment
Collection Act and this article, and (2) any existing lien of record on the
affected parcel for the delinquent Fire Assessment is supplanted by the lien
resulting from certification of the assessment roll, as applicable, to the
tax collector.



   (f)   Notwithstanding the city's use of an alternative method of
collection, the city manager shall have the same power and authority to
correct errors and omissions as provided to him or county officials in
Section 7-36 hereof.



   (g)   Any city commission action required in the collection of Fire
Assessments may be by resolution.



(Ord. No. 10-7-1, §2, 7-20-10)



Sec. 7-41. Government property.



   (a)   If Fire Assessments are imposed against government property,
the city shall provide Fire Assessment bills by first class mail to the owner
of each affected parcel of government property. The bill or accompanying
explanatory material shall include (1) a brief explanation of the Fire
Assessment, (2) a description of the unit of measurement used to determine
the amount of the Fire Assessment, (3) the number of units contained within
the parcel, (4) the total amount of the parcel's Fire Assessment for the
appropriate period, (5) the location at which payment will be accepted, and
(6) the date on which the Fire Assessment is due.



   (b)   Fire Assessments imposed against government property shall be
due on the same date as all other Fire Assessments and, if applicable, shall
be subject to the same discounts for early payment.



   (c)   A Fire Assessment shall become delinquent if it is not paid
within thirty (30) days from the date any installment is due. The city shall
notify the owner of any government property that it is delinquent in payment
of its Fire Assessment within sixty (60) days from the date such assessment
was due. Such notice shall state that the city will initiate a mandamus or
other appropriate judicial action to compel payment.



   (d)   All costs, fees and expenses, including reasonable attorney
fees and title search expenses, related to any mandamus or other action as
described herein shall be included in any judgment or decree rendered therein
All delinquent owners of government property against which a mandamus or
other appropriate action is filed shall be liable for an apportioned amount
of reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the city, including reasonable
attorney fees, in collection of such delinquent Fire Assessments and any
other costs incurred by the city as a result of such delinquent Fire
Assessments and the same shall be collectible as a part of or in addition to,
the costs of the action.



   (e)   As an alternative to the foregoing, a Fire Assessment imposed
against government property may be collected as a surcharge on a utility bill
provided to such government property in periodic installments with a remedy
of a mandamus action in the event of non-payment. The city commission may
contract for such billing services with any utility, whether or not such
utility is owned by the city. (Ord. No. 10-7-1, §2, 7-20-10)



Sec. 7-42. Applicability.



   This article and the city's authority to impose assessments pursuant
hereto shall be applicable throughout the city.



Sec. 7-43. Alternative method.



   (a)   This article shall be deemed to provide an additional and
alternative method for doing all things authorized hereby and shall be
regarded as supplemental and additional to powers conferred by other laws,
and shall not be regarded as in derogation of any powers now existing or
which may hereafter come into existence. This article, being necessary for
the welfare of the inhabitants of the city, shall be liberally construed to
effect the purposes hereof.



   (b)   Nothing herein shall preclude the city commission from
directing and authorizing, by resolution, the combination with each other of
(1) any supplemental or additional notice deemed proper, necessary or
convenient by the city, (2) any notice required by this article, or (3) any
notice required by law, including the Uniform Assessment Collection Act.

   (b)   The committee shall adopt specific operating guidelines for

Sec. 8A-5. Powers and duties.



   (a)   Designation. The committee shall have the power, subject to
subsection 8A-4 hereof, to designate historic structures and historic sites
and to recommend designation of historic districts within the city limits.
Such designations shall be made based on subsection 8A-4 hereof. Historic
districts shall be approved by the city commission. Once designated, such
historic structures, sites and districts shall be subject to all of the
provisions of this section.



   (b)   Regulation of construction, reconstruction, alteration and
demolition.



      (1)   No owner or person in charge of a historic structure,
historic site or structure within a historic district shall reconstruct,
alter or demolish all or any part of the exterior of such property or
construct any improvement upon such designated property or properties or
cause or permit any such work to be performed upon such property or demolish
such property unless a certificate of appropriateness has been granted by the
historic preservation committee. Also, unless such certificate has been
granted by the committee, the building department shall not issue a permit
for any such work.



      (2)   Upon filing of any application for a certificate of
appropriateness with the committee, the committee shall approve the
application, unless:



         a.   In the case of a designated historic structure or
historic site, the proposed work would detrimentally change, destroy or
adversely affect any exterior feature of the improvement or site upon which
said work is to be done;



         b.   In the case of the construction or a new
improvement upon a historic site, or within a historic district, the exterior
of such improvement would adversely affect or not harmonize with the external
appearance of other neighboring improvements on such site or within the
district;



         c.   In the case of any property located in a historic
district, the proposed construction, reconstruction, exterior alteration or
demolition does not conform to the purpose and intent of this section and to
the objectives and design criteria of the historic preservation plan for said
district;



         d.   The building or structure is of such architectural
or historical significance that its demolition would be detrimental to the
public interest and contrary to the general welfare of the people of the city
and state;



         e.   In the case of a request for the demolition of a
deteriorated building or structure, any economic hardship or difficulty
claimed by the owner is self-created or is the result of any failure to
maintain the property in good repair.



      (3)   If the committee determines that the application for a
certificate of appropriateness and the proposed changes are consistent with
the character and features of the property or district, it shall issue the
certificate of appropriateness. The committee shall make this decision within
forty-five (45) days of the filing of the application.



      (4)   The issuance of a certificate of appropriateness shall
not relieve the applicant from obtaining other permits and approvals required
by the city. A development order, building permit or other municipal permit
shall be invalid if it is obtained without the presentation of the
certificate of appropriateness required for the proposed work.



      (5)   Ordinary maintenance and repairs may be undertaken
without a certificate of appropriateness provided that the work involves
repairs to existing features of a historic structure or site or the
replacement of elements of a structure with pieces identical in appearance
and provided that the work does not change the exterior appearance of the
structure or site and does not require the issuance of a building permit.



   (c)   Appeals. Should the committee fail to issue a certificate of
appropriateness due to the failure of the proposal to conform to the
guidelines, the applicant may appeal such decision to the city commission
within thirty (30) days. In addition, if the committee fails to issue a
certificate of appropriateness, the committee shall, with the cooperation of
the applicant, work with the applicant in an attempt to obtain a Certificate
of Appropriateness within the guidelines of this chapter.



   (d)   Recognition of historic structures, sites and districts. At
such time as a historic structure, site or district has been properly
designated, the committee, in cooperation with the property owner, may cause
to be prepared and erected on such property, at city expense, a suitable
plaque declaring that such property is a historic structure, site or district.



Sec. 8A-6. Procedures.



   (a)   Designation of historic structures and historic sites.



      (1)   The committee may, after notice and public hearing,
designate historic structures and historic sites, or rescind such designation
or recommendation, after application of the criteria in Section 8A-4 above.
At least ten (10) days prior to such hearing, the committee shall notify the
owners of record, as listed in the Broward County tax rolls, who are owners
of property in whole or in part situated within two hundred (200) feet of the
boundaries of the property affected.



      (2)   The committee shall then conduct such public hearing
and, in addition to the notified persons, may hear expert witnesses and shall
have the power to subpoena such witnesses and records as it deems necessary.
The committee may conduct an independent investigation into the proposed
designation or rescission. Within ten (10) days after the close of the public
hearing, the committee may designate the property as either a historic
structure, or a historic site, or rescind the designation. After the
designation or rescission has been made, notification shall be sent to the
property owner or owners. Notification shall also be given to the Broward
County Tax Assessor's Office, the Office of the City Clerk and the Department
of Growth Management. The committee shall cause the designation or rescission
to be recorded, at city expense, with the Broward County Recording Division.



   (b)   Creation of historic district.



      (1)   For preservation purposes, the historic preservation
committee shall select geographically defined areas within the city to be
designated as historic districts and shall prepare a historic preservation
plan for each area. A historic district may be designated for any geographic
area of particular historic, architectural or cultural significance to the
city, after application of the criteria in Section 8A-4, above. Each historic
preservation plan pre-pared for or by the historic preservation committee
shall include a cultural and architectural analysis supporting the historic
significance of the area, the specific guidelines for development, and a
statement of preservation objectives.



      (2)   Review and adoption procedure.



         a.   Historic preservation committee. The historic
preservation committee shall hold a public hearing when considering the plan
for a historic district. Notice of the time, place and purpose of the public
hearing shall be sent by the city clerk to the city commission and the owners
of record, as listed in Broward County tax rolls, who are owners of the
property within the proposed historic district or are situated in whole or in
part within two hundred (200) feet of the boundaries of the proposed historic
district. Said notice is to be sent at least ten (10) days prior to the date
of public hearing. Following the public hearing, the historic preservation
committee shall vote to recommend, reject or withhold action on the plan.



         b.   City commission. The city commission, upon receipt
of the recommendations from the historic preservation committee shall hold a
public hearing, notice to be given as noted in subsection a, above, and
shall, following the public hearing, either designate or reject the historic
district. Designation of the historic district shall constitute adoption of
the plan prepared for that district and direct the implementation of said
plan.



Sec. 8A-7. Interim control.



   No building permit shall be issued by the building department for
alteration, construction, demolition, or removal of a nominated historic
structure, historic site, or any property or structure within a nominated
historic district from the date of the meeting of the historic preservation
committee at which a nomination form is first presented until the final
disposition of the nomination by the historic preservation committee and the
city commission, unless such alteration, removal or demolition is authorized
by formal resolution of the city commission as necessary for public health,
welfare or safety. In no event shall the delay be for more than one hundred
eighty (180) days.



Sec. 8A-8. Penalties for violations.



   Any person or persons violating any provision of this chapter shall be
fined fifty dollars ($50.00) for each separate violation. Each and every day
during which a violation continues shall be deemed to be a separate offense.
Notice of violations shall be issued by the code compliance division of the
police department. (Ord. No. 03-1-3, §1, 1-28-03)

   (a)   Purpose and intent. The purpose of this article is to regulate
special events and temporary outdoor sales to ensure public health, safety

inhibits the usual flow of pedestrian or vehicular travel or which occupies

space or which deviates from the established, legally permitted use of a
space or building.



      (1)   A special event shall include but not be limited to a
festival, concert, parade, walk, race, fund raising sale and similar

been obtained from the city as provided herein. No person, firm, group, or
corporation shall violate any terms of a special event permit issued under
this article, nor in any manner interfere with the progress or orderly

Sec. 11-8. Sexual offenders and sexual predators.



   (a)   Findings and intent.



      (1)   Repeat sexual offenders, sexual offenders who use
physical violence, and sexual offenders who prey on children are sexual
predators who present an extreme threat to the public safety. Sexual
offenders are extremely likely to use physical violence and to repeat their
offenses, and most sexual offenders commit many offenses, have many more
victims than are ever reported, and are prosecuted for only a fraction of
their crimes. This makes the cost of sexual offender victimization to society
at large, while incalculable, clearly exorbitant.



      (2)   It is the intent of this section to service the city's
compelling interest to promote, protect and improve the health, safety and
welfare of the citizens of the city by creating areas around locations where
children regularly congregate in concentrated numbers wherein certain sexual
offenders and sexual predators are prohibited from establishing temporary or
permanent residence.

section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning:

lodges or resides for 14 or more consecutive days.



(Ord. No. 05-08-01, § 1, 08-17-05)



      "Temporary residence" means a place where the person abides,
lodges or resides for a period of14 or more days in aggregate during any
calendar year and which is not the person's permanent address, or a place
where the person routinely abides, lodges or resides for a period of 4 or
more consecutive or nonconsecutive days in any month and which is not the
person's permanent address.



   (c)   Sexual offender and sexual predator residence prohibition;
penalties; exceptions.

Statutes, or convicted of any felony sexual offense in any state in the
United States, regardless of whether adjudication has been withheld, in which
the victim of the offense was less than16 years of age, as that term was
applied and used by the state in which the person was convicted, to establish
a permanent residence or temporary residence within 2500 feet of any school,
designated public school bus stop, day care center, park, playground, or
other place where children regularly congregate.



      (2)   For purposes of determining the minimum distance
separation, the requirement shall be measured by following a straight line
from the outer property line of the permanent residence or temporary
residence to nearest outer property line of a school, designated public
school bus stop, day care center, park, playground, or other place where
children regularly congregate.



      (3)   This section applies to any person convicted of a
violation of section 794.011, 800.04, 827.071 or 847.0145, Florida Statutes,
or convicted of any felony sexual offense in any state in the United States
in which the victim of the offense was less than 16 years of age, for
offenses that occur on or after October 1, 2004.



      (4)   Penalties. A person who violates this section shall be
punished by a fine not exceeding $500.00 or by imprisonment for a term not
exceeding sixty (60) days, or by both such fine and imprisonment; for a
second or subsequent conviction of a violation of this section, such person
shall be punished by a fine not to exceed $1,000.00 or imprisonment in the
county jail not more than twelve (12) months, or by both such fine and
imprisonment.



      (5)   Exceptions. A person residing within2500 feet of any

or other conveyance, is located within two thousand five hundred (2500) feet
of any school, designated public school bus stop, day care center, park,
playground, or other place where children regularly congregate.



         b.   A property owner's failure to comply with
provisions of this section shall constitute a violation of this section, and
shall subject the property owner to the code enforcement provisions and
procedures provided in section 1-8 of this code. (Ord. No. 05-08-01, § 1,

sell or public display for sale of synthetic cannabinoid herbal incense.



(Created by Ord. No. 12-8-1, § 2, 8-21-12)



   a.   Purpose and intent. The City Commission finds and declares that
the products and synthetic substances described hereunder are commonly used
as alternatives to marijuana. The Commission further finds that these
synthetic substances are particularly appealing to youth, and that these
synthetic substances are potentially dangerous to users in the short term and
that the long term effects are not yet known. The Commission finds that the
products which contain these synthetic substances often use a disclaimer that
the product is "not for human consumption" to avoid regulations requiring the
manufacturer to list the product's active ingredients. The Commission finds
that drug designers and chemists can quickly create new synthetic drugs once
federal or state law makes a particular synthetic drug illegal. As such, the
Commission finds there is a need to declare illegal the sale, offer for sale,
purchase with intent to sell or public display for sale of synthetic
substances that mimic illegal controlled substances that have not yet
themselves been categorized as illegal controlled substances under federal or
state law. The Commission further finds that it is proper and necessary for
the Commission to exercise its authority to safeguard and protect the public
health, safety and welfare by taking this action.



   b.   Application. This section shall be applicable within the City
to the fullest extent allowed by law.



   c.   Conflict. Any applicable Broward County ordinance governing
this subject area that is more stringent than this section or that declares
illegal a substance that is not declared illegal by this section shall remain
enforceable within the City.

synthetic cannabinoids or synthetic cannabinoid-mimicking compounds listed in
the controlled substance schedules in chapter 893, Florida Statutes, as
amended, or otherwise prohibited by federal or state law.



      2.   "Synthetic cannabinoid herbal incense" as used in this
section shall mean aromatic or nonaromatic plant material containing a
synthetic drug, or to which a synthetic drug has been sprayed, applied or
otherwise added, that is distributed in a loose, leafy, powder or granular
form or in a compressed block or blocks that can be crushed to result in a
powder or granular form, and can be placed into a pipe, cigarette paper or
drug paraphernalia for purposes of ingestion by smoking, inhaling or other
method.



      3.   "Synthetic drug" as used in this section shall mean any
chemical or mixture of chemicals, however packaged, that is structurally
similar to synthetic cannabinoids or synthetic cannabinoid-mimicking
compounds listed in the controlled substance schedules in chapter 893,
Florida Statutes, or otherwise prohibited by federal or state law. "Synthetic
drug" also shall include any chemical or mixture of chemicals, however
packaged, that mimics the effects of tetrahydrocannabinol (also known as
THC), the main active ingredient found in marijuana. Packaging that indicates
or implies that a product mimics the effects of marijuana, such as "fake
weed" or "fake pot", shall create a presumption that the product mimics the
effects of tetrahydrocannabinol. "Synthetic drug" shall not include any
substance currently listed in the controlled substance schedules in chapter
893, Florida Statutes, or otherwise prohibited by federal or state law.



   e.   Sale, offer for sale and purchase with intent to sell synthetic
cannabinoid herbal incense prohibited. It shall be unlawful for any store
owner, store manager, store purchasing agent or other person to sell, offer

prohibited. It shall be unlawful for any store owner, store manager, store
purchasing agent or other person to publicly display for sale any synthetic
cannabinoid herbal incense as defined herein.



   g.   Affirmative defense. It shall be an affirmative defense to
prosecution of a violation of this section if the sale, offer for sale or
public display for sale of synthetic cannabinoid herbal incense is pursuant
to the direction or prescription of a licensed physician or dentist
authorized in the State of Florida to direct or prescribe such act.



   h.   Seizure and destruction of synthetic cannabinoid herbal
incense. Synthetic cannabinoid herbal incense prohibited herein may be seized
by law enforcement officers and may be destroyed in the same manner used to
destroy narcotics and contraband substances, after its use for evidentiary
purposes in any judicial proceeding is no longer required.



   i.   Injunctive relief. The City shall have the authority to seek an
injunction against any person or business violating the provisions of this
section. In any action seeking an injunction, the City shall be entitled to
collect its enforcement expenses, including forensic costs, law enforcement
costs and reasonable attorney fees and costs incurred at trial and on appeal.



   j.   Subsequent federal or state action. If Congress or a federal
agency amends federal law to include a particular substance or otherwise
enacts or amends a federal law providing for criminal penalties for the
prohibitions of substances set forth in this section, then upon the effective
date of such enactment or amendment, the provisions of this section addressed
by federal law shall no longer be deemed effective. Any violations of this
section committed prior to the Congress or a federal agency enacting a
federal law, as described above, may be prosecuted. If the Florida
Legislature amends the controlled substance schedules in section 893.01,
Florida Statutes, to include a particular substance or otherwise enacts, or
amends a state statute providing for criminal penalties for the prohibitions
of substances set forth in this section, then upon the effective date of such
enactment or amendment, the provisions of this section addressed by the state
statute shall no longer be deemed effective. If the Florida Attorney General
pursuant to the rulemaking authority provided in Chapter 893 adds a
particular substance to the controlled substance schedules in section 893.01,
Florida Statutes, then upon the effective date of such enactment or
amendment, the provisions of this section addressed by the rulemaking action
shall no longer be deemed effective. Any violations of this section committed
prior to the Florida Legislature enacting such a statute or the Florida
Attorney General promulgating rules may be prosecuted.



   k.   Penalty. Any store owner, store manager, store purchasing agent
or other person violating any provision of this section shall be punishable
by a fine not to exceed five hundred dollars ($500.00), or by imprisonment
not to exceed sixty (60) days or by both such fine and imprisonment for each
violation. This section shall also be subject to enforcement via the Local

Sec. 11-13. Prohibiting the sale , offer for sale, purchase with intent to
sell or public display for sale of synthetic stimulant bath salts, synthetic
cathinones, synthetic amphetamines and other synthetic stimulants that mimic
illegal drugs.



(Created by Ord. No. 12-8-1, § 3, 8-21-12)



   a.   Purpose and intent. The City Commission finds and declares that
the products and synthetic substances described hereunder are commonly used
as alternatives to amphetamines, cocaine, ecstasy and other illegal drugs.
The City Commission further finds that these synthetic substances are
particularly appealing to youth, and that these synthetic substances are
potentially dangerous to users in the short term and the long term effects
are not yet known. The City Commission finds that the products which contain
these synthetic substances often use a disclaimer that the product is "not
for human consumption" to avoid regulations that require the manufacturer to
list the product's active ingredients. The City Commission finds that drug
designers and chemists can quickly create new synthetic drugs once federal or
state law makes a particular synthetic drug illegal. As such, the City
Commission finds that there is a need to declare illegal the sale, offer for
sale, purchase with intent to sell or public display for sale of synthetic
substances that mimic illegal controlled substances, even though such
synthetic substances have not yet themselves been categorized as illegal
controlled substances under federal or state law. The City Commission further
finds that it is proper and necessary for the Commission to exercise its
authority to safeguard and protect the public health, safety and welfare by
taking this action.

to the fullest extent allowed by law.



   c.   Conflict. Any applicable Broward County ordinance governing
this subject area that is more stringent than this section or that declares
illegal a substance that is not declared illegal by this section shall remain
enforceable within the City.

ARTICLE IV. ENFORCEMENT OF TRESPASS STATUTE



Sec. 13-50. Pre-authorization of police officers to enforce trespass statute
on private property.



   (a)   Declaration of public purpose. The city commission hereby
declares and finds that pre-authorizing police officers to enforce the state
trespass statute, Sec. 810.09(2)(b), Florida Statutes, on private property,
serves a valid public purpose. Specifically, the city commission finds that
the Florida Legislature has made it a first-degree misdemeanor for a person
to defy an order from the owner of private property, or an authorized person,
to leave the owner's property, other than a structure or conveyance.
Pre-designating police officers to issue warnings to leave on behalf of
private property owners will protect the public from breaches of the peace
which might occur if property owners are required to protect their property
and expel trespassers by force. Additionally, the protection of private
property is one of the primary missions of any police agency and in pursuit
of that mission the police department has proposed a program whereby private
property owners may pre-author ney's office.



   (d)   The property shall be posted by the property owner, with signs
and locations to be approved by the police department, advising all who enter
of the pre-authorization authority granted to the police department.



   (e)   (1)   It is unlawful for any person, who enters on private
property without being authorized, licensed or invited, to refuse to obey an
order to leave the premises given by a police officer who is pre-authorized
to issue such an order under the provisions of this section.



      (2)   If a citation issued for violation of this section shall
be paid prior to the issuance of a Notice to Appear or Municipal Information,
the fine shall be one hundred dollars ($100.00). After the issuance of a
Notice to Appear or Municipal Information the penalties provided in Section
1-8 of this Code shall be applicable. (Ord. No. 98-9-5, §1, 9-9-98; Ord. No.

may issue a Warning to the Violator stating that the Violator has committed a
violation of the Code and shall specify a reasonable time period within which
the Violator must correct the violation. This determination shall be based on
consideration of fairness; practicality; ease of correction; ability to
correct; severity of the violation; nature, extent and probability of danger

relating to the reasonableness of the time period prescribed.

shall issue a Notice to the Violator stating that the Violator has committed
a violation of the Code and shall specify a reasonable time period within
which the Violator must correct the violation. This determination shall be
based on consideration of fairness; practicality; ease of correction; ability
to correct; severity of violation; nature, extent, and probability of danger
or damage to the public; and other relevant factors relating to the
reasonableness of the time period prescribed.

violation presents a serious threat to the public health, safety or welfare,
the Code Enforcement Officer may issue a Notice requiring immediate
correction of the violation. If the violation is an Uncorrectable Violation,
the Code Enforcement Officer may issue a Notice. The Code Enforcement Officer
shall make a reasonable effort to notify the Violator and immediately notify
the City Manager or his or her designee and request a hearing.



   (e)   If a Code Enforcement Officer finds a Repeat Violation, the
Code Enforcement Officer shall issue a Notice to the Violator but is not
required to give the Violator a reasonable time to correct the violation. The
Code Enforcement Officer, upon notifying the Violator of a Repeat Violation,
shall notify the City Manager or his or her designee and request a hearing.



   (f)   If the owner of property which is subject to an enforcement
proceeding pursuant to this chapter transfers ownership of such property
between the time the initial pleading was served and the time of the hearing,

      (1)   Disclose, in writing, the existence and the nature of
the proceeding to the prospective transferee.

transfer of the property, with the identity and address of the new owner and
copies of the disclosures made to the new owner, within five (5) days after
the date of the transfer.



   A failure to make the disclosures described in paragraphs (1), (2), and
(3) before the transfer creates a rebuttable presumption of fraud. If the
property is transferred before the hearing, the proceeding shall not be
dismissed, but the new owner shall be provided a reasonable period of time to
correct the violation before the hearing is held.



Sec. 13-70. Contents and service of the Notice.

with, or may follow, an attempt or attempts to provide Notice by hand
delivery or by mail as required under subsection (b).



   (d)   Evidence that an attempt has been made to hand deliver or mail
the Notice as provided in subsection (b), together with proof of publication
or posting as provided in subsection (c), shall be sufficient to show that
the Notice requirements of this section have been met, without regard to
whether or not the alleged Violator actually received such Notice.

   (a)   Upon receipt of a Notice from the Code Enforcement Officer as

      (9)   Notice that requests for continuances will not be
considered if not received by the Special Magistrate at least five (5)
calendar days prior to the date set for the hearing.



      (10)   Notice that if the violation is corrected and then
recurs or if the violation is not corrected by the time specified for
correction, the case may be presented to the Special Magistrate even if the
violation has been corrected prior to the hearing.



   (c)   The City Manager or his or her designee shall call hearings on
a monthly basis or as he or she finds to be necessary. No hearing shall be
set sooner than ten (10) calendar days from the date of service of the Notice
of hearing except under circumstances in which the violation is a threat to
the health, safety or welfare of the residents of the City.



   (d)   A hearing date shall not be postponed or continued unless a
request for continuance, showing good cause for such continuance, is received
in writing by the Special Magistrate secretary at least five (5) calendar
days prior to the date set for the hearing.



   (e)   All hearings of the Special Magistrate shall be open to the
public. All testimony shall be under oath. Assuming proper Notice, a hearing
may proceed in the absence of the named Violator.



   (f)   The proceedings at the hearing shall be recorded and may be
transcribed at the expense of the party requesting the transcript.



   (g)   The City Manager shall provide clerical and administrative
personnel as may be reasonably required by the Special Magistrate for the
proper performance of its duties.



   (h)   The hearing need not be conducted in accordance with formal
rules relating to evidence and witnesses, but fundamental due process shall
be observed and shall govern the proceedings. Any relevant evidence shall be
admitted if the Special Magistrate finds it competent and reliable,
regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule to the
contrary.



   (i)   Each party shall have the right to call and examine relevant
witnesses; to introduce relevant exhibits; to cross-examine opposing
witnesses on any matter relevant to the issues even though that matter was
not covered in the direct examination; to impeach any witness regardless of
which party first called that witness to testify; and to offer rebuttal of
the evidence.



   (j)   The Special Magistrate shall make findings of fact and
conclusions of law based on evidence of record.



   (k)   If the named Violator is found to have violated the Code,
she/he may be held liable for the reasonable cost of the administrative
hearing in the amount of eighty dollars ($80.00), at the discretion of the
Special Magistrate.



   (l)   In the case of a Repeat Violation, if the Repeat Violation has
been corrected, the Special Magistrate retains the right to schedule a
hearing to determine costs and impose the payment of reasonable enforcement
fees upon the repeat Violator. The repeat Violator may choose to waive his or
her rights to this hearing and pay the costs as determined by the Special
Magistrate.



   (m)   The fact-finding determination of the Special Magistrate shall
be limited to whether the violation alleged did occur, and, if so, whether
the person named in the Notice may be held responsible for that violation. If
the Special Magistrate finds the named Violator not responsible for the Code
violation alleged in the Notice, the named Violator shall not be liable for
the payment of any civil penalty or costs, absent reversal of the Special
Magistrate's findings pursuant to section 13-74 of this chapter.



   (n)   The decision of the Special Magistrate affirming the decision
of the Code Enforcement Officer shall include the following elements:



      (1)   Possibility of civil penalty.



      (2)   Administrative costs of hearing, if applicable.



      (3)   Date by which the violation must be corrected to prevent
Continuing Violation penalties.



   (o)   The Special Magistrate shall postpone a hearing if the named
Violator, prior to the scheduled hearing date, files with the duly authorized
City board of appropriate jurisdiction, if any, an administrative appeal
concerning the interpretation or application of the Code provisions upon
which the alleged violation was based. However, once an issue has been
determined by the Special Magistrate in a specific case, that issue may not
be further reviewed by a City board in that specific case.



   (p)   Upon exhaustion of a timely filed administrative appeal and
finalization of the administrative order by such board, the Special
Magistrate may exercise all powers given to it by this article. The Special
Magistrate shall not, however, exercise any jurisdiction over such alleged
Code violations until the time allowed for court appeal of the ruling of such
board has lapsed or until such further appeal has been exhausted.



   (q)   The Special Magistrate shall be bound by the interpretations
and decisions of duly authorized City boards concerning the provisions of the
Code within their respective jurisdictions. In the event such a board decides
that an alleged violation of the Code is not in accordance with such board's
interpretation of the Code provision on which the violation is based, the
Special Magistrate shall not be empowered to proceed with the enforcement of
the violation.



Sec. 13-72. Civil penalties and related terms construed.



   (a)   Penalties for violations of the provisions to be enforced
through this article may be in the amounts prescribed in the schedule of
civil penalties contained in section 13-77(b) of this chapter.



   (b)   For each day of a continued violation, an additional penalty
in the same amount as that prescribed for in the original violation shall be
added.



   (c)   After an administrative hearing and a finding by the Special
Magistrate of a violation of the Code, the Special Magistrate shall determine
a reasonable time period within which correction of the violation must be
made, based on the considerations set forth in section 13-77(a) of this
chapter. Upon notification by the Code Enforcement Officer that correction of
the violation was not made within the period ordered, or upon finding that a
Repeat Violation has been committed, the Special Magistrate may enter an
order imposing civil penalties for each day a Continuing Violation or Repeat
Violation continues. The order shall state that the penalties imposed begin
to accrue after the time for correction has run and order the Violator to pay
the penalties imposed.



   (d)   If the Special Magistrate finds a violation to be irreparable
or irreversible in nature, the Special Magistrate may order the Violator to
pay a fine not to exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) per violation.



   (e)   If the Special Magistrate finds that a violation presents a
serious threat to the public health, safety and welfare, or if the violation
is irreparable or irreversible in nature, the Special Magistrate shall notify
the City Manager, who may order all repairs in order to bring the property
into compliance. The City may assess the Violator with the cost of the
repairs.



   (f)   Civil penalties assessed pursuant to this chapter are due and
payable to the City on the last day of the period allowed for the filing of
an appeal from the Special Magistrate's decision, or, if a proper appeal is
made, when the appeal has been finally decided adversely to the named
Violator.



Sec. 13-73. Recovery of unpaid civil penalties and cost of repairs; unpaid
penalty and cost of repairs to constitute a lien; foreclosure; lien reduction.



   (a)   The City may institute proceedings in a court of competent
jurisdiction to compel payment of civil penalties or cost of repairs
authorized herein.



   (b)   A certified copy of an order imposing a civil penalty may be
recorded in the public records and thereafter shall constitute a lien against
the property on which the violation exists and upon any other real or
personal property owned by the Violator; upon petition to the circuit court,
such order may be enforced in the same manner as a court judgment by the
sheriffs of this state, including execution and levy against the Violator's
personal property, but such order shall not be deemed to be a court judgment
except for enforcement purposes. A civil penalty imposed pursuant to this
chapter shall continue to accrue until the Violator complies or until
judgment is rendered in a suit to foreclose on a lien filed pursuant to this
chapter, whichever occurs first. After three (3) months from the date of
filing of any such lien, which remains unpaid, the City may foreclose or
otherwise execute on the lien. Alternatively, the City may initiate legal
proceedings to recover a money judgment for the amount of the Code
enforcement lien plus accrued interest.



   (c)   A certified copy of a notice of assessment of cost of repairs
may be recorded in the public records and thereafter constitute a lien on the
property on which the repairs were performed; upon petition to the circuit
court, such notice of assessment may be enforced in the same manner as a
court judgment by the sheriffs of this state, including levy against the
Violator's personal property, but such order shall not be deemed to be a
court judgment except for enforcement purposes. After three (3) months from
the date of filing of any such notice of assessment, which remains unpaid,
the City may foreclose or otherwise execute on the lien. Alternatively, the
City may initiate legal proceedings to recover a money judgment for the
amount of the lien plus accrued interest.



   (d)   No lien provided under this chapter shall continue for a
period longer than twenty (20) years after the certified copy of an order
imposing a fine or notice of assessment has been recorded, unless within that
time an action to foreclose on a lien is commenced in a court of competent
jurisdiction. In an action to foreclose on a lien, the prevailing party may
recover interest and all costs, including a reasonable attorney's fee,
incurred in the foreclosure. The continuation of the lien affected by the
commencement of the action shall not be good against creditors or subsequent
purchasers for valuable consideration without notice, unless a notice of lis
pendens is recorded.



   (e)   A certified copy of an order finding a violation or an order
imposing a civil penalty or notice of assessment of cost of repairs recorded
in the public records shall constitute notice of the violation and any civil
penalty or costs imposed therein to any subsequent purchasers, successors in
interest, or assigns if the violation concerns real property. The findings
therein shall be binding upon the Violator, and if the violation concerns
real property, any subsequent purchasers, successors in interest or assigns.



   (f)   If an order is recorded in the public records and it is
complied with by the date specified, the Special Magistrate shall issue an
order acknowledging compliance that shall be recorded in the public records.
A hearing shall not be required to issue such an order acknowledging
compliance.



   (g)   A lien arising from a civil penalty or notice of assessment
runs in favor of the City, and the City may charge the Violator for all costs
incurred in recording, researching the public records and satisfying a valid
lien. Upon payment of the civil penalty or notice of assessment by the
Violator or the successor(s), assign(s) or heir(s) of the Violator, the City
Clerk is authorized to execute and record in the Public Records of Broward
County the appropriate release of lien document.



   (h)   The Violator, or the Violator's successors or assigns (the
"applicant") who have an ownership interest in the property encumbered by a
lien for civil penalties, may file a request for a reduction of the civil
penalty with the City Manager only after a compliance inspection is completed
during which a Code Enforcement Officer finds that all violations were
corrected. Upon receipt of a written request for reduction of civil penalty,
and the filing of an affidavit of partial compliance by the Code Enforcement
Officer which sets forth that all outstanding violations of the Special
Magistrate's order have been corrected,  except for payment of any
outstanding civil penalties, the City Manager or his or her designee, shall
set the matter for penalty reduction hearing by the Special Magistrate.
However, if the City Attorney has commenced action to obtain compliance with
the order of the Special Magistrate, including but not limited to an action
for injunctive relief, foreclosure, or money judgment, no hearing shall be
held for a reduction of civil penalty unless consented to by the City
Attorney.



   (i)   At the hearing, the fact-finding determination of the Special
Magistrate shall be limited to evidence establishing:



      (1)   Good cause for a reduction of the civil penalty,



      (2)   The amount of the reduction, and



      (3)   Any equitable considerations raised by the applicant or
the City relating to good cause for the amount of the reduction. Said hearing
shall not be an opportunity to appeal any finding of fact or conclusions of
law set forth in any prior order of the Special Magistrate or any
administrative determination of the City.



   (j)   The Special Magistrate may reduce a civil penalty once the
applicant has otherwise complied with an order of the Special Magistrate
based on a showing of good cause, but in no event shall the civil penalty be
reduced below the costs incurred by the City in its prosecution of
violations, including but not limited to any attorney's fees and staff time.
In no event, however, shall any administrative fees previously ordered by the
Special Magistrate or court order be waived or reduced.



   (k)   In determining good cause, and the amount of the reduction, if
any, the Special Magistrate shall consider:



      (1)   The gravity of the violation.



      (2)   Any actions taken by the Violator or applicant to
correct the violation.



      (3)   Any previous, or other outstanding violations whether
committed by the Violator, or pertaining to the property to which the lien
attaches, unless an order finding a violation is under appeal at the time of
the determination.



      (4)   Whether the violation is irreparable or irreversible in
nature.



      (5)   Whether the Violator's failure to timely comply with an
order of the Code Enforcement Officer or the Special Magistrate is due to an
inability to comply based on factors beyond the control of the Violator.



   (l)   Upon a finding of good cause, the Special Magistrate has the
sole discretion to grant or deny the request for a reduction of civil penalty
according to the following guidelines, provided the reduction is not less
than the costs incurred by the City:



      (1)   If compliance occurs within three (3) months of the date
for compliance set forth in the order of the Special Magistrate, a maximum
reduction of ninety-five (95) percent of the total civil penalty (the
original civil penalty plus the continuing civil penalty amounts);



      (2)   If compliance occurs more than three months but less
than twelve (12) months from the compliance date, a maximum reduction of
seventy-five (75) percent of the total civil penalty amount;



      (3)   If compliance occurs from twelve (12) months to eighteen
(18) months of the compliance date, a maximum of fifty (50) percent of the
total civil penalty amount; and



      (4)   If compliance occurs more than eighteen (18) months
after the compliance date, a maximum of twenty-five (25) percent of the total
civil penalty amount.



   (m)   The Special Magistrate has the authority where there is a
demonstrated showing of financial hardship or other good cause to reduce the
civil penalty below the civil penalty reduction guidelines. The Special
Magistrate shall exercise this authority with great caution and only in
documented and exceptional circumstances. A Violator alleging financial
hardship has the burden of presenting evidence of inability to pay the civil
penalty.



   (n)   If a civil penalty is reduced, the order of the Special
Magistrate shall provide that, if the Violator fails to pay the reduced civil
penalty by the date ordered by the Special Magistrate, then the original
amount of the civil penalty shall be automatically reinstated. The Special
Magistrate may impose conditions on the granting of a request for reduction
of the civil penalty and may allow additional hearings upon request if
necessary to establish compliance with said conditions before an order
reducing the civil penalty is entered.



   (o)   A certified copy of the order reducing the civil penalty shall
not be recorded in the public records unless the terms of the order reducing
the civil penalty are fully complied with and the order shall so provide.



   (p)   Upon receipt of timely payment in full of the amount of the
reduced civil penalty, and the recording costs, the City Manager, or his or
her designee, shall record a copy of the order reducing the civil penalty and
a satisfaction of lien.



   (q)   A reduction of civil penalty may only be granted once as to
any violation of an order of the Special Magistrate.



Sec. 13-74. Appeals of order.



   (a)   An aggrieved party, including the City, may appeal a final
order of the Special Magistrate to the circuit court. Such an appeal shall
not be a hearing de novo but shall be limited to appellate review of the
record created before the Special Magistrate. An appeal shall be filed within
thirty (30) calendar days of the issuance of the order sought to be
overturned. Failure to make such appeal within the prescribed thirty-day
period shall render the findings of the Special Magistrate conclusive,
binding and final.



   (b)   Unless the findings of the Special Magistrate are overturned
in a proceeding held pursuant to this section, findings of the Special
Magistrate shall be admissible in any proceeding to collect unpaid civil
penalties or notices of assessment.



   (c)   No aggrieved party other than the City may apply to the court
for relief unless such party has first exhausted the remedies provided for in
this article and has taken all available steps provided in this article. It
is the intention of the City that all steps provided by this article shall be
taken before any application is made to the court for relief; and no
application shall be made by any aggrieved party other than the City to a
court for relief except from an order issued by a Special Magistrate pursuant
to this article. It is the intention of the City that, notwithstanding
anything in this article to the contrary, the City shall retain all rights
and remedies otherwise available to it to secure compliance with or prevent
violations of the Code. For purposes of an appeal, the City clerk shall make
available, for public inspection and copying, the record upon which each
final order of the Special Magistrate is based. The City clerk shall make a
reasonable charge commensurate with the cost for the preparation of the
official record on appeal and transmittal thereof to the circuit court and
for making certified copies of any record or portion thereof.



Sec. 13-75. Provisions contained herein are supplemental.



   Nothing contained in this article shall prohibit the City from
enforcing its Code by any other means including, but not limited to a
summons, a Notice to Appear in the county court, citations to the county
court as authorized in Section 13-24 of the Code, an arrest, a civil action
for injunctive relief, a stop work order, or demolition. The enforcement
procedures outlined herein are cumulative to all others and shall not be
deemed to be prerequisites to filing suit for the enforcement of any section
of the Code.



Sec. 13-76. Additional enforcement powers.



   In addition to the powers and authority given to the Special Magistrate
for the City pursuant to this chapter, the City may, in its discretion,
exercise any powers given to municipalities or their Special Magistrate by
F.S. Ch. 162, as may be amended.



Sec. 13-77. Schedule of violations, civil penalties.



   (a)   In determining the amount of any civil penalty, the Special
Magistrate shall consider the following factors:



      (1)   The gravity of the violation.



      (2)   Any actions taken by the Violator to correct the
violation.



      (3)   Any previous violations committed by the Violator.



   (b)   Schedule of fines. A fine imposed pursuant to this section
shall not exceed $250 per day for a first violation and shall not exceed $500
per day for a Repeat Violation, and in addition, may include all costs
pursuant to section 13-73 of this article. However, if a Special Magistrate
finds that the violation is to be irreparable or irreversible in nature, it
may impose a fine not to exceed $5,000.00 per violation.

ARTICLE VII. ABANDONED REAL PROPERTY



Sec. 13-90. Title.



   This Article may be cited as the "Abandoned Real Property Registration,
Maintenance, and Foreclosure Reporting Ordinance."



Sec. 13-91. Purpose and intent.



   It is the purpose and intent of the City to establish a process to
address the increasing amount of abandoned real property located within the
City. It is the City's further intent to specifically establish an abandoned
property registration and maintenance program as a mechanism to protect
residential and commercial neighborhoods from being blighted through the lack
of adequate maintenance and security of abandoned properties.



Sec. 13-92. Definitions.



   For purposes of this section, the term:



   (a)   "Abandoned property" means any real property that is vacant of
lawful occupants or not properly maintained and has had a lis pendens filed
against it by the lender holding a mortgage on the property, is subject to an
ongoing foreclosure action, under a notice of mortgagee's sale by the lender
or a pending tax assessors lien sale and/or properties that have been the
subject of a foreclosure sale where the title was retained by the beneficiary
of a mortgage involved in the foreclosure and any properties transferred
under a deed in lieu of foreclosure or sale. The designation of a property as
"abandoned" shall remain in place until such time as the property is sold or
transferred to a new owner or the foreclosure action has been dismissed.



   (b)   "Legal agent" means an employee or designee of a lender
designated by the lender for purposes of receiving legal notices relating to
real property.



   (c)   "Lender" means the owner and holder of a note and mortgage or
other similar instrument that secures a debt upon the property.



   (d)   "Maintenance agent" means an employee or designee of a lender
designated by the lender for purposes of maintaining the condition of real
property.



Sec. 13-93. Establishment of a registry.



   Pursuant to the provisions enumerated in Section 19-94, the City shall
establish a registry cataloging each abandoned property within the City,
containing the information required by this Article.



   (a)   The City shall use the information collected in the registry
to establish a schedule for the monitoring of abandoned property located
within the City.



   (b)   The City may charge a fee not to exceed $50.00 for filing of
information of each property listed in the registry.



Sec. 13-94. Registration of real property.



   (a)   Upon the default of a mortgagor, a lender holding a mortgage
on real property located within the City shall, prior to the issuance of a
notice of default, perform an inspection of the property that is the security
for the mortgage. If, upon inspection, the property is found to be vacant or
shows evidence of vacancy, it shall be classified as an abandoned property
and the lender shall, within ten (10) days of the inspection, register the
property with the City. A separate registration is required for each
abandoned property.



   (b)   If the property is occupied but remains in default, it shall
be inspected by the lender monthly until (1) the mortgagor or other party
remedies the default, or (2) it is found to be vacant or shows evidence of
vacancy at which time it is deemed to be abandoned, and the lender shall,
within ten (10) days of that inspection, register the property with the City.



   (c)   Registration pursuant to this section shall contain the
property owner's name, the address of the property, the lender's name, the
lender's loan number and the name, address, telephone number and email
address for the lender's maintenance and legal agents. The City may require
such other information the City deems necessary to fulfill the intent and
purpose of this section. The lender's legal agent and maintenance agent may
be the same person.



   (d)   An annual registration fee in the amount of fifty dollars
($50.00), per property shall accompany each registration form.



   (e)   Properties subject to this section shall remain under the
annual registration requirement, security and maintenance standards
enumerated in this section as long as they remain abandoned.



   (f)   A lender's registration of a property shall constitute the
consent of the lender for the City to enter the premises for inspection
purposes in the limited circumstances defined in section 13-95(a).



   (g)   Should it be determined by City personnel that a lender has
failed to complete the registration of an abandoned property as required
pursuant to this section, a civil penalty of $500 shall be imposed on the
lender. Said penalty shall be used towards satisfying any City liens upon the
premises that accrued prior to the filing in the registry and any excess
penalty moneys shall be retained by the City.



   (h)   In the event that the information required during the
registration has changed, the lender shall update the registry to reflect the
updated information, including the status of the proceedings initiated by the
lender, if any, to foreclose the mortgage on a registered property.



Sec. 13-95. Inspection



   (a)   The City may physically enter the premises of a registered
property in the normal course of property inspections under the same legal
authority possessed by the lender to enter upon such property, not more often
than once every month, for the purpose of examining the property to ensure
that the property is properly secured and is not a danger to the surrounding
area. The City shall notify the maintenance agent of the date and time of the
proposed inspection at least 10 days prior to entering the property. The
lender's maintenance agent may accompany the City's inspectors during such
inspection.

ARTICLE I. IN GENERAL



Sec. 16-1. Public service tax on utility bills



   (a)   Definitions:



      (1)   Purchaser: Every person legally liable for the payment
of taxable utility services or products rendered to them by a seller, unless
such person is exempt under section (h) hereunder.



      (2)   Seller: Every person or entity rendering taxable utility
services or products to any purchasers thereof.



   (b)   There is hereby levied by the city within the corporate limits
of said city, on each and every sale within said city of electricity, metered
or bottled gas (natural liquified petroleum gas or manufactured), bottled
water, fuel oil, a tax based upon the charge made by the seller thereof, of
ten percent (10%) of the total amount of such sales, which tax, in every case
shall be paid by the purchaser, for the use of said city, to the seller of
such electricity, gas, fuel oil or bottled water at the time of paying the
charge therefor.



   (c)   There is hereby levied and imposed by the city a public
service tax upon purchases within the municipality of telecommunications
service as defined in section 203.012, Florida Statutes, that originates and
terminates in this state a tax of seven percent (7%) of the total amount
charged for any telecommunications service provided within the municipality
or, if the location of the telecommunications service provided cannot be
determined as a part of the billing process, the total amount billed for such
telecommunications service to a telephone, or telephone number, a
telecommunications number or device, a service address, or a customer's
billing address located within the municipality, excluding public telephone

However, telecommunications service as defined in section 203.012 (5) (b),
Florida Statutes, shall be taxed only on the monthly recurring customer
service charges excluding variable usage charges.



   (d)   It shall be the duty of every seller of electricity, metered
or bottled gas (natural or manufactured), bottled water, fuel oil or
telecommunications service to collect from the purchaser for the use of said
city the tax hereby levied at the time of collecting the selling price
charged for each transaction, and to report and pay over on or before the
twentieth day of each calendar month unto the finance director of said city,
all such taxes levied and collected during the preceding calendar month.



   It shall be unlawful for any seller to collect the price of any sale of
electricity, metered or bottled gas (natural or manufactured), fuel oil,
bottled water or telecommunications service, without, at the same time,
collecting the tax hereby levied respect to such sale or sales. Except as
otherwise provided in sections 166.233 and 166.234, Florida Statutes, any
seller failing to collect such tax at the time of collecting the price of any
sale shall be liable to said city for the amount of such tax in like manner
as if the same had been actually paid to the seller and the city clerk of
said city shall cause to be brought all suits and actions and to take all
proceedings in the name of said city as may be necessary for the recovery of
such tax; provided, however, that the seller shall not be liable for the
payment of such tax upon uncollected charges. If any purchaser shall fail,
neglect, or refuse to pay to the seller the seller's said charge and the tax
hereby levied and as hereby required on account of the sale for which such
charge is made, or either, the seller shall have and is hereby vested with
his right, power and authority to immediately discontinue further service to
such purchaser until the tax and the seller's bill shall have been paid in
full.



   (e)   Each and every seller of electricity metered or bottled gas

bottled water and telecommunications service shall keep complete records
showing all sales in said city of such commodities or service, which records
shall show the price charged upon each sale, the date thereof and the date of
payment thereof, and said records shall be kept open for inspection by the
duly authorized agents of said city during business hours on all business
days, and said duly authorized agents of the city shall have the right, power
and authority to make such transcripts thereof during such times as they may
desire, except that an audit of the records of any seller of
telecommunications service shall be subject to the provisions of section
166.231 (10) (e), Florida Statutes.



   (f)   In all cases where the seller of electricity, metered or
bottled gas (natural or manufactured), fuel oil, bottled water or
telecommunications service, collects the price thereof at monthly periods,
the tax hereby levied may be computed on the aggregate amounts of purchases
during such period provided that the amount of tax to be collected shall be
the nearest whole cent to the amount computed. When the seller renders a bill
to the purchaser to cover purchases made during the period of time to which
the bill is applicable, the amount of public service tax shall be stated
separately from governmental charges and taxes, and shall not be levied
thereon.

rendered and billed on or after the effective date of this ordinance.

ordinance.

telecommunication services, the seller shall be allowed one percent (1%) of

in bulk for heating purposes except gasoline. A "bulk sale" shall mean a sale

dollars ($500.00) or imprisonment for not more than ninety (90) days or to
both fine and imprisonment for each and every violation.

county tax rolls as an improvement to real property. Such fee shall be
computed annually by the finance director according to the following criteria:

commercial structure by three thousand (3,000) square feet.



      (3)   Fee determination; proration. The average expense per
dwelling unit shall then be utilized by the finance director in computing the
public service fee applicable to each structure certified for occupancy
subsequent to January first of each calendar year. Such fee shall be prorated
on a per diem basis.



      (4)   Minimum fee. Notwithstanding the fee calculation

shall be ten dollars ($10.00).

the date of the issuance of the certificate of occupancy by the building
department and shall continue in full force and effect until discharged by

         a.   Any person who, while under the influence of an
alcoholic beverage or any drug, or the combined influence of an alcoholic
beverage and any drug, operates a motor vehicle and proximately causes an
accident resulting in an emergency response shall be liable for the expenses
of the emergency response.



         b.   For purposes of this chapter, it shall be presumed
that a person was operating a motor vehicle under the influence of an
alcoholic beverage if chemical analysis of the driver's blood, urine or
breath reveals that the weight of alcohol in the driver's blood was in excess
of one tenth of one (.10) percent.



      (2)   Criteria for assessment; DUI. A motorist arrested for
driving under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs will be assessed the
expenses of such emergency response only if all of the following criteria are
met:



         a.   Driving under the influence of alcohol and/or drugs
is evidenced by objective symptoms observed by the arresting officer and a
blood, breath or urine test above the legal one tenth of one (.10) percent
blood alcohol level; and,



         b.   Negligent operation of a motor vehicle as evidenced
by either an accident or the commission of a moving violation as defined
under the chapter 316, Florida Statutes; and,

violation was proximately caused by driving under the influence of alcohol
and/or drugs; and



         d.   The incident necessitated an emergency response,
which entailed the use of emergency lights and/ or siren by police or fire
units responding to the incident.



      (3)   Criteria for assessment; other cities. A motorist
arrested for other criminal acts resulting from intentionally wrongful
conduct while operating a motor vehicle will be assessed the expenses of such
emergency response only if one or more of the following criteria are met:

personnel who directly respond to an incident pro-rated for the time it takes
to complete the emergency response.



   (d)   Civil debt. The city will treat the emergency response costs
as a civil debt of that person which is collectable by the city in the same
manner as a contract obligation. Therefore, the city need not wait until
there is a conviction before billing the motorist.



   (e)   Delinquency. If the emergency response cost assessment is not
paid within thirty (30) days after the initial bill is mailed by the city or

for collection.

pursue recovery in any court of competent jurisdiction. This action will not
be initiated until after the criminal charges have been adjudicated.

recover all court costs, expenses and attorney's fees incurred by the city in
such dispute, whether or not suit be brought, and such rights shall include
all of such costs, expenses and attorney's fees through all appeals for other
actions.



   (g)   Penalties. Any person who shall fail to pay the cost reflected
in a bill issued pursuant to subsection (d) hereof and who shall fail to file

person who shall file an action for declaratory judgment pursuant to the
city's initial bill hereunder and who shall receive a judgment to such
person's disfavor or shall dismiss such action without conclusion and who
shall then fail to pay such fine within ten (10) calendar days, shall be
guilty of a misdemeanor and punished upon conviction by a fine of five
hundred dollars ($500.00), which fine shall be in addition to any monies due
pursuant to the terms hereof.



   (h)   Probation. In all appropriate cases, the city will seek to
have payment of the assessment imposed as a condition of probation.
Additionally, in all appropriate cases, the city will seek to have payment of
the assessment imposed as a form of restitution.

appeal it to the city manager. The city manager will review it for accuracy.
If it is found to be in error, then the bill may be corrected, or, if

outright by the consumer or by contract, lease, or otherwise.



   Contribution charge shall mean a contribution charge shall be made with
respect to each consumer, which charge shall be in lieu of a connection
charge. It is that sum of money a consumer shall be required to pay for the

to the city for the consumer's share of the costs incurred or to be incurred
by the city in providing the major portions of the overall systems as
identified in the extension policy or master plan. Under ordinary
circumstances, this contribution charge will be a one-time, set charge;
however, the charge may be revised from time to time by resolution of the
city commission and, pursuant to the developer's agreement, the consumer may
be required to increase the contribution charge paid to the city, either at

rights-of-way, conveyances or other property interests necessary or
incidental to the installation, extension, repair, maintenance, construction
or reconstruction of city's utility system or any components thereof, over or

   Equivalent Residential Connection (ERC) shall mean:



   (a)   A single-family detached residence that is served by a
five-eighth (5/8) inch meter size. The definition is intended to reflect the

city served by a five-eighth (5/ 8) inch meter. From time to time, the city
shall review consumption data, primarily within the city but, when necessary,
from data available in technical literature, and establish for each category
of customer the ERC value of that category.



   (b)   Any residential unit which is individually metered by use of a
five-eighth (5/8) inch meter shall equate to an ERC without regard to actual
consumption.



   (c)   Should an individual residential unit require a meter size in
excess of five-eighth (5/8) inch, then the number of ERC's attributable to
that residential unit shall be the same as that set forth below for
nonresidential customers.



   (d)   The number of ERC's for multi-family residential units with a
common or shared meter shall be based upon the following formula:

of delivery for water service shall be at the discharge side of the entire
water meter installation. Unless other indicated, point of delivery for sewer
service shall be the upstream connection of the clean-out which is placed at
or about the consumer's property line or easement line. In the absence of a
clean-out, the point of delivery is at the sewer lateral connection to the
sewer main of the city.



   Property shall mean the land or improvements upon land of which the
consumer is owner or over which consumer has control either by contract or
possessory interest sufficient to authorize consumer to make application for

applicant to make inquiry as to the delinquent status of the account and
bring said account current as a condition precedent to continuation of
service. The city shall maintain current records of outstanding accounts and
shall make such information available to the public at its city hall offices
during normal business hours. Service may also be withheld for service
installations which are not complete or are not in compliance with city

Sec. 19-76. Limitations of use. (Ord. No. 14-3-1, § 2, 3-25-14)



   (a)   In general. Utility service purchased from the city shall be
used by the consumer only for the purposes specified in the application for
service. The consumer shall not sell or otherwise dispose of such utility
service supplied by the city. All utility service furnished by the city to
the consumer shall be through city meters and may not, except as expressly
authorized below in this Section, be remetered by the consumer for the
purpose of selling or otherwise disposing of such service. Water/sewer
service furnished to the customer shall be rendered directly to the customer
through city's individual meter and may not be remetered by the customer for
the purpose of selling or otherwise disposing of water/ sewer service to
lessees, tenants, or others and under no circumstances shall the customer or
customer's agent or any other individual, association or corporation install
meters for the purpose of so remetering said water/sewer service, except for
the purpose of the allocation of the direct cost of water and sewer service
among multiple residential users, and then only pursuant to the city's
express approval and only to the extent thereof. Subject to the consent of
the city commission and pursuant to the terms of limitation of the applicable
remetering agreement, a consumer may remeter the water service provided by
the city solely for the purposes of determining the use thereof among the
consumer's residential lessees, tenants, or others who shall be lawfully
entitled to receive same. In no case shall a customer, except with the
written consent of the city, extend his lines across a street, alley, land,
court, property line, avenue, or other way, in order to furnish water/sewer
service for adjacent property through one (1) meter, even though such
adjacent property be owned by him. In case of such unauthorized extension,
remetering, sale or disposition of service, customer's water/sewer service is
subject to discontinuance until such unauthorized extension, remetering, sale
or disposition is discontinued and full payment is made of bills for
water/sewer service, calculated on proper classification and rate schedules
and reimbursement in full made to the city. Customer shall be responsible for
all extra expenses incurred for clerical work, testing and inspections.



   (b)   Rules and regulations for remetering.



      1.   Initial registrations and annual reports are required of
all multitenant residential properties engaged in remetering. Annual reports,
which are to be submitted to the city, shall contain a list of addresses

   When there are leaks in water or sewer lines on private property which,
in the discretion of the city manager or the manager's designee, necessitate
emergency repairs, the repairs may be made by the city at the cost of the
property owner. Repairs shall be limited to water and sewer lines and the
city shall not be responsible for lawns or vegetation. The consumer shall be
billed by the city for the actual cost of repair plus reasonable
administrative costs. Failure to make payment within thirty (30) days of the
date of billing shall entitle the city to place in the public records of
Broward County a lien on the property in the amount billed. Said lien may be

purposes of reading meters or maintaining, inspecting, repairing, installing
or removing city's property, and for any other purposes incident to
performance under or termination of any agreement with a consumer or such
consumer's predecessor in interest or use of the facilities or services made
accessible to the city by the consumer or be relocated by the city. (Ord. No.
84-4-1, § 14, 4-24-84)



Sec. 19-84. Change of occupancy, termination or transfer of services.



   When change of occupancy takes place on any premises supplied by the
city with service, written notice thereof shall be given to the city not less
than three (3) days prior to the date of change by the outgoing customer who
will be held responsible for all service used on such premises until such
written notice is so received and the city has had reasonable time to
discontinue water service. However, if such written notice has not been
received, the application of a succeeding occupant for service will
automatically terminate the prior account. The customer's deposit may be
transferred from one service location to another, but if both locations are
supplied by the city, the customer's deposit may be transferred from one name
to another.



   The property owner is ultimately responsible for any charges pursuant
to this section and this article.



   For the convenience of its customers, the city will accept telephone
orders to discontinue or transfer water service and will use all reasonable
diligence in the execution thereof. However, oral orders or advice cannot be
deemed binding or be considered formal notification to the city. (Ord. No.
84-4-1, § 15, 4-24-84)



Sec. 19-85. Resumption of service.



   After termination or discontinuance of service as provided herein, the
city may require as a condition precedent to service resumption payment in
full or adequate security in the form of additional security deposits to
cover all costs reasonably incurred by city as the result of such termination
or discontinuance, including any reconnection fees, meter installation or
removal and reinstallation costs, inspection costs, or other costs incident
thereto in accordance with city's schedule of fees and costs for such
services then in effect. (Ord. No. 84-4-1, § 16, 4-24-84)



Sec. 19-86. Customer deposits.



   Before rendering service, a deposit or guarantee satisfactory to city
to secure the payment of bills and any expenses incurred by city is required
and, upon payment, the city shall give the customer a nonnegotiable and
nontransferable deposit receipt. Such deposit shall bear no interest and
shall remain with the city as long as the customer continues to take service.
Deposits shall be made in accordance with the rate schedules of the city in
effect at the time of payment. Upon final settlement of a customer's account,
the deposit may be applied by city to any account balance due and any
remaining balance of the deposit will be refunded upon surrender to the city
of the applicable deposit receipt or when the receipt cannot be produced,
upon adequate identification. The city may require additional deposits for
customers whose services have been previously disconnected due to non-payment
as a condition to continued service, upon adequate proof as determined by the
finance director or the director's authorized representative. (Ord. No.
84-4-1, § 17, 4-24-84)



   Bills for service shall be rendered monthly or periodically at
intervals not to exceed ninety (90) days and shall be due when rendered. A
bill shall be deemed rendered when mailed United States mail, postage
prepaid, or when delivered to the customer's address shown on the application
for service. No partial payment of any bill rendered will be accepted by the
city unless authorized by the city manager, or the manager's authorized
representative. (Ord. No. 84-4-1, § 18, 4-24-84)



Sec. 19-88. Payment of water and sewer service bills concurrently.



   When both water and sewer services are provided by the city, payment of
any water service bill rendered by the city to a water service customer shall
not be accepted by the city without the simultaneous or concurrent payment of
any sewer service bill rendered by the city; and payment for sewer service
will not be accepted without the concurrent or simultaneous payment of any
outstanding water service bill. If the charges for water service are not so
paid, the city may, in addition to other remedies, discontinue both sewer
service and water service to the customer's premises for nonpayment of the
sewer service charge. The city shall not re-establish or re-connect sewer
service and water service or either of such services until such time as all
sewer service changes and water service charges and all other expenses or
charges established or provided for by these rules and regulations are paid.
No partial payment of any bill rendered will be accepted by the city except
by written agreement with the city. The city manager is authorized to
determine from whom, if anyone, partial or time payments will be accepted.
Partial or time payments may be permitted after the city manager or the
manager's authorized representative is provided with evidence of intent to
make all outstanding payments in a form and within a time period satisfactory
to the city manager or the manager's authorized representative. (Ord. No.
84-4-1, § 19, 4-24-84)

date rendered, the service will be discontinued; and the premises of such
delinquent customer will be disconnected from the system of the city
immediately upon the expiration of said twenty-five (25) days.



   If the service is disconnected pursuant to this section, a turn-off
charge will be made by the city. Such charge will be debited against the
deposit that the customer maintains with the city.



   All monies owed the city for service will be deemed liens on the
property, which liens may be filed in the official records of Broward County,
and foreclosed in the same manner provided in the Mechanic's Lien Law of the
State of Florida. (Ord. No. 84-4-1, § 20, 4-24-84; Ord. No. 2000-8-1, § 1,
8-15-2000)



Sec. 19-90. Adjustment of bills; meter readings and inspections.



   When a customer is determined by the city to have been overcharged or
undercharged as a result of incorrect meter reading, defective metering,
incorrect application of rate schedule fees and charges, or mistake in
billing, the amount so determined may be credited or billed to the customer,
as the case may be. The adjustment shall be accomplished over a period not to
exceed ninety (90) days, unless otherwise directed by the city manager or the
manager's authorized representative and so noted on the account. City shall
read and inspect meters periodically to determine their condition and
accuracy and as a basis for periodic billings. If a customer requests an
inspection or re-reading of a meter, the city may impose a service charge
therefor in accordance with policies for service established by the utility
department and approved by city commission. (Ord. No. 84-4-1, § 21, 4-24-84)



Sec. 19-91. Termination of service by city.



   The city may refuse to serve an applicant if, in the best judgment of
the city, it does not have adequate facilities or supplies to render the
service applied for, or if the service is of a character that is likely to
affect unfavorably service to other customers.



   As applicable, the city may refuse or discontinue service or remove the
meter under the following conditions, and any other spelled out in the
regulations; however, unless otherwise stated, the customer shall be given
notice and allowed a reasonable time to comply with any rule or remedy any
deficiency:



   (a)   For noncompliance with or violation of any state or municipal
law or regulation governing utility service.



   (b)   For failure or refusal of the customer to correct any
deficiencies or defects in the customer's piping or equipment which are
reported to the customer by the city.



   (c)   For the use of utility service for any other property or
purpose other than that described in the application.



   (d)   For failure or refusal to provide adequate space for the meter
or service equipment of the city.



   (e)   For failure or refusal to provide the city with a deposit to
ensure payment of bills in accordance with the utility's regulation.

city for the purpose of reading meters or inspection and maintenance of

   Whenever service is discontinued for fraudulent use of such services,
the city, before restoring service, may require the customer to make at his
own expense all changes in piping or equipment necessary to eliminate illegal
use and to pay an amount reasonably estimated as the deficiency in revenue
resulting from such fraudulent use. (Ord. No. 84-4-1, § 22, 4-24-84)



Sec. 19-92. Termination of service at customer's request.



   If service is terminated at the customer's request with no intervening
customer, the service availability charge for the period of service
termination will be collected as a condition precedent to restoration of
service. (Ord. No. 84-4-1, § 23, 4-24-84)



Sec. 19-93. Prerequisites to resumption of service.



   After termination of service pursuant to these regulations, such
service shall not be resumed to the same premises until the consumer
reimburses the city for all service charges, together with any and all
special expenses (such as for special trips, inspections, additional clerical
expenses, meter installation fees, etc.) incurred by the city on account of
the customer's violation of the contract for service or of the city's rules
and regulations in accordance with the rate schedule of the city in effect at
the time such expenses are incurred. (Ord. No. 84-4-1, § 24, 4-24-84)



Sec. 19-94. Unauthorized connections.



   Connections to the city's water and sewer system for any purpose
whatsoever shall be made only as authorized by the city. In addition to
possible criminal sanctions, unauthorized connections render the service
subject to immediate discontinuance without notice; and service shall not be
restored until such unauthorized connections have been removed and unless
settlement is made in full for all service estimated by the city to have been
used by reason of such unauthorized connection.



   Any unauthorized connections or any consumer who tampers with a meter,
or who shall tamper with any service locking device, or who shall bypass any
meter or "jump" or reconnect service where a meter has been removed shall be
subject to a charge as set forth in Schedule D together with the costs of
investigation, legal action or further protection of the city's product or
property. (Ord. No. 84-4-1, § 25, 4-24-84)



Sec. 19-95. Meters.



   Each consumer of the city receiving water must have a water meter which
measures flow and which is the ultimate basis for water charges. All water
meters shall be furnished by, installed by and remain the property of the
city and shall be accessible to and subject to another residence or business
site. The consumer shall provide meter space to the city at a suitable and
readily accessible location and when the city considers it advisable, within
the premises to be served, adequate and proper space for the installation of
meters and other similar devices.



   Before a meter is installed, all meter installation fees and charges
and contributions being due must be paid. The installation fee to be paid is
the amount in effect when the meters are installed.



   Consumers may have separate meters for irrigation purposes only.



   The meter to be furnished by the city shall be sized to be compatible
with the existing line and main sizes according to city standards and
specifications at customer's own expense. The consumer shall be required to
provide a proper service connection and service line in accordance with the
city standards and specifications. Meter sizes other than those originally
specified or intended shall be as approved by the city engineer and/or the
city utilities director. (Ord. No. 84-4-1, § 26, 4-24-84)



Sec. 19-96. All water through meter.



   That portion of the consumer's installation for water service shall be
arranged so that all water service shall pass through the meter. No person
shall make or cause to be made any connection with any main, service pipe, or
other pipes, appliances or appurtenance used for or in connection with the
city water system in such manner as to cause to be supplied water from such
plant to any faucet or other outlet whatsoever without such water passing
through a meter provided by the city and used for measuring and registering
the quantity of water passing through the same, or make or cause to be made,
without the consent of the city, any connection with any such plant or any
main, pipe, service pipe or other instrument or appliance connected with such
plant in such manner as to take or use, without the consent of the city, any
water. (Ord. No. 84-4-1, § 27, 4-24-84)



Sec. 19-97. Meter testing.



   The city reserves the right to remove the meter and check, repair, or
replace it at any time at no cost to the consumer. Should a consumer desire
their meter to be checked at any time, they may have this work done by
submitting a written request accompanied by a fee in accordance with the rate
schedules of the city in effect at the time of such testing. Should the meter
be tested and found to be registering over two (2) percent more than is
actually used, the last three (3) months service bill will be adjusted
accordingly, the meter will be repaired or replaced, and the fee returned. In
any other case, the amount of the fee shall be retained by the city to defray
the cost of testing. (Ord. No. 84-4-1, § 28, 4-24-84)



Sec. 19-98. Damaging, tampering with, altering facilities of utility plant or
system.



   No person shall: damage or knowingly cause to be damaged any meter or
water, or sewer pipe or fittings connected with or belonging to a city water
or sewer system or tamper or meddle with any meter or other appliance or any
part of such system in such manner as to cause loss or damage to the city;

same, or where a measurable adjustment can be made in the metered supply to
determine the liquid quantity.



   The measuring, totalizing, recording devices are to be supplied,
installed, and maintained by the owner.



      (3)   Samples shall be taken every hour, properly refrigerated
and composted in proportion to the flow for a representative twenty-four (24)
hour sample. Such sampling shall be repeated on as many days as necessary to
insure representative quantities for the entire reporting period. Industrial
plants with wide fluctuations in quantities of wastes, will require an
automatic sampler paced automatically by the flow-measuring device. Minimum
requirements for representative quantities shall include reevaluation during
each quarterly period. The determination of representative quantities shall
include not less than three (3) consecutive days of twenty-four (24) hour
composite samplings taken during periods of normal operation, together with
acceptable flow measurements. The frequency of sampling, sampling chamber,
metering device, sampling methods, and analysis of samples shall be subject,

(Ord. No. 89-2-1, § 50, 2-28-89)



Sec. 19-120. Compliance with regulatory requirements.



   (a)   General. The provisions of this division shall not be deemed
as alleviating compliance with applicable state and federal regulations.
Specific user charge and industrial cost recovery requirements, promulgated
pursuant to Public Law 92-500, shall be considered as a part of this division
upon official adoption. All nonresidential users will be required to comply
with pretreatment standards outlined in Title 40 of the Code of Federal
Regulations Part 403.



   (b)   Federal categorical pretreatment standards. Upon the
promulgation of the federal categorical pretreatment standards for a
particular industrial subcategory, the federal standard, if more stringent
than limitations imposed under this division for sources in that subcategory,
shall immediately supersede the limitations imposed under this division. The
manager shall notify all affected users of the applicable reporting
requirements under 40 CFR, section 403.12.



   (c)   Modification of federal categorical pretreatment standards.
Where the city's waste water treatment system achieves consistent removal of
pollutants limited by federal pretreatment standards, the city may apply to
the approval authority for modification of specific limits in the federal
pretreatment standards. "Consistent removal" shall mean reduction in the
amount of a pollutant or alteration of the nature of the pollutant by the
waste water treatment system to a less toxic or harmless site in the effluent
which is achieved by the system ninety-five (95) percent of the samples taken
when measured according to the procedures set forth in section403.7(C)(2) of
(Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part403) - "General
Pretreatment Regulations for Existing and New Sources of Pollution"
promulgated pursuant to the Act. The city may then modify pollutant discharge
limits in the federal pretreatment standards if the requirements contained in
40 CFR Part 403, section 403.7 are fulfilled and prior approval from the
approval authority is obtained.



   (d)   State requirements. State requirements and limitations on
discharges shall apply in any case where they are more stringent than federal
requirements and limitations of those in this division.



   (e)   City's right of revision. The city reserves the right to
establish by ordinance more stringent limitations or requirements on
discharges to the waste water disposal system if deemed necessary to comply
with the objectives presented in section 19-114 of this division.



   (f)   Excessive discharge. No user shall ever increase the use of
process water or, in any way, attempt to dilute a discharge as a partial or
complete substitute for adequate treatment to achieve compliance with the
limitations contained in the federal categorical pretreatment standards, or
in any other pollutant-specific limitation developed by the city or state,
unless specifically allowed in the categorical pretreatment standards
established by EPA.



   (g)   Accidental discharges. Each user shall provide protection from
accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other substances regulated by
this division. Facilities to prevent accidental discharge of prohibited
materials shall be provided and maintained at the owner or user's own cost
and expense. Detailed plans showing facilities and operating procedures to
provide this protection shall be submitted to the city for review, and shall
be approved by the city before construction of the facility. All existing
users shall complete such a plan four (4) months after the sewer use
ordinance is enacted. No user who commences contribution to the POTW after
the effective date of this division shall be permitted to introduce
pollutants into the system until accidental discharge procedures have been
approved by the city. Review and approval of such plans and operating
procedures shall not relieve the industrial user from the responsibility to
modify the user's facility as necessary to meet the requirements of this
division. In the case of an accidental discharge, it is the responsibility of
the user to immediately telephone and notify the POTW of the incident. The
notification shall include location of discharge, type of waste,
concentration and volume, and corrective actions.



   (h)   Written notice. Within five (5) days following an accidental
discharge; the user shall submit to the city manager a detailed written
report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by
the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not
relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may
be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, fish kills, or any other
damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of
any fines, civil penalties, or other liability which may be imposed by this
section or other applicable law.



   (i)   Notice to employees. A notice shall be permanently posted on
the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to
call in the event of a dangerous discharge. Employers shall insure that all
employees who may cause or suffer such a dangerous discharge to occur are
advised of the emergency notification procedure.

or welfare of persons, to the environment, causes interference to the POTW or
causes the city to violate any condition of its NPDES permit.



   (c)   Any person notified of a suspension of the waste water
treatment service and/or the waste water contribution permit shall
immediately stop or eliminate the contribution. In the event of a failure of
the person to comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the city shall
take such steps as deemed necessary including initiation of legal action by
the city attorney and immediate severance of the sewer connection, to prevent
or minimize damage to the POTW system or endangerment to any individuals. The
city shall reinstate the waste water contribution permit and/or the waste
water treatment service upon proof of the elimination of the non-complying
discharge. A detailed written statement submitted by the user describing the
causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any
future occurrence shall be submitted to the city within fifteen (15) calendar
days of the date of occurrence.

statement shall be signed by an authorized representative of the industrial
user, and certified by a qualified professional.



      (2)   Periodic compliance reports.



         a.   Any user subject to a pretreatment standard, or, in
the case of a new source, after commencement of the discharge into the POTW,
shall submit to the city manager during each quarterly period, unless
required more frequently in the pretreatment standard or by the city manager,
a report indicating the nature and concentration, of pollutants in the
effluent which are limited by such pretreatment standards. In addition, this
report shall include a record of all daily flows which during the reporting
period exceeded the average daily flow reported. At the discretion of the
city manager and in consideration of such factors as local high or low flow
rates, holidays, budget cycles, etc., the city manager may agree to alter the
months during which the above reports are to be submitted.



         b.   The city manager may impose mass limitations on
users which are using dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements, or in other cases where the imposition of mass limitations are
appropriate. In such cases, the report required by paragraph a. above shall
indicate the mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the
effluent of the user. These reports shall contain the results of sampling and
analysis of the discharge, including the flow and the nature and
concentration, or production and mass where requested by the city manager or
pollutants contained therein which are limited by the applicable pretreatment
standards. The frequency of monitoring shall be prescribed in the applicable
pretreatment standard. All analysis shall be performed in accordance with
procedures established by the approval authority pursuant to section 304(g)
of the Act and contained in 40 CFR, part 136 and amendments thereto or with
any other test procedures approved by the manager. Sampling shall be
performed in accordance with the techniques approved by the approval
authority (DER).



(Comment: Where 40 CFR, part 1 36 does not include a sampling or analytical
technique for the pollutant in question sampling and analysis shall be
performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the EPA publication,
Sampling and Analysis Procedures for Screening of Industrial Effluents for
Priority Pollutants, April 1, 1977, and amendments thereto, or with any other
sampling and analytical procedures approved by the manager.)



   (d)   Monitoring facilities. The city shall require to be provided
and operated at the user's own expense, monitoring facilities to allow
inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or
internal drainage systems. The monitoring facility should normally be
situated on the user's premises, but the city may, when such a location would
be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be
constructed in the public street or sidewalk area and located so that it will
not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.



   There shall be ample room in or near such sampling manhole or facility
to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The
facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times
in a safe and proper operating condition at the expense of the user.



   Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and
monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the city's
requirements and all applicable local construction standards and
specifications. Construction shall be completed within ninety (90) days
following written notification by the city.



   (e)   Inspection and sampling. The city shall inspect the facilities
of any user to ascertain whether the purpose of this division is being met
and all requirements are being complied with. Persons or occupants of
premises where waste water is created or discharged shall allow the city or
their representatives ready access at all reasonable times to all parts of
the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records examination or
in the performance of any of their duties. The city, approval authority and
(where the NPDES State is the approval authority), EPA shall have the right
to set up on the user's property such devices as are necessary to conduct
sampling inspection, compliance monitoring and/or metering operations. Where
a user has security measures in force which would require proper
identification and clearance before entry into their premises, the user shall
make necessary arrangements with their security guards so that upon
presentation of suitable identification, personnel from the city, approval
authority and EPA will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes
of performing their specific responsibilities.



   (f)   Pretreatment. Users shall provide necessary waste water
treatment as required to comply with this division and shall achieve
compliance with all federal categorical pretreatment standards within the
time limitations as specified by the federal pretreatment regulations. Any
facilities required to pretreat waste water to a level acceptable to the city
shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the user's expense. Detailed
plans showing the pretreatment facilities and operating procedures shall be
submitted to the city for review, and shall be acceptable to the city before
construction of the facility. The review of such plans and operating
procedures will in no way relieve the user from the responsibility of
modifying the facility as necessary to produce an effluent acceptable to the
city under the provisions of this division. Any subsequent changes in the
pretreatment facilities or method of operation shall be reported to and be
acceptable to the city prior to the user's initiation of the changes.



   The city shall annually publish in the largest daily newspaper a list
of the users which were not in compliance with any pretreatment requirements
or standards at least once during the twelve (12) previous months. The
notification shall also summarize any enforcement actions taken against the
user(s) during the same twelve (12) months.



   All records relating to compliance with pretreatment standards will be
made available to officials of the EPA or approval authority upon request.



   (g)   Confidential information. Information and data on a user
obtained from reports, questionnaires, permit applications, permits and
monitoring programs and from inspections shall be available to the public or
other governmental agency without restriction unless the user specifically
requests and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city that the
release of such information would divulge information, processes or methods
of production entitled to protection as trade secrets of the user.



   When requested by the person furnishing a report, the portions of a
report which might disclose trade secrets, or secret processes, shall not be
made available for inspection by the public but shall be made available upon
written request to governmental agencies for uses related to this division,
the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit, State
Disposal System permit and/or the pretreatment programs; furnishing the
report. Waste water constituents and characteristics will not be recognized
as confidential information.



   Information accepted by the city as confidential, shall not be
transmitted to any governmental agency or to the general public by the city
until and unless a ten (10) day notification is given to the user. (Ord. No.
89-2-1, § 55, 2-28-89)



Secs. 19-125. Wastewater User Charges.



   (a)   Statement of Intent. It is determined and declared to be
necessary and conducive to the protection of the public health, safety,
welfare and convenience of the city to collect charges from all users who
contribute wastewater to the city east and west treatment plants. The
proceeds of such charges so derived will be used for the purpose of operating
and maintaining the public wastewater treatment plant.

DIVISION 3. WATER AND SEWER EXTENSION POLICY



Sec. 19-130. Purpose and declaration of policy.



   The city owns, operates and maintains water treatment and distribution
and sewage collection, treatment and disposal systems which serve residents
inside or outside the city. New development may require the extension of
mains to provide service, as well as modification or expansion of facilities
or plant to accommodate new development. In some instances, the city in
anticipation of expansion of its systems due to growth and development may
have already provided mains for service thereof. The cost of providing
extensions, modifications, and expansions of facilities is to be borne by
property owners, builders or developers within the city's service areas to
defray or partially defray the costs of these extensions, modifications, and
expansions. The allocable share of each is to be charged as described herein.
It is the declared policy of the city by this article to establish a uniform
method of determining charges for availability of services so that all such
contributions shall be non-discriminatory among the various consumers served
by the city's systems and shall be applied as nearly as possible with
uniformity to all consumers and prospective consumers within city's service
areas. City specifically reserves its rights to fix and determine rates,
charges and contributions required for the provisions, consumption,
operation, maintenance, extension, and expansion of its utility services as
provided herein and as authorized by law. Each consumer is hereby notified
that the city, in the exercise of its governmental responsibility to provide
for the health, safety, and welfare of all consumers of its utility services,
has the authority and responsibility to amend its schedules of rates,
charges, and contributions from time to time to ensure the perpetuation of
service. (Ord. 84-4-1, § 60, 4-24-84)



Sec. 19-131. Water and sewer extension policy.



   City requires developers to pay a contribution charge and/or to install
water distribution and sewage collection facilities, with title to such
facilities being transferred to the city when the installation has been
completed. The facilities are "on-site" and "off-site" as defined in this
article. The requirement for such contributions is for the purpose of
defraying the cost of the water distribution and sewage collection systems
and to partially defray the cost of the hydraulic share of the systems. The
cash payment by the developer of such contributions to the city shall be a
condition precedent to the execution of permit applications to regulatory
agencies for the construction of the utilities systems, or as stipulated in a
developer agreement. In the event that payment by the developer of such
contributions to the city is in the form of facilities, these facilities
shall be transferred to the city as defined herein as a condition precedent
to the rendering of service by the city.



   The contribution charge is defined in section 19-72 of this article and
the schedule of contribution charges is attached hereto as schedule E. These
charges may be changed from time to time pursuant to the provisions of this
article by resolution of the city commission. (Ord. No. 84-4-1, § 61,
4-24-84)



Sec. 19-132. On-site facilities.



   Each developer, owner or builder shall be responsible for the design,
installation, inspection and testing of the complete water distribution and
sewage collection systems located in the street or streets adjoining or
within the boundaries of developer's property. The term "complete water
distribution and sewage collection systems" as used herein, shall include all
component parts of a water distribution system, including water mains,
valves, fittings, services, hydrants, and all appurtenances as shown upon the
approved design of such water distribution system and all the component parts
of the sewage collection system including all collection mains, laterals to
the point of clean-out within right-of-way or easement, force mains, lift or
pumping stations including the site for same, and all other appurtenances as
shown on the approved design for the installation of such sewage collection
system. (Ord. No. 84-4-1, § 62, 4-24-84)



Sec. 19-133. System design; independent engineers.



   City shall recognize the design of water and sewer facilities prepared
by a registered professional engineer regularly engaged in the field of
utility engineering, covering the design of developer's on-site water
distribution and sewage collection system. Provided, however, that each such
design shall be fully subject to the approval of the city engineer and shall
conform in all respects to city criteria, the facilities ultimately to be
accepted by city for ownership, operation and maintenance.



   The city shall have the right, however, to charge a plan review fee
and/or an inspecting fee as provided for in this article.



(Ord. No. 84-4-1, § 63, 4-24-84)



Sec. 19-134. Easements and rights-if-way.



   As a prerequisite to the construction of any water distribution or
sewage collection system proposed to be connected to the facilities of city,
developer shall agree to grant to city, such easements or rights-of-way
corresponding with the installation of the proposed facilities. Such grant or
conveyance shall be in the form satisfactory to the city attorney. Such
conveyances, when located on the property of developer, shall be made without
cost to the city. City reserves the right, to require such easement or
right-of-way to the point at which the meter is proposed to be installed or
at the "point of delivery of service," being the point at which the
facilities of city joins with consumers upon installation. Such easements and
rights-of-way shall be conveyed and accepted upon completion, approval and
acceptance of the work done by developer.



(Ord. No. 84-4-1, § 64, 4-24-84) Sec. 19-135. Inspection.



   The city will perform such inspections as required by the city's
adopted engineering standards of the installation of all water distribution
or sewage collection facilities installed by developer or developer's
contractors. Such inspections are intended to provide additional assurance
that water and sewer lines and/or lift stations are installed in accordance
with approved designs and are further consistent with the criteria and
specifications governing the kind and quality of such installation. However,
inspection by the city shall not relieve the developer and his design
engineer of the responsibility for ensuring all construction is in accordance
with the approved plans and specifications and applicable government
regulations. Representatives of the city shall be present at tests of
component parts of water distribution or sewage collection systems for the
purpose of determining that the system, as constructed, conforms to city's
criteria for exfiltration, infiltration, pressure testing, line and grade.
Such tests will be performed by developer or developer's contractor, but only
under the direct supervision of the City. The city shall be notified at least
forty-eight (48) hours prior to any inspections or testing performed in
accordance with these regulations. (Ord. No. 84-4-1, § 65, 4-24-84); (Ord.
No. 06-07-05, § 2, 7-25-06)



Sec. 19-136. Transfer of contributed property; bills of sale.



   (a)   Each developer who has constructed portions of the water
distribution and sewage collection system on developer's own property prior
to interconnection with city's existing facilities, shall convey such
component parts of water distribution and sewage collection system to city by
bill of sale in a form satisfactory to the city attorney, together with such
evidence as may be required by city that the water distribution and sewage
collection system proposed to be transferred to city is free of all liens and
encumbrances.



   (b)   Any facilities in the category of "consumer's lines," "service
lines" or "consumer's installation" located on the discharge side of each
entire water meter installation or on the consumer's side of the point of
delivery of service shall not be transferred to city and shall remain the
property of developer, a subsequent owner-occupant or their successors and
assigns. Such "consumer's lines," "service lines" or "consumer's
installation" shall remain the maintenance responsibility of developer or
subsequent consumers.



   (c)   City shall not accept title to any component part of the water
distribution or sewage collection system as constructed by developer until
the city has approved the construction of said lines, accepted the tests to
determine that such construction is in accordance with the criteria
established by city and other regulatory agencies have evidenced its
acceptance of such lines for city's ownership, operation and maintenance.



   (d)   Developer shall maintain accurate cost records establishing
the construction costs of all utility facilities constructed by developer and
proposed to be transferred to city. Such cost information shall be furnished
to city concurrently with the bill of sale and such cost information shall be
a prerequisite for the acceptance by city of the portion of the water
distribution and sewage collection system constructed by developer.



   (e)   City may refuse connection and deny the commencement of
service to any consumer seeking to be connected to portions of the water
distribution and sewage collection system installed by developer until such
time as the provisions of this section have been fully met by developer or
developer's successors or assigns.



(Ord. No. 84-4-1, § 66, 4-24-84)



Sec. 19-137. Off-site water distribution and sewage collection systems;
hydraulic share.



   (a)   The location, size or proposed density of developer's property
may make service to such property dependent upon the extension of off-site
water distribution and sewage collection facilities, as defined herein.



   (b)   It is the city's policy to apportion the cost of main
transmission and collection lines and pumping stations pro rata against the
properties receiving service from such main transmission lines located
off-site as to developer's property. Since each developer draws from the
hydraulic capacity of such lines, the city will require that developer pay
his property's hydraulic share of the cost of the off-site main transmission
and collection facilities through which service is rendered to developer's
property. The charge for developer's share of off-site facilities will be
applicable to developer's property on a fair-share basis whether or not the
main transmission lines and/or pumping stations have been previously
constructed or may be constructed for future service.



   (c)   A construction charge shall be assessed against property
benefited by improvements of water or sanitary systems in proportion to the
benefits to be derived therefrom. The equitable and just method of
determining and prorating the special benefits is hereby prescribed based on
consideration of both the number of units served and the number of total
acres of property thereby benefited. Assessment so determined shall be
computed for each benefited property as a combined total of the number of
units served and an acreage charge. Charges shall be due and payable at time
of execution of appropriate regulatory agency construction permit or as
stipulated in a developer agreement.



   (d)   This extension policy recognizes instances in which a
developer may be required to construct oversized or off-site facilities or to
modify and rehabilitate existing facilities, or both construct and modify
facilities, applicable to other underdeveloped property in order that such
facilities may be constructed to serve developer's property and at the same
time be sized in accordance with the city's master plan. All amounts expended
by the developer, over and above the developer's hydraulic share for
oversized or off-site facilities or modifications and rehabilitations or
each, shall be refunded to developer by subsequent developers in accordance
with the terms and conditions of the developer's agreement which the city
shall execute with the developer. The agreement shall provide for a plan of
refund based upon the connection of other properties which will be served by
the off-site facilities installed by the developer.



   (e)   As future users connect to facilities paid for by developer,
the city shall refund to the developer during the first five (5) years after
date of execution of his developer's agreement providing for such refund, pro
rata shares of expense of such facilities, as paid by subsequent users,
according to the following formula:



      (1)   The city will estimate total capacity (or additional
capacity if applicable) of the facilities in gallons;



      (2)   The volumetric load of original user will be determined
by the city as a percentage of total capacity;



      (3)   Subsequent user's load will also be determined as a
percentage of total capacity;



      (4)   Such percentage will be applied to total cost of the
off-site or oversized facilities to determine each user's share of costs;



      (5)   Subsequent user's share of costs will be collected by
the city and remitted to the original applicant within thirty (30) days after
collection;



      (6)   No refund will exceed developer's actual costs for
off-site or oversized facilities, and in no case shall it exceed the
percentage of the developer's responsibility for his volumetric load
capacity; reimbursement will only take place during the five (5) years after
execution of a developer's agreement providing for such reimbursement.



   (f)   The city further declares that the charge for the developer's
hydraulic share of off-site facilities will be applicable to the developer's
property whether or not the main transmission lines or pumping stations have
been previously constructed.



   (g)   Developers may be required to advance all or a portion of the
main transmission lines and pumping stations in order to provide a physical
interconnection of the developer's property with the facilities of the city
at their then present terminus.



   (h)   The city may require developers at each developer's sole cost
and expense to modify and rehabilitate existing water and sewer or both
facilities to accommodate the impact that the demand created by a project is
projected to have upon the water or sewer system when the city determines
that no other undeveloped property will benefit significantly from the
modification and rehabilitation.



(Ord. No. 84-4-1, § 67, 4-24-84)



Sec. 19-138. Contribution charges.



   (a)   The city declares that it shall require developers to
contribute a portion of the cost of the overall utility including but not
limited to plant facilities, water distribution, sewage collection, fire
protection, pumping facilities, storage facilities. Such contributions, by
developers, owners or builders, are defined herein as "contribution charges."
The city requires, at the time of site plan approval, an executed developer's
agreement containing a provision setting forth a schedule for payment of all
water and sewer, or either, as acceptable contribution charges. Contribution
charges shall be due and payable no later than the time of the execution of a
developer's agreement.



   (b)   The monies collected pursuant to this section are to be
treated as trust funds and may be used only to pay for or offset the cost of
a portion of capital improvements. The monies are not to be treated as
revenue of the utility.



   (c)   The computation of the contribution charge is based upon the
number of equivalent residential connections (ERC's) or on meter size, as
defined in section 19-72 of this article. A schedule F is attached hereto
with a statement of the current contribution charge for water and
contribution charge for sewer.



   (d)   The contribution charges may be amended by resolution of the
city commission. Contribution charges shall be paid at the time of the
execution of a developer's agreement, which shall be a requirement for each
consumer's connection to the system. For those who have existing developer
agreements and a site plan as of February 1 , 1983, then the contribution
charge shall be paid at the time of the application for each building permit.
For those who had developer agreements on February 1, 1983, but no site plan,
then the contribution charge shall be paid at the time of approval of the
site plan by the city council. Those with developer agreements on February 1,
1983 who have paid some portion of the contribution charge either to Cooper
City Utilities, Inc. or the City of Sunrise, shall be given credit for that
portion of the contribution charge paid.



   (e)   In situations where platting is required, but a site plan is
not, then the developer's agreement shall be executed at the time of final
plat approval, and contribution charges shall be paid at that time. For
properties which had official plat approval prior to February 1, 1983, and
for which site plan approval was not required, the contribution charge shall
be paid at the time of the application for each building permit.



   (f)   All contribution charges collected after February 1, 1983
shall be governed by this article, as same may be amended from time to time.



(Ord. No. 84-4-1, § 68, 4-24-84)



Sec. 19-139. Guaranteed revenues.



   (a)   For the purpose of defraying the cost of maintaining reserve
capacity in the water and sewer treatment plants, a developer shall pay
monthly for guaranteed revenues in an amount equal to the service
availability charge for water and sewer service for each equivalent
residential connection in accordance with the rate schedule of the city as
the same may be amended from time to time. As to master metered residential
customers, guaranteed revenues shall be based on the number of units times
the service availability charge. These guaranteed revenue payments are due
and payable monthly commencing six (6) months from the effective date of the
developer agreement, if the property has been plat approved by Broward
County, or if no plat approval by Broward County is necessary. If at the time
of the developer agreement there is no plat approval by Broward County and
such plat approval is required, then guaranteed revenue shall commence one
year after the effective date of the agreement. Guaranteed revenue shall be
due for all ERC's assigned to the property.



   (b)   Guaranteed revenue, if initiated shall no longer accrue for
unit when metered water and sewer service is established at a particular
building and the required customer deposits are paid to the city. However, if
accounts are opened in the developer's name and closed without a new account
being established, the guaranteed revenues shall resume.



   (c)   For those developers who had site plan approval prior to
February 1, 1983, guaranteed revenues are to be due and payable beginning
September 1 , 1983. Guaranteed revenue payments are considered as revenue or
income to the system.



   (d)   If any payment of guaranteed revenues required by this section
is more than fifteen (15) days late, the city shall send the developer a
notice of delinquency by prepaid certified mail, and failure of the developer
to make the required payment in full within five (5) days of the date shown
on the notice shall constitute a default by the developer.



   (e)   Should the developer be in default of his obligation to pay
guaranteed revenues, the city shall have the right to exercise any of the
following sanctions or penalties:



      (1)   The developer agreement is voidable by resolution of the
city commission.



      (2)   The site plan for the property is voidable by resolution
of the city commission.



      (3)   No final inspections shall be approved by the city.



      (4)   No certificate of occupancy shall be issued by city for
any unit on the property.



      (5)   There shall be an interest penalty equal to the maximum
rate allowed by Florida State Law on any payments due to city from developer
which are not paid. The penalty, when applicable, shall accrue from the due
date of payment as provided in this agreement. The rate of interest shall be
established by resolution of the city commission.



      (6)   The city shall be entitled to lien the property and
foreclose the lien in satisfaction of any payments due under this section.



      (7)   The city shall be entitled to any other remedy at law
and failure to exercise any remedy shall not constitute a waiver of said
remedy.



(Ord. No. 84-4-1, § 69, 4-24-84)



Sec. 19-140. Automatic escalation provision.



   (a)   The basis for contribution charges have been structured by the
city with regard to two (2) major but variable factors. First, the present

theory of treatment facilities and their degree of treatment sophistication
as prescribed by the appropriate regulatory agencies.



   (b)   The city declares that the schedule of contribution charges
set forth herein will be automatically escalated based upon increases in
utility construction index published in Engineering News Record Magazine,
entitled "20 Cities Construction Cost Index," using as a base, the published
index for the quarter ending December 31, 1982. The city will automatically
adjust the contribution charges at the time of execution of a developer
agreement.

Sec. 19-141. Escalation by the city commission.



   Separate and apart from the automatic escalation provisions set forth
above, the utilities department of the city may file with the commission a
higher contribution schedule, and in support, detail the reasons requiring
such increased contributions. Such reasons may include and be related to
increasing standards of service, inadequate or incorrect estimates of the
total anticipated contribution versus the actual investment levels required
by the city for water distribution and sewer collection facilities, actual
experience with regard to matters of service area density having a direct
bearing upon contributions received versus the cost of construction of the
facilities; matters of net investment bearing upon rates and charges required
of consumers and/or such other matters which may reasonably bear upon the
needs, necessities, or considerations requiring such change. (Ord. No.
84-4-1, § 71, 4-24-84)



Sec. 19-142. Extensions outside incorporated area.

City's utility system prior to the effective date of this section (September
13, 2006), the city shall institute a surcharge of twenty-five percent (25%)
upon all charges, or such other amount as authorized by general law and
section 19-101 of this code. The provisions of this section shall not prevent
the city from entering into bulk user agreements with adjacent
municipalities, Broward County and/or private utility companies in accordance
with section 19-145 of this code. (Ord. No. 84-4-1, § 72, 4-24-84; Ord. No.

   (b)   Upon completion of construction and transfer of improvements
to the city by bill of sale together with accepted "as-built" plans as
prepared and certified by the engineer of record, the bond may be reduced to
no less than twenty-five (25) percent of the certified completed cost of the

   (b)   The city commission recognizes that the interruption of water
or sewer service by way of an emergency might adversely affect the health,
safety and welfare of the customers of the utility and the citizens of the
city.



   (c)   Recognizing that fact, the city commission hereby waives the
requirements as to competitive bidding and advertising when an emergency
exists for immediate repair of the utility systems.



   (d)   The city commission authorizes the emergency to be declared by
the mayor of the city, or in the mayor's absence, the vice mayor, together
with the city manager or in their absence the acting city manager pursuant to
charter section 4.01. If neither the mayor nor vice mayor is available, their
decision may be made by any available member of council. If the city manager
or acting city manager is unavailable, their decision may be made by the
utilities director.

reasons therefore stated in such response.



      (3)   The rate adjustment, if granted, will apply
retroactively to the date on which the erroneous information was applied to
the applicant's fee, but not to exceed one (1) year prior to the adjustment
request.



      (4)   If the petition is denied, the petitioner may appeal to
Circuit Court, provided said appeal is filed within thirty (30) days after
the City Manager renders his/her decision.



   (b)   The city manager, upon discovering an error or oversight in
the calculation of the fee, may initiate an adjustment request. The request
must be made in writing documenting the reasons for the adjustment. In the
event that the adjustment would require an increase in the fee, the city
manager must provide the adjustment request to the affected fee payer thirty
(30) days prior to adjusting the fee and offer the fee payer an opportunity
within the stated thirty (30) days to request an adjustment pursuant to the
provisions of subsection (a) above. An increase or decrease in fee shall not
be retroactively effective more than one (1) year from the date of adjustment.

Sec. 22-4. Reserve units.



   (a)   Purpose and intent. Reserve units are established by the
Broward County and Cooper City comprehensive plans and included in this
chapter as a means of permitting flexibility in the application of the
comprehensive plan's residential density standards. The purpose and intent of
the reserve unit provisions is to permit residential uses within areas
designated for nonresidential land use and to otherwise implement the city
comprehensive plan.



   (b)   Allocation and approval procedures. The city commission shall
have final authority for approving reserve unit allocations. Requests for
reserve unit allocations may be included and processed with applicable
development order applications, but in all cases reserve unit allocations
shall require a public hearing meeting the notice and procedure requirements
of sec. 23-151, Rezoning (map amendment).



   (c)   Allocation standards. The city shall maintain an active log of
the number of residential units held in reserve, the number of reserve units
allocated to individual parcels and the reason(s) for allocating reserve
units to respective parcels. The city shall be responsible for notifying the
Broward County planning council, in writing, whenever reserve units are
allocated. Upon granting an allocation of reserve units, the total number of
units held in reserve shall be reduced accordingly. The following standards
shall govern the city commission's allocation of available reserve units:



      (1)   The city commission may allocate reserve units to a
parcel of land designated for office use on the comprehensive plan's future
land use map, if:



         a.   The total residential floor area does not exceed
fifty (50) percent of the gross floor area of all office space on the parcel,



         b.   The residential units are physically a part of the
office structure(s) and



         c.   The maximum gross density of the parcel receiving
the reserve units does not exceed fifteen (15) units per acre.



      (2)   The city commission may allocate reserve units to a
parcel of land designated for commercial use on the comprehensive plan's
future land use map in order to permit special residential facilities within
nonresidential districts. When reserve units are allocated to accommodate
special residential facilities, the city's pool of available reserve units
shall not be reduced until a total of one hundred (100) special residential
facility beds have been approved or developed within the community. After use
of the one hundred (100) bed bonus allocation, the city's pool of reserve
units shall be reduced by one unit for each two beds or sleeping units within
new or expanded special residential facilities located in nonresidential
districts.



      (3)   The city commission may allocate reserve units to
planned unit developments in order to permit residential development. In
applying reserve units to planned unit developments pursuant to this
provision, the city commission shall be required to find that:



         a.   The reserve units will be used to further the
purpose and intent in this section;



         b.   The reserve units will be used to discourage urban
sprawl; and



         c.   The reserve units will be used to encourage land
use patterns that are easily served by existing utilities and services.



   (d)   Land use plan amendments. The use of reserve units is strictly
governed by the requirements of this section. Any other use of reserve units
shall not be permitted, but, rather shall require an amendment of the local
comprehensive plan and recertification by the Broward County planning council.



Sec. 22-5. Notification prior to sale of dwelling.



   Surrounding property: All land adjacent on all sides to the residential
plat within which the new dwelling unit is located.



   (a)   Information provided by seller.



      (1)   Prior to the sale of any new dwelling unit, the seller
shall inform the buyer of the zoning of the property to be purchased and the
zoning and land use designation of all other surrounding property.



      (2)   If any instance where all or part of the surrounding
property is a planned unit development, the seller shall also inform the
buyer of the proposed use of such PUD zoning areas by posting a copy of the
concept site plan in the sales office.



   (b)   Notice. In order to ensure that proper notice is given and
that the buyer understands what each of the zoning categories means, the
seller shall do the following:



      (1)   At the time of the issuance of development permits and
prior to the sale of a new dwelling unit, the seller shall distribute to the
buyer and attach to the written contract a "notice of surrounding zoning and
land use," a copy of which is on file in the clerk's office and marked as
exhibit "A," with the location of the new dwelling unit to be sold indicated
on the form. The seller shall retain a copy of the form for his files. The
seller shall obtain the required forms from the building department.



      (2)   The seller shall post a copy of the city zoning map and
of the city's certified land use plan in its sales office. Copies of these
maps shall be obtained from the office of the city clerk, at a nominal cost
based on the cost of reproduction of the map.

   In order to implement the mandate of the city's comprehensive plan to
ensure that adequate potable water, sanitary sewer, solid waste, drainage,
park and road public facilities are available to accommodate development in
the city concurrent with when the impacts of development occur on such public
facilities, the city commission establishes, pursuant to the terms of this
article, (1) a management and monitoring program that evaluates the
conditions of public facilities to ensure they are being adequately planned
for and funded to maintain the LOS for each public facility, and (2) a
regulatory program that ensures that each public facility is available to
serve development concurrent with when the impacts of development occur or
that development orders are conditioned on the availability of public
facilities to serve the development concurrent with when the impacts of
development



Sec. 22-23. Management and monitoring program.



   (a)   General. In order to ensure that adequate potable water,

public facilities, the city shall establish the following management and
monitoring practices. Their purpose is to evaluate and coordinate the timing,
provision, and funding of potable water, sanitary sewer, solid waste,
drainage, park and road public facilities (1) to ensure adequate planning and
funding to maintain the LOS for the public facilities, and (2) to evaluate
the capacity of the public facilities for use in the regulatory program to
ensure (a) that no development orders are issued unless adequate public
facilities are available to serve the development concurrent with when the
impacts of development are proposed to occur, or (b) that no development
orders are issued unless they are conditioned on the availability of public
facilities to serve the development concurrent with when the impacts of
development occur.



   (b)   Annual Update and Inventory Report (AUIR).



      (1)   By May 1 of each year, the director shall complete an
annual update and inventory report on public facilities (hereinafter AUIR).
To assist in the preparation of the AUIR and to maintain updated inventories,
the city engineering and utilities director shall review public facility
capacity for capital potable water, capital sanitary sewer, capital solid
waste, and capital drainage public facilities and provide updates on capacity
surpluses and deficiencies to the director and the city manager on at least a
quarterly basis.



      (2)   The AUIR shall determine the existing conditions of all
capital potable water, capital sanitary sewer, capital solid waste, capital
drainage, capital park, and capital road public facilities, determine and
summarize the available capacity of these capital improvements (public
facilities) based on their LOS, and forecast the capacity of existing and
planned public facilities identified in the five (5) year capital improvement
schedule for each of the five (5) succeeding years, and ten (10) succeeding
years. The forecasts shall be based on the most recently updated schedule of
capital improvements (public facilities) for each public facility. The AUIR
shall be based on the most recent Bureau of Economic and Business Research
(BEBR) population projections, updated public facility inventories, updated
unit cost, and analysis of traffic count data.



      (3)   The findings of the AUIR shall form the basis for the
annual update to the CIE, any proposed projects to be included in the city's
tentative annual budget, the determination of any compact deferral area and
the review of and issuance of development orders during the next year.



   (c)   Annual determination of adequate public facilities
(concurrency). Based on the findings of the AUIR, by May 1 of each year, the
director will report to the city commission concerning deficiencies in public
facilities and remedial action options including but not limited to the

needed public facility projects by the city commission, the state
legislature, or the city or county voters.



   (d)   Recommendations on the annual CIE update and tentative annual
budget. Based upon analysis of the AUIR, the director shall propose to the
city commission by July 15 of each year, the annual update to the CIE in
conjunction with the release of the city's tentative annual budget which is
to be adopted by October 1 of each year, will include projects and funding
approved by the city commission in the adopted annual CIE update.



   (e)   Establishment of compact deferral areas for roads.



      (1)   Determination of deficient road segment. For the purpose
of determining whether a road segment is a deficient road segment, the county
shall consider whether:



         a.   The necessary capital road public facilities are in
place during the review period; or



         b.   A development order is issued subject to the
condition that the necessary capital road public facilities will be in place
when the impacts of the development occurs, but in no event later than the
issuance of the building permit; or



         c.   The necessary capital road public facilities are
under construction during the review period; or



         d.   The necessary capital road public facilities are
guaranteed in an enforceable development agreement that guarantees that the
necessary public facilities will be in place when the impacts of development
occur, but in no event later than the issuance of the building permit; or



         e.   During the review period, the necessary capital
road public facilities are the subject of a binding executed contract which
provides for the commencement of the actual construction of the required
capital road public facilities within one (1) year of the issuance of the
development order; or



         f.   The necessary capital road public facilities are
guaranteed in an enforceable development agreement which requires the
commencement of the actual construction of the public facilities within one
year of the issuance of the applicable development permit; or



         g.   The construction of the required capital road
public facilities is included in the initial three (3) years of the state's
five (5) year work program or the city's first year of the current five (5)
year capital improvement schedule adopted as part of the comprehensive plan,
and the city commission has made an express finding, after a public hearing,
that the current five (5) year capital improvement schedule is based on a
realistic, financially feasible program of funding from existing revenue
sources, and that the capital improvement program and schedule, at a minimum,
meet the requirements of Rule 9J-5.0055(2)(c), F.A.C.



         h.   Before determining that any road segment is a
deficient road segment, the director shall undertake a detailed capacity
analysis of the road segment to ensure that the road segments operational
conditions verify that it is a deficient road segment.



      (2)   Establishment of compact deferral areas. If the findings
of the AUIR identify additional needed road improvements, they will be
included in the road component of the proposed annual CIE update. Broward
County will determine if there is a deficient road segment. Broward County
shall propose and identify a compact deferral area around any deficient road
segment. The boundaries of a compact deferral area shall be proposed by
Broward County and forwarded by the director to the city commission by May 1
of each year. The proposed compact deferral area shall become effective on
June 1 of each year if the additional needed road improvements identified in
the AUIR are not added to the CIE by June 1 of each year. No trips shall be
permitted for new development in a compact deferral area covering a deficient
road segment.



      (3)   Standards in establishing compact deferral areas. The
boundaries for the compact deferral area shall be based upon accepted
transportation planning practices as established by Broward County, and shall
include those areas surrounding a deficient road segment where development
may be expected to place an unreasonable number of new trips on the deficient
road segment. The director shall complete a detailed conditions analysis of
the deficient road segment within each proposed compact deferral area
boundary prior to forwarding the boundaries of the compact deferral area to
the city commission. The analysis shall take into consideration
characteristics of the road segment (such as traffic control, signal spacing,
timing, and phasing) using procedures documented in the 1985 Highway Capacity
Manual (or its current edition).



      (4)   Review and approval by city commission. After receipt of
the proposed boundaries of a potential compact deferral area from the
director, the city commission, by June 1 of each year, shall hold a public
hearing noticed pursuant to the requirements of Sec. 166.041, Fla. Stat., and
after consideration of the proposal and public comment, approve the
boundaries (including a map of the boundaries) with or without modifications,
or determine that competent substantial evidence has been placed on the
record to show that the road segment is not deficient and determine that the
establishment of a compact deferral area is not necessary to ensure that
development orders are served by adequate road public facilities. The
approved boundaries for each compact deferral area will become effective on
June 1 of each year if additional road improvements are not added to the
capital improvement element at that time.



      (5)   Map of compact deferral area. A map showing the
boundaries of each compact deferral area established by Broward County and
approved by the city commission shall be kept in the office of the director
and the office of the clerk to the city commission for review and inspection
by the public during normal business hours.



      (6)   Duration of established compact deferral area. Once the
boundaries of a compact deferral Area are approved by the city commission,
they are valid for one (1) year, unless otherwise dissolved.



      (7)   Dissolution of compact deferral area. If the additional
needed road improvements identified in the AUIR are added to the CIE; or if
funds are available for, and committed for construction of, the needed road
improvements to eliminate the classification of a road as a deficient road
segment; or if a detailed conditions analysis of the deficient road segments
within the compact deferral area determines that the deficient road segments
are no longer deficient; then the compact deferral area established for that
deficient road segment shall be dissolved in the same manner in which it was
established.



Sec. 22-24. Regulatory program.



   (a)   General. In order to ensure that adequate potable water,
sanitary sewer, solid waste, drainage, park and road public facilities are
available concurrent with when the impacts of development occur on each road
public facility, the city shall establish the following development review
procedures to ensure that no development orders are issued unless adequate
public facilities are available to serve the proposed development, or that
the development order is conditioned on the availability of public facilities
to serve the development concurrent with when the impacts of development
occur on the public facilities.



   (b)   Exemptions. The following development orders and developments
shall be exempt from the terms of this article:



      (1)   All valid, unexpired final development of regional
impact (DRI) development orders which were issued prior to adoption of this
article except where:



         a.   Development conditions or stipulations applicable
to concurrency, or the provision of adequate public facilities concurrent
with the impacts of development, exist in the DRI development order;



         b.   Substantial deviations are sought for a DRI
development order, and then, this article shall apply only to those portions
of the development for which the deviation is sought;



         c.   An overriding concern for public health, safety, or
welfare exists;



         d.   The city can demonstrate pursuant to sec. 380.06,
Florida Statutes, that substantial changes in the conditions underlying the
approval of the development order have occurred or the development order was
based on substantially inaccurate information provided by the developer or
that the application of this article to the development order is clearly
established to be essential to the public health, safety and welfare; or



         e.   The new requirements would not so change or alter a
DRI development order that they would materially or substantially affect the
developer's ability to complete the development authorized by the DRI
development order.



      (2)   All valid, unexpired final local development orders
issued prior to adoption of this article.



      (3)   Construction of public facilities that are consistent
with the city's comprehensive plan.



      (4)   Any development orders determined by the director not to
impact any public facilities.



      (5)   Development orders permitting replacement,
reconstruction or repair of existing development consistent with all elements
of the city's comprehensive plan.



      (6)   All single family residential lots platted under a
valid, final subdivision plat prior to March 20, 1979.



      (7)   All lots platted under a valid, final subdivision plat
from March 20, 1979 to October 1, 1989, with valid, unexpired site plans
approved by the city.



      (8)   Lots which are not required to be platted under a final
subdivision plat and which have not been platted.



      (9)   Vested rights. Any development order or development
whose current owner is entitled to receive, and who properly obtains, a
determination of vested rights for adequate public facilities ("APF") in
accordance with the provisions of this sec. 22-24(b)(9), vested rights.



         a.   Application. An application for determination of
vested rights for APF shall be submitted to the director in the form
established by the director. An application fee in an amount to be determined
by the city commission shall accompany and be part of the application. The
application shall, at a minimum, include:



            1.   Name, address, and telephone number of the
owner and authorized applicant if other than the owner;



            2.   Street address, legal description, and
acreage of the property; and



            3.   All factual information and knowledge
reasonably available to the owner and applicant to address the criteria
established in sec. 22-24(b)(9)e., criteria for vested rights.



         b.   Determination of completeness. After receipt of an
application for determination of vested rights for APF, the director shall
determine whether the application submitted is complete. If he determines
that the application is not complete, the director shall notify the applicant
in writing of the deficiencies. The director shall take no further steps to
process the application until the deficiencies have been remedied.



         c.   Review and determination by director and city
attorney. After receipt of a completed application for determination of
vested rights for APF, the director and the city attorney shall review and
evaluated the application in light of all of the criteria in sec.
22-24(b)(9)e., criteria for vested rights. Based on the review and
evaluation, the director and the city attorney shall deny, grant, or grant
with conditions the application for determination of vested rights for APF
for the property or properties at issue. The determination shall be in
writing and shall include findings of fact for each of the applicable
criteria established in sec. 22-24(b)(9)e., criteria for vested rights,
conclusions of law for each of such criteria, and a determination denying,
granting, or granting with conditions, in whole or in part, the vested rights
for adequate public facilities.



         d.   Appeal to the city commission. Within thirty (30)
days after issuance of the director and city attorney's written determination
of vested rights for APF, the owner or its authorized attorney or agent may
appeal the determination of vested rights for APF to the city commission. A
fee for the application and processing of an ownerinitiated appeal shall be
established at a rate set by the city commission from time to time and shall
be charged to and paid by the owner or its authorized agent. The city
commission shall adopt the determination of vested rights for APF unless the
city commission finds that the determination is not supported by substantial
competent evidence in the record or that the determination of vested rights
for APF is contrary to the criteria established in sec. 22-24(b)(9)e.,
criteria for vested rights.



         e.   Criteria for vested rights. This section is
intended to strictly adhere to and implement existing case law and statutory
law as they relate to the doctrine of vested rights and equitable estoppel as
applied to a local government exercising its authority and powers in zoning,
the provision of adequate public facilities concurrent with development
(concurrency), and related matters. It is the express intent of the city to
require application of the provisions of this article to as much development
and property in the city as is legally possible without violating the legally
vested rights which the owner may have obtained in accordance with Florida
common law and statutory law, particularly sec. 163.3167(8), Florida
Statutes. The criteria herein provided shall be considered in rendering a
vested rights determination under this section. It is intended that each case
be decided on a case by case factual analysis. An owner shall be entitled to
a positive determination of vested rights for APF only if he demonstrates by
substantial competent evidence that he is entitled to complete his
development without regard to the otherwise applicable provisions of this
article based on the provisions of sec. 163.3167(8), Florida Statutes, or all
three of the following requirements of the three-part test under Florida
common law:



            1.   Upon some act or omission of the city,



            2.   A property owner relying in good faith,



            3.   Has made such a substantial change in
position or has incurred such extensive obligations and expenses that it
would be highly inequitable and unjust to destroy the rights acquired.



         f.   Limitation on determination of vested rights for
APF. A determination of vested rights for APF which grants an application for
determination of vested rights for APF shall expire and be null and void
unless construction is commenced pursuant to a final development order,
within two (2) years after the issuance of the determination of vested rights
for APF under this sec. 22-24(b)(9), vested rights, and such development
pursuant to a final development order, is continuing in good faith. The
aforementioned two (2) year time limitation on the determination of vested
rights for APF shall be stayed during any time periods within which
commencement of construction pursuant to a final development order is
prohibited or deferred by the city solely as a result of lack of adequate
public facilities to serve the property pursuant to this article.



   (c)   Certificate of public facility adequacy.



      (1)   General.



         a.   After the effective date of this article, a valid,
unexpired certificate of public facility adequacy shall be obtained prior to
final subdivision plat approval, or, in the event a final subdivision plat is
not required for the development, prior to the earlier to occur of final site
plan approval or building permit approval; provided, however, any development
orders except a building permit may be approved or issued provided they are
expressly conditioned on the issuance of a certificate of public facility
adequacy prior to building permit approval and provided the owner and
applicant proceed at their own risk and expressly waive and release the city
in writing from any and all future claims of vested rights and equitable
estoppel resulting from such conditional approval or actions relying thereon.



         b.   At the applicants request, the city shall review
and approve, approve with conditions, or deny, an application for a
certificate of public facility adequacy prior to the consideration of an
application for development approval for any development order needed for a
proposed development prior to receipt of a final subdivision plat approval,
final site plan approval, or building permit approval.



         c.   Where the proposed development has been issued
final subdivision plat approval or final site plan approval prior to the
effective date of this article, a certificate of public facility adequacy
shall be obtained prior to approval of the next development order required
for the proposed development.



         d.   All applicable impact fees for a development shall
be paid to the city in the amount estimated to be due upon issuance of the
final local development order(s) for the development upon or prior to
issuance of a certificate of public facility adequacy for the development.
The payment of the estimated impact fees shall be applied as a credit towards
the impact fees calculated and due upon issuance of the final local
development order(s) for the development. Such fees shall be otherwise paid
in accordance with the applicable impact fee ordinance, and shall be
refundable pursuant to such ordinances only upon expiration of the
certificate of public facility adequacy for that development.



      (2)   Rules of general applicability for certificate of public
facility adequacy.



         a.   Timing. An application for a certificate of public
facility adequacy may be submitted at any time, subject to sec. 22-24(c)(1),
certificate of public facility adequacy general.



         b.   Consolidated application.  A building permit,
final subdivision plat or final site plan shall receive final approval only
to the extent to which the proposed development receives a certificate of
public facility adequacy. The application for a certificate of public
facility adequacy may be submitted with an application for development
approval, where appropriate under this article.



         c.   Assignability and transferability. A certificate of
public facility adequacy shall run with the land, shall be assignable within
a proposed development, and shall not be assignable or transferable to other
development.



         d.   Expiration. A certificate of public facility
adequacy shall expire when the development order for which it was obtained
expires; provided that where no expiration for a development order is
applicable, the certificate shall expire three (3) years after the date of
its approval except to the extent that building permits have been issued for
the proposed development for which the certificate is approved and the
proposed development is then completed pursuant to the terms of the city
building codes.



         e.   Effect. Issuance of a certificate of public
facility adequacy shall demonstrate proof of adequate public facilities to
serve the development approved in the development order, subject to the
conditions in the development order. A subsequent application for development
approval for development approved in a development order for which a
certificate of public facility adequacy has been approved shall be determined
to have adequate public facilities as long as the certificate of public
facility adequacy is valid and unexpired. When a certificate of public
facility adequacy expires, any subsequent application for development
approval shall require a new certificate of public facility adequacy to be
issued pursuant to the terms of this section prior to approval of any
subsequent development order for the proposed development.



         f.   Conditional approval. Anything in this article to
the contrary notwithstanding, all certificates of public facility adequacy
approved or issued from the date that the director releases the next years
AUIR to the public through the date that the next years approved boundaries
for each compact deferral area become effective shall be expressly
conditioned upon any and all of the next years restrictions, limitations,
provisions and boundaries adopted by the city commission pursuant to sec.
22-23(e), establishment of compact deferral areas for roads.



      (3)   Effect of development agreement in conjunction with a
certificate of public facility adequacy. Upon approval by the city
commission, any applicant may enter into a development agreement with the
city pursuant to the provisions of section 163.3220-3242, Florida Statutes
(1989), in conjunction with the approval of a development order and/or a
certificate of public facility adequacy. The effect of the development
agreement shall be to bind the parties pursuant to the terms and conditions
of the development agreement and the certificate of public facility adequacy
in order to insure that adequate public facilities are available to serve the
proposed development concurrent with when the impacts of the development
occur on the public facilities. Development agreements may address
conditional development order approvals and conditions for renewal of the
certificate of public facility adequacy beyond five (5) years, however, the
duration of any certificate of public facility adequacy shall not exceed five
(5) years. Development agreements may also provide for private provision of
public facilities or for a joint endeavor between the private sector and the
city to provide public facilities. Any public facility in the five (5) year
schedule of capital improvements in the CIE on which such a certificate of
adequate public facilities is made in conjunction with the approval of a
development order and a development agreement shall not be delayed, deferred,
or removed from the five (5) year schedule of improvements in the CIE.



      (4)   Procedure for review of application.



         a.   Submission of application and fee. An application
for a certificate of public facility adequacy shall be submitted to the
director. An application shall be submitted at the filing of the earliest or
next to occur of final subdivision plat, final site plan, or building permit.
An application fee in an amount to be determined by the city commission shall
accompany and be part of the application, except that no application fee
shall be required for an application for a certificate of public facility
adequacy submitted in conjunction with an application for a final subdivision
plat, a final site plan, or a building permit.



         b.   Application contents. The form and contents for the
application for public facility adequacy shall be established by the director
and shall be published and made available to the general public.



         c.   Determination of completeness and review. After
receipt of an application for certificate of public facility adequacy, the
director shall determine whether it is complete within ten (10) days. If it
is determined that the application is not complete, written notice shall be
served on the applicant specifying the deficiencies. The director shall take
no further action on the application unless the deficiencies are remedied.
Within twenty (20) days after the application is determined to be complete,
the director shall review and grant, grant with conditions, or deny each
public facility component in the application pursuant to the standards
established in sec. 22-24(c)(5), certification of public facility adequacy
standards for review of application.



         d.   Appeal to public facilities determination appeal
committee. Within thirty (30) days after issuance of the determination of the

facilities determination appeal committee. A fee for the application and
processing of an appeal shall be established at a rate set by the city
commission from time to time and shall be charged to and paid by the
applicant. The public facilities determination appeal committee shall hold a
hearing on the appeal and shall consider the determination of the director
and public testimony in light of all the criteria set forth in sec.
22-24(c)(5), certification of public facility adequacy standards for review
of application. The public facilities determination appeal committee shall
adopt the director's determination on the application for a certificate of
public facility adequacy with or without modifications or conditions, or
reject the director's determination. The public facilities determination
appeal committee shall not be authorized to modify or reject the director's
determination unless the public facilities determination appeal committee
finds that the determination is not supported by substantial competent
evidence or that the growth management director's determination is contrary
to the criteria established in sec. 22-24(c)(5), certification of public
facility adequacy standards for review of application. The decision of the
public facilities determination appeal committee shall include findings of
fact for each of the criteria.



         e.   Makeup of public facilities determination appeal
committee. The public facilities determination appeal committee shall be
comprised of three (3) members: an assistant to the city manager;
metropolitan planning organization (MPO) coordinator, or designee; and the
director.



      (5)   Standards for review of application. The following
standards shall be used in the determination of whether to grant, grant with

                  1.   For the purpose of issuing
development permits, the peak hour LOS standard for road segments within the
District shall be the Generalized Two-way Peak Hour LOS "D" Volumes for
Florida's Urbanized Areas Table in Florida DOT's most current Level of
Service Manual.



                  2.   Measurement of Capacities



                  The procedure for the initial measuring
of highway capacities is the Generalized Two-way Peak Hour Volumes for
Florida's Urbanized Areas Table in Florida DOT's most current Level of
Service Manual. The measurement of capacity may also be determined by
substantiation in the form of engineering studies or other data. Traffic
analysis techniques must be technically sound and justifiable as determined
by the City or by the Broward County Action Plan Review Committee.
Alterations to capacity on the State Highway Network shall require the
opportunity for FDOT review.



                  3.   Development Subject to Adequacy
Determination



                  Prior to application for a building
permit, the applicant shall obtain a Transportation Concurrency Satisfaction
Certificate from the Broward County Development Management Division. The City
will not issue a building permit, unless the corresponding Transportation
Concurrency Satisfaction Certificate has been presented. The County
Commission shall adopt within the Broward County Administrative Code
exemptions from this requirement for categories of building permits that
clearly do not create additional transportation impacts.



                  For any adequacy determination involving
development of previously improved land, the determination shall be for the
additional trips that equal the difference between the trips to be generated
by the proposed development and the trips generated by any existing
development, except that any demolished development, which qualifies as
existing under the criteria below, shall be counted at one hundred ten
percent (110%) of its generated trips.



                  Existing development shall be construed
to include vacant structures, and previous development demolished no earlier
than eighteen (18) months previous to the date the application is submitted.



                  The City shall defer to Broward County to
establish the methodology of determining the number of trips generated for
any existing vacant structure by resolution adopted by the Board of County
Commissioners.



               c.   For Regional Transportation Concurrency
within the Standard Concurrency District.



                  1.   The following applications for a
development permit for development of vacant land or previously improved land
shall be subject to an adequacy determination:



                     (a)   All plats or replats,
except those described in subsection 2) below;



                     (b)   Site plans and building
permits in the unincorporated area where the property is unplatted or was
platted, with plat approval received before March 20, 1979; and



                     (c)   Requests by developers to
place a notation on the face of a plat approved and recorded between June 4,
1953, and March 20, 1979.



                  2.   For a replat, or an amendment to
a note on a plat, or a requirement to place a note on a plat, where property
was platted after March 20, 1979, an adequacy determination shall be required
for those additional trips that equal the difference between the previous
plat and the replat; or the previous note and the proposed amendment to the
note; or the development approved by the County Commission at the time of
plat approval and the proposed note to be placed on the plat.



                  3.   For the purposes of this
subsection, the term "replat" shall be defined as an application for plat
approval of land within a recorded plat, which was approved by the County
Commission after March 20, 1979.



               d.   For Adequacy of the Entire Regional
Transportation Network within the Standard Concurrency District



                  1.   No application for a building
permit shall be issued by the City without documentation that a finding of
adequacy has been made by the County except as otherwise provided in
paragraph 2) below.



                  2.   The following types of building
permits shall be exempt from this adequacy determination:



                     (a)   All additions and
renovations to residential buildings that do not increase the number of
dwelling units, and do not change the type of dwelling units:



                     (b)   All additions and
renovations to non-residential buildings that do not increase the number of
gross square feet of any use, and do not introduce any new use. Gross square
footage includes permanent canopies and overhangs for gas stations,
drive-thru facilities, and overhangs designed for outdoor tables at a
restaurant.



                  3.   Required Determinations



                     a.   Regional Transportation
Concurrency within Transit Oriented Concurrency District



                        1.   Pursuant to Section
5-182, Broward County Land Development Code, as amended, Broward County shall
issue a Transportation Concurrency Satisfaction Certificate, relative to a
building permit application for property within the Transit Oriented
Concurrency District, under any of the following circumstances:



                           (a)   If the
building permit application is on property within a recorded plat that was
approved by the County Commission on or after March 20, 1979, and before the
effective date of this ordinance; and the building permit application is
consistent with the level of development under which the plat is currently
approved by the County Commission; and the County Commission's finding of
satisfaction of transportation concurrency for the plat is not in violation
of an agreement with Broward County with respect to transportation
concurrency.



                           (b)   If the
building permit application is on property for which Broward County has made
a finding of vested rights with respect to transportation concurrency; and
the building permit application is consistent with the level of development
under which the plat was approved by the County Commission, if any; and the
plat is not in violation of an agreement with Broward County with respect to
transportation concurrency, if any.



                           (c)   If the
building permit application is for property within, and for development in
accordance with and as authorized by, an approved Development of Regional
Impact (DRI) or a Florida Quality Development (FQD) development order which
development order was either issued prior to the adoption of the 1989 Broward
County Comprehensive Plan or was issued after being reviewed for, and
satisfying, Broward County's transportation concurrency requirements.



                           (d)   If the
applicant has paid to Broward County a Transit Concurrency Assessment for the
development proposed in the building permit application.



                           (e)   If the
application is for an addition to, replacement of, or renovation to a
residential building, and does not increase the number of dwelling units
within that building nor change the type of units.



                           (f)   If the
application is for an addition to, replacement of, or renovation to a
non-residential building, and does not increase the number of peak-hour trips
generated by the building.



                           (g)   If the
building permit application is for development that promotes public
transportation, which means development that directly affects the provision
of public transit, including transit terminals, transit lines and routes,
separate lanes for the exclusive use of public transit services, transit
stops (shelters and stations), and office buildings or projects that include
fixed-rail or transit terminals as part of the building.



                        2.   The Transit
Concurrency Assessment shall be calculated as the total peak-hour trip
generation of the proposed development, multiplied by a constant (for each
year) dollar figure for each District, that represents the cost per trip of
all the enhancements in that District listed in the County Transit Program,
as described in paragraph 5) below. The schedules of trip generation rates
and costs per trip for the calculation of this assessment shall be
incorporated in the Broward County Administrative Code.



                        3.   Based on building
permit applications and/or site plans which have been approved by the City,
which contain features intended to significantly encourage transit usage,
building permit applications shall receive credits towards the Transit
Concurrency Assessment. The schedule and procedures for calculating credits
is incorporated in the Broward County Administrative Code.



                        4.   The Broward County
Development Management Director may grant a request for a waiver of the
Transit Concurrency Assessment under the following circumstances, or may
refer such request to the County Commission. All waivers granted by the
Development Management Director shall be reported to the County Commission on
a quarterly basis:



                           Applications for
building permits for "very low income" and "low income" affordable housing
projects, which is defined as "housing for which monthly rents or monthly
mortgage payments (including taxes and insurance) do not exceed 30% of an
amount representing the percentage (very low = 50%; low = 80%; moderate =
120%) of the median income limits, as published by the US Department of
Housing and Urban Development, adjusted for family size for the households.",
shall be eligible for a waiver of one hundred percent (100%) of the Transit
Concurrency Assessment, provided that such application qualifies for some
level of credit under paragraph 3) above.



                           Applications for
building permits by a governmental agency for the construction of public
buildings which will directly serve the health and/or safety needs of the
public, and for public libraries and public parks (except for commercial
recreation uses) shall be eligible for a waiver of one hundred percent (100%)
of the Transit Concurrency Assessment.



                           For all waivers, the
Broward County Development Management Director or the Board of County
Commissioners shall designate an alternative funding source which shall be
utilized to pay for each Transit Concurrency Assessment waiver.



                        5.   The City of Cooper
City shall defer to the Broward County Commission to adopt a five-year County
Transit Program (CTP) that is projected to achieve the level of service
standards, for the Transit Oriented Concurrency District, as listed in the
Transportation Element of the Broward County Comprehensive Plan. The County
Commission shall ensure that the CTP is a financially feasible plan. The CTP
shall be updated annually.



                        6.   The revenues from the
Transit Concurrency Assessments shall be used solely to fund the enhancements
within the CTP which are in the District, except for the following:



                           (a)   Up to three
percent (3%) of such revenues shall be set aside to serve as the designated
funding source for waivers granted under paragraph 4) above.



                           (b)   Two percent
(2%) of such revenues shall be set aside to fund the costs of administering
the concurrency management system and developing the CTP.



                        7.   Proposed development
that is subject to a Transit Concurrency Assessment by Broward County shall
not be subject to impact fees for regional transportation facilities by
Broward County.



                        8.   In lieu of payment of
some or all of the Transit Concurrency Assessment as specified in this
subsection, an applicant may implement, or participate in implementing, an
alternative transit improvement, provided the following criteria are met:



                           (a)   The County
finds that the primary purpose of the alternative improvement is to enhance
transit ridership; and that said enhancement is not focused predominantly on
the occupants and/or users of the applicant's property.



                           (b)   The
alternative improvement is determined by the County to benefit the regional
transportation system within the District in which the proposed development
is located, and is found to be consistent with the Long Range Transportation
Plan adopted by the Metropolitan Planning Organization; except that an
alternative improvement that crosses the boundary between a Transit Oriented
District and a Standard Concurrency District may involve roadway and/or
transit improvements.



                           (c)   An agreement
among the applicant, the City and the County is executed, describing the
alternative improvements, the applicant's obligations in relation to said
improvements, and including security for said obligation in a form acceptable
to the County. The timing of the applicant's obligation under such an
agreement shall be such that the improvement, or the applicant's
responsibilities towards the improvement, is completed prior to issuance of
any certificate of occupancy within the proposed development, or the
improvement has been included in the first two (2) years of the adopted
municipal, state or county schedule of transportation improvements and the
applicable government entity makes a determination that a binding contract
for the implementation of said improvement will be executed no later than the
final day of the second fiscal year of the original schedule.



                        9.   Prior to the Broward
County approval of any application for a plat, an amendment to the
restrictive note on the plat, or the placement of a restrictive note on the
plat, for property within a Transit Oriented Concurrency District, the County
Commission shall make a finding that the District satisfies at least one of
the following standards:



                           (a)   The District
does not contain two parallel and adjacent arterial roadways, both of which
have a volume/capacity ratio in excess of1.30, which ratio is derived by
comparing existing p.m. peak hour traffic volumes to LOS D peak hour
capacities.



                           (b)   The ridership
within the District on fixed route transit services has increased at least 2
1/2 percent over the previous year.



                     b.   Regional Transportation
Concurrency within the Standard Concurrency District.



                     Before a development permit is
approved for an application for property within the Standard Concurrency
District, which application is subject to an adequacy determination according
to Section 5-182, Broward County Land Development Code, one of the following
findings shall be made:



                        1.   The proposed
development does not place any trips on, or create any, overcapacity links
within the impact area. The impact area consists of all property within the
impact distance of the boundary of the proposed development site, where the
impact distance is defined below:



 

Proposed Use
 
Impact Distance (miles)




Church
 
1


Commercial, less than 200,000 square feet GFA
 
1


Commercial, between 200,000 & 1 million square feet GFA
 
2


Commercial, greater than 1 million square feet GFA
 
3


Commercial recreation

Regional Cultural/Tourism Facility
 
3


Residential
 
1.5


School
 
1




 



   Proposed developments with mixed use will be assigned the impact
distance from the above table that is closest to the weighted average of
impact distances of the individual uses in the proposed development, with the
weights based on trips generated. Traffic studies submitted by an applicant
shall be considered in reaching this determination.



                        2.   The proposed
development places trips on, or creates, overcapacity links within the impact
area, but one of the following conditions applies:



                           (a)   There is an
approved action plan to accommodate the traffic impact of the development; or



                           (b)   The necessary
improvements to provide the applicable level of service are either under
construction or are the subject of a executed contract for the immediate
implementation of the improvements at the time the permit is issued; or



                           (c)   The necessary
improvements to provide the applicable level of service have been included in
the first two (2) years of the adopted municipal, state or county schedule of
transportation improvements and the applicable government entity makes a
determination that a binding contract for the implementation of said
improvements will be executed no later than the final day of the second
fiscal year of the original schedule; or



                           (d)   The necessary
improvements for the applicable LOS are provided for in an enforceable
development agreement and will be available prior to certificates of
occupancy that require those facilities. An enforceable development agreement
may include, but is not limited to, development agreements pursuant to
section 163.3220, Florida Statutes; or



                           (e)   The
development permit will be issued in accordance with, and as authorized by,
an approved Florida Quality Development (FQD) or Development of Regional
Impact (DRI) development order which development order was either issued
prior to the adoption of the 1989 Broward County Comprehensive Plan or was
issued after being reviewed for concurrency; or



                           (f)   The proposed
development is found to have vested rights with regard to any affected road
segment in accordance with the provisions of Chapter 163, Part II, Florida
Statutes, or a common law vested rights determination made as to that road
segment in accordance with Section 5-181 of the Broward County Land
Development Code. The proposed development must meet concurrency for any road
segment for which a vested rights determination has not been made; or



                           (g)   De Minimis
Exception: The proposed development meets all of the following criteria:



                              (1)   The
proposed development is one single family dwelling or duplex.



                              (2)   No
impact will be de minimis if it would exceed the adopted LOS standard of any
affected designated evacuation routes.



                              (3)   The
proposed development has not utilized any of the following provisions of the
Broward County Land Use Plan:



                                 •   Use 
of "reserve units" consistent with Policies 01.01.03 and 01.02.01;



                                 •   Use 
of "flexibility units" consistent with Policy 01.02.01;



                                 •   Use 
of Commercial to Residential flexibility consistent with Policy 02.04.05.



                              This prohibition
shall not apply to the use of provisions of the Broward County Land Use Plan
regarding affordable housing or special residential facilities.



                              (4)   A de
minimis exception shall not be applied more than once to the same plat or
parcel of land, within a period of five (5) years. If a finding of adequacy
has expired, an application for a de minimis exception for the same plat or
parcel of land shall not be considered by the Commission for a period of
three (3) years after the date the finding of adequacy expired.



                           (h)   The proposed
development would promote public transportation. Specifically, the proposed
development is either:



                              (1)   a public
transit capital facility, including transit terminals, lines, shelters and
stations; or



                              (2)   an
office building or office project that includes fixed-rail or transit
terminals as part of the building(s).



                        3.   The payment of road
impact fees for a building permit application in a Standard Concurrency
District does not, in itself, satisfy the regional transportation concurrency
requirements for the proposed development associated with that application.



                        4.   An applicant for a
proposed development in a standard concurrency district may choose to satisfy
the transportation concurrency requirement by making a proportionate
fair-share contribution to an eligible project, pursuant to the following
requirements:



                           (a)   Eligible
projects



                              Regional
Transportation Concurrency within Standard Concurrency Districts.



                              (1)   The
five-year schedule of capital improvements in the County Capital Improvements
Element (CIE) includes a transportation improvement(s) that, upon completion,
will mitigate the additional traffic generated by the proposed development; or



                              (2)   The
County adopts by Resolution a commitment to add a transportation improvement
to the five-year schedule of capital improvements in the CIE no later than
the next regularly scheduled update, and said improvement will mitigate the
additional traffic generated by the proposed development; and the County
Commission makes a finding in said Resolution that the proposed improvement
will be financially feasible.



                           (b)   Determining
the proportionate fair-share obligation



                              (1)   Proportion
ate fair-share mitigation includes, without limitation, separately or
collectively, private funds, contributions of land, and construction and
contribution of facilities.



                              (2)   The fair
market value of the proportionate fair-share mitigation shall not differ
based on the form of mitigation. The County may not require a development to
pay more than its proportionate fair-share contribution regardless of the
method of mitigation.



                              (3)   The
methodology used to calculate an applicant's proportionate fair-share
obligation shall be as provided for in Section 163.3180, Florida Statutes, as
follows:



                           "The cumulative number
of trips from the proposed development expected to reach roadways during peak
hours from the complete buildout of a stage or phase being approved, divided
by the change in the peak hour maximum service volume (MSV) of roadways
resulting from construction of an improvement necessary to maintain the
adopted level of service, multiplied by the construction cost, at the time of
developer payment, of the improvement necessary to maintain the adopted level
of service."



                              (4)   For
purposes of this calculation, the cost shall include all improvements and
associated costs, such as design, right-of-way acquisition, planning,
engineering, inspection, and physical development costs directly associated
with construction at the anticipated cost in the year it will be incurred.
The cost shall be based upon the cost estimate contained in the CIE, the MPO
Transportation Improvement Program, or the FDOT Work Program. Where such
information is not available, the cost estimates shall conform to the
standards and procedures set forth in Subsection 5-184(d) of the Broward
County Land Development Code.



                           (c)   Impact Fee
Credit for Proportionate Fair-Share Mitigation



                              Proportionate
fair-share mitigation shall be applied as a credit against impact fees to the
extent that all or a portion of the proportionate fair-share mitigation is
used to address the same capital infrastructure improvements contemplated by
the local government's impact fee ordinance.



                           (d)   Proportionate
Fair-Share Agreements



                              Approval of
proportionate fair-share mitigation shall be by an agreement with the Broward
County Commission which shall, at minimum, provide adequate assurances for
payment and/or timely completion of: the proportionate fair-share
contribution, in accordance with Subsection 5-184(c) of the Broward County
Land Development Code. The agreement shall require that the payment and/ or
completion of the mitigation occurs prior to the issuance of the
Transportation Concurrency Satisfaction Certificate by the County, as
required under Subsection 5-182(a)(4) of the Broward County Land Development
Code. The agreement shall be executed and approved by the City prior to being
scheduled for Board action.



                              If the mitigation
addressed in the agreement is for impacts to facilities on the Strategic
Intermodal System, then the Florida Department of Transportation shall be
provided an opportunity to review and comment on the agreement, prior to it
being scheduled for Board action.



                     c.   Adequacy of the Entire
Regional Road Network within Standard Concurrency Districts:



                        1.   In addition to
satisfying the concurrency determinations (of Subsections 5-182(a)(5)(b)) of
the Broward County Land Development Code), the proposed development within a
Standard Concurrency District shall be required to address the adequacy of
the remainder of the regional road network. If any road segment of the
regional transportation network impacted by the proposed development lacks
capacity to accommodate the additional traffic generated by the proposed
development at level of service "D," it shall be determined whether such
capacity will be available if all of the transportation improvements
contained in the Long Range Transportation Plan adopted by the Broward County
Metropolitan Planning Organization are completed. If it is determined that
such capacity will be available, then the specific improvements necessary to
enable the network to reach such capacity shall be identified (hereinafter
referred to as "necessary improvements"), and the application shall be
granted with an express condition regarding the adequacy of the regional
transportation network. At the sole discretion of the County Commission, such
condition shall require one of the following:



                           (a)   That the
applicant shall construct the necessary improvements proportional to the
share of the additional capacity that is needed to accommodate traffic
generated by the applicant's development.



                           (b)   That the
applicant deposit in a separately maintained account established and
maintained by the county an amount of money equal to the share of the cost of
the improvements that would otherwise be required in subsection 1 above.



                           The amount of the fee
required under this subsection shall be calculated as indicated in the
Broward County Administrative Code, and shall be adjusted at least annually.



                           Funds deposited
pursuant to this subsection shall be segregated according to the Concurrency
District.



                           A separate account will
be maintained by Broward County for each Concurrency District pursuant to the
Broward County Land Development Code and the fees will be spent within a
reasonable period of time from collection within the Concurrency District.
Each account shall be subject to the regulations of Section 5-184(b)(2) of
the Broward County Land Development Code. Any money paid to the County under
this section shall be reimbursed to the developer if the County is presented
with credible evidence from the City that one of the following has occurred:
no building permit application was filed within thirty (30) days of the
approval authorized under Section 27-66 of the Broward County Code; the
building permit was issued and has expired. Revenues in each account will be
expended prior to or contemporaneously with the expenditure of any other
public funds necessary for the construction of the necessary improvements for
which the account was created.



                     d.   Transportation Concurrency
Satisfaction for Building Permit Applications within the Standard Concurrency
District.



                        1.   Pursuant to the
Broward County Land Development Code, Broward County shall issue a
Transportation Concurrency Satisfaction Certificate, relative to a building
permit application for properly within the Standard Concurrency District,
under any of the following circumstances:



                           (a)   If the
building permit application is on property within a recorded plat that was
approved by the County Commission on or after March 20, 1979, and before the
effective date of this ordinance; and the building permit application is
consistent with the level of development under which the plat is currently
approved by the County Commission; and the County Commission's finding of
satisfaction of transportation concurrency for the plat has not expired; and
the plat is not in violation of an agreement with Broward County with respect
to transportation concurrency.



                           (b)   If the
building permit application is on property for which Broward County has made
a finding of vested rights with respect to transportation concurrency; and
the building permit application is consistent with the level of development
under which the plat was approved by the County Commission; and the plat is
not in violation of an agreement with Broward County with respect to
transportation concurrency.



                           (c)   If the
application is for property within a recorded plat that was approved by the
County Commission after the effective date of this Ordinance; and a finding
of satisfaction of transportation concurrency was made for that plat by the
County Commission; and the building permit application is consistent with the
level of development under which the plat is currently approved by the County
Commission; and the County Commission's finding of satisfaction of
transportation concurrency for the plat has not expired; and the plat is not
in violation of an agreement with Broward County with respect to
transportation concurrency.



                           (d)   If the
building permit application is for property within a standard concurrency
district, and the property is not within a recorded plat that was approved by
the County Commission on or after March 20, 1979, and the appropriate
municipality is not requiring platting or replatting with regard to this
building permit application. The Development Management Division may require
written evidence from the municipality that platting or replatting is not
required.



                  4.   Action Plans



                     a.   An Action Plan is a program
of transportation improvements designed at a minimum to accommodate the net
traffic impact of development to the extent that the regional transportation
network lacks the available capacity to provide for the net traffic impact.
The Action Plan shall provide substantiation in the form of engineering
studies or other data acceptable to the County to demonstrate to the
satisfaction of the County the anticipated effect of the proposed program of
improvements and/or innovations; shall provide for a source of funding for
the improvements and/or innovations; and shall provide for monitoring of the
program to ensure implementation.



                     b.   Review of Action Plans



                        1.   Action Plan Review
Committee: The County Administrator shall establish and maintain an
Interdepartmental Action Plan Review Committee (APRC) consisting of
representatives of following agencies:



                           •   Transportation
Planning Division



                           •   Development
Management Division



                           •   Traffic
Engineering Division



                           •   Highway
Construction and Engineering Division



                           •   Municipality
with jurisdiction over the plat



                           •   and other
agencies that the County Administrator deems appropriate.



                        2.   The APRC shall
prepare and maintain standard guidelines for the content of Action Plans,
which shall be approved by the County Commission.



                        3.   The APRC shall make a
recommendation to the Board of County Commissioners regarding approval of the
Action Plan. The recommendation shall give the reasons for the recommendation
which may include but are not limited to determinations regarding the trips
created by the proposed development, the feasibility and safety of the
proposed facility or program; the adequacy of the data to demonstrate the
ability of the Action Plan to accommodate the net impact of development; the
county's ability to ensure that the program or facility is maintained; the
date by which the facility or program will be implemented and the plan for
funding the improvement or facility.



                        4.   Approval of an Action
Plan shall be by an agreement with the Board which shall at a minimum provide
adequate assurances for funding and timely completion or implementation of
the action plan. The agreement shall be executed and approved by the City
prior to being scheduled for Board action.



                        5.   Local Roads



                           a.   Prior to the
application for a building permit, the City will conduct an adequacy review
of adopted levels of service as it relates to impacts on local roads. If it
is determined that an independent traffic impact study is required, the City
will request that report from the applicant.



                           b.   In the event a
traffic impact study is requested, the study will be conducted in accordance
with the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE) standards of review and
in accordance with Section 24-64(J).



                           c.   The City will
review and assess the traffic impact study as submitted by the applicant to
determine its adequacy to address any issues related to impacted roadways
within the city's local roadway system. This may include hiring a
professional traffic engineer or transportation planner to review the study
to ensure it was conducted in accordance with ITE standards and its findings
and conclusions are valid and supportive. The study shall propose mitigation
requirements in order to provide an acceptable level of service for the local
roadway system.



   (g)   All plats, replats, plat note amendments, findings of adequacy
or site plans with a residential component shall be subject to the public
school concurrency requirements as set forth in Section 5-182(m) of the
Broward County Land Development Code, as amended from time to time. The
burden shall be on the applicant to ensure compliance with this Section, and
the applicant shall provide the necessary documentation from Broward County
demonstrating satisfaction of these requirements. (Ord. No. 08-3-1, §2,
03-11-08)

ARTICLE III. PARKLAND DEDICATION REQUIREMENTS



Sec. 22-40. Applicability.



   A plat submitted to the city commission suitable for residential
development pursuant to the applicable land development regulations shall be
designed to provide for the park, open space and municipal recreational needs
of the future residents of the platted area, and the developer shall be
required to comply with the provisions of sec. 22-42, dedication of land
and/or deposit of money, sec. 22-43, maximum land area required for
dedication and sec. 22-44, exclusion of school sites, prior to or in
conjunction with the city's approval of the proposed plat.



Sec. 22-41. Definition of usable land.



   For the purposes of this chapter, usable land shall be defined as land
which has adequate public access and which has been cleared, demucked and is
free from deleterious materials, filled with good granular material
(soil/sand) free from deleterious material and graded to a level six (6)
inches above the highest existing or proposed adjacent finished crown of road
elevation which elevation must be in accordance with sec. 6-71, floodplain
management requirements for subdivisions.



Sec. 22-42. Dedication of usable land and/or deposit of money.



   In order to provide usable lands or funds or a combination thereof to
be used by the city to provide parks, open spaces, or recreational land
within residential developments, a developer must, at the discretion of the
city commission, satisfy one of the following.



   (a)   Dedicate usable land of suitable size, topography, and general
character to serve as park, open space or recreational areas which will meet
the needs created by the development. Said dedication of recreational land
shall be by warranty deed and accompanied by an opinion of title signed by
the attorney for the development or by a recognized title insurance company,
and approved by the city attorney, indicating that either the city is
receiving marketable title to the parcel dedicated by a survey of the parcel
sealed by a professional land surveyor registered in the State of Florida,
and by an affidavit of value from the attorney of record or the title
insurance company, or by a tax notice or tax bill for the most recent tax
year stating the value of the property. The total amount of usable land to be
dedicated either on or off the development site must equal a ratio of at
least six (6) acres of land for every one thousand (1,000) residents of the
development.



      (1)   Sod the dedicated parcel with Floratam or such other
material as approved by the public works director, and install an irrigation
system pursuant to code, the approved site plan and the standards utilized by
the city.



         a.   The developer shall post a bond or other surety, as
approved by the city attorney, at the time of site plan approval to ensure
completion of the improvements.



         b.   Improvements to lands dedicated pursuant to this
section shall be completed no later than six (6) months from the date of
completion of roadways abutting the dedicated land.



   (b)   Deposit in the "Cooper City Special Land Acquisition and
Recreational Facilities Fund" established and maintained by the city, or
deposit in another recreational land acquisition and development fund as
deemed proper by the city, an amount of money equal to the fair market value
of the land otherwise to be dedicated. In order to determine the appropriate
fair market value, the city shall select a real estate appraiser, the
developer shall select a real estate appraiser and the average of the values
determined by the two said appraisers shall be the fair market value of the
property. The fee for both appraisals shall be paid by the developer. Such
amounts of money shall be deposited in said special fund prior to or in
conjunction with the approval of the proposed plat by the city. All monies
deposited to the city special land acquisition and recreational facilities
fund shall be used only and solely for the purpose of acquiring land or water
for park, open space, or recreational purposes; for the development of or for
nonrecurring capital improvements to these areas; or for the development of
or for nonrecurring capital improvements to park, open space, or recreational
facilities on the lands or on land heretofore acquired or designated for such
use by the city.



   (c)   Provide a combination of land and money under subsection (b)
above, which combination shall meet or exceed the total dedication
requirements.



   (d)   Construct recreational improvements on the lands or on land
heretofore acquired or designated for such use by the city, the value of
which shall meet or exceed the total dedication requirements. Such value
shall be determined at the sole discretion of the city commission. The type
of improvements, site plan, design and specifications for such recreational
facilities shall be subject to the approval of the city.



Sec. 22-43. Maximum land area required for dedication.



   The following schedule establishes the maximum percentage of gross
residential site area that shall be required to be dedicated pursuant to sec.
22-42, dedication of land and/or deposit of money:



 

Density in dwelling units per gross acre of residential land use
 
Estimated number of persons per dwelling unit
 
Maximum % of gross residential land area required to be dedicated




From 0 up to 1

Sec. 22-44. Exclusion of school sites.



   When the subdivision covers an area within which the county school
board requires a school site, it is recommended that provision be made in the
subdivision plat for such proposed school site, properly integrated into the
plans of the subdivision. Such areas shall not be construed as meeting the
requirements of sec. 22-42, dedication of land and/or deposit of money and
sec. 22-43, maximum land area required for dedication, but shall be excluded
for the purposes of calculating the required land dedication.



Sec. 22-45. Discretion of city commission to accept dedication.



   It shall be at the discretion of the city commission whether or not to
accept any proposed dedication pursuant to sec. 22-42, dedication of land
and/or deposit of money and sec. 22-43, maximum land area required for
dedication. However, no part of the area required to be deeded or dedicated
shall be part of or in any way encumbered by or located in any easement or
right-of-way.



Sec. 22-46. Credit for private park land.



   The city may grant a credit against the amount of land otherwise
required to be dedicated pursuant to sec. 22-42, dedication of land and/or
deposit of money and sec. 22-43, maximum land area required for dedication,
under the following circumstances.



   (a)   When the dedication requirements set forth in sec. 22-42,
dedication of land and/or deposit of money and sec. 22-43, maximum land area
required for dedication, would require the dedication of more than six (6)
percent of the gross residential area of any plat, then the city may grant a
credit against such additional requirements over and above said six (6)
percent for land either on or off the development site which is to be
non-publicly owned and maintained for the benefit of the future residents of
the platted area and which will serve their park, open space, or recreational
needs. Such areas may include golf courses, lakes, waterways, private parks
and recreational facilities and private open space areas other than the areas
necessary to meet setback requirements, front and rear and side yard
requirements, parking and landscaping requirements, or other similar areas
specifically required by the applicable land development regulations. The
city shall require that the developer provide deed restrictions to ensure
perpetual public use as park, open space or recreational purposes and
maintenance of same, and



   (b)   For lakes or other waterbodies to qualify as permanent,
nonpublic recreation areas pursuant to (a) above, public recreation lands
must abut at least one-third of the shore line of the water body and not be
part of the drainage requirements. Lakes or water bodies meeting this
requirement shall be credited at fifty (50) percent.



Sec. 22-47. Credit for fee or construction of new facilities.



   In lieu of dedicating the total area of public parks required by this
article, at the discretion of the city commission, the developer shall
receive a partial credit by either paying a fee or constructing new
recreation facilities on a park site which shall serve the future residents.
The standards for reviewing the credit and fees required for public
improvements are as follows:



   (a)   It shall be the city commission's decision to permit the
developer to dedicate less park area than shown on the following schedule:



 

Total proposed amount of residential units
 
Maximum park area


From 0 to 25 units
 
15,000 square feet


From 25 to 75 units
 
22,000 square feet


From 75 to 200 units
 
44,000 square feet


200 units and over
 
44,000 square feet, plus additional half acre each group of 50 units greater
than 200



 



   (b)   If it is decided that a public improvement shall be provided
by the developer as part of the overall credit, the developer shall submit an
estimated cost to construct the facility prepared by a qualified architect to
demonstrate that the construction costs equal or exceed the value of the fee
required in this section.



   (c)   The method to determine the value of the credit for the
recreation land which will be substituted by a fee or construction of new
recreation facilities to be provided by the developer shall be in accordance
with sec. 22-43(b), dedication of land and/or deposit of money.



   (d)   The city commission shall direct the fees or new recreation
facilities to be utilized to provide necessary public facilities to serve the
future residents as required by the city's comprehensive land use plan, and
other applicable recreation or public facilities standards.

ARTICLE IV. IMPACT FEES



Sec. 22-60. Short title and authority.



   (a)   Short title. This article shall be known and may be cited as
the "Cooper City Public Facilities Impact Fee Ordinance."



   (b)   Authority. The City of Cooper City (city) is authorized to
adopt this article under the authority granted by the provisions of Chapter
166, Florida Statutes, as amended, and other applicable provisions of law.



Sec. 22-61. Findings.



   It is hereby found and determined that:



   (a)   The city is committed to the goal of providing public services
and facilities in a timely and economically efficient manner at levels
necessary to support development within the city. In order to accomplish this
goal, the city has, among other matters projected its annual growth through
build-out in 2010 to derive an estimate of the total anticipated increase in
residential and nonresidential development within the city. Based on such
projections the city has determined that residential and nonresidential
development within the city will place excessive demands on the city's
existing public facilities and services and contribute to the need for new
and/or expanded public facilities and services that would not otherwise be
necessary. The city has identified the capital improvements necessary to
service anticipated new development through 2010 and has addressed these
needs in the areas of funding, scheduling and priority of projects, in part,
through the adoption on October 11, 1988 of a comprehensive plan
("comprehensive plan") pursuant to Chapter 163, Florida Statutes. The
comprehensive plan provides that new development may not be permitted to
proceed unless certain adequate public facilities and services are available
when needed to service such new development.



   (b)   The city has determined that new development within the city
should pay its fair share of the cost of providing the new and/or expanded
public facilities and services required to service such development. In order
to arrive at a formula for determining the amount new development should be
required to pay, the city commissioned Burton & Associates, a professional
consulting firm, to prepare the impact fee study report dated January 17,
1990 ("study"). For the purposes of the Study, the city manager, city planner
and other members of the city's staff with responsibility for parks and
recreation, general government and public safety analyzed the city's
projections as to growth through build-out of the city and developed a
capital improvements program identifying certain specific capital
improvements which were determined to be necessary to service new development
in the city at required or desired levels of service in the general
categories of park improvements (exclusive of land acquisition), general
government services and public safety services (including police and fire
services) (hereinafter sometimes referred to collectively as the
"improvements"). The city provided information regarding the Improvements,
including a schedule of the time when the Improvements would be needed and
estimated capital expenditures to be incurred over the next six years in
connection therewith, to Burton & Associates and requested that the study:
(i) consider the estimated cost of providing the Improvements; and (ii)
develop, in accordance with applicable law, a fair and equitable formula for
computing a proportionate share of the cost of such Improvements attributable
to new development and allocating such cost between residential and
nonresidential development in the form of impact fees (as herein defined).



   (c)   The study did not address capital improvements, other than the
improvements, which may be undertaken by the city as a result of new
development, such as in connection with its water and sewer system and
roadways, or the acquisition of park land, as the costs thereof are the
subject of other impact fees or regulatory impositions not intended to be
replaced or modified by the study or hereby.



   (d)   The city now desires to accept the study and the
recommendations therein as same relate to the method of computing new
development's proportionate share of the cost of the Improvements and
allocating the same between residential and nonresidential development and to
impose the impact fees suggested therein in the amount and manner more fully
set forth herein.



   (e)   The city hereby determines that the need for the improvements
is generated by and reasonably attributable to, future development within the
city and benefits such development, and that the impact fees to be imposed
hereby:



      (1)   Are not in excess of new developments proportionate
share of the cost of the Improvements;



      (2)   Are consistent with the concept of providing adequate
public facilities consistent with new development as set forth in the
comprehensive plan;



      (3)   Do not impose an unfair burden on new development within
the city;



      (4)   Will be earmarked, restricted and expended in such
manner as to ensure that new development receives the benefit of the
Improvements for which it has paid impact fees; and



      (5)   Are in the best interests of the city and its residents.



   (f)   Impact fees will result in only partial recoupment of the
capital expenditures required to finance the cost of the Improvements. The
city anticipates that the balance of the cost of the improvements not
financed by the impact fees imposed hereby shall be funded by the city from
available ad valorem tax revenues and other legally available funds of the
city. In determining the amount of the impact fees to be imposed hereby, a
credit has been given for payments anticipated to be made by new development
toward the cost of the improvements through ad valorem taxes. The impact fees
imposed hereby will not be used to fund the portion of the cost of the
improvements or other public facilities and services necessitated by, or
attributable to, existing development within the city or to correct any
existing deficiencies in public facilities and services within the city in
any fashion whatsoever.



Sec. 22-62. Adoption of study.



   The city hereby approves and adopts the impact fee study report and the
recommendations therein as same relates to the computation of the impact fee
and the allocation of the impact fees between new residential and
nonresidential development within the city. Copies of the study are available
for inspection at the office of the city clerk.



Sec. 22-63. Applicability and exemptions.



   (a)   Except as hereinafter provided in this section, this article,
as same may be amended from time to time, shall apply to all development
activity for which an application for building permit is made on or after
January 23, 1990. Nothing in this section shall limit or modify the rights of
any person to complete any development activity for which a building permit
was validly issued prior to January 23, 1990.



   (b)   Any development activity, including the construction of a new
structure or the addition to an existing structure for which a valid building
permit has been issued by the city prior to January 23, 1990, shall be exempt
from the provisions of this article.



   (c)   Any development activity consisting of the remodeling,
rehabilitation, alteration, expansion of or other improvement of an existing
structure, the rebuilding of a damaged or destroyed structure or the
construction of accessory structures, provided that as a result of the
development activity there is no increase in gross developable square footage
or the number of dwelling units in such structure, shall be exempt from the
provisions of this article.



   (d)   Development activity undertaken by governmental or public
entities shall be exempt from the provisions of this article. Such
development activity includes that which relates to those parcels, grounds,
buildings or structures owned by municipal, county, state and federal
governments, the Broward County school board and the South Florida water
management district and any other political subdivision of the State of
Florida and the operation of those entities and which will accomplish
non-proprietary purposes including, but not limited to, governmental offices,
police and fire stations, airports, parking facilities leased for general
government operations and activities. Private residential, commercial or
industrial activities constructed or operated through lease agreements on
public lands or in public facilities shall not be considered governmental or
public facilities for the purposes hereof and shall be subject to the
provisions of this article and the impact fees imposed hereby.



   (e)   Unless provided for to the contrary in the current effective
development order (hereinafter defined) applicable thereto, all development
activity which is subject to a development of regional Impact development
order adopted pursuant to chapter 380, Florida Statutes, prior to January 23,
1990 ("development order"), shall be exempt from this article with regard to
the development activity approved by such development order. This exemption
is conditioned upon full compliance by property owners with the conditions of
the applicable development order and shall not apply to those development
orders which may have been revoked or determined to be null and void or to
any development activity not authorized in such development order by the
city. This exemption shall not apply to any additional development activity
relating to the property which is the subject of a development order,
regardless of whether such additional development activity constitutes
"substantial deviation" pursuant to chapter 380, Florida Statutes.



   (f)   Development activity subject to either: (i) a valid, unexpired
site plan approved by the city before January 23, 1990, or (ii) an annexation
agreement or development agreement with the city entered into before January
23, 1990, may be all or partially exempted from the provisions hereof, as
hereinafter provided.



      (1)   The then current owner of property on which the proposed
development activity will occur may petition the City, in writing, seeking to
exempt such development activity, in whole or in part, from the provisions
hereof, setting forth, in detail, the reasons therefore, with specific
reference to the criteria hereinafter specified.



      (2)   In determining whether the proposed development activity
should be exempted from the provisions hereof, in whole or in part, the city
commission shall evaluate:



         a.   Whether there exists a valid, unexpired site plan
or a legal and binding annexation or development agreement with respect to
such development activity;



         b.   Whether the provisions of the annexation or
development agreement expressly prohibit the application of all or any
portion of the impact fees to the development activity;



         c.   Whether the fees and contributions imposed in
connection with the site plan process or the fees and contributions imposed
pursuant to the annexations or development agreement were intended to pay for
the impact of all or any portion of the development activity on public
facilities of the general categories of the improvements and not for other
impositions of the city, Broward County or other governmental entity;



         d.   Whether the proposed development activity has been
altered so that the impact thereof is materially different than at the time
the site plan was approved or the annexation or development agreement was
entered into;



         e.   Whether the fees and contributions imposed in
connection with the site plan process or the fees and contributions imposed
pursuant to the annexation or development agreement are reasonably equivalent
to the Impact fees that would be applicable to the development activity
hereunder;



         f.   Whether the city should waive all or any portion of
the unpaid fees and contributions imposed in connection with the site plan
process or the unpaid fees and contributions imposed by the annexation or
development agreement; or



         g.   Whether, upon analysis of all of the applicable
facts and circumstances presented, the owner of the subject property has
expended substantial money, incurred substantial obligations or otherwise
changed his position in reliance upon official actions of the city upon which
such owner was entitled to rely, such that imposition of the impact fees, all
or in part, to the development activity would be inequitable and that the
City should be estopped therefrom.



      (3)   Any property owner petitioning the city pursuant to this
sec. 22-63(f), applicability and exemptions shall have the burden of
demonstrating to the city the fees and contributions paid in satisfaction of
all other city, Broward County or other governmental impositions applicable
to the development activity so as to distinguish same from any credits being
sought and, if there is land embraced within the site plan, development
agreement or annexation agreement, as applicable, not included within the
development activity for which the exemption is being sought, the basis upon
which any credit or exemption granted by the city should be allocated among
such development activity and other land.



      (4)   To the extent the city determines that the fees and
contributions imposed in connection with the site plan process or the terms
of the annexation or development agreement should apply to all or any portion
of the development activity in lieu of all or any portion of the impact fees,
the property owner shall be relieved of obligations hereunder to the extent
so determined by the city, conditioned upon such property owner's compliance
with all such fees and contributions imposed in connection with the site plan
process or the terms of the annexation or development agreement to the extent
determined applicable by the city.



      (5)   Any property owner who is eligible to petition the city
pursuant to this section and desires to do so, shall be required to deliver
the petition, prepared in accordance with the standards of this section, to
the city on or before November 12, 1990 ("petition date") in order to claim

have waived any right they may have to claim such exemption. Following the
petition date, no person or entity shall have the right to petition the city
pursuant to this section to seek an exemption from the provisions of this
ordinance for any development activity.



Sec. 22-64. Imposition of impact fees.



   (a)   Impact fees are hereby imposed on all development activity
within the city, in the amounts hereinafter set forth:



      $2,217 per dwelling unit



      $0.715 per gross developable square foot



   (b)   Impact fees will be calculated based upon the proposed
development activity described in the application for a building permit. In
order to defray the city's costs in administering the provisions of this
article, an administration fee equal to two (2) percent of the impact fee
payable in connection with the proposed development activity shall be added
to the applicable impact fee (administration fee), which administration fee
shall be included within the term impact fees for the purposes hereof. If the
development activity for which a building permit is sought contains both
residential and nonresidential uses, the City shall separately calculate the
impact fees for each type of development in accordance herewith. If the
building permit is for less than the entire contemplated development
activity, the impact fees shall be computed for the amount of development
activity covered by the building permit.



   (c)   Each applicant for a building permit shall pay, as a condition
to the issuance thereof, the applicable impact fees prior to or at the time
of issuance of the building permit. No building permit shall be issued by the
city unless the applicable impact fees have been paid. Prior to applying for
a building permit, an applicant may request a non-binding estimate from the
city of the impact fees payable in connection with the proposed development
activity.



   (d)   In the event development activity in connection with which a
building permit was previously issued is increased, the applicant shall be
required to pay impact fees in accordance herewith only for the additional
dwelling units or gross developable square footage resulting from such
increase.



   (e)   In the event a building permit expires or is revoked, impact
fees shall be payable in accordance herewith upon the issuance of a new
building permit authorizing development activity on such property, and a
credit shall be given for any Impact Fee previously paid in connection
therewith that have not been refunded in accordance with sec. 22-67, refunds.
Impact fees shall not be required to be paid in connection with development
activity if the amount due and payable under the terms of this article with
respect thereto is less than fifty dollars ($50.00).



Sec. 22-65. Accounting procedures for impact fee funds.

improvement account (hereinafter the public safety improvement account) and
the city's impact fee general government improvement account (hereinafter the
general government improvement account). Upon collection of the applicable
impact fees with respect to a particular development activity, the same shall
be earmarked to ensure that such impact fees are ultimately expended in
connection with the improvements for which such impact fees were paid, by
crediting such impact fees in the following amounts to the appropriate
restricted account:



 

Restricted Account
 
Residential Impact Fees Per Dwelling Unit

independent, self-balancing funds or accounts, as such terms are commonly
defined and used in governmental accounting, but rather is intended solely to
constitute an earmarking of impact fees for certain purposes.



   (c)   Types of accounts. The impact fees and earnings thereon may be
deposited immediately upon collection as follows, provided that, in each
case, the account is with a depository authorized to receive deposits of City
funds and that standard accounting records are maintained to reflect the
earmarking of the monies therein for the various purposes of the restricted
accounts. The restricted accounts shall be maintained on the books of the
City as separate and distinct from all other funds and accounts of the City:



      (1)   in three (3) separate interest bearing bank accounts
established in the names of each of the restricted accounts;



      (2)   in a single, interest bearing bank account;



      (3)   in an interest bearing bank account in which other funds
of the city are on deposit; or



      (4)   in any combination of the foregoing accounts.



   (d)   Security. All monies in such restricted accounts shall be
continuously secured in the same manner as deposits of city funds are
required to be secured by the laws of the State of Florida.



   (e)   Interest. Interest earned on the impact fees shall be credited
to each of the restricted accounts in the appropriate percentages.



Sec. 22-66. Expenditure of impact fee funds.



   (a)   Expenditures by improvement category. Impact fees, and
earnings thereon, shall be spent on improvements related to the general
category of improvements for which they were collected.



      (1)   Impact fees, and earnings thereon, in an amount equal to
the percentage thereof credited to the park improvement account shall be
applied to finance capital expenditures related to park improvements
(exclusive of land).



      (2)   Impact fees, and earnings thereon, in an amount equal to
the percentage thereof credited to the public safety improvement account
shall be applied to finance capital expenditures related to public safety
services.



      (3)   Impact fees, and earnings thereon, in an amount equal to
the percentage thereof credited to the general government improvement account
shall be applied to finance capital expenditures related to general
government services.



   (b)   Types of capital improvements. The city shall have the right
to expend the impact fees in any order of priority on capital improvements
determined by the city to be within the general categories of the
improvements reflected in the study, provided that the impact fees credited
to each of the restricted accounts are ultimately expended for the purposes
of such restricted accounts in accordance with the percentages set forth in
sec. 22-65, accounting procedures for impact fee funds. Further, the city
shall have the right to modify or delete any of the proposed capital
improvements within each of the general categories of Improvements reflected
in the study or to add capital improvements within such general categories,
provided that the total amount of impact fees credited to each of the
restricted accounts are ultimately expended for the purposes of such
restricted accounts in the percentages set forth in sec. 22-65, accounting
procedures for impact fee funds.



   (c)   Administrative fee. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city
shall have the right to retain and direct to City operating accounts an
amount equal to two (2) percent of all impact fees collected as its
administrative fee.



   (d)   Records. The city shall maintain adequate financial records
reflecting the impact fees collected, including the amounts credited to each
of the restricted accounts, and the purposes for which the impact fees are
disbursed. All disbursements from the restricted accounts shall require the
approval of the finance director. The finance director shall cause to be
prepared and published a financial report on the restricted accounts at least
annually.



Sec. 22-67. Refunds.



   (a)   The impact fees collected with respect to a particular
development activity pursuant to the provisions hereof shall be refunded,
without interest, in whole or in part, in the manner hereinafter provided to
the then current owner of the property to which the development activity
relates, upon petition by such owner to the city, if:



      (1)   the building permit relating to the development activity
has expired without construction being undertaken or is revoked for
non-commencement of construction; or



      (2)   the development activity in connection with which a
building permit was previously issued and has since expired was altered to
decrease the total number of dwelling units or gross developable square
footage resulting therefrom; or



      (3)   the impact fees have not been expended or encumbered by
the end of the fiscal quarter immediately following six (6) years from the
date of payment of the impact fees. For the purposes of this subsection,
impact fees shall be deemed encumbered when a contract or agreement
obligating all or a portion of said impact fees shall have been approved by
the city or when such impact fees have been pledged as security for bonds or
other evidence of indebtedness of the city.



   (b)   In connection with any refund of impact fees, the city shall
be entitled to retain an amount equal to two (2) percent thereof as its

petition for refund is filed, the city manager shall advise the petitioner in
writing of the decision on the refund request, including the reasons therefor

manager shall arrange for a refund payment be made to the petitioner. When a
refund is due pursuant to sec. 22-67(a)(1),.refunds (building permit expired
with no construction), the petitioner shall execute an acknowledgement that
the building permit applicable to the development activity has expired or has
been revoked. When a refund is due pursuant to sec. 22-67(a)(2), refunds
(building permit expired after construction), the refund shall consist only
of the excess impact fees paid in view of the decrease in the number of
dwelling units or gross developable square footage.



Sec. 22-68. Appeal of administration decision.



   (a)   Application. The determination of the impact fees applicable
to a proposed development activity ("impact determination") and any refund
decision may be appealed by the then current owner of the property to which
the impact fees relate ("appealing party") by filing a notice of
administrative appeal ("notice of appeal") with the city clerk within thirty
(30) days of the impact determination or the date on which the refund
decision is received by the petitioner, as appropriate, on a form provided by
the city for that purpose. The notice of appeal shall be accompanied by a
letter providing a full explanation of the appeal, including the specific
reasons therefor and any supporting documentation.



   (b)   Commission review. The city commission shall schedule the
appeal as soon as practically possible and shall vote to affirm, reject or
revise the impact determination or the refund decision, as appropriate.



   (c)   Effect of appeal on liability to pay impact fees. The filing
of a notice of appeal relating to an impact determination shall not stay the
collection of the applicable impact fees unless said notice is accompanied by
a bond or other surety in an amount equal to such impact fees, in form and
substance satisfactory to counsel to the city, in which case a building
permit may be issued for the proposed development activity.



   (d)   Legal action. The appealing party shall be required to exhaust
the appeal procedure provided herein prior to taking any legal action
whatsoever, including, but not limited to, filing a lawsuit or seeking an
injunction ("legal action"), in order to contest an impact determination or
refund decision. Furthermore, any legal action taken by the appealing party
or any other person in connection with an impact determination or refund
decision following exhaustion of the appeal procedure provided herein shall
be premised solely upon the matters set forth in the notice of appeal and the
accompanying documentation and the appealing party and any other party shall
be estopped from raising in such legal action any issues not specifically
addressed in the notice of appeal and the accompanying documentation.



Sec. 22-69. Bonds and other indebtedness.



   The city may issue bonds and other evidence of indebtedness, in such
manner and subject to such limitations as may be provided by law, in order to
finance the cost of providing the public facilities and services for which
the impact fees imposed hereby are collected and may pledge such impact fees
to the payment thereof. Notwithstanding the foregoing, however, the impact
fees credited to each of the restricted accounts hereby may only be pledged
as security for bonds issued to finance a capital expenditure within the
general category of capital improvement to which such restricted account
relates.



Sec. 22-70. Periodic review.



   The city manager shall periodically review this article and, if

commission. The city commission shall consider the city manager's recommended
revisions, if any, to the ordinance at least once every twelve (12) months.

ensure that the impact fees fund only the cost of new and/or expanded public
facilities and services the need for which is generated by, and reasonably
attributable to development activity that said impact fees shall not exceed
new development's proportionate share of the cost of such new and/or expanded
public facilities and services, and that the procedures for administering the
impact fees remain efficient and comply with applicable law.

Sec. 23-3. Zoning map established.



   (a)    The districts aforesaid and the boundaries of such districts
as shown on the zoning map, which is on file in the office of the city clerk
and designated as the zoning map of the city, are hereby adopted and made a
part of this chapter. The zoning map and all notations, references, and other
information shown thereon shall be as much a part of this chapter as if such
matters and information set forth on the map were all fully described and set
out thereon.



   (b)   If, because of error or omission in the zoning map, any
property in the city or that has been annexed into the city is not shown as
being in a zoning district, the classification of such property shall be A-1,
unless the A-1 district is not permitted according to the comprehensive plan,
in which case compatible zoning will be enacted by amendment to this chapter.



Sec. 23-4. Interpretation of district boundaries.



   Where uncertainty exists as to boundaries of any district shown on the
official zoning map, the following rules shall apply:



   (a)   Where such district boundaries are indicated as approximately
following street lines, alley lines, lot lines, or land use plan lines, such
lines shall be construed to be boundaries.



   (b)    In unsubdivided property, or where a district boundary
divides a lot, the location of such boundary, unless the same is indicated by
dimensions, shall be determined by the use of the scale appearing on the map.



   (c)   Where any street or alley is hereafter officially vacated or
abandoned, the regulations applicable to each parcel of abutting property
shall apply to that portion of such street or alley added thereto by virtue
of such vacation or abandonment.



   (d)   Where a district boundary line divides a lot in a single
ownership on April 2, 1962, the city commission may, in its discretion,
permit a use authorized in either portion of such lot to extend to the entire
lot.



Sec. 23-5. Supplemental nature of district regulations.



   The provisions of this chapter shall be supplemental and not in lieu of
all existing ordinances and regulations existing in the city, as
specifically, the provisions of the official charter of the city.



Sec. 23-6--23-7. Reserved.



Sec. 23-8. Applicability.



ARTICLE II. USE REGULATIONS



   No building shall be erected, reconstructed, or structurally altered,
nor shall any building or land be used for any purpose  other than as
permitted herein by the district in which such building or land use is
located.  If there is a conflict between the land uses designated by this
chapter and the city comprehensive land use plan, the regulations included in
the land use plan shall prevail.



Sec. 23-9. Use classification.



   The use regulations of the zoning districts are based on the following
use classification system.



   (a)   Purpose and intent. The purpose of these provisions is to
classify uses of land into a number of specially defined land use categories
on the basis of common functional characteristics and similar compatibility
with other uses, thereby providing a basis for regulation of uses in
accordance with criteria that are directly relevant to the public interest. 
These provisions shall apply throughout this chapter.



   (b)   Classification of principal uses.  The use categories listed
on the following use regulations schedule shall be considered to be principal
uses. A single lot may contain more than one principal use, unless otherwise
prohibited by the provisions of this chapter.  All existing and proposed
uses shall be classified into the use category that most closely portrays the
overall nature of such activity, consistent with the definitions of the use
categories in sec. 21-9, definitions. Any use that cannot be so classified
shall not be permitted in any district.



Sec. 23-10. Schedule of use regulations.



   The following use regulations schedule summarizes the use regulations
of the districts.  In the event of any conflict between the use regulations
schedule and the text of the zoning district regulations or the supplementary
regulations, the text shall control.  Uses that were established prior to
the adoption of this chapter or its predecessors, but that are now
inconsistent with the requirements of this chapter, shall be permitted if
such uses meet the requirements of sec. 23-156, Nonconforming provisions, for
a valid nonconforming use.



   (a)   Interpretation of use regulations schedule.  The use
regulations schedule shall be interpreted as follows.



      (1)   Permitted by right.  Principal uses identified in a
particular district column with a “P” are “permitted by right” and
shall be permitted in such district.



      (2)   Conditional uses.  Principal uses identified in a
particular district column with a “C” are “conditional uses” and
shall be permitted in such district only upon approval by the city commission
in accordance with the procedures and standards of sec. 23-152, conditional
use.



      (3)   Not permitted.  Principal uses not identified in a
particular district column as permitted by right or as a conditional use,
including but not limited to, the preparation, cultivation, storage,
processing, manufacturing, delivering or dispensing of marijuana in any form,
for any personal, business or occupational use whatsoever, are not allowed in
such district unless otherwise expressly permitted in this chapter. Further,
all uses, products, or acts prohibited under any state or federal law are
prohibited throughout the City. (Ord. No. 14-10-4, §3, 10-28-14)

the minimum amount of walkways and/or driveways reasonably necessary to serve
the permitted P-1 uses.



      (2)   Landscaping.  All required yards and open spaces

Sec. 23-66. Planned unit development districts generally.



   (a)   Applicability. The provisions of this section apply to all
Planned Unit Development (PUD) districts. Every PUD, as defined herein, for
which approval shall hereafter be sought, for either rezoning, site planning
or platting, shall be governed by the provisions of this section. There are
four (4) zoning categories of PUD's:



      (1)   PRD, Planned Residential Development District;



      (2)   PCD, Planned Commercial Development District;



      (3)   PMUD, Planned Mixed-use Development District;



      (4)   PID, Planned Industrial Development District.



   (b)   District purpose. The purpose of the Planned Unit Development
(PUD) districts is to provide for the development of land under unified
control, planned and developed as a whole in a single development operation
or an approved programmed series of development operations for residential
dwelling units and compatible office and commercial uses. The PUD districts
should provide a means of achieving flexibility in development of land
appropriate in size, mix of uses, and shape to facilitate utilization in a
manner not possible in conventional zoning districts; should encourage a more
imaginative and innovative design and conservation of land in developments;
and should promote a more desirable living environment. Through exercise of
sound and proper planning principles, a PUD district should complement
surrounding property or uses thereof; should promote the health, safety, and
general welfare of the public; and should not exceed achievable capacity of
community utilities, facilities and services. A PUD district should
accomplish the following objectives:



      (1)   Include principal and accessory uses and structures
substantially related to the character of the development itself and the
surrounding area of which it is a part.



      (2)   Allow diversification of uses, structures and open
spaces when not in conflict with existing and permitted land uses on abutting
properties.



      (3)   Reduce improvement costs through a more efficient use of
land and a smaller network of utilities and streets than is possible through
application of standards contained in conventional land development
regulations.



      (4)   Promote and encourage development where parcels of land
are suitable in size, location, and character for the uses and structures
proposed and to encourage development in a uniform and coordinated manner.



      (5)   Include common areas and facilities with provision for
maintenance and unified control through the recording of restrictive
covenants which shall run with the land.



      (6)    Conserve the natural amenities of the land by
encouraging the preservation and improvement of scenic and functional space.



      (7)   Provide maximum opportunity for application of
innovative site planning concepts to the creation of aesthetically pleasing
environments on properties of adequate size, shape and location.



      (8)   Insure that development will occur within the guidelines
and intent of the city’s comprehensive plan land use element. Planned
developments should be equally adaptable to new development, redevelopment
and conservation of land, water and other city resources.



   (c)   Definitions. Definitions that apply to the Planned Unit
Development districts are as follows:



      (1)   Comprehensive plan means a composite of the written and
graphic proposals recommending the physical, social and economic development
of the city, which has been adopted by the planning and zoning board and by
the city commission, as amended from time-to-time.



      (2)   Gross area means the total surface (land and water) area
contained within the proposed PUD, including on-site streets and
rights-of-way.



      (3)   Gross density means the density of a building site
calculated by dividing the total number of dwelling units by the total
acreage of the site without reduction of any nonresidential uses such as
parks, waterways, shops, churches, schools, etc.



      (4)   Open space means a generally unobstructed parcel or area
of land permanently dedicated or reserved for the use and enjoyment of owners
and occupants of the land within a PUD.  Lakes, canals, and other features
may be considered as required open spaces to the extent of the limitations
contained in this article.



      (5)   Planned unit development (PUD) means land under unified
control, planned and developed as a whole in a single development operation
or an approved programmed series of development operations for residential
dwelling units and office and commercial uses. The establishment of a
Community Development District in accordance with applicable laws is an
acceptable method of meeting this requirement.



         a.   A PUD may include principal and accessory uses and
structures substantially related to the character of the development itself
and the surrounding area of which it is a part.



         b.   A PUD shall be developed according to comprehensive
overall master plans which include proposed land uses, streets, utility
locations, parks, open space areas, and preservation areas, intended to be
located, constructed, used, and related to one another.



         c.   A PUD shall include a maintenance area and
agreement to accommodate a program for full maintenance and operation of such
areas, improvements, facilities and services for common use by the occupants
of the planned unit development.



      (6)   Pod, for purposes of this section, shall refer to a
parcel(s) of land which is(are) a sub-unit of a larger development or
subdivision, and which is distinguished either by housing type or use,
geographic features, or a separate and distinct non-profit association
established for the maintenance of interior common areas.



      (7)   Unified control means all land included for purpose of
development within a PUD district shall be under the control of the applicant
(an individual, partnership or corporation or group of individuals,
partnerships or corporations). This provision does not prevent the applicant
from transferring ownership of property within the PUD at any time, subject
to the regulations set forth herein.  The applicant shall present
satisfactory legal documents to constitute evidence of the unified control of
the entire area which shall be certified by the city attorney. Upon
application for rezoning the applicant shall agree as follows:



         a.    To proceed with the proposed development according
to the provisions of this article and the applicable planned unit development
master plan;



         b.    To provide agreements, contracts, covenants, deed
restrictions and sureties acceptable to the city for completion of the
development according to the plans approved at the time of rezoning to PUD
and for continuing operations and maintenance of such areas, functions and
facilities which are not proposed to be provided, operated or maintained at
public expense; and



         c.    To bind their successors in title to any
commitments made under the above. All agreements and evidence of unified
control shall be reviewed by the city attorney and no rezoning of land to a
PUD classification shall be adopted without a certification by the city
attorney that such agreements and evidence of unified control meet the
requirements of this article.



   (d)   Permitted uses. Permitted uses in the planned unit development
districts are found in sections 23-68(a), 23-70(d), 23-72(a), and 23-74(a) as
they apply to each of the four PUD zoning categories respectively and as they
may be amended from time to time.



      (1)   The amendment of this section shall not render
non-conforming any Planned Unit Development (PUD) master plan and/or site
plan approved prior to the effective date of this section (June 28, 2005). 
Redevelopment or reconstruction within any existing PUD shall be in
accordance with the approved master and/or site plan as same may have been
amended and approved from time to time.



   (e)   Development regulations. Development regulations for the PUD
districts are as follows:



      (1)   Minimum site size. The minimum size of a PUD development
shall be fifteen (15) acres provided that for PMUD district developments the
minimum size of development shall be four hundred (400) acres.



      (2)   Minimum lot size. No minimum lot size shall be required
within a PUD district.



      (3)   Building heights. All developments containing buildings
greater than two (2) floors in height must demonstrate an acceptable method
for the city's fire/rescue service to provide adequate fire protection.  If
adequate fire protection is not presently available in the city, it is the
responsibility of the applicant to provide the additional required fire
apparatus or equipment or compensation to the city for the city to purchase
the necessary equipment prior to receiving the first building permit.



      (4)   Density. The proposed density of the development shall
not exceed the maximum density permitted by the city's land use plan, as may
be amended and recertified from time to time.



      (5)   Maximum floor area ratio (FAR). The overall floor area
ratio of multi-family and non-residential developments within a PUD shall not
exceed the following:



 


Height of Maximum FAR building




One story

 

0.40

Four stories

 

0.85




Five stories

 

1.00




 



   For PMUD district developments the city commission may in its sole and
exclusive discretion approve variations in the maximum FAR set forth
hereinabove.  Should the city commission authorize such variations the newly
approved standards shall be included in the PMUD district design guidelines
and be recorded in the public records of Broward County.



      (6)   Minimum floor area per unit. No dwelling unit shall be
constructed or occupied in a PUD district with a gross floor area of less

square feet;



            2.   One bedroom unit: Six hundred (600) square
feet;



            3.   Two bedroom unit: Eight hundred (800) square
feet;



            4.   Three bedroom unit or larger: Eleven hundred
(1,100) square feet.



   For PMUD district developments, the city commission may, in its sole
and exclusive discretion, approve variations in the minimum floor area per
unit set forth hereinabove.  Should the city commission authorize such
variations, the newly approved standards shall be included in the PMUD
district design guidelines and be recorded in the public records of Broward
County.



      (7)   Off-street parking. Off-street parking shall meet all
requirements of chapter 25, article I, off-street parking and loading.  In
addition, there shall be at least an open space of twenty-five (25) feet
minimum, between the perimeter property line or each public or private
roadway, and all parking bays, interior drives, trash storage areas, loading
zones, etc. In PMUD district mixed-use phases, where residential and
non-residential uses are proposed within the same pod, the city commission
may authorize deviations from these standards, which shall be included within
the approved design guidelines for the PMUD development and recorded in the
public records of Broward County.



      (8)   Landscaping. Landscaping shall meet all requirements of
chapter 25, article III, landscaping, as well as including landscaping
drawings for community entrances, common open space, landscaped medians,
etc., to be approved by the city commission, and a swale planting master plan
in accordance with the city's overall objective and approved plan. In PMUD
district mixed-use phases, where residential and non-residential uses are
proposed within the same pod or phase, the city commission may authorize
deviations from these standards, which shall be included within the approved
design guidelines for the PMUD development and recorded in the public records
of Broward County.



      (9)   Pedestrian circulation. An internal pedestrian system
shall be provided within the planned unit development separate from vehicular
circulation systems and at a distance sufficient to ensure safety.  Such
pedestrian system shall be surfaced with a durable and dustless material. The
city may waive this requirement, or a portion of this requirement, upon a
demonstration that a pedestrian system is infeasible or undesirable in the
proposed development.



      (10)   Energy conservation. A planned unit development shall
incorporate passive energy conservation measures in its site design. Such
measures shall include, but need not be limited to, the directional
orientation of buildings, the location of window overhangs, minimization of
radiant heat absorption and the inclusion of energy-efficient landscaping.



      (11)   Open space.



         a.   Percent of site area.  There shall be provided on
the site an area of open space, as further defined in subsection (11)b.
below, equal to not less than forty (40) percent of the area of a PRD
development and thirty (30) percent of the area of a PCD, PMUD, or PID
development. If an application is for more than one PUD category, the city
commission may allow excess open space on one category to be transferred to
another category, provided the applicant provides adequate perimeter
buffers.  Development in PMUD districts may deviate from the open space
requirements set forth herein within individual pods, provided however, that
the overall development meets the open space requirement and that in no case
shall open space provided within an individual pod be less than fifty (50)
percent of the amount that would be required if the overall open space ratio
were applied to the individual pod and all preceding pods, and shall be
determined as part of the conceptual design guidelines.



         b.   Eligible areas. Areas that may be counted toward
the open space requirement of subsection (11)a. above shall meet the
following requirements:



            1.     Generally. Open space areas shall consist
of a parcel or parcels of land that are open and undeveloped except as
provided herein, and are designed and intended for the use, enjoyment and
access by all residents or users of the PUD.



            2.   Permitted structures. Open space areas may
contain such complementary structures and improvements as are necessary and
appropriate for the benefit and enjoyment of residents or users of the PUD.
This definition shall include, but not be limited to, such items as
landscaped entrances, greenbelts, decorative fountains, gazebos, shelters,
walkways, sidewalks, pedestrian ways, bicycle paths, trails, recreation
buildings, open recreation areas, golf courses, pools and picnic areas.



         c.   Water area open space credit. Water area open space
credit in the planned unit development district shall be as follows:



         Average Width / % Area Credit



         Greater than 100 ft. / 50



         60 ft. to 100 ft. / 25



         Less than 60 ft. / 0



            1.     Manmade water bodies may not be counted
toward meeting more than forty (40) percent of the total open space
requirement.



            2.     If the water body is natural and the
shoreline vegetation will not be disturbed by the development, one hundred
(100) percent of the area contained therein may be counted as open space.



            3.    When recreational facilities are provided to
allow residents to actively utilize the waterbody, the percentages in this
subsection of the surface area of such waterbodies may be doubled, at the
discretion of the city commission, to be counted toward the open space
requirement.



         d.   Preservation of natural habitats. If natural animal
and/or plant habitats of significant value are determined to exist on the
site of a proposed PUD, the city commission may require that the PUD plan
preserve such areas in a natural state and adequately protect them as open
space preserves or passive recreation areas. One hundred (100) percent of
such area contained therein may be counted as open space.



      (12)   Public access. Each dwelling unit or other permitted
use shall have access to a public street either directly or indirectly via a
private approach road, pedestrian way, court or other area dedicated by
common easement guaranteeing access. Permitted uses are not necessarily
required to front on a dedicated road. The city shall be allowed access on
privately owned roadways, easements and common open space to ensure the
police and fire protection of the area, to meet emergency needs, to conduct
city services and the services of the exclusive franchises and to generally
ensure the health and safety of the residents of the PUD.



      (13)   Required setbacks and yards:



         a.   A setback of not less than twenty-five (25) feet in
depth abutting all public road rights-of-way, and exclusive of perimeter
buffers, within or adjacent to a PUD.



         b.   A setback of not less than twenty-five (25) feet
shall be required next to the boundary of a PUD. A setback of not less than
fifteen (15) feet shall be required next to the boundary of a PUD that
borders a one hundred-foot canal right-of-way or easement.  No portion of
such setback may be used for buildings, parking or other vehicular use area
except for accessways. Perimeter lots are required to maintain lot depths
exclusive of the buffer. The required twenty-five foot or fifteen foot
perimeter PUD setbacks shall include landscaped buffers in accordance with
open space landscaping requirements. Fences or walls may not be installed any
closer than fifteen (15) feet from the right-of-way.  A fifteen-foot roadway
buffer is required along the ultimate right-of-way line of roads classified
as minor collectors and greater.



         c.   Setbacks, distance between buildings, and other
applicable site development regulations shall conform to the standards
contained in the design development standards required by section 23-66(j)(2).



         d.   For PMUD Districts, in the event of a conflict
between the provisions of this section and the design guidelines approved by
the city commission, the design guidelines shall prevail.



      (14)   Underground utilities: All utilities within PUDs,
including telephone, television cable, and electrical systems shall be
installed underground.  Primary facilities providing service to the site may
be exempted from this requirement. Large transformers shall be placed on the
ground and contained within pad mounts, enclosures or vaults. The developer
shall provide adequate landscaping with shrubs and plants to screen all
utility facilities permitted above ground.



      (15)   All commercial development within a PUD shall meet the
minimum distance between buildings and be separated from parking and/or
vehicular circulation areas by a minimum of ten (10) feet of landscape area.
(Sidewalks, structures and other hardscape surfaces are not permitted in this
ten (10) feet).  This landscape area shall be outside of all buildings, roof
overhangs, and support columns. This landscape area and the required
landscape material within may not be required where a section of building is
proposed and approved for loading and unloading, delivery through roll up
doors, and/or other utility area as approved through the site plan process.
For PMUD district developments, the city commission may, in its sole and
exclusive discretion, approve variations in this 10 foot landscape standard
set forth hereinabove for those pods containing both residential and
non-residential uses.  Should the city commission authorize such variations,
the newly approved standards shall be included in the PMUD district design
guidelines and be recorded in the public records of Broward County.



   (f)   Maintenance of common open space.  Any common open space not
dedicated to the city or other governmental entity shall conform to its
intended purpose and remain as shown in the PUD development plan. Deed
restrictions and/or covenants shall govern the maintenance of privately owned
common open space.  Such restrictions and covenants shall provide for
privately owned common open space to be maintained by private property owners
with an interest in such open space.  Required maintenance standards and/or
maintenance activities shall be included in the deed restrictions and/or
covenants.  The deed restrictions and/or covenants shall provide for the
city to assess private property owners with an interest in common open space
for the cost of maintenance if inadequate private maintenance results in a
public nuisance. Deed restrictions and covenants shall run with the land and
be for the benefit of present as well as future property owners.



   (g)   Common open space and improvements. All common open space as
well as public and recreation facilities shall be specifically included in
the planned unit development plan and be constructed and fully improved by
the developer. Common open space and improvements including private or public
parks, pools, recreation centers, or other facilities shall be constructed in
conjunction with residential dwellings.  Such facilities shall be completed
at a rate equal to that which is capable of serving the number of completed
residential units in the PUD. The PUD conceptual master plan shall specify
the location and scope of common area improvements. The improvements must be
backed by performance bonds issued to the city in a form and quantity
acceptable to the city attorney and growth management director respectively,
prior to the issuance of the first residential permits.

   (i)   Rezoning to PUD. The procedure for rezoning to any of the PUD
districts shall be as set forth in section 23-151, as modified by the
following:



      The planning and zoning board and city commission shall give
special consideration to the following matters and requirements, and permit
changes in the rezoning application prior to the required public hearings in
accordance with the provisions of this section.



      (1)   Pre-Submittal conferences. Upon request by the
applicant, representatives of the growth management department shall meet
with the applicant to review a required PUD conceptual master plan.  The
purpose of pre-submittal conferences shall be to provide information to
assist the applicant in interpreting the PUD zoning requirements.
Pre-submittal conferences shall continue until the applicant has a complete
PUD rezoning plan ready for submission with a rezoning application. The PUD
conceptual master plan shall include the following:



         a.    A boundary map of the proposed PUD;



         b.   The proposed pattern of land use;

pre-submittal conferences appear unnecessary, the applicant may present a
formal petition for PUD zoning as set forth in this section.  The petition
shall be accompanied by the materials set forth in section 23-66(j).  A
meeting date shall be established for the next regularly scheduled
Development Review Committee (DRC) meeting.



   The DRC shall review the application, master plan and other supporting
material required in section 23-66(j) for compliance with code requirements
and shall prepare a report detailing the (non) compliance with the standards
of this section and other applicable provisions of the code.



   The report shall immediately after preparation be forwarded to the
applicant who shall then respond to the compliance comments by revising the
application, master plan and supporting documentation to comply with the DRC
report.



   A written response shall accompany the resubmittal which shall
demonstrate how and where on the plans each of the DRC comments have been
addressed.



   The revised application shall then be resubmitted to the DRC who shall
then review the revised application to ensure that all comments have been
addressed. Upon satisfactory determination that all DRC comments have been
adequately addressed, the rezoning petition shall then be scheduled for the
next available, regularly scheduled planning and zoning board meeting at a
public hearing with proper public notice given, in the same manner as for
other applications for rezoning.

application for PUD zoning, and the report of the DRC and the growth
management director, the planning and zoning board shall conduct a review of
the application at a public hearing.



   After the close of the public hearing, the planning and zoning board
may recommend to the city  commission that the PUD rezoning be granted as
submitted, granted subject to stated stipulations and conditions, or denied.
In making its recommendation, the planning and zoning board shall find that
the plans, maps, and documents submitted by the applicant and presented at
the public hearing do or do not establish that: (1) the applicant has met the
requirements of this article, and (2) the proposed development would or would
not promote the public health, safety and welfare.



      (4)   City commission action. The city commission shall, after
due consideration, enact or deny PUD zoning for the subject property. The
ordinance enacting PUD zoning shall specifically incorporate the PUD master

procedures for rezoning generally.



      (5)   Effect of PUD zoning. Subsequent to the enactment of PUD
zoning, development of all or a portion of the PUD shall proceed in
accordance with the site plan review and subdivision approval provisions of
chapter 24 of the Land Development Code. Site plan approval and subdivision
approval shall be granted only for developments which conform to the
submissions incorporated into the PUD ordinance in accordance with subsection
(6) of this section, except that the provisions of subsection (2) of this
section shall apply.



      (6)   Applications for rezoning and/or amendments to the PUD
requiring action by the planning and zoning board and the city commission

buildings and structures associated with individual phases. The nature, type
and amount of such improvements provided during an individual phase of the
project shall be commensurate with and proportionate to the overall
development of the phase, and in no case shall open space provided during an
individual pod of a PUD be less than fifty (50) percent of the amount that
would be required if the overall open space ratio were applied to the
individual pod and all preceding pods.  Phases and stages of construction

hereinabove, the developer may request that the city commission, in its sole
and exclusive discretion, authorize and establish a Community Development
District in accordance with Chapter 190, Florida Statutes.



      (7)   Community Development District. Should the city
establish a Community Development District (CDD), in accordance with Chapter
190, Florida Statutes, all real property and infrastructure owned and

Sec. 23-70. PMUD, Planned mixed-use development district.



   (a)   Applicability. The provisions of this section apply to all
Planned Mixed Use Development Districts comprised of a minimum of 400 acres
of land controlled by a single landowner at the time of application submittal.



   (b)   District Purpose. The purpose of the Planned Mixed-Use
Development District ("PMUD") is to provide a means of achieving flexibility
in the development of land appropriate in size and shape to facilitate
utilization in a manner not generally feasible in a conventional zoning
district. The PMUD is designed to create a community whose central focus is
to encourage neighborhood values known for diversity of recreation, family
entertainment, limited commercial and retail uses. Through the exercise of
sound and proper planning principles, a PMUD should not be detrimental to
surrounding property, or the health, safety, and general welfare. Instead a
PMUD should accomplish the following objectives:



      (1)   Include a mix of uses to comprise residential,
commercial, office, retail, recreational, and institutional either
separately, or comingled within a particular portion of the site, such as a
town center.



      (2)    Encourage diversification of uses, structures and open
spaces not in conflict with existing and permitted land uses on abutting
properties while creating a variety of social and recreational amenities
serviced through an interconnected network of streets designed to encourage
walking, reduce automobile traffic, and protect open space.



   (c)   Mix of land uses. The portion of a PMUD devoted to
nonresidential uses shall not be more than twenty (20) percent of the total
gross acres within the PMUD, with no more than ten (10) percent of the total
gross acres in the PMUD devoted to business, retail, and other commercial
uses.



   (d)   Permitted uses. In the PMUD District, no building or
structure, or part thereof, shall be erected, altered, or used, or land or
water used, in whole or in part, for other than one or more of the following
uses:



      (1)    Alcohol sales or service;

   (q)   Town Center regulations. The intent of a Town Center is to
provide for the development of a sustainable, mixed-use downtown environment
that embodies the uniqueness of the community.  This section is intended to
promote the development of pedestrian-oriented, mixed-use community organized
around centralized open space and water bodies. The efficient development of
land resources, compact development of a variety of housing choices,
flexibility in use and design and green building and planning techniques are
fundamental to a Town Center development.



   Pedestrian comfort and safety is crucial to the development of an
economically sustainable Town Center and shall be of greater concern than the
convenience of drivers. Streetscapes should offer protection from the
elements. To the greatest degree possible, continuous overhead cover should
be provided.  In addition, the best streets offer variety and encourage
building occupants to add something to the street such as awnings, cafe
seating, plants and flowers.  The goal of street design within the Town
Center should be to provide appropriate space for these things to occur thus
ensuring a vibrant and interesting public space.  Site furnishings, plants,
and hardscape treatments should be carefully selected and installed to
complement the sustainable goals of the Town Center.



   In the event that a Town Center is developed in connection with a PMUD,
the following regulations shall apply:



      (1)   Size: No more than ten percent (10%) of the total gross
PMUD acreage may be approved for a town center.



         There shall be at least one plaza or square within a town
center.



      (2)   Categories of use allocation in the town center can
include residential, commercial, office, retail, institutional, recreational,
and open space.



      (3)   Sidewalks, excluding any outdoor plaza/square, or
outside seating areas in a town center to be a minimum width of eight (8)
feet and may include tree grates.



      (4)   A minimum landscaped buffer of five (5) feet shall be
required if a Town Center parcel abuts a residential parcel.



      (5)   In addition to the landscaped buffer a solid wall/fence
at a minimum height of eight (8) feet shall be required if a Town Center
parcel directly abuts a residential parcel/lot without separation by a water
body or public or private roadway or alley on the residential parcel.



      (6)   With the following exceptions, parking requirements
shall be as specified in section 25-4:



         a.    On-street parallel parking shall be a minimum
width of eight (8) feet and twenty-two (22) feet length.



         b.   The amount of required parking for all
non-residential uses shall be reduced by twenty-five percent (25%), for any
building which contains both residential and non-residential uses.




   (r)   Alley widths. Alley widths to be a minimum of fourteen (14)
feet where a minimum ten (10) feet of travel lane is required for one-way
circulation, and twenty-four (24) feet where a minimum of (20) feet of travel
lane for two-way circulation. Curb radii to accommodate emergency vehicle
turning radius as required.

Sec. 23-83 - Setback Requirements - Swimming Pools



   (a)   If deemed advisable by the building department to issue a pool
and/or screen enclosure permit, after investigation as to its propriety, same
shall be issued by the building department to the owner permitting the
construction of a swimming pool and/or screen enclosure to six (6) feet from
the rear lot line and six (6) feet from the interior side lot line. In no
event shall a permit be issued for construction of a pool and/or screen
enclosure that will encroach upon a utility easement. If a pool and/ or
screen enclosure is proposed for an easement dedicated to a drainage district
or any other type of easement, the owner shall receive approval for such
encroachment from any and all parties to which the easement is dedicated. 
Screened enclosures, or permanent fences or wall (minimum five (5) feet in
height) shall be required to surround all in-ground swimming pools, all
above-ground swimming pools, therapeutic pools, hot tubs and spas (for this
section these shall all be generally referred to as "pools"). This is to
include all features classified with pools by the Florida Building Code but
not to include other items such as portable toddler’s wading pools.
Permanent fencing shall be of a design that would require a building permit
for installation such as a chain link fence, shadowbox fence, picket fence,
or a board-on-board fence and would not be able to be readily removed (not
what is commonly referred to as a baby guard swimming pool fence, “baby
fence” or mesh safety fence). A fence shall be considered to be able to be
readily removed if it is designed in such a way that once the fence is taken
down the Florida Building Code would not require a building permit for it to
be put back in place. Therefore, a permanent fence would require a building
permit each and any time it is put in place. Permanent fences and screen

potential damage to adjacent property or common area.

   (c)   Materials: All fences and walls shall be constructed of
materials appropriate to their purpose and location. Treated wood,
concrete/masonry, chain link, or similar materials as approved by the
building department are permitted. Provided, however, that barbed wire,
oriented in toward the property on which the fence is located, shall be
permitted in U-1 (utility) district, CS (community services) district, and on
any other municipally-owned property, regardless of the zoning district
designation, such fence to be shielded by hedge material and/or landscaping;
and further providing that barbed wire shall not be installed on fences of
less than eight (8) feet in height nor on fences surrounding swimming
pools.    Applicants are encouraged to use recycled plastic and/or other
attractive, non-deteriorating materials. All walls shall have, at minimum, a
“drip edge” detail at the top of the wall to prevent water damage. The
chief building official or his designee shall make all final decisions as to
the design and materials for fences or walls.



      (1)   Rear or side yard concrete masonry walls on double
frontage residential lots shall be maintained by the property owner, as
specified herein.

will not interfere with or cause damage to any utilities located in said
easement.



   (e)   Orientation:



      (1)   Fences and walls shall be oriented so that the side of
the fence or wall facing or viewable from a street right-of-way or an
adjoining property is the finished side, with all support posts and stringers
facing inward toward the property upon which the fence or wall is located.
However, as determined by the building official or designee, if access to a
portion of a fence is wholly or partially blocked by a building, fence, wall
or other structure or by foliage which conceals the fence proposed to be
constructed, located upon adjoining property and adjacent to, but not
necessarily abutting, the property line, the support posts for that portion
of the fence, but not the stringers, may be installed on the outside of the
fence, facing away from the property upon which the fence is located.



      (2)   All fences constructed on residential lots in yards
which abut a public or private road right-of-way and are along an
uninterrupted line of fencing of double frontage lots (i.e., double frontage
lot rear fences and street side yard fences associated with those double
frontage lot rear fences), subsequent to the effective date of this section
(July 25, 2006), shall be shadowbox design with a natural wood appearance in
order to maintain visual continuity along the streetscape of the double
frontage lots. Any duly-recorded covenants and restrictions or Homeowners'
Association regulations otherwise filed with the city governing the uniform
and perpetual maintenance of fences as a specific design shall prevail with
regard to this provision. Fences of other construction which were legally
constructed prior to the effective date of this section shall comply with the
non-conforming use provisions contained within Section 23-156 of this code. 
Provisions of this section shall supersede fence requirements of Section
25-72(d), provided such fences shall match finish/color to that which exists
in the existing fence line directly to each side of that which is to be
installed.



   (f)   Height and location on lot. Fence and wall heights shall be
measured from the existing finished first floor level and the top of the
fence or wall shall not exceed six (6) feet above the said first floor level
nor exceed seven (7) feet above grade when abutting a residential lot. For
double frontage lots along SW 100th Avenue between SW 49th Street on the
north to SW 53rd Street on the south, fence and wall heights along rear
property lines may not exceed six (6) feet as measured from the finished
elevation of the abutting sidewalk. For the safety of the adjacent roadways
and neighborhood:



(Ord. No. 14-4-2, §2, 4-22-14)



      (1)   No fence, wall or hedge will be allowed to be installed
or constructed within the setback area from a street right-of-way, except as
provided for in subsection (3) hereof.



(Ord. No. 06-07-03, §1, 7-25-06)



      (2)   No fence or wall will exceed six (6) feet in height,
except as permitted in subsection (f) above. Any fence or wall which exceeds
six (6) feet in height shall require a signed plan from a licensed architect
or engineer.



(Ord. No. 98-8-1, §1, 8-11-98; Ord. No. 14-4-2, §2, 4-22-14)



         a.   Fences or walls in U-1 (utility) district, CS
(community services) district, on any municipally-owned property regardless
of its zoning district designation, and surrounding swimming pools that are
open and available for public or semi-private use (i.e., swimming pools in
common areas owned by homeowners' associations for the exclusive use of the
residents and invitees of the subdivision), shall be permitted to be (8) feet
in height.



      (3)   On a corner lot in a residential district, fences, walls
or hedges may be erected in the side yard abutting the street. On corner lots
in a residential district, the location of fences, walls and hedges shall
conform to district regulations, except if the fence, wall or hedge will not
obstruct the view of a driver approaching the intersection, only then may be
the fence, wall or hedge be brought out to the property line, but may never
extend past the front of the house. When the corner lot is other than
rectangular in shape, prior approval by the building official and the police
chief, or their designees, shall be required to ensure adequate vision to a
driver of a vehicle.



      (4)   Where a hedge is required to screen an off-street
parking area or other vehicular use area from a public right-of-way or
abutting property in a residential district, the hedge shall be maintained at
height of not less than four (4) feet.  Provided, however, that where hedge
materials are planted within thirty (30) inches of a free-standing masonry
wall, the hedge shall be maintained at a height equal to the height of the
wall.  This section is not intended to amend the provisions of the
landscaping code which shall prevail as to the minimum required height of
hedges at the time of installation. Property owners, including homeowners'
association, which violate the provisions of this section, shall be subject
to an administrative fine of $300 per violation, said fine to be expended on
the purchase and installation of additional plant materials within the
development or property subject to the fine.



         a.   For purposes of this section, the following
definitions shall be applicable:



            i.   A violation shall be determined if forty
percent (40%) or more of any mature, continuous, contiguous hedge, exclusive
of any breaks or interruptions for the display of architectural detailing
pursuant to subsection b, below, is trimmed below the height of the adjacent
freestanding masonry wall.

masonry wall includes a particular architectural feature (including but not
limited to a line of accent tiles or color within twelve (12) inches of the
top of the wall, or an interruption in the wall for decorative fencing),
hedges may be maintained at a height lower than the height of the wall to
ensure visibility of such architectural feature, not to exceed six (6) inches
below the level of the architectural feature. (Ord. No. 01-1-4, §1, 1-23-01)



      In instances where there are extraordinary circumstances or
conditions, the chief building official shall be entitled to determine the
beginning elevation and height of the fence, wall or hedge.



   (g)   New double frontage lots:  The city code specifically
prohibits double frontage lots, however, should the city commission waive the
prohibition of double frontage lots as provided in section 24-63(a) of this
code, then the following conditions shall affect a fence or wall constructed
at the rear yards of such lots:



      (1)   A landscaped buffer zone shall be required as set forth
in section 25-42 of the City code.



      (2)   The fence or wall shall be constructed at the rear of
the required "buffer zone" from the street right-of-way. The fence shall be
constructed in shadowbox design with a natural wood appearance. (Ord. No.
06-07-03, §1, 7/25/06)



      (3)   Any fence or wall constructed by any developer of a
subdivision subsequent to the date of the adoption of this code section shall
provide for a homeowners' association or similar owner association which
shall be responsible for the maintenance of the "buffer zone" landscaping and

   (h)   Landscaping and irrigation.  Fences and walls located within
a setback area from a street right-of-way shall be landscaped and irrigated
on the outside, or right-of-way side, of the fence or wall in accord with all
provisions and specifications contained in this subsection and in accord with
a landscape plan approved by the city commission or the public works director
or his designee, as provided in the City code. All plant materials shall be
maintained by the property owner in a healthy and orderly condition; any
materials not so maintained may be ordered to be replaced at the direction of
the code enforcement officer. Any landscaping in proximity to a public
sidewalk shall be maintained so that none of the landscaping encroaches upon
the sidewalk. All required plant materials shall adhere to the following:



      (1)   Shrubs or hedges shall be planted along the lineal
distance of the fence or wall generally parallel to the street right-of-way.



      (2)   All fences and walls located within a setback area from
a street right-of-way shall be provided with an opening or gate of sufficient
width to allow access outside of the area enclosed by the fence or wall to
such right-of-way for the purpose of facilitating maintenance of any required
landscaping, irrigation and the street right-of-way.



      (3)   Shrubs shall be planted at a minimum height of two (2)
feet so as to achieve a minimum maintained height of three (3) feet upon
maturity, achieve a density so as to obscure the fence or wall and maintained
no higher than the fence or wall.



   (i)   Maintenance. All fences, walls and hedges installed or
constructed pursuant to this section shall be maintained as set forth in the
approved plans and in a structurally sound and aesthetically attractive
manner. Specifically:



      (1)   A fence or wall shall be maintained in a vertical
position, and shall not be allowed to sag or lean at more than ten (10
degrees from vertical, unless the fence or wall is specifically designed and
permitted to be maintained at such an angle.



      (2)   Each support post or footer shall be solidly attached to
the ground.



      (3)   Each fence stringer shall be securely fastened to the
support posts and face of the fence.



      (4)   Each fence face shall be securely fastened to the
support post and fence stringers; and



      (5)   All fence or wall surfaces shall be painted, stained,
treated or otherwise maintained so as to present a uniform appearance;
however, this section is not intended to prohibit the maintenance of fences
in which a deteriorated section of the fence is replaced with new material
which will take some time to “age” or “weather” to replicate the
appearance of the original fence. All fence’s finish/color shall match that
which exists in the existing fence line directly to each side of that which
is installed or to be installed. Provided, however, this shall not apply if
the applicant replaced the fence with recycled plastic or other
non-deteriorating materials.



      (6)   All walls shall be maintained in a clean condition, free
from cracks greater than 1/16th of an inch in width, dirt, grime, stains,
graffiti, peeling paint and missing materials, and mildew, discoloration,
fading, mold and be aesthetically pleasing to surrounding properties, and
shall be in good repair. All walls finish/color shall match that which exists
in the existing wall line directly to each side of that which is installed or
to be installed.



      (7)   When any single sight view of a fence or wall is subject
to any of the abovementioned deficiencies, then the owner shall upon notice
by the city take immediate steps to correct the violation.



   (j)   Miscellaneous provisions:



      (1)   The following persons shall be responsible for the
implementation of the provisions of this section of the code:

across an alley, street, drainage ditch or waterway, from residential
districts, must have a seven (7) foot wall constructed on the boundary lines
of the property so abutting such residential districts. Such wall must be
constructed of concrete masonry, and its height shall be measured from the
residential property side. The chief building official shall make all final
decisions as to the appropriate height of the wall. (Ord. No. 06-07-03, §1,
7/25/06)



      (3)   Requirements of this section may be superseded on
projects subject to design approval by the city commission.



      (4)   The city commission, in considering any subdivision
plat, may require that masonry walls be constructed for screening purposes,
and may fix the height of said wall, which height may exceed the limitations
set forth in this chapter when the wall is required for screening purposes. 
The city commission in requiring a wall be constructed for screening
purposes, may take into consideration the following:



         a.   Design of wall for appearance;



         b.   Location of wall; and



         c.   Impairment of visibility at streets or driveways.



         d.   Appropriate landscaping and irrigation.



      (5)   Those properties located within a subdivision which, in
conjunction with the approval of the subdivision, were required to have a
fence, wall or hedge shall not be permitted any additional or substitute
fences or walls which otherwise contravene the general purpose and uniformity
afforded by the plan.



   (k)   Notice and penalties:



      (1)   In enforcing the provisions of this section against
residential premises, the city may utilize those procedures set forth in code
section 6-43 through 6-45 by citing the property owner and/or the occupant of
the affected property.



      (2)    The provisions of this section shall be in addition to
such other remedies as may be provided by law or ordinance. The violation of,
or failure to comply with any provisions of this section, shall subject the
offender, upon conviction, to a fine not to exceed five hundred dollars
($500.00).



      (3)    Under the provisions of this section, each day a
violation of this section exists shall constitute a separate offense and
shall be subject to a separate penalty.



(Ord. 98-1-1, § 1, 1-13-98)



Sec. 23-91. Building design standards.



   (a)   Similarity of building design prohibited.  No building permit
for any structure for which a building permit is required shall be issued
unless it has been found as a fact by the building official after a view of
the site of the proposed structure and an examination of the application
papers for a building permit, which shall include exterior elevation of the
proposed structure, that the exterior architectural appeal and functional
plan of the proposed structure will, when erected, not duplicate nor be so
similar to either the exterior architectural appeal and functional plan of
the structures already constructed or in the course or construction, that are
within five hundred (500) feet or six (6) lots, whichever is the lesser, of
the proposed structure on the same side of the street, as to cause a
substantial depreciation in the property values of the neighborhood area. In
making such determination of design similarity, the following factors shall
be considered by the building official:



      (1)   A duplication of similarity in the massing of the front
of the structure;



      (2)   A duplication or similarity in roof style;



      (3)   A duplication or similarity in car storage area.



   (b)   Major changes. Should the building official make such a
determination of design similarity, the building official may consider any
one of the following three (3) major changes, in conjunction with the
required minor changes, as evidencing sufficient change in similar or
duplicate structures:



      (1)    A plan change which will affect the massing of the
front of the structure in such a manner so as to cause a perimeter change or
the addition or elimination of two (2) or more corners. The height of any
such wall to be classified as a perimeter wall shall be from ground line to
soffit line.



      (2)   A definite change in roofing framing by changing the
style (hip to gable, etc.), or the addition of a cupola or a minimum change
in roof pitch of one (1) inch of vertical rise per twelve (12) inches of
horizontal run.



      (3)   A definite change in car storage that involves position
and direction of entrance; or, if direction of entrance remains the same, the
car storage area shall move forward or backward a minimum of eight (8) feet
for a flat roof.



   (c)   Minor changes. Each of the following shall constitute a unit
of minor change in a structure:



      (1)   Change of room similarities; one out of five (5)
structures;



      (2)   Change of roof material or shape or material;



      (3)   Change of extent of overhang or distinctive change of
shape of overhang;



      (4)   Garage instead of carports involving area change or
vice-versa;



      (5)   Change of exterior wall texture;



      (6)   Change of exterior wall pattern;



      (7)   Change of exterior wall materials;



      (8)   Change of area of exterior wall texture, pattern and
materials;



      (9)   Use of walls and fences;



      (10)   Change of exterior wall color;



      (11)   Change in fenestration;



      (12)   Change in type of windows;



      (13)   Change in design details such as depth of cornice
boards, soffit materials, shutters, garage door, etc.;



      (14)   Change in landscaping materials and plan; sketch
required;



      (15)   Use of grilles;



      (16)   Use of planters;



      (17)   Use of patio;



      (18)   Use of walks.



   (d)   Acceptable combinations of major and minor changes. The
following combinations will be acceptable as evidencing sufficient change in
similar or duplicate structures, provided that a different front entrance
detail should be required with each combination:



      (1)   Subsection (b)(1) and four (4) units of subsection (c);



      (2)   Subsection (b)(2) and four (4) units of subsection (c);



      (3)   Subsection (b)(3) and four (4) units of subsection (c);



      (4)   Subsections (b)(1) and (b)(2) and two (2) units of
subsection (c);



      (5)   Subsections (b)(3) and (b)(2) and two (2) units of
subsection (c).



   (e)   Review by planning and zoning board. The building official
shall request a meeting of the planning and zoning board to consider
applications for building permits that have been found to comply in all
respects with all other ordinances of the city, but for which a building
permit has been refused because in the building official’s opinion the
proposed structure, is similar to adjacent structures according to the
criteria of subsection (a).



   (f)   Hearing.  The planning and zoning board shall, if requested
by the applicant for the building permit, hear the applicant for the building
permit in question and/or the owner of the plat on which it is proposed to
erect the structure in question, together with any other persons who are
residents or property owners desiring to be heard, giving such notice of the
hearing as the board may deem sufficient. Such hearing may be adjourned from
time to time but for not more than forty-eight (48) hours, and within
forty-eight (48) hours after the close of the hearing the planning and zoning
board shall, in writing, make or refuse to make the finding required by
subsection (a), and file it in the office of the city clerk, who shall
forthwith send a copy of it to the building official.



   (g)   Appeal to Commission. The decision of the planning and zoning
board on any matter considered herein shall be final; provided, however, the
applicant for the building permit and/or the owner of the lot on which it is
proposed to erect the structure in question, may appeal the decision of the
planning and zoning board to the city commission, by filing an appeal, in
writing, with the city clerk within fifteen (15) days of the date of the
filing of the findings by the planning and zoning board with the city
commission. The appeal shall state briefly the grounds for the appeal and
shall be placed on the agenda of the next regular meeting of the city
commission for the purpose of scheduling a hearing thereon. The hearing shall
be scheduled by the commission for a date and time not later than the next
following regular meeting of the commission.



   (h)   Reroofing of multi-unit structures. At the time of repair or
replacement of roofs on all duplex, townhouse and/or multiple-family
dwellings that have attached or continuous roofs, the new roof area shall be

determination within thirty (30) days after receipt of the additional
information from the requesting party.

designee's written determination is mailed to the requesting party, the
requesting party may appeal the decision to the City Commission.  All
appeals shall contain a statement explaining the reason for the appeal. The
City Commission shall, after giving public notice pursuant to subsection (8)
and conducting a public hearing, make a determination no later than 60 days
after an appeal has been filed to uphold, reverse or modify in whole or in
part the City Manager's determination. The purpose of the public hearing is
to receive comments, input and information from the public, which shall be
taken under advisement by the City Commission.

right-of-way or property line.



      Outparcel:  An area of land on a plat or site plan as the site

to independently meet the provisions of the city’s code.  For the purposes
of determining whether an outparcel or major parcel has provided for
sufficient landscaping, setbacks, as well as whether all other city code
regulations have been met, each outparcel or major parcel shall be reviewed
independently and the condition of other outparcels or an adjacent major
parcel, will not be considered in determining whether code criteria are met.



   (c)   Integrated parking areas. Notwithstanding the above, a minimum
of fifty (50) percent of the total parking spaces required for the outparcel
shall be provided on the outparcel. Any remaining required parking spaces
shall be provided on the adjacent major parcel in addition to the parking

outparcel. If such parking spaces are separated from the outparcel by an
internal roadway, adequate pedestrian safety must be provided to cross such
internal roadway with features such as, but not limited to, pavement marked
crosswalk(s), signage, and/or mechanized lighting signals. Any such remaining
required parking spaces so provided shall be paved and a cross-parking

right-of-way in front of the primary frontage of the building from such
public right-of-way to the primary frontage of the building.  Such
unobstructed view shall extend the entire length of the primary frontage of
the building(s).



   (e)   Outparcels which were designated through an approved site plan

or canopy on the outparcel to any building or canopy on any other outparcel
or major parcel located in the same block shall be one hundred twenty (120)
feet.

   (a)   Purpose and intent. The purpose and intent of this section is
to protect the public health, safety and welfare by:



      (1)   Establishing minimum standards for the occupancy,
physical development, redevelopment, location, and future conversion of
special residential facilities within the city;



      (2)   Coordinating city regulations with those of the state of
Florida and Broward County;



      (3)   Ensuring an adequate quality of life for residents of
special residential facilities by providing for a balanced mix of
residential, social, health and leisure services within such facilities;



      (4)   Encouraging the development of special residential
facilities within planned developments; and



      (5)   Establishing standards for the appropriate placement of
special residential facilities within the growth management framework
established by the city's comprehensive plan.



   (b)   Applicability. The requirements of this section shall apply to
all special residential facilities within the city. These standards shall
prevail over less restrictive standards applicable to such facilities within
the city.



   (c)   Maximum occupancy. The following maximum occupancy standards
shall apply to special residential facilities.



      (1)   The maximum occupancy of a special residential facility,
type 1 shall be six (6) persons, excluding staff.



      (2)   The maximum occupancy of a special residential facility,
type 2 shall be fourteen (14) persons, excluding staff.



      (3)   The maximum occupancy of a special residential facility,
type 3 shall be established by multiplying two and four-tenths (2.4) by the
maximum number of dwelling units permitted by the zoning district or land use
designation, whichever is less. In the case of nonresidential districts, a
maximum permitted density of fifteen (15) units per acre will be assumed for
the purpose of calculating maximum occupancy. When special residential
facilities are located in nonresidential zoning districts, reserve units must
be subtracted from the city’s remaining allocation of reserve units
pursuant to the requirements of section 22-4, reserve units.



   (d)   Number of residents to be specified.  The total number of
residents proposed, including resident staff, shall be specified in the
preliminary site development plan application and on the final site
development plan.



   (e)   Conversion to conventional dwelling units.  The following
regulations shall govern the conversion of special residential facilities to
conventional dwelling units.



      (1)   Prior to conversion to conventional dwelling units, a
building designed and permitted to accommodate a special residential facility
shall, if necessary, be structurally modified to comply with residential
density restrictions of the comprehensive plan and zoning district.



      (2)   No site plan for a special residential facility, type 3,
shall be certified until a declaration of restrictions regarding conversion
to conventional residences in a form approved by the city attorney has been
recorded to run with the land in the official records maintained by the clerk
of the circuit court in and for Broward county.  This declaration of
restrictions shall expressly provide the following.



         a.   The conversion of the premises to conventional
dwelling units is prohibited except in compliance with this section, as
amended.



         b.    If permitted, conversion will not result in an
increase in the number of units permitted on the site under conventional
zoning unless the converted project has obtained a valid PUD approval. If
that approval has not been granted, the converted project will have to comply
with the density permitted in the underlying zoning district.



         c.   The total number of permitted residents may be
determined by referring to the approved site development plan on file with
the planning and growth management department.



   (f)   Supplemental property development regulations.

provided for each four (4) residents, plus one (1) space for each employee on
the two (2) combined shifts of greatest employment.



            2.   Special residential facilities, types 2 and
3, shall establish a safe drop-off area for group transportation, such as
vans or similar vehicles.



         c.   Every special residential facility shall provide
adequate parking and circulation for residents, visitors and staff. The
standards established in this section shall be considered the minimum
necessary to achieve this goal.



         d.    The basis for parking calculations shall be
clearly stated on proposed site plans, including the maximum number of
employees.

special residential facilities. Food preparation shall be prohibited in
sleeping areas or in individual quarters in special residential facilities,
type 1 or type 2. Individual kitchen facilities may be provided in the living
quarters of a special residential facility, type 3.



      (5)   Maximum occupancy of sleeping areas. The maximum number
of persons per sleeping area shall be determined by applying the space
requirements of the state of Florida department of health and rehabilitative
services.

and home occupation uses.



         b.   A special residential facility, type 3, may have:



            1.   Those accessory land uses customarily
accessory to a multiple-family residence; and



            2.    Those noncommercial land uses customarily
incidental to a special residential facility, such as a common dining room, a
central kitchen, a nursing station, a medical examining room, a chapel, a
library, and offices necessary to manage the facility.



      (7)   Location, concentration and neighborhood compatibility.
No approval for a special residential facility shall be granted unless it
satisfies the following criteria for location, concentration and neighborhood
compatibility.



         a.   Location of special residential facility, type 1. A
special residential facility, type 1 may be located wherever single-family

within one thousand (1,000) feet of another such facility.



         b.   Location of special residential facilities, types 2
and 3.



            1.    A special residential facility, type 2 may
be permitted in all residential zoning districts that allow multi-family
dwelling units as permitted uses, provided that it is not located within a
radius of twelve hundred (1,200) feet of another special residential
facility, type 2 and shall not be within a radius of five hundred (500) feet
from a zoning district that allows single-family dwelling units as permitted

Agricultural District, E-3 Agricultural Estate District, E-2 Rural Estate
District and the E-1 Estate District.

Sec. 23-152. Conditional use.



   (a)   Purpose and intent.



      (1)    The purpose of the conditional use procedure is to
provide for certain uses or structures that cannot be well-adjusted to their
environment in particular locations, and to offer full protection to
surrounding properties by rigid application of the district regulations, and,
due to the nature of the use, the importance of the relationship to the
comprehensive development plan and the possible impact on neighboring
properties, to require the exercise of planning judgment on their location
and site plan.



      (2)   If any criteria for a conditional use or for conditional
uses in general is found by a court of competent jurisdiction to be
inadequate; the legislative intent is for that conditional use to be a
prohibited use in the district for which conditional use approval had
previously been required.



   (b)   Approval standards. A conditional use permit shall not be
considered an entitlement, and shall be granted by the city commission only
if the commission finds that all of the following standards are met. The
burden of proof in demonstrating that the standards have been met shall be on
the applicant. No conditional use permit shall be granted if the commission
finds that any one (1) or more of the following standards are not met.



      (1)   Nature of use. The nature and characteristics of the
proposed use or structure is consistent with the type of use or structure
authorized as a conditional use in the zoning district in which located.



      (2)   Plan compliance. The proposed use conforms to the
provisions of the city's comprehensive plan.



      (3)   Ordinance compliance.  The proposed use complies with
all applicable regulations, including any specific standards for the proposed
use set forth in this land development code.



      (4)   Compatibility. The proposed use is compatible with
adjacent uses, in terms of use, building height, bulk, scale, setbacks, open
spaces, landscaping, drainage, access and circulation.



      (5)   Traffic impact.  The proposed use does not adversely
affect the safety and convenience of vehicular and pedestrian circulation in
the area, and will not result in a significant increase in traffic on any
local residential street.



      (6)   Parking adequacy.  The proposed use provides adequate
and convenient off-street parking and loading facilities, and will not result
in overflow parking on adjacent residential streets.



      (7)   Hazard protection. The proposed use reasonably protects
persons and property from erosion, flooding, fire, noise, glare or similar
hazards.



   (c)   Application. Applications for conditional use approval shall
be subject to the following provisions.



      (1)   Every application shall be completed by the owner of
record of the subject property, and shall be signed by such individual and
notarized.



      (2)    Each application shall be accompanied by ten (10)

advertising fees.



      (4)   It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to
furnish, at the applicant’s expense, a certified list of all property
owners within a three hundred (300) foot radius of the boundaries of the
subject property.  This list must be certified by a licensed title company
or other qualified individual, and the applicant will be responsible for the
accuracy of the list of property owners. The list must be submitted to the
city clerk at the time of the filing of the application. The list of property
owners must be dated and certified to a date not exceeding thirty (30) days
prior to the date of filing of the application.



      (5)   It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to
furnish, at the applicant’s expense, a map showing all property within a
three hundred (300) foot radius of the boundaries of the subject property.



      (6)   Each application shall be accompanied by such other
information as may be required by the city commission, the planning and
zoning board, or staff for a determination of the nature of the proposed use
and its effect on the comprehensive development plan, the neighborhood and
surrounding properties.



   (d)   Review procedure. Applications for approval of a conditional
use shall be subject to the following review procedures.



      (1)   Submittal. Applications shall be submitted to the city
clerk who shall review the application and concept site plan or floor plan
for sufficiency under the requirements of these regulations and forward
necessary copies of the application to the planning and growth management
department and the planning and zoning board for study, for holding of a
public hearing, and for recommendation and report to the city commission.



      (2)   Review by planning and zoning board. Within a reasonable
time of the receipt of the application, the planning and zoning board shall
hold a public hearing in relation thereto, at which parties in interest and
citizens shall have an opportunity to be heard.



         a.   At least fifteen (15) days notice of the time and
place of such hearing shall be published in a newspaper of general
circulation in the city, notice of the hearing shall be posted on the subject
property and all property owners within a three hundred (300) foot radius of
the boundaries of the subject property shall be notified by certified and/or
ordinary first class mail at least fifteen (15) days in advance of the
hearing, provided, that where the applicant is the owner of land not included
in the application, and the land not included is a part of or adjoins the
parcel for which the conditional use is requested, the three hundred (300)
foot requirement shall be measured from the boundaries of the applicant’s
ownership, including the land not covered by the application.



         b.    Within thirty (30) days of the public hearing, the
planning and zoning board shall submit a report and recommendation to the
city commission.



      (3)   Commission action. Within a reasonable time of the
receipt of the planning and zoning board’s recommendation, the city
commission shall hold a public hearing in relation thereto, at which parties
in interest and citizens shall have an opportunity to be heard.



         a.    Following the public hearing, the city commission
may approve, approve with conditions, or deny the application based on the
approval standards of subsection (b) above.



         b.    The city commission may impose such conditions or
restrictions upon a conditional use approval as necessary in order to ensure
that the approval standards are met and to eliminate or minimize the
injurious effect of such use upon surrounding properties.



   (e)   Effect of approval. Approval of a conditional use shall be
subject to the following provisions.



      (1)   Approval of a conditional use under this section shall
be valid for a period of one (1) year following the date of approval and
thereafter shall become null and void, unless construction or use is
substantially underway during such one-year period or unless an extension of
time is approved by the planning and zoning board before the expiration of
such one-year period.



      (2)   A conditional use granted under the provisions of this
section shall not be transferable from place to place and shall be valid only
at the place designated on the conditional use permit.



      (3)   Permits issued under a conditional use approval may be
revoked by the city commission for failure to comply with conditions of
approval or applicable regulations, after review and a public hearing.



Sec. 23-153. Variance.



   (a)   Purpose and intent.  For purposes of this section,
“variance” shall mean a modification of the zoning district regulations
when such variance will not be contrary to the public interest and when,
owing to conditions peculiar to the property and not the result of the
actions of the applicant, a literal enforcement of the ordinance would result
in unnecessary and undue hardship.



   (b)   Applicability. A variance is authorized only for height, area,
size of structure or size of yards and open spaces, and off-street parking
and loading requirements. Establishment or expansion of a use otherwise
prohibited shall not be allowed by variance nor shall a variance be granted
because of the presence of non-conformities in the zoning district or
classification or in adjoining zoning districts or classifications.



      (1)   Use variance. The establishment or expansion of a use
otherwise prohibited in the zoning district may be permitted by variance
provided that the characteristics of the site (for example, the presence of
jurisdictional wetlands, environmentally-sensitive lands) or other
pre-existing uses on the site or adjacent thereto would serve to preclude the
development of the property within the permitted uses allowed in the
applicable zoning district.



   Applicants for use variances shall submit with their application, a
statement from a Florida registered engineer explaining the unique
circumstances of the site which would preclude alternate development within
the permitted uses of the zoning district.



(Ord. No. 03-1-4, § 1, 1-28-03)



   (c)   Application. Any person applying for a building permit found
to be in non-conformance to the city zoning code may apply for a variance
from the existing zoning regulations of the city if found to be in accordance
with subsection (b) above, and the procedures for requesting a variance which
are set forth as follows:



      (1)   Clear architectural plans and site plan shall be
submitted, prior to variance application, to the building department, in such
detail that all required variances to the city code may be determined by city
staff.



      (2)   The building department shall issue to the applicant in
writing a letter indicating:



         a.   Administrative denial of application for a building
permit;



         b.   That the city has received plans in such detail as
to enable determination of all required variances to specific sections of the
city code;



         c.   A specific list of variances required in order for
the plans to be in complete compliance with the city code.



      (3)   Filing of variance application shall be in duplicate, on
forms to be supplied by the city, with the city clerk. The application must
be accompanied by the letter required in subsection (2) above, and shall

         a.   Name of applicant;



         b.   Applicant’s relation to the property involved;



         c.   The legal description of the property;



         d.   The variance(s) from existing regulations requested;



         e.   The hardship for requesting the variance(s).



         f.   A copy of the administrative denial from the
building department.



      (4)   Each application for a variance shall be accompanied by
a fee in the sum of two hundred fifty dollars ($250.00), payable to the
city.  Said fee shall be nonrefundable, provided, however, the city
commission shall have the authority to direct the refunding of said fee in
their sole and exclusive discretion.



   (d)   Scheduling of public hearings. Upon receipt of the application
the city clerk shall docket same for a public hearing to be held for review
and recommendation by the planning and zoning board at the next regular
meeting of the planning and zoning board, which shall be at least twenty-five
(25) days subsequent to the date of the filing of the application. The city
clerk shall docket same for a public hearing to be held by the city
commission at the next regular or special meeting of the city commission,
which shall be at least twenty-five (25) days subsequent to the date of the
filing of the recommendation by the planning and zoning board.



   (e)   Notification.



      (1)   Notice of each meeting shall be published by the city
clerk in a newspaper of general circulation in the city, which notice shall
be published once, with the dates of the respective meetings.



      (2)   The city clerk shall send notice of the aforesaid
planning and zoning board meeting and city commission public hearing by first
class United States mail to each owner of real property located within three
hundred (300) feet of the property on which the variance is requested. Notice
of said meetings shall also be sent, via certified mail, to the petitioner.



      (3)   Notice of each public hearing shall be posted in a
conspicuous place in the city hall at least fifteen (15) days prior to the
date of the hearing.



   (f)   Planning and zoning board action. The planning and zoning
board shall consider the application for the variance at the meeting docketed
by the city clerk, and may recommend approval of the variance as requested,
recommend approval as amended, recommend disapproval or table the variance.



   (g)   City commission action.  The city commission shall consider
the application for the variance at the hearing docketed by the city clerk,
and the approval of the variance as requested or as amended by the commission
shall only be on the affirmative vote of at least three (3) members of the
commission.



   (h)   Expiration of approval. Any variance authorized by the city
commission shall expire ninety (90) days after the date of action on the
variance by the city commission unless building permit, based upon and
incorporating the variance, is issued within the aforementioned ninety (90)
day period.



   (i)   Reapplication. Upon rejection by the city commission of any
application for a change, exception, and/or variance in existing zoning
ordinances and regulations as same affects a specific lot, piece or parcel of
land in the city, a period of not less than twelve (12) months shall elapse
before the city commission will accept other, further, or new applications
for the same change, exception, and/or variance, regardless of the identity
of the petitioner.



(Ord. 95-4-2, § 1, 4-11-95)



Sec. 23-154. Additional fees for rezonings and variances.



   In addition to all other fees required in connection with an
application for a zoning change or an application for a granting of a
variance, the applicant shall pay unto the city the actual cost incurred by
the city in the completion of the ownership search of adjacent property
owners who are required to receive notification of the application, the cost
of publication of the notice and the cost of mailing and duplicating the
notice. The city shall upon a determination of the exact cost as aforesaid
forthwith notify the applicant of the costs incurred or to be incurred as
hereinabove set forth and may defer any further action upon the application
for rezoning or for a variance until the aforesaid costs have been paid in
full, which costs shall be determined to be a part of the application fee,
and in addition to any amount otherwise required. The city may, as a
condition precedent to taking any action on the application, require the
posting of a deposit in an amount estimated by the city to be the costs to be
incurred as aforesaid. All funds received hereunder shall be receipted and
deposited in the same manner as the application fee heretofore required on
the applications for rezoning and/or granting of variances.



Sec. 23-155. Construction permits.



   (a)   The issuance or granting of a permit or approval of plans and
specifications shall not be deemed or construed to be a permit for or an
approval of any violations of any of the provisions of this chapter. No
permit presuming to give authority to violate or cancel the provisions of
this chapter shall be valid except insofar as the work or use which it
authorizes is legal.



   (b)   The issuance of permit upon plans and specifications shall not
prevent the building official from thereafter requiring the correction of
errors in the plans and specifications, or preventing building operations
being carried on thereunder when in violation of this chapter.



Sec. 23-156. Nonconforming provisions.



   (a)   Applicability. This section shall control land uses, buildings
or other structures that were legally established but do not currently
conform to the provisions of this chapter as the result of the enactment of
this chapter, its predecessor, or subsequent amendment thereof.



   (b)   Nonconforming use of buildings.  The lawful use of a building
may be continued although such use does not conform to the provisions of this
chapter.  Such use may be extended throughout the building, provided no
structural alterations except those required by law or ordinance, or ordered
by an authorized officer to ensure the safety of the building, are made
therein. No such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such
building. If such nonconforming building is removed, or the nonconforming use
of such building is discontinued for a continued period of ninety (90) days,
every future use of such premises shall be in conformity with the provisions
of this chapter.



   (c)   Change of nonconforming use of buildings. If no structural
alterations are made, a nonconforming use of a building may be changed to a
use of the same or higher classification. For the purposes of this provision,
the zoning districts shall be considered arranged in a hierarchy from the
highest, or most restrictive (A-1), to the lowest, or least restrictive
(I-1), as shown in section 23-1, districts established, and uses shall be
classified according to the highest zoning district in which they are
permitted by right. When a district shall hereafter be changed, the then
existing nonconforming use in such changed district may be continued or
changed to a use of similar or higher classification, provided all other
regulations governing the new use are complied with. Whenever a nonconforming
use of a building has been discontinued or changed to a higher
classification, or to a conforming use, such use shall not thereafter be
changed to a nonconforming use of a lower classification.



   (d)     Nonconforming use of land. The lawful use of land although
such use does not conform to the provisions of this chapter, may be
continued, provided, however, that no such nonconforming use shall be
enlarged or increased, nor shall any nonconforming use be extended to occupy
a greater area of land than that occupied by such use on the date such use
became nonconforming. If such nonconforming use is discontinued for a
continuous period of ninety (90) days, any future use of the land shall be in
conformity with the provisions of this chapter. Where such use of land is not
an accessory to the use of a main building located on the same lot or
grounds, such nonconforming use of land shall be discontinued and all
material completely removed by its owner not later than two (2) years from
the date on which the use became nonconforming.



   (e)   Noncomplying structures.  The use of a building or other
structure lawfully constructed, although not currently conforming to the
provisions of this chapter, may be continued and may be enlarged or converted
to another use, provided that no enlargement or conversion shall be made that
would either create a new noncompliance or increase the degree of
noncompliance.



   (f)   Building destroyed. In the event that a noncomplying building
or a building occupied by a nonconforming use is damaged or destroyed to the
extent of not more than fifty (50) percent of its replacement value by fire,
explosion or other casualty, or act of God, or the public enemy, the building
may be reconstructed and the previous use restored, provided that the
reconstruction does not increase the degree of noncompliance that existed at
the time of such partial destruction. In the event that such a building is
damaged or destroyed to the extent of more than fifty (50) percent of its
replacement value by involuntary means, such building shall be reconstructed
and used only in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.



Sec. 23-157. Reasonable accommodation procedure.



(Ord. 14-2-4, § 4, 2-25-14)



   (a)   Purpose and applicability. This section implements the policy
of the City of Cooper City for processing of requests for reasonable
accommodation to its ordinances, rules, policies, and procedures for persons
with disabilities as provided by the federal Fair Housing Amendments Act (42
U.S.C. 3601, et seq.) (“FHA”) and Title II of the Americans with
Disabilities Act (42 U.S.C. Section 12131 et seq.) (“ADA”). For purposes
of this section, a “disabled” individual or person is an individual that
qualifies as disabled and/or handicapped under the FHA and/or ADA. Any person
who is disabled (or an applicant applying on behalf of one or more qualified
individuals) may request a reasonable accommodation with respect to the
City’s land use or zoning laws, rules, policies, practices or procedures as
provided by the FHA and the ADA pursuant to the procedures set out in this
section.



   (b)   Application. An applicant shall request relief under this
section prior to filing a lawsuit, by completing a reasonable accommodation
request form, which is available from the City’s Growth Management
Department. The form shall contain such questions and requests for
information as are necessary for evaluating the relief requested.



   (c)   Notice. The City shall display a notice of the request for
reasonable accommodation on the City’s public notice bulletin board and
shall maintain copies available for review in the Growth Management
Department and the City Clerk’s Office. The notice shall advise the public
that a request for reasonable accommodation is pending. The location, date
and time of the applicable public hearing shall be included in the notice.



   (d)   Application and hearing. The City Manager shall have the
authority to consider and act on requests for reasonable accommodation
submitted to the Growth Management Department. A public hearing shall be held
by the City Manager on the request for reasonable accommodation within
forty-five (45) days of receipt of a completed application, unless the
applicant agrees in writing to extension of the hearing date. A final written
determination shall be issued by the City Manager no later than thirty (30)
days after the conclusion of the public hearing. The final written
determination may: (i) grant the relief requested, (ii) grant a portion of
the request and deny a portion of the request, or impose conditions upon the
grant of the request, or (iii) deny the request. Any determination shall be
final, in writing, and shall state the reasons for the decision. The final
written determination shall be sent to the applicant by certified mail,
return receipt requested.



   (e)     Additional information. If necessary, prior to the public
hearing, the City may request additional information from the applicant,
specifying in sufficient detail what information is required. In the event a
request for additional information is made to the applicant by the City, the
hearing shall be conducted within 30 days after the applicant’s provision
of the additional information requested. The applicant shall have fifteen
(15) days after the date the information is requested to provide the
additional information. If the applicant fails to timely respond with the
requested additional information, the City shall notify the applicant and
proceed with scheduling a public hearing; however, the applicant and the City
may extend the time period for conducting the hearing by mutual agreement. 
The City Manager will issue a final written determination regarding the
relief requested as required in subsection (d) of this section, based on the
information in the City’s possession at the time of the public hearing.



   (f)   Criteria. In determining whether the reasonable accommodation
request shall be granted or denied, the applicant shall be required to
establish that the request is reasonable and necessary to afford handicapped
or disabled persons an equal opportunity to use and enjoy housing, by first
establishing that the persons to receive the benefit from the request are
handicapped or disabled, as defined in the FHA and/or ADA.  Although the
definition of disability is subject to judicial interpretation, for purposes
of this subsection, the applicant must show that the disability involves:



      (i)   A physical or mental impairment which substantially
limits 1 or more major life activities;



      (ii)   A record of having such impairment; or



      (iii)   That they are regarded as having such impairment.



   Next, the applicant shall be required to demonstrate that the proposed
accommodation being sought is reasonable and necessary to afford handicapped
or disabled persons equal opportunity to use and enjoy housing. The foregoing
(as interpreted by the courts) shall be the basis for a decision of the City
Manager upon a reasonable accommodation request.



   (g)   Exhaustion required. Completion of the reasonable
accommodation procedures shall be a supplement to and not a substitute for
any other pre-litigation dispute resolution processes available by law to the
City or the applicant. Completion of the reasonable accommodation procedures
shall constitute the exhaustion of all administrative remedies available from
the City.



   (h)   Effect while pending. While an application for reasonable
accommodation or appeal of a determination of same is pending before the
City, the City will not enforce the Code, rules, policies, and procedures
which are the subject of the request against the applicant, except that the
City may seek relief through the code enforcement procedures of Article VI
“Code Enforcement” of Chapter 13 “Public Safety” of the Code of
Ordinances, or through injunctive relief if an imminent threat to the health,
safety and welfare of the public is present.



   (i)   Appeals. An applicant aggrieved by a decision of the City
Manager on a request for reasonable accommodation may appeal the decision to
the City Commission in accordance with the following procedures:



      (1)   The denial or other disputed determination of a request
for reasonable accommodation pursuant to this section may be appealed to the
City Commission by filing a notice of appeal, on a form provided by the City
Manager, within 30 days of the date of the issuance of the final written
determination by the City Manager in accordance with subsection (d).



      (2)   After receipt of the notice of appeal, the appeal will
be placed on a City Commission agenda for a hearing within 60 days, with
public notice provided as required by subsection (c). At the hearing, the
applicant may present evidence and testimony relating to the issues appealed,
and the standard of review for such appeal shall be de novo.



      (3)    At the hearing, the City Commission shall grant the
appeal, deny the appeal or grant the appeal subject to conditions.



   (j)   Additional provisions for reasonable accommodation. The
following provisions shall be applicable:



      (1)   The City shall display a notice in its public notice
bulletin board and on its website advising the public of this reasonable
accommodation procedure and that applications for reasonable accommodation
may be obtained from the Growth Management Department.



      (2)    An applicant may apply for reasonable accommodation on
his or her own behalf, or may be represented at all stages by a
representative designated by the applicant.



      (3)    The City shall provide such assistance and
accommodation as is required pursuant to federal and state law, in connection
with a disabled person’s request for reasonable accommodation, including,
without limitation, assistance with reading application questions, responding
to questions, completing the form, filing an appeal, and appearing at a
hearing, etc., to ensure that the process is accessible.

ARTICLE I. GENERAL PROVISIONS



Sec. 24-1. Statement of purpose.



   (a)   The purpose of this chapter is to enumerate certain
development requirements and to assist in expediting the administrative
review of applications for development in the city. In order for an applicant
to adjust proposed development plans to applicable ordinances and conditions,
prior to the submission of extensive technical engineering data, the review
of development submissions shall generally be in two (2) separate stages with
an optional review of the site's concept prior to the first required stage.



   (b)   The first required review (preliminary site development or
plat plan review) shall consist of reviewing the overall physical layout,
without technical engineering information, by staff and the planning and
zoning board and the city commission.



   (c)   The second stage shall follow staff and planning and zoning
board review of the preliminary plan. The applicant shall submit final
development plans technically describing all related on-site and off-site
information for review by the staff and by the planning and zoning board and
subsequent action by the city commission. In the case where a plat is
submitted, the applicant shall submit comments from the county development
review committee. Furthermore, during this second stage, the development
review criteria established by the city commission shall be applied to the
project. If the criteria is not met or cannot be met in the opinion of the
commission after consideration of the recommendation of the planning and
zoning board and staff, the project shall be denied.



   (d)   As an option prior to the first stage, applicants wishing to
determine the feasibility of a proposed project may submit a concept site
plan for discussion with staff.



Sec. 24-2. Applicability and exemptions.



   (a)   Permit issuance conditioned. No application for development
permit required or authorized by the chapter 23, zoning districts, this land
development code or the South Florida building code for the development of
land within the city shall be reviewed or development permit issued except in
compliance with the requirements and procedures set forth in this chapter.



   (b)   Subdivision approval required.



      (1)   No structure shall hereafter be erected within the city
limits without it being erected upon a lot shown on a plat, which plat, has
been duly accepted and approved by the city commission and duly recorded in
the public records of Broward County, Florida. The city commission may, in
cases of extenuating circumstances, waive the aforesaid requirement.



      (2)   The owners of lots or parcels of land within the
corporate limits of the city as now defined or as may hereafter be defined
who shall subdivide or lay out such lots or grounds into a subdivision shall
as a condition precedent to the official acceptance and approval by the city
commission, of a plat of such subdivision, first fully perform and comply
with the regulations and requirements of this chapter.



      (3)   Where platting regulations as set forth in this land
development code are not entirely comprehensive and inclusive, then in that
event, the platting regulations of Broward County shall control, where not in
conflict with the platting regulations contained herein.



   (c)   Site development plan approval required. All development
within the city shall obtain site development plan approval in accordance
with the provisions of this section, unless exempted by the provision of
section 24-2(d), exemptions.



   (d)   Exemptions. The following developments are exempt from review
but a building permit is required:



      (1)   One single-family or one duplex residence on a platted
lot;



      (2)   A change to the interior or exterior of an existing
structure where no additional parking will be required and does not affect
the overall site;



      (3)   The erection of a fence, pool, or accessory structure in
a single-family zoning district;



      (4)   The temporary placement of construction material,
trailers, or fences during the construction of a parcel of land.



      (5)   Clearing and grubbing of land.



      (6)   Agricultural use of land.



   (e)   Compliance with county and state requirements. Subdividers,
builders, and/or developers shall also be required to conform with all county
and state requirements not included herein and not in conflict with this land
development code.



Sec. 24-3. Representations.



   (a)   For the purposes of this section, the term "representation"
shall include but not be limited to plans submitted, graphic renderings,
building materials and selections, required supplementary documents, and
verbal representations reduced to writing made by a developer to the city
commission in seeking issuance of a development order.



   (b)   All verbal representations made by a developer to the city
commission in seeking issuance of a development order shall be reduced to
writing by the developer.



   (c)   All representations and supportive documentation submitted by
a developer shall be made a part of the development order, prior to issuance
of same.



   (d)   Developments constructed must conform to all representations
made by a developer prior to the city commission granting a development
order, and it shall be no defense to this section that said representation
exceeded code requirements relative to a particular development and in effect
at the time of issuance of a development order. Should a deviation from a
development order be requested, same must be approved by commission pursuant
to those procedures set forth in this chapter.



   (e)   The city may issue stop work orders, refuse to issue
certificates of occupancy or building permits should it be determined that a
development is proposed or has been constructed to any extent in either
nonconformity with representations affixed or contained within a development
order and without the developer obtaining approval for such deviation, or
verbal representations were not properly reduced to written form.



Sec. 24-4. Boards and officials in the development review process.



   The roles and responsibilities of boards and officials in the
development review process shall be as follows.

authority for the issuance of a development permit relating to plats, site
plans, and changes in zoning on platted or unplatted land.



   (b)   Planning and zoning board. The planning and zoning board is
the advisory board to the city commission which receives reports assessing
the adequacy of services for proposed developments, reviews these reports,
and makes recommendations to the city commission for development permit
approval.

responsible for obtaining and coordinating staff and engineer reviews as to
the availability of services for a proposed development prior to the issuance
of a development permit.



   (f)   Chief building official. The chief building official has staff
responsibility for determining that the availability of services has been
reviewed and is in conformance with this code and applicable regulations of
the county's land development code, ordinance no. 81-16, as may be amended,
and for the issuance of building permits, after determining the project has a
valid development order.



Sec. 24-5. Non-binding effect of staff decisions.



   An action taken or comment made by the city manager or any city
employee regarding a development for which approval by the city commission is
required is not binding on the city commission in its review of the
application for a development permit; nor does it carry with it any right to
approval of the development permit application.



Sec. 24-6. Presumption of maximum impact.



   (a)   For the purpose of implementing this chapter, a proposed
development shall be presumed to have the maximum impact permitted under
applicable land development regulations such as zoning regulations and the
land use element of the city comprehensive plan or under applicable deed
restrictions.



   (b)   If a site plan is presented when a proposed plat or rezoning
application is submitted, it may be used as the basis to assess the maximum
impact of the development. If an application for a building permit is
submitted which, in the opinion of the chief building official provides for
more intensive uses than those indicated on the site plan, the application
will be referred to the city commission for reassessment



Sec. 24-7. Development order.



   Upon city commission approval of an application, the city shall include
in the resolution special conditions of approval, time limits for completing

   Except where specifically provided otherwise in the city code,
preliminary site development plans for parcels not previously platted and
recorded shall be accompanied by a preliminary plat before the planning and
zoning board. The final site plan shall be accompanied by a final plat
through the planning and zoning board and the city commission. Except where
otherwise required within the county land use plan or the city land use plan,
there is no requirement for platting of property owned by the city upon which
construction or improvements will be performed.

ARTICLE II. PLAT REVIEW PROCEDURES



Sec. 24-20. Review Procedures.



   (a)   Subdivision sketch plat.



      (1)   Subdividers shall review with the planning and zoning
board subdivision sketch plats further described in section 24-21, sketch
plat submittal requirements.



      (2)   Such sketch plats will be considered as submitted for
informal discussion between the subdivider and the planning and zoning board.
Submission of a sketch plat shall not constitute formal filing of a plat;
however, a copy of same should be submitted to the engineer for review.



      (3)   As far as may be practicable on the basis of a sketch
plat, the planning and zoning board will informally advise the subdivider as
promptly as possible of the extent to which the proposed subdivision conforms
to the design standards of the subdivision and the planning program and will
discuss possible plat modifications necessary to secure conformance.



   (b)   Preliminary and final plat. Preliminary plats and final plats
shall be reviewed in accordance with the following procedures.



      (1)   Consideration by the planning and zoning board. The
planning and zoning board, in studying the preliminary plat, will take into
consideration the requirements of the community and the best use of the land
being subdivided. Particular attention will be given to width, arrangement
and location of streets, surface drainage and lot size, as well as
requirements for parks, playfields, playgrounds, school sites, parkways and
highways, ample buffers between varying zoning classifications, and
compliance with the city's beautification standards. Adequate street
connections will be required to ensure free access to and circulation for
adjoining subdivisions and land.



      (2)   Consistency of final and preliminary plats. The final
plat must conform in all important respects with the preliminary plat as
previously reviewed and approved by the council and shall incorporate
modifications and revisions specified by the council as in its conditional
approval of the preliminary plat.



      (3)   Conformance to regulations. The final plat and
supportive data shall comply with the provisions of these regulations and
applicable statutes and ordinances. Failure to do so shall be cause for
rejecting the plat, unless the commission should waive compliance in specific
instances which are not considered necessary or essential by the commission.



      (4)   Commission consideration. Consideration of the final
plat or site plan including supportive data and staff reports, shall be made
by the commission within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the tentative report
from the planning and zoning board. The commission may, at this time, adopt
on first reading the ordinance granting a development permit on the subject
plans.



      (5)   Completion of construction required; surety. No site
plan or plat containing any dedication of public roads, utilities, drainage
facilities, streets, alleys, canals, ditches or other public facilities
within easements or rights-of-way in the city shall be deemed accepted until
and unless all construction including dredging or filling and erection of
structures, or surety guaranteeing such completion, in an amount to be
approved by the city commission, shall have been posted by the owner or
owners of the land included in any such site plan or plat. The city
commission shall approve the sureties and the terms and conditions of such
surety. In certain instances the city commission may waive such surety until
the site plan or plat has been reviewed by the county; however, such surety
is mandated prior to recordation of any site plan, plat or dedication.



Sec. 24-21. Sketch plat submittal requirements.



   (a)   A sketch plat may be submitted by the developer as a basis for

Sec. 24-63. Substantive conformance to standards.



   The requirements for development review findings by the city as a
prerequisite to the issuance of a development permit is found within section
5 of the implementation section of the Broward County land use plan, and
within the implementation section of the city's land use element of its
comprehensive plan. The following standards and criteria are intended to
implement those requirements:



   (a)   No application for a development permit may be approved unless
and until it is determined by the commission that the development review
requirements set forth below are met. However, except to the extent limited
below in stages of development prior to site plan approval, an application
for a development permit may be approved (at the option of the city) on the
condition that the developer agrees in writing that at the time of site plan
approval the following requirements are to be met.



   (b)   Plats and site plans may be processed simultaneously under the
regulations of the city. However, the commission realizes and acknowledges
that situations exist wherein a developer may choose to plat the property
prior to the property being site planned. In those instances, if development
review is conducted (at the option of the city), the maximum impact allowed
under the applicable zoning district shall be assumed for the property
subject to the plat. The developer should note that Broward County, during
plat review, may independently review development review criteria contained
herein. A finding by the city that such criteria have been satisfied is not
to be construed as a guarantee that Broward County will come to the same
conclusion.



Sec. 24-64. Criteria for approval.



   No site plan shall be approved by the city unless the city commission
finds that the application complies with the development review criteria set
forth in this section and other applicable city codes and ordinances. The
city commission may impose such conditions upon its approval of a site plan
which in their judgment will ensure compliance with the development review
criteria set forth in this section and other applicable city codes and
ordinances. A determination that adequate public facilities and services
shall be available to serve the needs of the proposed site development plan
and address the impacts of development shall be made in accordance with the
adequate public facilities regulations of the City and also shall be made
when the commission approves the reports, which indicate the following
findings:



   (a)   Potable water service. Potable water service shall be
available to serve the needs of the proposed development.



      (1)   A finding that potable water service is available shall
be based upon one of the following two (2) criteria:

obtained by the developer, finding that the water treatment plant has
sufficient capacity to provide the potable water needs of the proposed
development, other developments in the service area which are occupied,
available for occupancy, for which building permits are in effect, or for
which potable water treatment capacity has been reserved, or



         b.   A written statement from the utility department,
obtained by the developer, finding that potable water service is not
available but will be made available. A finding that potable water service
will be made available shall be based upon a demonstration by the utility
department that there is an economical and fiscally feasible plan to
construct or expand a water treatment facility which will have sufficient
capacity to provide for the potable water needs of the development proposed
by the application and for other developments in the service area, which are
occupied, or available for occupancy, for which building permits are in
effect, or for which potable water treatment capacity has been reserved.



      (2)   The city commission shall deny an application for a
development permit when it finds that potable water service is not available
and will not be made available. A finding that potable water service will not
be made available must be made in the absence of a certification by the city
engineer for utilities that there is an economical and fiscally feasible plan
to construct or expand a water treatment facility which will have sufficient
capacity to provide for the potable water needs of the development proposed
by the application and for other developments in the service area which are
occupied, available for occupancy, for which building permits are in effect,
or for which potable water treatment capacity has been reserved.



      (3)   All references to the availability of potable water
service include the water supply, treatment, distribution and transmission
system.



      (4)   A water development agreement shall be required to be
entered into with the entity to provide service therefor, and all fees
required therein shall be paid prior to requesting a building permit.



      (5)   In situations where plats are not processed with site
plans, a finding of availability of water at the time of plat approval shall
not be a guarantee by the city that there will be adequate potable water
service at the time of site plan consideration.



      (6)   The proposed development shall be designed to provide
adequate areas and easements which may be necessary for the installation and
maintenance of a potable water service transmission system which will meet
all applicable health and environmental regulations.

other items pertaining to potable water set forth in applicable governmental
regulations shall be required to be complied with.



   (b)   Wastewater service. Wastewater treatment and disposal service
shall be available to serve the needs of the proposed development.



      (1)   A finding that wastewater treatment and disposal service
is available shall be based upon one of the following two (2) criteria:



         a.   A written statement from the utility department,
obtained by the developer, finding that the wastewater treatment plant has
sufficient capacity to provide for the wastewater treatment needs of the
proposed development, other developments in the service area which are
occupied, available for occupancy, for which building permits are in effect,
or for which wastewater treatment and disposal capacity has been reserved, or



         b.   A written statement from the utility department,
obtained by the developer, finding that wastewater treatment and disposal
services are not available but will be made available. A finding that
wastewater treatment and disposal service will be made available shall be
based upon a demonstration by the utility department that there is an
economically and fiscally feasible plan to construct or expand a wastewater
treatment and disposal facility which will have sufficient capacity to
provide for the treatment and disposal needs of the development proposed by
the application and to other developments in the service area which are
occupied, available for occupancy for which building permits are in effect or
for which wastewater treatment or disposal capacity has been reserved.



      (2)   The city commission shall deny an application for a
development permit when it finds that wastewater treatment and disposal
services are not available and will not be made available. A finding that
wastewater treatment and disposal services will not be made available must be
made in the absence of a certification by the city engineer for utilities
that there is an economically and fiscally feasible plan to construct or
expand a wastewater treatment and disposal facility which will have
sufficient capacity to provide for the treatment and disposal needs of the
development proposed by the application and for other developments in the
service area which are occupied, available for occupancy, for which building
permits are in effect or for which wastewater treatment or disposal capacity
has been reserved.



      (3)   Furthermore, prior to the requesting of a building
permit, a developer must have entered into a wastewater development agreement
with the entity to provide service therefor. All fees required to be paid for
sewer contribution or other charges shall be paid prior to requesting a
building permit.



      (4)   In situations where a plat is to be processed prior to a
site plan, a finding that there is adequate wastewater treatment and disposal
services, shall not be a guarantee by the city that the services will be
available at the time of site plan review.



      (5)   The proposed development shall be designed to provide
adequate areas and easements which may be necessary for the installation and
maintenance of a wastewater disposal system which will meet all applicable
health and environmental regulations.



      (6)   The standards pertaining to wastewater discharge and
other items pertaining to wastewater set forth in article II of chapter 19 of
the city code as the same may be amended from time to time, shall be required
to be complied with.



   (c)   Fire protection service. Fire protection service shall be
adequate to protect people and property in the proposed development. The
proposed plat or site plan shall be consistent with the annual report on fire
protection prepared pursuant to section 22-93, fire protection, there shall
be adequate accessibility for fire apparatus to protect people and property
in the proposed development, and the plat or site plan shall comply with the
city code. The standards to be applied in this subsection shall be:



      (1)   Water supply. Water supply facilities either existing or
proposed to be constructed by the developer shall be adequate to meet the
fire protection needs and shall be installed prior to the issuance of any
building permit, other than for models, for the proposed development.



         a.   All existing and proposed developments shall have
available either a public or private fire protection water supply system. The
water supply, either temporary or permanent, shall be available as soon as
combustible material accumulates on the site of a development. The supply
shall include fire hydrants as shown on the approved final site plan. All
permanent fire protection water supply systems shall be functional prior to
the issuance of the final certificate of occupancy.



         b.   If a public water supply is not available and a
private system is determined to be used, based on the discretion of the fire
chief and city engineer, the fire protection water supply system shall comply
with the requirements of section 300-340 of the ISO Fire Suppression Rating
Schedule (edition 6-80), pages 4-7. The private water supply shall be

      (3)   The city commission shall deny an application for a
development permit when it finds that solid waste disposal service is not
available and will not be made available.



      (4)   The standard to be applied by the city commission in
determining whether solid waste disposal service shall be available is a
comparison of the projected construction period set forth by the developer in
a written document to be submitted to the city with its request for final
site plan approval or with its request for final plat approval, the developer
shall submit a contract with a franchise garbage company wherein the garbage
company agrees that it is bound to remove the solid waste generated by the
proposed development for a period of one year subsequent to the issuance of
the projected certificate of occupancy. Furthermore, the city shall review
data submitted by Broward County or any other entity licensed to operate a
disposal site concerning projected capacity at its site and if projected
capacity extends beyond the date that a certificate of occupancy is expected
for a particular portion of a proposed development, then the city shall not
deny approval of a development permit due to the inadequacy of solid waste
disposal sites.



   (i)   Drainage and flood protection. The standards to be applied for

      (3)   The city manager shall submit all traffic impact
statements prepared for development permits other than building permits to
the city commission for approval. This submittal to the city commission shall
be accompanied by an evaluation as to adequacy and technical sufficiency of
the traffic impact statement.



      (4)   Traffic impact statements prepared as a requirement for
issuance of a building permit shall be submitted to and approved by the city
manager prior to the issuance of a building permit. In review of a traffic
impact statement, the following shall be considered:



         a.   Existing traffic studies;



         b.   When available, the annual regional transportation
review program adopted by the county commission;



         c.   The traffic circulation element of the city
comprehensive plan.



      (5)   The city commission shall determine an acceptable level
of service for the regional transportation network until such time as the
county commission establishes a higher level of service. In establishing the
level of service, the city commission will consider:



         a.   Traffic safety;



         b.   Capital improvement and right-of-way costs;



         c.   Economic impact;



         d.   Environmental impact.



      (6)   The level of service to be maintained shall be level "C"
as defined in the Highway Capacity Manual. However, if there are unique or
special physical characteristics of the proposed development or the affected
road network that would allow a reduction of the level of service to occur
without unduly sacrificing public safety or energy efficiency, and such
characteristics do not generally apply to all developments or to the entire
regional transportation network, the city commission may determine that a
level of service "D" as defined in the Highway Capacity Manual would be
acceptable for certain specified links in the regional transportation network.



      (7)   If level of service "C" or "D" cannot be met, the city
commission may approve a site plan and plat subject to the developer entering
into an agreement or making impact fee payments satisfactory to Broward
County.



      (8)   Dedication of right-of-way for major roads. The
trafficways on the Broward County delineated trafficways plan approved by the
county commission and the roads shown on the adopted traffic circulation and
transportation element of the city comprehensive plan shall be conveyed to
the public by plat, deed or grant of easement, the manner of conveyance as
determined by the city. If there is a conveyance by easement, no required
parking shall occur in the easement and setbacks shall be measured from the
edge of the easement farthest from the center line of the road.



      (9)   Access to trafficways. A final site plan and plat of
lands which abut or contain existing or proposed trafficways shall be
designed to facilitate the safe and efficient movement of vehicles between
the trafficway and the proposed development and shall comply with the
following standards and requirements.



      (10)   Trafficways shall conform to the criteria and
characteristics established by and shown on the Broward County Trafficways
Plan.



      (11)   In order to expand intersections of two (2) major
trafficways to handle additional approach lane capacity, additional
right-of-way may be required to be provided consistent with the standards of
the typical intersection detail on file at the Broward County engineering
division.



      (12)   In order to provide for the installation of
traffic-control equipment, a chord shall be drawn at each intersection with
the trafficway and the area between the chord and the tangents of the
intersection street shall be dedicated or, if acceptable to the city, granted
by easement. Such required chord shall be based on the radius shown for the
particular intersection of the following table:



 

Street type
 
Radius in feet


Arterial
 
35


Collector
 
30


Local
 
25



 



      (13)   A collector should intersect a trafficway only if
aligned with an extending and existing collector which intersects the
trafficway or at a minimum distance of one thousand three hundred twenty
(1,320) feet from the intersection of an existing collector and the
trafficway.



      (14)   A local street should not intersect a trafficway unless
aligned with an extending and existing local street which intersects the
trafficway or at a minimum distance of eight hundred (800) feet from any
other intersection.



      (15)   The frontage width of a residential lot fronting on a
trafficway should not be less than three hundred (300) feet unless one of the
following conditions is met:



         a.   Access to the lot is limited to streets other than
trafficways;



         b.   Access to the lot is provided jointly with other
lots created as part of the same development or another development;



         c.   Access to the lot will be provided from a frontage
road paralleling the trafficway.



      (16)   If development abuts a trafficway corridor, a
non-vehicular ingress and egress easement or line may be required to be
granted along the property frontage except at those points of access not in
conflict with sound traffic engineering practices and principles.



      (17)   Local streets and roads shall provide safe, adequate
access between buildings within the proposed development and the regional
transportation network prior to occupancy. The standards to be applied in
this instance are those set forth within chapter 25, article VI, roads and
rights-of-way, as the same may be amended from time to time.



Sec. 24-65. Processing and evaluation.



   (a)   When the city evaluates the development review criteria for a
plat that is not processed simultaneously with a site plan for the same
project, or for any application for a development permit prior to site plan
consideration, a finding that the development review criteria set forth
herein has been satisfied shall not preclude the city from making a separate
and independent review for compliance with development review criteria at the
time of site plan review and subsequent stages of development.



   (b)   Furthermore, if eighteen (18) months or more has elapsed from
the time of final site plan approval or an approved final plat has not been
recorded within eighteen (18) months from the date of final subdivision
approval by the county commission, or work for which a permit is required has
not commenced within eighteen (18) months, then all approvals previously
granted by the city will be null and void.



   (c)   Any modification to the site plan that has been reviewed and
approved shall require a new finding by the commission that the development
review criteria have been satisfied. This procedure may be based upon the
findings already made or additional information may be required at the
discretion of the staff or the city commission.



   (d)   The director shall be responsible for providing a report to
the planning and zoning board prior to action being taken by that body on a
final site plan or a final plat (if the plat is not processed simultaneously
with the site plan) which report shall set forth each of the development
review criteria and set forth a recommendation as to whether the criteria
have been satisfied. If any of the criteria have not been satisfied, the
staff report shall set forth proposed conditions for approval, if any.



   (e)   The planning and zoning board shall hold a public hearing
concerning review of the final site plan and approved landscape plans.



   (f)   After review by the planning and zoning board, the director
shall be responsible to see that a proposed development order (which states
that each individual development review criteria has been satisfied, or if
not satisfied in the opinion of the staff and the planning and zoning board,
conditions for approval), shall be prepared and submitted to the city
commission before approval of the final site plan or plat, or both, is
considered.



   (g)   The action of the city commission concerning compliance with
development review criteria may be appealed only through the filing of a
petition for a writ of certiorari in the Circuit Court of Broward County
within the time period set for appeals within the Florida Appellate Rules of
Civil Procedure. (Ord. 11-3-1, §2, 3-8-11)



Sec. 24-66. Review by city commission.



   (a)   The city manager shall transmit the document outlined below to
the city commission for review. In no case shall the petition be placed on a
commission agenda for commission consideration until all necessary documents
have been submitted in acceptable form.



      (1)   Final site plan (if applicable);



      (2)   Final plat;



      (3)   All information submitted to the planning and zoning
board in section 24-61, required information;



      (4)   Recommendation from the planning and zoning board;



      (5)   Landscape plan approved by the Public Works Director or
his/her designee;



      (6)   All other related documents.



   (b)   If all of the preceding information required to be submitted
by the applicant is not submitted within six (6) months of the date of action
by the planning and zoning board to recommend approval, approval with
conditions, or denial of a final site development plan, the application shall
be considered null and void; and the applicant shall be required to refile
the final site development plan application with the planning and zoning
board and pay all applicable fees. This time period may be extended by the
city commission on a finding of hardship only if written application is made
prior to the expiration of the six (6) months and a fee set by resolution of
the city commission is paid.



   (c)   The commission shall hold a public hearing on the request for
a development order permit on a final site development plan and take final
action on the resolution granting or denying a development order permit. The
petitioner shall be notified of the hearing by the city clerk.



   (d)   If the commission grants a development order permit on the
proposed site plan, the city clerk shall forward a copy of the final revised
plan and development permit to the building department. (Ord. 11-3-1, §2,
3-8-11)



   (e)   Site development plan approval by the city commission. Site
plan approval means that the city has made good faith effort to see that all
city requirements in effect at the time of approval have been satisfied.
However, it is not and should not be construed to be a guarantee that all
requirements actually have been met. If a violation of an ordinance appears
on an approved site plan, the city staff shall see that the ordinance is
enforced. The developer shall make any changes necessary to comply with
applicable regulations. Site plan approval shall exempt a project from the
terms of regulations affecting development enacted after the date of the site
plans approval if construction commences prior to the expiration of the
period of site plan approval.



   (f)   The city commission shall deny a proposed site plan if any
development review criteria is not satisfied, or if any ordinance or other
regulation is violated by any portion of the proposed site plan. (Ord.
11-3-1, §2, 3-8-11)



Sec. 24-67. Site plan revisions.



   (a)   Where a site plan has been previously approved by the city
commission and is proposed by the applicant or city to be revised in any
manner, a revised site plan shall be submitted to the city.



   (b)   The revised site plan submission shall consist of the
previously approved site plan signed by the Mayor and a separate drawing
showing the desired changes and any other drawings or information as may be
required by staff.



   (c)   The plan will be reviewed by staff and by the planning and
zoning board, who shall evaluate the proposed revision, and current
development regulations. The planning and zoning board shall then recommend
approval, approval with conditions, or denial to the city commission. The
commission shall issue a revised development order to approve, approve with
conditions, or deny the revised, site plan by development order.



   Rev. Suppl. No. 13 (October, 2011)



Sec. 24-68. Expiration of final site development plans.



   (a)   All final site development plans shall expire eighteen (18)
months after the date of approval by the city commission unless construction
has commenced, as evidenced by the issuance of a building permit. Following
the city commission's review and approval of the final site development plan,
for either the complete project or for an approved phase of such project,
there shall be an eighteen (18) month limit in which the developer shall take
out the first engineering or building permits. Computation of the eighteen
(18) months for final site development plans approved with conditions shall
begin on the date the commission approves the final site development plan.
Failure to take out the first building or engineering permit within the time
limit shall automatically cause the final site development plan to become
null and void. If an applicant seeks to revise a site development plan
subsequent to final site development plan approval, the 18-month period
during which permits shall be taken out shall be computed from the date of
the initial final site plan approval unless otherwise determined by
commission.



   (b)   All site development plans approved prior to the effective
date of this section shall expire eighteen (18) months from the date of final
adoption of this section unless construction has commenced, as evidenced by
the issuance of a building permit.



   (c)   As part of the review of the final site plan, the city
commission may condition any site plan approval by reducing or
increasing the time period set forth in this section.



Sec. 24-69. Issuance of building permits.



   (a)   A building permit may be issued by the chief building official
after a determination has been made that the project was granted a
development order by the city commission.



   (b)   Prior to the issuance of a building permit, the chief building
official shall confirm that each person designated in this section to review
building permits has signed the building permit application. Such signature
shall constitute a finding that the application is consistent with applicable
review requirements.



   (c)   The chief building official shall be responsible, before
issuing any new permits, for verifying that the applications for such permits
are for construction and development according to the approved site
development plan, and the chief building official shall see that either the
approved site plan time limit has not expired or that the city commission has
granted an extension of time. No permit of any nature shall be issued for
development which is inconsistent.



Sec. 24-70. Nonconformities associated with the expansion of state roads
within the city.



   (a)   Within the city along Griffin Road are properties which, but
for the qualified variations authorized by this section, may be nonconforming
after the additional right-of-way is acquired by the department of
transportation for the planned expansion of Griffin Road within the city by
reason of the resulting parcel no longer meeting otherwise applicable
setback, off-street parking, landscaping, signage and other regulations. As
set forth in section 21-20 of this code, the continuance of nonconforming
uses and structures is discouraged by regulations which may limit the time
period when nonconforming structures may be used, provide time periods upon
which nonconforming uses must stop or expire, and which preclude
nonconforming structure or use expansion. The city commission legislatively
determines that it is in the public's interest, particularly with respect to
encouraging economic revitalization of property within the city, to create
authorized, qualified variations to the city land development regulations
which could be issued so that land utilized in accordance with such
variations (and which would otherwise be nonconforming) would not be
classified as nonconforming, or would have nonconformities minimized. Any
variations granted pursuant to this section shall be described in a
certificate of conformity.



   (b)   A structure or lot that is rendered or will be rendered
nonconforming in a particular respect because of eminent domain proceedings
initiated by the department of transportation, or the sale or conveyance of a
parcel of land under the threat of or in contemplation of eminent domain
proceedings or planned state road expansion, shall be considered conforming
in such respect through the acceptance of a certificate of conformity
pursuant to the terms of this section and through the completion of
redevelopment in accordance with the certificate of conformity.



   (c)   Application.



      (1)   Submission of application. The department of
transportation or property owner may submit an application requesting a
certificate of conformity to the city planner. Review of the application
shall be conducted pursuant to the city's development review process as set
forth in chapter 24 of this code.



      (2)   Contents of application. The application is a public
record and shall include the following:



         a.   An acceptable legal description and sketch of the
property which will (or has) become owned by the department of transportation
for state road right-of-way; and



         b.   An acceptable legal description and sketch of the
remainder of the building site property.



         c.   A site plan of the building site, at a scale of not
less than one inch (1") equals thirty feet (30'), showing the existing
location of all structures and improvements (including landscaping and
parking areas) on both the property which will (or has) become owned by the
department of transportation for state road right-of-way expansion, and on
the balance of the building site property to remain (or remaining) titled in
the property owner (the "remaining property");



         d.   A site plan proposed for the remaining property at
a scale of not less than one inch (1") equals thirty feet (30'), showing the
location of all structures and improvements proposed for the remaining
property (including landscape areas and parking);



         e.   The name and mailing address of the owner of the
remaining property and such owners's authorized representative, and the name
and address of lessees of the remaining property and business owners in
possession of any portion thereof;



         f.   The name and mailing address of the department of
transportation's authorized representative;



         g.   An explanation of why the certificate of conformity
should be granted;



         h.   Proof that notification of the application has been
provided to the other party (department of transportation or property owner,
whichever is relevant); and



         i.   Any other information the city reasonable
determines is necessary to evaluate the application (including but not
limited to disclosure of estimated or paid costs to cure);



         j.   When the department of transportation files an
application, the application must contain a certification that the department
made a good faith effort to discuss the application with the property owner
prior to making the application with the city.



         k.   Applicable review fees, as set forth in section
24-6 of this code.



         l.   A letter of approval from the Central Broward Water
Control District.



      (3)   Determination of sufficiency. The city planner shall
determine if the application is complete within ten (10) working days:



         a.   If the city planner determines the application is
not complete, a written notice shall be mailed to the applicant specifying
the deficiencies. No further action shall be taken on the application until
the deficiencies are remedied. If the deficiencies are not remedied within
twenty (20) working days of the date of the city planner's letter, the
application shall be considered withdrawn.



         b.   If the application is determined complete, the city
planner shall notify the applicant, in writing, that the application is ready
for review pursuant to the procedures and standards of this code.



      (4)   Review by the planning and zoning board. Within twenty
(20) working days after the application is determined complete, or as soon as
possible thereafter, the planning and zoning board shall review the
application and recommend approval or denial of the application based on the
substantive standards established in this section. The planning and zoning
board may attach conditions to its recommended approval.



         a.   Notice of the board meeting shall be mailed by
first class mail to the property owner, the department of transportation and
the owners of each property within one hundred (100) feet of the affected
property which fronts on (or is situate to) the same side of the state road
as the affected property as their names and addresses are disclosed by the
most recent county ad valorem real property tax roll. Notice of the board
meeting will also be directed by first class mail to the lessees and any
business owners in possession of property as described in the application.
This notice shall be placed in the mail at least fourteen (14) calendar days
before the meeting.



      (5)   After board review, the plan and board recommendations
may be considered by the city commission.



         a.   If the department of transportation and property
owner agree on a plan which has been recommended for approval, the item shall
be agendized as a quasi-judicial commission agenda item. If the department of
transportation and property owner are not in agreement the matter will not be
placed on the city commission quasi-judicial agenda.



         b.   The city commission shall review the application in
accordance with this section an all other applicable standards and criteria
in this code pertaining to site plan or city variance approval.



         c.   Notice of the city commission meeting shall be
given by first class mail to the subject property owner, the department of
transportation, and the owners of adjacent property within one hundred (100)
feet of the property for which the application is sought as their names and
addresses are disclosed by the most recent county ad valorem real property
tax roll. Notice shall also be given to the lessees and business owners
possessing any portion of the property as their names and addresses appear on
the application. This notice shall be placed in the mail at least fourteen
(14) calendar days before the meeting. The agenda for the city commission
meeting will be posted at city hall at least seven (7) business days in
advance of the date of the meeting.



         d.   The city commission shall review the matter as a
quasi-judicial item in accordance with the city commission's full
administrative rules for same.



   (d)   Approving site plan modifications.



      (1)   Available development orders. The planning and zoning
board may recommend the following variations to the city's land development
regulations, which may be approved or rejected by the city commission;



         a.   The width of the Griffin Road right-of-way building
setback (regardless of whether such setback is the front, side or rear of
such building) can be reduced to not less than fifty (50) feet measured from
the right-of-way line of Griffin Road, plus additional right-of-way as shown
on Florida department of transportation right-of-way plans at locations of
turn lanes and expanded intersections.



         b.   The width of landscape buffers provided adjacent to
Griffin Road right-of-way on the remaining property can be reduced to not
less than ten (10) feet excluding access points. Except for the foregoing
sentence's ten (10) foot landscape buffer requirement, other landscape
requirements may be reduced to the extent of landscaping existing within that
area acquired by the department of transportation. There will be no net loss
of any landscaping on the remaining property (the ten (10) foot buffer strip
may be credited against any landscaping which may need to be removed on the
remaining property as a result of parking reconfiguration, or other side
improvements), in accordance with the city's tree preservation regulations.



         c.   Signs. Any existing legally established
free-standing sign that is located within the property included in the
eminent domain action may be relocated on site subject to the standards of
this section and the following criteria:



            1.   Sign number and size. Any sign(s) to be
relocated shall comply with the height, size (face area) and maximum number
of signs allowed requirements of the code.



            2.   Sign relocation. In no event shall the front
setback be less than five (5) feet from the ultimate right-of-way and have
less than a five (5) foot side setback, except upon receipt of a sign
relocation permit.



            3.   A sign relocation permit may be issued,
provided the applicant can meet the following standards:



               (i)   The sign relocation in accordance with
this section, would create additional loss in the number of required parking
spaces.



               (ii)   The proposed sign location does not
encroach into the right-of-way, unless it is part of a negotiated settlement
with the department of transportation;



               (iii)   There is no other location on the
subject property to place the sign consistent with safe vehicular use area
design.



         d.   1.   The amount of off-street parking, on-site,
after the property acquisition may be reduced by:



               (i)   Twenty (20) percent of the parking
requirement set forth in this code (except where the parking requirement has
already been reduced by virtue of a variance or grandfather provision); or



               (ii)   Ten (10) percent of the actual spaces
existing on the property before the property acquisition; or



               (iii)   Twenty-five (25) percent of the
actual spaces existing on the property before the property acquisition, for
building sites adjacent to Griffin Road; provided, however, that the building
setbacks on the remaining property area a minimum of fifty (50) feet from the
Griffin Road right-of-way line and such front street setback site
configuration includes 90o front parking adjacent to the structures, and a
two-way driveway parallel to Griffin Road, and the five (5) foot landscape
buffer.



            2.   Any reduction in parking pursuant to this
paragraph shall not justify an increase in gross square feet of the building
area.



            3.   For purposes of this paragraph d, "the actual
spaces existing on the property before the property acquisition" shall mean
that number of spaces which is depicted on a parking plan previously approved
by either the city or Broward County, or if there be no such plan, that
number of spaces which can be accommodated on site using the location,
character and size regulations set forth in 17 of this code, and utilizing
site areas not devoted to landscaping nor otherwise necessary to be reserved
for fire access protection purposes. The actual number of spaces existing on
the property before property acquisition shall not include any
required-but-not-actually-installed landscaping and the parking areas may be
reconfigured without increased landscaping required by chapter 25 of this
code.



            4.   The amount of parking spaces for disabled
person shall be as provided in 316.1955 (2) (c), Florida Statutes.



         e.   The affected property's building coverage ratio
will be increased, and its landscape ratio decreased, to reflect the size of
the remaining property.



         f.   The planning and zoning board may also review and
recommend minor changes in elevations to the buildings and structures on the
remaining property in the event building modifications are proposed which are
necessary to implement a variation authorized by this section.



      (2)   Factors to consider in issuing development orders. The
variations set forth above shall be evaluated in accordance with the
following measurable standards and criteria in addition to any other
applicable code provisions:



         a.   The structure or lot as planned can function
adequately for its actual or intended land use after the Griffin Road
expansion; and



         b.   The plan proposed will not create a traffic hazard
or traffic nuisance because of turning movements in relation to its access to
public roads or intersections or inadequacy of off-street parking. As used
herein, inadequacy of off-street parking shall refer to a usual condition for
the subject site where off-street parking is insufficient to accommodate the
existing site needs and where, as a result, customer, employee, or invitee
vehicles regularly park off-site in places not approved and reserved for
off-site, off-street parking for the subject site.



         c.   The site plan will not be detrimental to the
development of the property, or the surrounding property.



         d.   The plan proposed, while not strictly in accordance
with city regulations applying generally within the zoning district, meets
public purposes in minimizing nonconformities and conflict with the city
code, and in the particular circumstances of the case, strict application of
the regulations is not necessary for the accomplishment of public purposes or
the provision of public protection, at the time or under foreseeable
circumstances.



      (3)   Implementing the approvals.



         a.   The city commission shall issue the certificate of
conformity evidencing the approval of the application. The certificate of
conformity shall be sent to the applicant by certified mail. If the applicant
was a property owner, a copy of the certificate shall be mailed to the
department of transportation, and vice versa. The certificate will become
null and void if it is not accepted within six (6) months, in the manner
provided in subsection b herein below. The city commission is hereby granted
the authority to extend the certificate's initial (unaccepted) validity prior
to its expiration. Requests for extension shall be approved for good cause
(which shall include, but not be limited to the fact that eminent domain
litigation affecting the subject property has not concluded).



         b.   The city planner shall confirm as effective an
issued certificate of conformity only upon:



            1.   The receipt of the property owner's approval,
in the form of their notarized signature, on the certificate of conformity;
and



            2.   The receipt of a non-exclusive license from
the property owner limited in term, sufficient to enable the completion of
any required site improvements (defined as modified access openings,
installing the landscape buffer between any front parking and Griffin Road,
and reconfiguring parking areas ) for which an appropriate surety has been
posted and which are required as a condition to approving the application;



            3.   An assurance that within a three (3) year
period from the right-of-way clear date that contemplated improvements on the
approved site plan that are within such license area will be completed,
regardless of whether the certificate of conformity expires. (This assurance
can be in the form of a cash escrow agreement with the city in the estimated
amount of the improvements, or can be assured by the state agreeing on the
property owner's behalf to improve the property in keeping with the
certificate of conformity, or can be in the form of an agreement with the
state (for such state assurances, an appropriate license will be granted to
the state and its agents for such improvements)); and



            4.   The variations and any conditions associated
with the certificate of conformity are enforceable, until such certificate
expires.



         d.   A certificate of conformity confirmed pursuant to
this section, is, except as provided in the next sentence, subject to the
durational time limits set forth in section 24-31 of this code, it being
recognized that such certificate is a zoning decision. A confirmed
certificate of conformity shall be initially valid for a period of time not
to exceed three (3) years from the right-of-way clear date. If the rights
granted by the certificate are not exercised in the aforesaid three (3) year
period of time by applications for all appropriate permits necessary to
implement the certificate's development orders, the certificate shall expire;
however, the commission may extend this three (3) year time period for one
(1) extension not to exceed six (6) additional months for good cause
demonstrated prior to the expiration of the period of initial validity.



         e.   In the event a certificate of conformity expires,
all development approvals in connection with such certificate will become
ineffective such that, when and if the property redevelops thereafter, it
will be subject to all the city's land development regulations.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city (or others as agreed) may implement
the required improvements within the license areas. (Ord. No. 97-2-1, § 1,
2-11-96)



Sec. 24-71. Nonconformities associated with expansion of county roads within
the city.



   (a)   Within the city along county roads are properties which, but
for the qualified variations authorized by this section, may be nonconforming
after the additional right-of-way is acquired by the county for planned
expansion of county roads within the city by reason of the resulting parcel
no longer meeting otherwise applicable setback, off-street parking,
landscaping, signage and other regulations. As set forth in section 23-20 of
this code, the continuance of nonconforming uses and structures is
discouraged by regulations which may limit the time period when nonconforming
structures may be used, provide time periods upon which nonconforming uses
must stop or expire, and which preclude nonconforming structure or use
expansion. The city commission legislatively determines that it is in the
public's interest, particularly with respect to encouraging economic
revitalization of property within the city, to create authorized, qualified
variations to the city land development regulations which could be issued so
that land utilized in accordance with such variations (and which would
otherwise be nonconforming) would not be classified as nonconforming, or
would have nonconformities minimized. Any variations granted pursuant to this
section shall be described in a certificate of conformity.



   (b)   A structure or lot that is rendered or will be rendered
nonconforming in a particular respect because of eminent domain proceedings
initiated by Broward County or the sale or conveyance of a parcel of land
under the threat of or in contemplation of eminent domain proceedings or
planned road expansion, shall be considered conforming in such respect
through the acceptance of a certificate of conformity pursuant to the terms
of this section and through the completion of redevelopment in accordance
with the certificate of conformity.



   (c)   Application.



      (1)   Submission of application. The property owner shall
submit an application requesting a certificate of conformity to the city
planner. Review of the application shall be conducted pursuant to the city's
development review process, as set forth in chapter 24 of this code.



      (2)   Contents of application. The application is a public
record and shall include the following:



         a.   An acceptable legal description and sketch of the
property which will (or has) become owned by the county for road
right-of-way; and



         b.   An acceptable legal description and sketch of the
remainder of the building site property.



         c.   A site plan of the building site, at a scale of not
less than one inch (1") equals thirty feet (30'), showing the existing
location of all structures and improvements (including landscaping and
parking areas) on both the property which will (or has) become owned by the
county for road right-of-way expansion, and on the balance of the building
site property to remain ( or remaining) titled in the property owner (the
"remaining property");



         d.   A site plan proposed for the remaining property at
a scale of not less than one inch (1") equals thirty feet (30'), showing the
location of all structures and improvements proposed for the remaining
property (including landscape areas and parking);



         e.   The name and mailing address of the owner of the
remaining property and such owner's authorized representative, and the name
and address of lessees of the remaining property and business owners in
possession of any portion thereof;



         f.   The name and mailing address of the county's
authorized representative in the eminent domain proceedings;



         g.   An explanation of why the certificate of conformity
should be granted;

   (d)   Approving site plan modifications.



      (1)   Available development orders. The planning and zoning
board may recommend the following variations to the city's land development
regulations, which may be approved or rejected by the city commission:



         a.   The width of the right-of-way building setback
(regardless of whether such setback is the front, side or rear of such
building) can be reduced to not less than fifty (50) feet measured from the
right-of-way line of the road, plus additional right-of-way as shown on
applicable right-of-way plans at locations of turn lanes and expanded
intersections.



         b.   The width of landscape buffers provided adjacent to
the right-of-way on the remaining property can be reduced to not less than
ten (10) feet excluding access points. Except for the foregoing sentence's
ten (10) foot landscape buffer requirement, other landscape requirements may
be reduced to the extent of landscaping existing within that area acquired by
the county. There will be no net loss of any landscaping on the remaining
property (the ten (10) foot buffer strip may be credited against any
landscaping which may need to be removed on the remaining property as a
result of parking reconfiguration, or other site improvements), in accordance
with the city's tree preservation regulations.



         c.   Signs. Any existing legally established
free-standing sign that is located within the property included in the
eminent domain action may be relocated on site subject to the standards of
this section and the following criteria:



            1.   Sign number and size. Any sign(s) to be
relocated shall comply with the height, size (face area) and maximum number
of signs allowed requirements of the code.



            2.   Sign relocation. In no event shall the front
setback be less than five (5) feet from the ultimate right-of-way and have
less than a five (5) foot side setback, except upon receipt of a sign
relocation permit.



            3.   A sign relocation permit may be issued,
provided the applicant can meet the following standards:



               (i)   The sign relocation in accordance with
this section, would create no additional loss in the number of required
parking spaces;



               (ii)   The proposed sign location does not
encroach into the right-of-way, unless it is part of a negotiated settlement
with the county.



               (iii)   There is no other location on the
subject property to place the sign consistent with safe vehicular use area
design.



         d.   1.   The amount of off-street parking, on-site,
after the property acquisition may be reduced by:



               (i)   Twenty (20) percent of the parking
requirement set forth in this code (except where the parking requirement has
already been reduced by virtue of a variance or grandfather provision); or



               (ii)   Ten (10) percent of the actual spaces
existing on the property before the property acquisition ; or



               (iii)   Twenty-five (25) percent of the
actual spaces existing on the property before the property acquisition, for
building sites adjacent to the road; provided, however, that the building
setbacks on the remaining property are a minimum of fifty (50) feet from the
right-of-way line and such front street setback site configuration includes
90 degree front parking adjacent to the structures, and a two-way driveway
parallel to the road, and the five (5) foot landscape buffer.



            2.   Any reduction in parking pursuant to this
paragraph shall not justify an increase in gross square feet of the building
area.



            3.   For purposes of this paragraph d, "the actual
spaces existing on the property before the property acquisition" shall mean
that number of spaces which is depicted on a parking plan previously approved
by either the city or Broward County, or if there be no such plan, that
number of spaces which can be accommodated on site using the location,
character and size regulations set forth in chapter 17 of this code, and
utilizing site areas not devoted to landscaping nor otherwise necessary to be
reserved for fire access protection purposes. The actual number of spaces
existing on the property before property acquisition shall not include any
required-but-not-actually-installed landscaping and the parking areas may be
reconfigured without increased landscaping required by chapter 25 of this
code.



            4.   The amount of parking spaces for disabled
person shall be as provided in 316.1955 (2) (c), Florida Statutes.



         e.   The affected property's building coverage ratio
will be increased, and its landscape ratio decreased, to reflect the size of
the remaining property.



         f.   The planning and zoning board may also review and
recommend minor changes in elevations to the buildings and structures on the
remaining property in the event building modifications are proposed which are
necessary to implement a variation authorized by this section.



      (2)   Factors to consider in issuing development orders. The
variations set forth above shall be evaluated in accordance with the
following measurable standards and criteria in addition to any other
applicable code provision:



         a.   The structure or lot as planned can function
adequately for its actual or intended land use after the road expansion; and



         b.   The plan proposed will not create a traffic hazard
or traffic nuisance because of turning movements in relation to its access to
public roads or intersections or inadequacy of off-street parking. As used
herein, inadequacy of off-street parking shall refer to a usual condition for
the subject site where off-street parking is insufficient to accommodate the
existing site needs and where, as a result, customer, employee, or invitee
vehicles regularly park off-site in places not approved and reserved for
off-site, off-street parking for the subject site.



         c.   The site plan will not be detrimental to the
development of the property, or the surrounding property.



         d.   The plan proposed, while not strictly in accordance
with city regulations applying generally within the zoning district, meets
public purposes in minimizing nonconformities and conflict with the city
code, and in the particular circumstances of the case, strict application of
the regulations is not necessary for the accomplishment of public purposes or
the provision of public protection, at the time or under foreseeable
circumstances.



      (3)   Implementing the approvals.



         a.   The city commission shall issue the certificate of
conformity evidencing the approval of the application. The certificate of
conformity shall be sent to the applicant by certified mail. The certificate
will become null and void if it is not accepted within six (6) months, in the
manner provided in subsection b herein below. The city commission is hereby
granted the authority to extend the certificate's initial (unaccepted)
validity prior to its expiration. Requests for extension shall be approved
for good cause (which shall include, but not be limited to, the fact that
eminent domain litigation affecting the subject property has not concluded).



         b.   The city planner shall confirm as effective an
issued certificate of conformity only upon:



            1.   The receipt of the property owner's approval,
in the form of their notarized signature, on the certificate of conformity;
and



            2.   The receipt of a non-exclusive license from
the property owner limited in term, sufficient to enable the completion of
any required site improvements (defined as modified access openings,
installing the landscape buffer between any front parking and the road, and
reconfiguring parking areas) for which an appropriate surety has been posted
and which are required as a condition to approving the application;



            3.   An assurance that within a three (3) year
period from the right-of-way clear date that contemplated improvements on the
approved site plan that are within such license area will be completed,
regardless of whether the certificate of conformity expires.



            4.   The variations and any conditions associated
with the certificate of conformity are enforceable, until such certificate
expires.



         c.   A certificate of conformity confirmed pursuant to
this section is, except as provided in the next sentence, subject to the
durational time limits set forth in section 24-31 of this code, it being
recognized that such certificate is a zoning decision. A confirmed
certificate of conformity shall be initially valid for a period of time not
to exceed three (3) years from the right-of-way clear date. If the rights
granted by the certificate are not exercised in the aforesaid three (3) year
period of time by applications for all appropriate permits necessary to
implement the certificate's development orders, the certificate shall expire;
however, the commission may extend this three (3) year time period for one
(1) extension not to exceed six (6) additional months for good cause
demonstrated prior to the expiration of the period of initial validity.



         d.   In the event a certificate of conformity expires,
all development approvals in connection with such certificate will become
ineffective such that, when and if the property redevelops thereafter, it
will be subject to all the city's land development regulations.
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city (or others as agreed) may implement
the required improvements within the license areas. (Ord. No. 97-5-1, § 1,
5-27-97)

ARTICLE I.  OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING



Sec. 25-1. Purpose and intent.



   It is intended that adequate, well-landscaped off-street parking be
provided throughout the city in any and all districts and that adequate
off-street loading be provided as required in this section. The city
encourages developers to exceed the minimum landscape standards required in
the landscape ordinance (chapter 25, article III) in order to promote a
rustic and natural environment throughout the city.



Sec. 25-2. Application requirements.



   (a)    A site development plan shall be submitted with every
application for a building permit for any use or structure required to
provide off-street parking or loading facilities under this article, which
plan shall clearly and accurately designate the required parking and loading
spaces, access aisles, driveway ribbons, driveways and relation to the uses
or structures these off-street parking and loading facilities are intended to
serve.  Computations based on use and amount required are to be listed. The
plan shall include off-street landscaping as required by the landscape
ordinance (chapter 25, article III).



   (b)    No building permit shall be issued unless and until a site
development plan for such off-street parking and loading facilities and
landscaping, including drainage, lighting and all driveways extending beyond
the property line into the public right-of-way, shall have been reviewed by
the planning and zoning board for conformity with the provisions of this
article.



   (c)    No certificate of occupancy will be granted unless and until
all provisions of this article are met.  The building department, police
department or code enforcement officer shall be responsible for inspecting
property and approving conformity with this article after construction is
completed.  Notice of such approval must be sent to the planning and zoning
board, community appearance board, city engineer and city commission.



Sec. 25-3.  Off-street parking required.



   (a)   New development. Every use or structure instituted or erected
after May 3, 1977 shall be provided with off-street parking facilities in
accordance with provisions of this article for the use of occupants,
employees, visitors or patrons.



   (b)   Existing development.



      (1)   Additions or enlargements.  Where any building or use
is enlarged in floor area, volume or capacity, such additional space so
created or occupied shall be provided with additional off-street parking
facilities in accordance with requirements of this article.



      (2)   Nonconforming uses.  In the case of a building occupied
by a use which is not permitted as a new use in its designated district,
major repairs, substantial alterations or extensions of such nonconforming
use shall be permitted only if the off-street parking requirements of this
article for the new use are applied to such existing use and are fully
provided for.



      (3)   Business districts.  Development existing prior to May
3, 1977 in business districts (B-1, B-2, B-3) are to conform with the minimum
off-street parking standards of this article. The city commission may waive
off-street parking requirements in regard to existing business districts if
such requirements would create an undue hardship.



      (4)   Commercial, civic, recreational and light industrial
districts.  Where any structure in the C-1, C-2, I-1, P-1 or X-1 districts
is enlarged or any use is extended, the full amount of off-street parking
space shall be supplied and maintained for the structure or use in its
enlarged or extended size. Where the use of a structure or land or any part
thereof in such districts is changed to a use requiring off-street parking
space under this section, the full amount of off-street parking space shall
be supplied and maintained to comply with this section.



   (c)   Repairs and remodeling. Any building or structure may be
modernized, altered or repaired provided there is no increase in floor area
or capacity and there is no change of use without providing additional
off-street parking facilities.



   (d)   Maintenance.  Such off-street parking facilities shall be
maintained and continued as long as the main use is continued.



Sec. 25-4. Amount of off-street parking.



   (a)   Unlisted uses.  The requirements for off-street parking for
any uses not specifically mentioned in this section shall be the same as
provided in this section for the most similar to the one sought, it being the
intent to require all uses except, agricultural to provide off-street parking.



   (b)     Mixed uses.  In the case of mixed uses, the total
requirements for off-street parking shall be the sum of the requirements for
the various uses computed separately; and off-street parking space for one
use shall not be considered as providing the required off-street parking for
any other use.



   (c)   Combined off-street parking.  Nothing in this article shall
be construed to prevent collective provisions for or joint use of off-street
parking facilities for two (2) or more buildings used by two (2) or more
owners or operators, provided that the total of such parking spaces when
combined or used together shall not be less than the sum of the requirements
for the several individual uses computed separately in accordance with this
article.



   (d)   Use of required off-street parking by another building.  No
part of an off-street parking area required for any building or use by this
article shall be included as a part of an off-street parking area similarly
required for another building or use unless the type of use indicates that
the periods of usage will not overlap or be concurrent with each other as
determined by the city commission.



   (e)   Parking of commercial vehicles.



      (1)   No off-street parking facilities required by this
article and supplied by or for a use to meet the requirements of this article
shall be utilized for the parking or storage of commercial vehicles owned by
or utilized by such use during the time such use is in operation.



      (2)   Every use shall provide and maintain adequate and
sufficient off-street parking facilities to accommodate the vehicles utilized
by such use at the site of its operation independent of and in addition to
the facilities otherwise required by this article.



   (f)   Measurement.



      (1)   Fractional measurements.  When units or measurements
determining number of required off-street parking spaces result in a
requirement of fractional space, any such fraction equal to or greater than
one-half shall require a full off-street parking space.



      (2)   Bench seating. In stadiums, sports arenas, churches and
other places of assembly in which occupants utilize benches, pews or other
similar seating facilities, each twenty (20) linear inches of such seating
facilities shall be counted as one seat for the purpose of computing
off-street parking requirements.

either at the beginning or end of a block or adjacent to alley entrances (see
Figure 31). Curbs adjacent to such spaces shall be of a height which will not
interfere with the opening and closing of motor vehicle doors.



            4.     Each such parking space shall be
conspicuously outlined in blue paint, and shall be posted and maintained with
a permanent, above-grade sign bearing the international symbol of
accessibility or the caption “PARKING BY DISABLED PERMIT ONLY,” or
bearing both such symbol and caption (see Figure 32). Such signs shall not be
obscured by a vehicle parked in the space. All handicapped parking spaces
must be signed and marked in accordance with the standards adopted by the
Department of Transportation.



            5.     All spaces shall have an adjacent access
aisle 60 inches wide minimum (see Figure 30). Parking access aisles shall be
part of the accessible route to the building or facility entrance and shall
comply with Accessible Route section of this manual. Two accessible parking
spaces may share a common access aisle. Parked vehicle overhangs shall not
reduce the clear width of an accessible circulation route.



            6.     All spaces shall have accessible thereto a
curb-ramp or curb-cut, when necessary to allow access to the building served,
and shall be located so that users will not be compelled to wheel behind
parked vehicles.

Sec. 25-7. Off-street loading.



   (a)   Applicability.



      (1)    On the same lot with every structure or use hereafter
erected or created, there shall be provided and maintained adequate space for
loading and unloading of materials, goods or things, and for delivery and
shipping, so that vehicles for these services may use this space without
encroaching on or interfering with the public use of streets and alleys by
pedestrians and vehicles.



      (2)    Where any structure is enlarged or any use is extended
so that the size of the resulting occupancy comes within the scope of this
section, the full amount of off-street loading space shall be supplied and
maintained for the structure or use in its enlarged or extended size.  Where
the use of a structure or land or any part thereof is changed to a use
requiring off-street loading space under this section, the full amount of
off-street loading space shall be supplied and maintained to comply with this
section.



   (b)   Loading area design standards.



      (1)    For the purposes of this section, an off-street loading
space shall be an area at the grade level at least twelve



      (12)   feet wide by forty-five (45) feet long with fifteen
(15) foot vertical clearance.



      (2)    Each off-street loading space shall be directly
accessible from a street or alley without crossing or entering any other
required off-street loading space and arranged for convenient and safe
ingress and egress by motor truck and/or trailer combination. Such loading
space shall also be accessible from the interior of any building it is
intended to serve.



      (3)   All such deliveries or shipping areas shall be screened
from public view. In I-1, Light industrial districts, no off-street loading
space shall be located within two hundred fifty (250) feet of any
right-of-way line or four hundred (400) feet of any residential district.



   (c)   Amount of off-street loading space.  The following minimum
number of off-street loading spaces shall be provided for the uses
indicated.  For any use not specifically mentioned in this subsection, the
requirements for off-street loading for a use which is so mentioned and to
which the unmentioned use is similar, shall apply.  When calculations of the
number of required loading spaces results in a requirement of a fractional
space, any such fraction equal to or greater than one-half (½) shall require
a full off-street loading space.



      (1)    For each retail store, storage warehouse, wholesale
establishment, industrial plant, factory, freight terminal, market,
restaurant, funeral home, laundry, dry cleaning establishment, or similar use
the minimum number of required off-street loading spaces shall be as follows:



 

Gross floor area (square feet)
 
Off-street loading requirement




5,000 or less
 
None


5,001 - 25,000

Two (2) spaces


60,001 - 120,000
 
Three (3) spaces


120,001 - 200,000
 
Four (4) spaces


200,001 - 290,000
 
Five (5) spaces


For each additional 75,000 or major fraction thereof
 
One (1) space




 



      (2)    Every multi-family or apartment hotel building having
at least twenty (20) dwelling units shall provide one (1) off-street loading
space, plus one (1) additional loading space for each additional fifty (50)
dwelling units or major fraction thereof.



      (3)    Each auditorium convention hall, exhibition hall,
museum, hotel, office building, sports arena, stadium, hospital, sanitarium,
welfare institution, or similar use, which has an aggregate gross floor area
of more than ten thousand (10,000) square feet shall provide a minimum of one
(1) off-street loading space, plus one (1) additional loading space for each
additional sixty thousand (60,000) square feet or major fraction thereof.



   (d)   Limitation on uses.



      (1)   Off-street loading facilities supplied to meet the needs
of one use shall not be considered as meeting the off-street loading needs of
any other use.



      (2)    No area or facility supplied to meet the required
off-street parking facilities for a use shall be utilized for or deemed to
meet the requirements of this article for off-street loading facilities.



      (3)   Nothing in this section shall prevent the collective,
joint, or combined provision of off-street loading facilities for two (2) or
more buildings or uses, provided that such off-street loading facilities are
equal in size and capacity to the combined requirements of the several
buildings or uses and are so located and arranged as to be usable thereby.



      (4)   The planning and zoning board may recommend and the city
commission may grant a reduction of length of an off-street loading space to
not less than thirty (30) feet and the required minimum vertical clearance to
not less than eight (8) feet when there is a finding that the size, character
and operation of a particular building or use will not normally involve
service by motor vehicles requiring the length or vertical clearance of an
off-street loading space specified in subsection (b)(1), loading area design
standards.



   (e)   Application requirements for off-street loading. Plans for
buildings or uses requiring off-street loading facilities under the
provisions of this section shall clearly indicate the location, dimensions,
clearance and access of all such required off-street loading facilities; and
such plans shall be submitted to the planning and zoning board for review and
approved by the city commission as to location of ingress and egress from
such off-street loading spaces in relation to the public streets and alleys
in order to ensure the safe, orderly and expeditious movement of traffic.



Sec. 25-8. Alternative parking surfaces.



   The modifications to parking requirements allowed in this section are
intended to permit and encourage the reduction of hard-surface parking areas
so as to retain the maximum permeable soil surface and green area while still
providing for adequate parking.  It is not the intent of this section to
define each and every land use where these modifications of parking
requirements may be feasible.  The city commission may allow the use of
these modifications in any instance where such a modification appears
appropriate, excluding commercial districts, even though the specific land
use may not be cited in the following provisions. The term hard-surface as
referred to in this provision shall mean asphaltic concrete.



   (a)   Parking ribbons.  The use of hard-surface parking ribbons
shall be permitted in situations where the required parking is directly
associated with an individual dwelling unit.  Such ribbons shall be no less
than two (2) feet in width, separated at no greater distance than three (3)
feet, and constructed to the specifications of the city engineer. The
remaining required area for each parking space shall be covered with grass,
ground cover or other porous landscape material. Such ribbons are primarily
intended for use with single-family and duplex dwellings, townhouses, tourist
camps and parks.



   (b)   Reduction of hard surface allowed.



      (1)   For multi-family residential land uses, it shall be
allowed for up to ten (10) percent of the required parking to be reserved in
a grassed area.  For certain other, noncommercial uses (i.e., religious,
civic and institutional), it shall be allowed for up to twenty (20) percent
of the required parking to be reserved in a grassed area.



      (2)   Such a reserved area shall be identified on the site
plan and shall include space for all associated accessways, and shall be no
greater than three hundred (300) feet walking distance from the residences
they serve.  The reserved area may be used for temporary or overflow
parking. Parking use of the reserved area shall conform to City
specifications, including requirements for base materials, drainage and
species of grass.  Such areas shall be posted with signs, at the expense of
the property owner, that they are reserved for temporary or overflow parking.
Where regular use of the parking surface warrants, it may be required that
aisles, accessways and drives be surfaced with a hard-surface material.
Regular use of a reserved area so that maintenance of the grass in a healthy
and viable condition is impossible shall require the hard-surfacing of the
area.



      (3)   A reserved area used for temporary or overflow parking
shall meet all landscaping requirements for vehicular use areas except that
the ten (10) percent interior open spaces required may also be used for
parking provided all trees are located in an area of at least fifty (50)
square feet which shall be protected from vehicular intrusion.  Conversion
of a reserved area to hard-surface parking shall require compliance with all
landscaping requirements for vehicular use areas.  In no instance shall a
reserved area be used to satisfy the landscaping requirements for a
contiguous hard-surfaced vehicular use area or to satisfy requirements for
open space.



   (c)   Maintenance.  The owner, tenant, and their agent, if any,
shall be jointly and severally responsible for the maintenance of all vehicle
use areas, whether standard hard-surface or grass.  Grass parking areas
shall be maintained so as to present a neat appearance to ensure a viable and
healthy grass surface. In the event of deterioration of a grass parking
surface due to improper or inadequate maintenance or due to parking use too
heavy to allow a healthy grass surface, the building department may require
the restoration of the grass surface or the hard surfacing of the area.



Sec. 25-9. Variance from parking requirements.



   It shall be permissible to apply for a variance to the provisions
contained in this article, pertaining to off-street parking and loading
requirements, in accordance with the provisions of section 23-153, variance.



Sec. 25-10.  Parking of commercial vehicles, RVs and boats.



   (a)   Parking in residential districts. Except as hereinafter
provided, no owner or person having the use of a commercial vehicle,
recreational vehicle, boat or trailer, as these terms are defined in section
21-8, shall park, store or keep the vehicle or boat or trailer for any period
of time in the public street, public right-of-way or privately owned property
in residentially zoned districts.  This section shall not apply to the
following:



      (1)   Vehicles, boats or trailers that are enclosed or
screened from public view in one of the following ways. This subsection is
not a waiver of setback requirements or any other ordinances or regulations,
each of which must be complied with by any party seeking to be included under
this subsection.



         a.   Vehicles, boats or trailers parked entirely in a
covered garage whose door(s) is closed except for actual, active and
uninterrupted moving, loading or unloading;



         b.   Vehicles, boats or trailers parked entirely in a
carport, attached to the home, which is screened on all sides by permanent
dense vegetation or other permanent material, and covered by a roof, and that
such screening shall screen from view from any right-of-way abutting the
property;



         c.   Vehicles, boats, trailers or boats mounted on
trailers which do not exceed ten (10) feet in height, and which are parked
within an area behind a privacy fence with a height of six (6) feet. No
portion of a vehicle or boat parked or stored pursuant to this subsection
shall exceed ten (10) feet in height. All portions of a vehicle or boat,
excepting only the center console or bimini top of a boat, exceeding the six
(6) foot privacy fence must be screened from public view by a form-fitting
cover conforming with the standard designed contour of the vehicle or boat.
Said form-fitting cover must be maintained in good, clean condition, such
that there is no fading, tearing, or holes in the cover that are not part of
its intended design and no accumulated dirt, mold, debris or other material
on the cover.



            1.   All vehicles or boats parked or stored
pursuant to this subsection and that exceed the six (6) feet privacy fence
must be annually registered with the city's police department. Upon
registering the vehicle or boat the property owner or occupant must allow the
police department entry to the property to inspect and verify the height and
valid state registration of the vehicle or boat.  The initial registration
fee, and subsequent annual renewal fees, are to be recommended by the chief
of police reflecting the actual costs for the police department inspection
and verification, and then approved by the city manager. The annual
registration is not transferable to another vehicle or boat.



      (2)   Vehicles made necessary for individual use by persons
with actual physical impairments or disabilities;



      (3)    Any boat or prohibited vehicle parked in a prohibited
area for purposes of actual, active and uninterrupted loading or unloading,
repairs, deliveries or maintenance between the hours of 6:00 a.m. and 7 p.m.;



      (4)   Any rowboat, canoe or sailboat not to exceed fourteen
(14) feet in length, kept by the owner at the rear or interior side yard of
the owner’s residence or in the waterway adjacent thereto.



      (5)   A vehicle performing or used in the performance of a
local city, county or state function.



      (6)   Commercial vehicles whereby signage is the only cause
for classifying the vehicle as a commercial vehicle and where the signage is
completely covered with a magnetic cover and provided that the magnetic cover
is the same color as the commercial vehicle and the vehicle maintains the
standard designed contour of the vehicle.



      (7)   Owners and/or occupants of residences are permitted to
park or store their boat or recreational vehicle in front of a residence for
a period of not more than twenty-four (24) hours within any seven (7) day
period.  This subsection is not a waiver of any other ordinances or
regulations, each of which must be complied with by any party seeking to be
included under this subsection.



   Except as provided herein, the use of a tarpaulin (tarp) or other
similar covers shall not satisfy the requirements of this section for a
recreational vehicle, boat or trailer. A commercial vehicle or private
passenger vehicle may use a form-fitting vehicle cover so long as the current
automobile license tag may be visible from the right-of-way by means of clear
material or an opening or otherwise make view of the tag available and that
such cover is designed to conform to the standard designed contour of the
vehicle.  Under all circumstances covers shall be constructed of sound
material and shall be maintained in good, clean condition, such that there is
no fading, tearing, or holes in the cover that are not part of its intended
design and no accumulated dirt, mold, debris or other material on the cover.
Vinyl or canvas tarpaulin or other covers not designed for use to cover a
vehicle shall be prohibited.



   All properties located within the municipal boundaries of the City of
Cooper City shall be brought into compliance with the provisions of Cooper
City Ordinance No. 05-05-03 no later than November 23, 2005.



      (8)    Any properties who enjoy the protections of the special
residential lifestyle overlay district as set forth in section 23-76 of this
code.



      (9)    In all residential zoning districts, only one (1) boat
or one (1) recreational vehicle is permitted per dwelling unit.



   (b)   Parking in commercial districts. Except as hereinafter
provided, no owner, or person having the use of a commercial vehicle,
recreational vehicle, boat or trailer shall park, store or keep the vehicle
or trailer for any period of time within the property lines of any district
other than a residentially zoned district. This subsection shall not apply to
the following:



         (1)    Vehicles, boats or trailers which have an active
commercial or business purpose for which the owner or person having the use
of said vehicles, boats or trailers holds a current and valid occupational
license for a business location within the commercially-zoned district;
provided, however, that such vehicle, boat or trailer shall be parked, stored
or kept in the rear of the commercial facility or structure.  This
subsection is not a waiver of setback requirements or any other ordinances or
regulations, each of which must be complied with by any party seeking to be
included under this subsection.



         (2)   Vehicles, boats or trailers which have an active
commercial or business purpose for which the owner or person having the use
of said vehicles, boats or trailers holds a current and valid occupational
license for a church, synagogue, private or parochial school, nursery school,
or child care center, or non-profit club; provided that the use occupies a
free-standing building located on a separate parcel of land that is not
connected to or has no access to adjacent commercial uses. Such separate
parcel of land may be under the same ownership as adjacent commercial uses. 
This subsection is not a waiver of setback requirements or any other
ordinances or regulations, each of which must be complied with by any party
seeking to be included under this subsection.



   (c)   Special variance. Any person owning or using a commercial
vehicle may apply for a variance from the strict and literal terms of the
foregoing provisions and the city commission may grant such a variance from
the terms, conditions and provisions of this section as will not be contrary
to the public interest when, owning to special circumstances, literal
enforcement of the applicable provisions hereof would inflict an unnecessary
hardship to the ownership of such commercial vehicles, provided, further,
that the following conditions are met:



      (1)   Applicant has submitted a petition for variance on such
forms as the city clerk shall prescribe and has paid a fee therefore of fifty
dollars ($50.00);

business in order to facilitate responses to emergency situations involving
threat to life and/ or property and that without the named employee having
immediate access to the subject vehicle, the emergency to which such vehicle
is intended to respond would be increased, and that the use of the vehicle by
the named employee is not merely for the employee’s convenience.



      (4)    Notice of a public hearing has been given by the city
in accordance with the procedures of section 23-153, Variance.



      (5)    No variance granted pursuant to the terms hereof shall
be granted for a period longer than one year from the effective date of the
variance.



   (d)   Prohibition on junked or abandoned vehicles.



      (1)    All commercial vehicles, recreational vehicles, boats
or trailers herein permitted shall be parked or stored with all wheels and
tires mounted and inflated, and shall be maintained in a movable condition.



      (2)   Such vehicles and boats and trailers shall not be
supported to any degree by concrete blocks, jacks or any other means of
support, except a truck or camper unit which has its own jacks, and which is
a structure designed to be mounted upon and carried by another vehicle.



      (3)   The following shall be stored within a completely
enclosed building:



         a.     Any wrecked, junked, dismantled or partially
dismantled vehicles, boats or trailers, including vehicles missing major
parts, including but not limited to, bodies, engines, transmissions, and rear

1-8 of this code shall be applicable.



      (2)   After any person has paid or been convicted of two (2)
violations of this section, all additional violations of this section for

Sec. 25-11. Junked or abandoned vehicles.



   (a)   Prohibition and exemptions. No person shall deposit, store,
keep or permit to be deposited, stored or kept in the open upon public or
private property an abandoned vehicle, as that term is defined in section
21-8, definitions, except that this section shall not apply to any vehicle
that is:



      (1)   Parked in a covered garage; or



      (2)   Parked in a carport, attached to the home, which is
enclosed on three (3) sides by permanent dense vegetation or other permanent
material, and covered by a roof; or



      (3)    Parked within a fenced area so that the vehicle is not
visible from the public street, right-of-way, or adjacent residential
property.



   (b)   Notice to remove vehicle.  Whenever the enforcement officer
shall ascertain that an article of abandoned property is present on private
or public property, the officer shall cause a notice to be placed upon such
article in substantially the following form.  Such notice shall be not less
than eight (8) inches by ten (10) inches and shall be sufficiently
weatherproof to withstand normal exposure to the elements.  In addition to
posting, the enforcement officer shall make a reasonable effort to ascertain
the name and address of the owner; and if such is reasonably available, he
shall mail a copy of such notice to the owner on or before the date of
posting.



         This property, (setting forth brief description of
location) located at (setting forth brief description of location) is
improperly stored (if on private property) (unlawfully upon public property)
and must be removed within ten (10) days (thirty (30) days if a boat). You
have the right to a hearing before the city manager or his designee within
those ten (10) days (thirty (30) days if a boat) before the city will remove,
destroy or sell the property with the owner liable for all costs of removal
and destruction.



         Dated this: (setting forth the date of posting of notice).
Signed: (setting forth name, title, address and telephone number of
enforcement officer).



   (c)   Hearing. A hearing before the city manager shall be afforded
anyone claiming an interest in the noticed vehicle, within ten (10) days
(thirty (30) days if a boat) of the posting of such notice.  The city
manager shall have the right to postpone such hearing for a reasonable time
although property alleged to be abandoned may not be removed until following
the requested hearing. Failure to arrange for or attend such hearing shall
constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing. Any person claiming any
interest in such vehicle shall be allowed to present evidence showing why
such vehicle is not an abandoned vehicle as defined herein.



   (d)   Seizure of vehicle and costs of removal.  Waiver of the right
to a hearing or an adverse adjudication at the hearing shall constitute final
action by the city and subject the vehicle to immediate seizure. The owner of
any abandoned vehicle who fails to remove such vehicle between the date of
posting of notice and seizure by the city shall be liable to the city for all
costs of removal and destruction, less any salvage value received.  Any
person who neglects or refuses to pay such amount within ten (10) days of
billing by the city shall be subject to a fine of one hundred dollars
($100.00).



   (e)   Abandoned vehicle-hazardous.  If an enforcement officer
ascertains that an abandoned vehicle presents an immediate or imminent threat
or hazard to traffic, persons or surrounding property he may have the vehicle
removed to a location to be designated for such purpose by the city, where it
shall be posted with a notice as aforesaid.  The City shall protect the
vehicle from further harm until a hearing shall adjudicate its disposition.



   (f)   If a citation issued for a violation of this section shall be
paid prior to the issuance of a Notice to Appear or Municipal Information,
the fine shall be twenty-five dollars ($25.00). After the issuance of a
Notice to Appear or Municipal Information, the penalties provided in section
1-8 of this code shall be applicable. (Ord. No. 99-10-3, § 3, 10-26-99)

Sec. 25-19. Purpose and intent.



   (a)    The purpose of this article is to create the framework for a
comprehensive but balanced system of sign control, thereby facilitating clear
and pleasant communications. It is the belief of the city commission that the
nature of signs is to provide an index to the needed goods and services. It
is the intention of this article to develop specific sign criteria which are:



      (1)   Compatible with their surroundings;



      (2)   Legible under the circumstances in which they are seen;



      (3)   Expressive of the identity of individual businesses or
organizations or the community as a whole;



      (4)   To promote the aesthetics, safety, health, morals,
property values, general welfare and the assurance of protection of adequate
lighting, energy and air space within the city by regulation of the posting,
displaying, erection, use and maintenance of signs;



      (5)   For the sole purpose of identifying businesses and not
to permit advertising along trafficways.



   (b)   Applicability.  All signs shall be erected, placed,
established, painted, created, or maintained in the city only in conformance
with the standards, procedures, exemptions, and other requirements of this
article. This article is not intended to regulate any sign which is not
visible from another property or from public access areas.  Signs posted by
the city, including but not limited to traffic signs and legal notices, shall
not be subject to this article. No sign shall be permitted except in
accordance with the provisions of this article.



(Ord. No. 12-1-1, § 3, 1-10-12)



   (c)   Substitution clause.  It is not the intent of this article to
afford greater protection to commercial speech than to noncommercial speech.
Any sign, display or device allowed under this article may contain, in lieu
of any other copy, any otherwise lawful noncommercial message that complies
with all other requirements of this article.  The noncommercial message may
occupy the entire sign area or any portion thereof, and may substitute for or
be combined with the commercial message. The sign message may be changed from
commercial to noncommercial, or from one noncommercial message to another, as
frequently as desired by the sign's owner, provided that the sign is not
prohibited and the sign continues to comply with all requirements of this
article, including but not limited to the requirements for permit review for
installation or alteration of signs pursuant to Section 25-27, and all
construction requirements as provided in Section 25-28.



(Ord. No. 12-1-1, § 3, 1-10-12)



   (d)   Severability.



      (1)   The sections, paragraphs, sentences, clauses and phrases
of this article are severable, and if any phrase, clause, sentence, paragraph
or section of this article shall be declared unconstitutional or void or
unenforceable by the valid judgment or decree of a court of competent
jurisdiction, such as unconstitutionality or invalidity shall not affect any
of the remaining phrases, clauses, sentences, paragraphs and sections of this
article.



      (2)    This subsection shall not be interpreted to limit the
effect of subsection (1) above, or any other applicable severability
provision in this code or any adopting ordinance.  The city commission
specifically intends that severability shall be applied to sign regulations
even if the result would be to allow less speech in the city, whether by
subjecting currently exempt signs to permitting or by some other means.



      (3)   This subsection shall not be interpreted to limit the
effect of subsections (1) or (2) above, or any other applicable severability
provision in this code or any adopting ordinance.  The city commission
specifically intends that severability shall be applied to prohibited signs
so that each of the prohibited sign types listed in Section 25-22 shall
continue to be prohibited irrespective of whether another or any sign
prohibition is declared unconstitutional or invalid.



      (4)    This subsection shall not be interpreted to limit the
effect of subsections (1), (2) or (3) above, or any other applicable
severability provision in this code or any adopting ordinance.  The city
commission specifically intends that severability shall be applied to Section
25-22 of the sign regulations so that if all or any of such provisions are
declared unconstitutional or invalid by the final and valid judgment of any
court of competent jurisdiction, the city commission intends that such
declaration shall not effect any other prohibition on animated or billboard
signs in the aforesaid section.

maintaining permeable land areas essential to surface water management and
aquifer recharge; reducing air, noise, heat and chemical pollution through
the biological filtering capacities of trees and other vegetation; promoting
energy conservation through the creation of shade; reducing heat gain in or
on buildings or paved areas through the filtering capacity of trees and other
vegetation; reducing the temperature of the microclimate through the process
of evapotranspiration; and encouraging the use of limited fresh water
resources through the use of drought-tolerant plants;



   (c)   Water conservation. To promote water conservation by requiring
and encouraging the use of native and drought-tolerant plant material;
utilization of water-conserving irrigation practices; and adherence to sound
landscape installation standards and maintenance procedures that promote
water conservation;



   (d)   Efficiency in land development. To promote efficiency in the
development of limited land resources by ameliorating the compatibility of
otherwise discordant land uses;



   (e)   Land values. To maintain and increase the value of land by
requiring minimum landscaping which becomes a capital asset;



   (f)   Human values. To provide physical and psychological benefits
to persons through landscaping, by reducing noise and glare, and by softening
the harsh visual aspects of urban development;

day extension of time for the installation of required landscaping by posting
a cash bond in an amount equal to no less than one hundred fifty (150)
percent of the estimated cost of installing the landscaping, as calculated by
the registered landscape architect who prepared the landscape plans and
approved by the director. In no case shall the amount of the cash bond be
less than one thousand dollars ($1,000.00).



      (3)   Use and release of bonds.  After the expiration of the
twenty-one (21) day extension period, the registered landscape architect who
prepared the landscape plan shall inspect the landscaping to determine
whether the requirements of this article have been satisfied and submit a
written report to the director. If it is reported that the landscaping
requirements have been satisfied, the director or his designee shall conduct
a final inspection.  If the inspection reveals that the landscaping
requirements of this article have been satisfied, the cash bond shall be
returned to the owner.  Should it be determined that the landscaping fails
to satisfy the requirements of this article, the cash bond shall be declared
forfeited and the city shall assume responsibility for installing the
landscaping required by this article.  In the event that the costs to
install required landscaping exceed the cash bond amount, the city shall
assess the property owner for any additional costs.

ARTICLE IV. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION



Sec. 25-60.  Environmentally sensitive lands.



   (a)   Purpose and intent.  The provisions of this section are
intended to protect the natural resources, including land, water, native
vegetation and wildlife, within the city in accordance with the Growth
Management Act of 1985, Rule 9J-24 of the Florida Administrative Code and
section 5, “conservation” of the goals, policies and objectives of the
comprehensive plan of the city.  This section is specifically intended to
implement the provisions of objective 5.4 and policy 5.4.8 of the
comprehensive plan.



   (b)   Definition.  “Environmentally-sensitive lands” shall mean
any area of land or water designated by the city, or other appropriate
governmental entity as being needed to serve the purpose of conserving or
protecting natural resources or environmental quality.



   (c)   Environmental impact reports.



      (1)   When required. If a proposed development includes all or
any part of any lands which are designated by any governmental agency as
“environmentally-sensitive lands”, the applicant shall prepare and submit
an environmental impact report (EIR) identifying the effects that the
proposed development would have on the unique natural qualities and resources
of the area and identifying strategies to protect the resource or mitigate
unavoidable adverse impacts on the resource.



      (2)   Contents.  The EIR shall be prepared by a qualified
field biologist or ecologist, as that term is defined in section 21-9,
definitions, and shall include the following information:



         a.    An identification and detailed description of the
types and significance of impacts that the proposed development is
anticipated to have on the unique natural qualities and resources found on
the site. Impact categories to be identified and described include water
resources, vegetation, soil, air, wildlife, aesthetics, open space, outdoor
recreation and land use.  This analysis shall be based on the activities
related to the development and the environmental attributes which will be
affected by them.



         b.   An identification of conservation measures to
minimize or alleviate adverse environmental impacts of the proposed
development.  Conservation measures shall include the preservation of a
particular portion or portions of a site which contain a significant
ecological plant and/or wildlife community, and shall be sufficient to
protect the integrity of the resource.



         c.    A mitigation plan in those cases where the
proposed development will have an adverse impact upon the resource.



         d.    An identification of the need for public land
acquisition, if applicable.



   (d)   Action on EIR.  If otherwise in compliance with the minimum
requirements of this section, and if the city commission determines that the
EIR submitted adequately addresses the impacts expected by the proposed
development on the unique natural qualities and resources of the site and
that the mitigation plan will adequately address the adverse impacts of the
proposed development, an application for a development permit may be approved
and shall be subject to the requirements of the EIR which will include those
conditions that have been determined by the city commission to be reasonably
necessary to minimize adverse environmental impact.  The execution and
recordation of an agreement which will ensure compliance with the conditions
of the development approval adopted by the city commission shall be a
condition of approval of the development order and such an agreement will
also provide for recordation of releases upon satisfaction of the conditions.



   (e)   Additional study. If the city commission determines that the
EIR and the proposed mitigation plan is insufficient to avoid adverse
environmental impacts, it may direct that further study or studies be
performed in order to determine if additional measures can be taken to
protect the environmental resources which have been identified on the land
proposed for development.  Such further studies shall be completed within
six (6) months of the date that the city commission determines that the EIR
and mitigation plan is insufficient. Upon completion of the study, the city
commission shall approve, approve with conditions or disapprove the proposed
development.



   (f)   Acquisition. If the city commission determines that
acquisition of all or part of the land, or of some interest in the land, is
necessary to avoid adverse environmental impact, the city commission may
defer action on the application for a period of time not to exceed six (6)
months from the date approval of the city commission would otherwise be
required under chapter 24 of this code for the purpose of arranging for the
acquisition of the land or some interest therein.  At the expiration of such
six (6) month period, if the application conforms with all requirements of
this section and other applicable law, the city commission shall approve the
application for development permit subject to appropriate conditions unless
the land has been acquired, condemnation proceedings have been initiated, or
the applicant agrees to a further extension of time.

words shall have the meanings herein described:



      Endangered species: Any species of fish or wildlife naturally
occurring in Florida, whose prospects of survival are in jeopardy due to
modification or loss of habitat or over-utilization for commercial, sporting,
scientific or educational purposes.  Said species shall be those set forth
in section 39-27 of the Florida administrative code, as same may be amended
from time to time.



      Qualified field biologist or ecologist:  A firm or individual
certified to be professionally competent or capable to perform habitat
assessments in South Florida by a nationally recognized organization or
otherwise acceptable to the Florida Freshwater Fish and Game Commission,
Non-Game Wildlife Division.



      Rare species: Those species of fish or wildlife that are so
designated by ordinance by the city commission of the city from time to time.



      Species of special concern: Any species of fish or wildlife that
are not currently threatened or endangered but are the subject of special
concern because of potential habitat loss or over-utilization for commercial,
sporting, scientific or educational purposes and have been designated as such
by the Florida Freshwater Fish and Game Commission as set forth in section
39-27.005 of the Florida administrative code, as same may be amended from
time to time.



      Threatened species: Any species of fish or wildlife naturally
occurring in Florida that may not be in immediate danger of extinction, but
exists in such small populations as to become endangered if it is subjected
to increased stress as a result of further modification or loss of habitat or
over-utilization for commercial, sporting, scientific or educational
purposes. Said species shall be those set forth in Section 39-27.004 of the
Florida administrative code, as same may be amended from time to time.



   (b)   Applicability.  No permit shall be issued by the building
department authorizing any land clearing or development of any land within
the city, unless and until the developer has demonstrated that the parcel
proposed for land clearing or development does not serve as a habitat for a
rare, threatened or endangered species or a species of special concern.



   (c)   Submittals. A developer may demonstrate that a parcel proposed
for land clearing or development does not serve as habitat for rare,
threatened or endangered species or a species of special concern through
approval of any one (1) of the following submittals:



      (1)   Site visit.  If the parcel proposed for land clearing
or development is less than one (1) acre in size and is surrounded on at
least fifty (50) percent of its boundaries by developed land, is not
contiguous to any property which exhibits or contains land cover or other
conditions likely to serve as habitat for any rare, threatened or endangered
species or species of special concern, which when added to the parcel equals
one (1) acre or more, an affidavit that a qualified field biologist or
ecologist has visited the site and is of the opinion that the parcel does not
serve as habitat for any rare, threatened or endangered species or a species
of special concern;



      (2)   Field assessment.  A preliminary field assessment of
the parcel proposed for land clearing or development together with an
affidavit, prepared and sworn to by a qualified field biologist or ecologist,
stating that a field inspection of the parcel proposed for land clearing or
development indicates that there is no reasonable likelihood that the parcel
serves as habitat for any rare, threatened or endangered species or species
of special concern.  For the purpose of this preliminary field assessment
the presence of land cover likely to serve as habitat for any such species
shall be deemed to be evidence that the parcel proposed for land clearing or
development is likely to serve as habitat for such species;



      (3)   Site survey. A detailed site survey of the parcel
proposed for land clearing or development, prepared and sworn to by a
qualified field biologist or ecologist, that demonstrates that the proposed
character, location and magnitude of the proposed land clearing or
development is such that it will not have an adverse impact or result in any
harm to any individual rare, threatened or endangered species or a species of
special concern;



      (4)   Mitigation plan. A mitigation plan, prepared and sworn
to by a qualified field biologist or ecologist, demonstrating that the
proposed land clearing or development will not result in the taking of any
threatened or endangered species and that the survival of each and every
population of any rare, threatened or endangered species or a species of
special concern, individuals of which are found on the parcel proposed for
land clearing or development, is assured notwithstanding the proposed land
clearing or development.



   (d)   Current information. Affidavits, site surveys, or field
assessments must be current to within thirty (30) days of the date of
application for permit. Should a permit expire, or should a period of
seventy-five (75) days elapse between the date of issuance of the permit and
the commencement of work, or between the date of issuance of the initial
permit and any subsequent permit, the developer shall be required to have the
affidavit, site survey, or field assessment updated or a new affidavit, site
survey or field assessment performed prior to the renewal of the permit,
commencement of work or issuance of a new permit.



Sec. 25-63. Wellfield protection

   (a)   Yard Waste. Yard wastes shall not be disposed of or stored by
shorelines, in ditches or swales or near or into storm drains. Mulching
mowers are recommended. When a conventional mower equipped with a side
discharge chute is used near the shoreline, the user shall direct the chute
away from the water body. When mowing upland areas, the user shall direct the
chute back onto the yard, not onto the road or other hardscape area. Shredded
yard clippings and leaves should be used for mulch or be composted for use as
fertilizer.



   (b)   Fertilizer Management. Fertilizers applied to turf and/or
landscapes shall be formulated and applied in accordance with requirements
and directions provided by Rule 5E-1.003(2), Florida Administration Code,
Labeling Requirements for Urban Turf Fertilizers.  Rotary fertilizer
spreaders should have deflector shields.  Deflectors must be positioned so
that fertilizer granules are deflected away from all impervious surfaces,
fertilizer-free zones and water bodies, including wetlands. All fertilizer
that lands on impervious surfaces shall be immediately and completely removed
to the greatest extent practicable. In no case shall fertilizer be washed,
swept, or blown into stormwater drains, ditches, conveyances, or water
bodies. Fertilizer shall not be applied within ten (10) feet, or three (3)
feet if a deflector shield or drop spreaders is used, of any pond, stream,
water course, lake, canal or waterbody. Newly installed turf or landscape
plants may be fertilized in this zone only for the first sixty (60) day
establishment period, using caution to prevent direct deposition of nutrients
into the water.



   (c)   Pesticide Management. All landscape applications of
pesticides, including Weed and Feed products, for hire should be made in
accordance with State and Federal Law and with the most current version of
the Florida Friendly Best Management Practices (BMPS) for Protection of Water
Resources by the Green Industries. Property owners and managers are
encouraged to use Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategy as currently
recommended by University of Florida Cooperative Extension Service
publications. When using pesticides, all label instructions are State and
Federal law and must be adhered to.



   (d)   Landscape Maintenance.  In no case shall grass clippings,
vegetative material and/or vegetative debris either intentionally or
accidentally, be washed, swept, or blown off into stormwater drains, ditches,
conveyances, waterbodies, wetlands, or sidewalks or roadways.



   (e)   Shoreline and Water Body Maintenance.  No prohibited or
non-native aquatic plant shall be placed in, or knowingly be distributed for
use in natural waters, or waters connected to natural waters. Shoreline
plants should not be fertilized or treated with herbicides. A voluntary six
(6) foot low maintenance zone is recommended from any pond, stream, water
course, lake, wetland or from the top of a seawall. No mowed or cut
vegetative material should be deposited or left remaining in this zone or
deposited in the water. Care should be taken to ensure erosion of the surface
soil does not occur as excessive erosion may be a greater pollutant than
occasional proper applications of fertilizer. (Ord. No. 12-2-1, § 4, 2-28-12)

impassable by traffic at any given time. In all cases, the time during which
work will be permitted shall be governed by the city.



      (7)   Safety precautions. Any person making an excavation
shall be responsible for all appropriate safety precautions. If insufficient
barricading necessitates the city to provide additional safety precautions,
the city will do so at double the standard cost for labor and materials.



      (8)   Bonds.  In addition to the foregoing requirements of
this article, the person, developer, owner, contractor, subcontractor or
franchisee who shall apply for street cut permits shall furnish to the city a
bond in accordance with section 24-82, Public improvement bonds.  The amount
of the bond shall be a minimum of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or as may
be determined by the city.  Such bond shall be furnished by a surety company
of recognized standing authorized to do business in the state and having a
resident agent in the county; provided, that the person may, at his option,
furnish cash in the same amount, conditioned upon the completion of all
required restorations within a period not to exceed the forty-eight (48) hour
limits set in subsection (5) hereinabove.  The contractor, subcontractor, or

Sec. 25-101.  Non-vehicular access easements.



   In order to promote orderly traffic movement surrounding all public and
private developments, the city commission shall require, prior to commission
approval of final plats, site plans or revised site plans, the creation of
easements prohibiting vehicular ingress and egress at those locations along
the boundaries of the property where otherwise such ingress and egress would,
in the commission’s discretion, create traffic congestion or safety
hazards.  Vehicular ingress and egress shall be prohibited in the following
circumstances:



   (a)   All residential developments greater than four (4) acres in
size shall be constructed with interior vehicular access served by either
local service or collector streets.  Exterior access to individual lots,
buildings or parcels of land shall be prohibited.



   (b)    All nonresidential developments shall prohibit vehicular
ingress and egress to local service streets, and shall prohibit vehicular

accordance with applicable provisions of the city code, as may be amended,
and with the city’s adopted engineering standards.



Sec. 25-102. Repair and maintenance required.



   A.   Repair of sidewalks located on owner’s premises. It shall be
the duty and responsibility of each property owner (including homeowner
associations pursuant to section 6-33(h) of the City Code) to construct or
reconstruct and to keep in repair any sidewalks located on their premises
(i.e., excluding public sidewalks which are located within the public
right-of-way).



   B.   Driveway aprons.  The apron area of a driveway shall be
repaired by the owner of the abutting property so as to remain in a smooth
and clean condition, free from ruts, potholes, loose aggregate and
deterioration. Any sidewalks which are separately laid out and constructed as
a sidewalk and situated between the paved driveway and the driveway apron
area shall be the city’s responsibility (in lieu of the owner of the
abutting property being responsible for said sidewalk) to the same extent
that the city repairs sidewalks pursuant to this section 25-102, except that
the city’s responsibility under this paragraph B. shall be subject to each
of the following limitations, restrictions and conditions:



      (i)   The city shall cause any sidewalk repair for which the
city is responsible to be done by its own forces or city contractors in
accordance with contract specifications, standards and methods which are
approved by the city’s Public Works Director.



      (ii)   The city shall not be responsible for aesthetic or
cosmetic differences between the repaired sidewalk and the remaining portion
of the driveway or for any lack of uniformity in appearance.



      (iii)   Before undertaking any sidewalk repair work pursuant
to this paragraph B., the City Manager may require the benefitted property
owners to execute release and indemnification forms (the “release:) which
serves to implement this provision and to protect the city and its officers,
agents, employees, and contractors from liability. The release shall also
provide for the benefitted property power to be solely responsible for the
repair of the remaining portion of the property owner’s driveway.



As an alternative to doing the above-described repair work via the city’s
own forces or city contractor, the City Manager may authorize, by written
agreement, the property owner to engage the property owner’s own contractor
to do the sidewalk repair work, at the property owner’s sole cost and
expense, except that the City manager may reimburse the property owner for
the cost of the repair, after the work is satisfactorily completed. The
amount of reimbursement shall not exceed the cost that the city would have
incurred had the city used its own forces or a city contractor for the repair
work.



   C.   Harmony of provisions. Except as provided in paragraphs A. to
and including B. above, all sidewalk areas within public rights-of-way shall
be kept in a structurally sound condition (as defined in section 6-36(o) of
the City Code) by the city. Any sidewalks located within the paved driveway
apron area of a non-residential property shall be the property owner’s
responsibility to construct or reconstruct and keep in repair.



   D.   Cleaning of sidewalks. It shall be the responsibility of each
property owner (including homeowner associations pursuant to section 6-33(h)
of the City Code) to uniformly clean debris, stain, and mold from all
sidewalks on or abutting the front or sides of their property. This area
shall also be kept clean and free of weeds, trash and debris and other such
obstructions. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this section, the city
may, in its discretion, periodically clean (i) those portions of a public
sidewalk that abuts non-residential property and which are in the public
rights-of-way outside a property owner’s boundaries; or (ii) sidewalks
which abut the rear property boundary of a residential property that may or
may not be separated by a fence or other physical barrier from the property.

grading for the proposed construction, reconstruction or repair.  The
construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair of all sidewalks shall
be acceptable to the city.



   (d)    The sidewalk plan shall provide for construction of sidewalks
in the street right-of-way adjacent to all property which abuts a street. 
Sidewalks shall be extended to the edge of pavement over all streets and
parking areas and shall be continuous across driveways.  In the event there
is not sufficient room within the street right-of-way for construction of a
sidewalk, the sidewalk shall be constructed on the owner’s property
adjacent to public streets and the owner shall dedicate an appropriate
easement to the public for sidewalk purposes.



   (e)    Any sidewalk constructed contrary to the provisions of this
section may be condemned by the chief building official and ordered
reconstructed or reformed.

the Local Government Code Enforcement Act, Chapter 162, F.S., as amended, and
Article VI of Chapter 13 of the City Code as amended.



   (2)   Each day that a violation continues shall be deemed a separate
violation.

for development or building permits or any final site development plan or any
revised site plan increasing the size or use of a building.



   (c)   It shall be the petitioner’s responsibility to demonstrate
compliance with the requirements of this section prior to receiving approval
of a final site development plan, or requesting a final building inspection
or certificate of occupancy.



Sec. 25-111.  Number and size of containers.



   (a)   Multi-family residential development.  Each multi-family
residential development shall have one four (4) cubic yard garbage container
and one set of recycling containers for each twenty (20) to twenty-five (25)
dwelling units, provided, however, that the maximum walking distance from any
dwelling unit to any such container, shall be no greater than two hundred
(200) feet.  The city commission shall have the option of permitting
door-to-door sanitation service in multi-family developments provided the
amended development meets or exceeds the following requirements:



      (1)   The type of development is single-family attached units
or row townhouses and/or villas which have parking areas directly adjacent to
the front elevation of the units;



      (2)    Four (4) foot wide sidewalks consisting of dustless

shall be concealed from public view; (4)  Each dwelling unit is provided
with an individual water meter;



      (5)    Curbed, landscaped islands are provided between every
two (2) to four (4) parking spaces: and,



      (6)    Configuration of traffic aisles, relative to width and
turnarounds, are sufficient to permit the free-flow of traffic as well as
adequate ingress/egress for sanitation vehicles.



      (7)    Applicant shall indicate on preliminary site plan if
door to door pick-up is proposed.



      (8)    Applicant shall provide a letter indicating sanitation
review of proposed layout of subdivision.



   (b)   Nonresidential developments. The number and size of containers
to be provided in nonresidential developments shall be as specified in the
following table.







   (c)   Supplementary standards.



      (1)   The above requirements are minimum standards that must
be shown on all site plans prior to city commission approval.  If the
applicant is able to submit information to the city commission demonstrating
that fewer containers are required, commission may approve the site plan with
fewer containers, provided that space is provided for all containers required
by this section.



      (2)   Major tenants, i.e., square footage of thirty thousand
(30,000) square feet or more, shall be responsible for their own trash
containers. All other containers shall be the responsibility of the landlord.



      (3)    Dumpster enclosures in commercial and industrial
developments shall be constructed no greater than two hundred (200) feet

enclosures than provided for in the table above, this provision shall prevail.



      (4)   Any enclosure provided for the use of food-handling
establishments must comply with the rules and regulations of the Broward
County health department relative can-wash facilities, floor drains, etc. as
may be amended. Copies of the current regulations are available in the city
building department for public inspection.



Sec. 25-112.  Site plan revisions for additional enclosures.



   In the event it is determined by the city through over-accumulation of
garbage or leasing of space to a food-handling establishment that an occupied
nonresidential development is in need of additional enclosures, the property
owner may present a revised site plan to city development review staff for
approval rather than be processed through the site planning procedure
provided in chapter 24, subdivision and site plan review. Provided, however,
that such revised site plan must be in full compliance with the original
final site plan approval granted by the city commission.  In the event the
site plan conflicts with commission approval, the provisions of chapter 24,
subdivision and site plan review, shall apply.



Sec. 25-113.  Enclosure design standards.



   (a)    All garbage receptacles shall be required to be shielded by
solid masonry walls covered in a material consistent with the approved design
of the center or residential development and solid gates. However, each
exterior trash enclosure approved after the effective date of this chapter
shall have a thirty (30) inch opening on one side, according to the
illustration in subsection (k), which shall be used to enable a person to
walk into the enclosure to deposit trash.  Wheel stops shall be installed
within the enclosure to prevent the dumpster from rolling into the walls of
the enclosure. This opening is for the purpose of allowing side entry into
the dumpster area so that small items of trash may be more easily disposed of
without the need to open the gate.



   (b)    The minimum height of all enclosure walls and gates shall be
five (5) feet, but shall not be less than the height of the dumpster to be
placed inside.



   (c)    The minimum inside dimensions of the enclosure shall be no
less than twelve (12) feet by twelve (12) feet.



   (d)    The gates of the enclosure shall have no panel wider than six
(6) feet and shall be constructed of a metal frame with solid walls affixed
thereto, and of a material of sufficient strength to withstand normal daily
use of rubbish disposal and pickup.  Chain link gates with slats are not
permitted.  The gates shall be attached to metal posts (minimum of three
(3") diameter with at least three (3) hinges. Each gate shall have a wheel
stop at the bottom to prevent it from sagging. The gates shall have drop
pins/rods to hold them in place in both the open and closed positions.



   (e)   The base of the enclosure must be poured concrete, a minimum
of four (4) inches in depth; said base to be extended three (3) feet beyond
the front opening of the enclosure as an apron and all concrete must be level
with adjacent asphalt. Concrete or recycled plastic wheelstops shall be
placed at the sides and rear of the enclosure one (1) foot within the walls
to prevent the dumpster from striking the walls of the enclosure.



   (f)   The enclosure shall be permitted to encroach into the side and
rear setbacks up to three (3) feet from the property line when the abutting
property is zoned for commercial or industrial use.  When the enclosure is
placed adjacent to property lines abutting all other zoning districts, the
setbacks shall be the same dimensions as for the principal buildings.



   (g)    All dumpsters located within a building shall be in
trashrooms provided with an automatic sprinkler, washing facilities and
deodorizing system and one (1) main door on the ground floor, said door to be
a minimum of thirty-six (36) inches wide.



   (h)    The trash receptacles and enclosures shall be located in a
position convenient to pick up by the back-end loaders and placed in the rear
of the property, for commercial and industrial developments.



   (i)    In addition to the above requirements, a continuous hedge
shall be provided around the base of the enclosure consisting of three (3)
gallon shrubs planted twenty-four (24) inches on center.



   (j)    Multi-family residential developments approved for
construction prior to the effective date of this section (December 10, 1991)
shall have eighteen (18) months from said date to modify the existing garbage
container or dumpster enclosure area, or to construct a new enclosure area
immediately adjacent to the existing enclosure area, to accommodate
enclosures for the required recycling containers.  Such modification and/or
construction shall be subject to review and approval by the city; however,
the city shall waive all site plan review fees for this purpose.



   (k)    For purposes of clarification, displayed below is a sample of
an acceptable design for dumpster and recycling container enclosures:







Sec. 25-114. Existing multi-family complexes.



   (a)   Definition.  For the purposes of this section only, the term
“multi-family residential dwelling complex” shall mean three (3) or more
dwelling units located in a structure or building the common areas of which
are not governed by a condominium association or other legally recognized
association made up of dwelling unit owners.



   (b)   Containers required. Each building within a multi-family
residential dwelling complex receiving final site plan approval prior to
March, 1983 and not presently operating in conformity with section 25-111,
Number and size of containers, must within one hundred eighty (180) days of
the effective date of this article (December 10, 1991) comply with the
following requirements:



      (1)    A minimum of eight (8) thirty (30) gallon containers
with lids and wheels, either Rubbermaid brand or its equivalent as approved
by the city, must be provided for each building or structure within a
multi-family residential dwelling complex.



      (2)    All containers required to be placed pursuant to this
section shall be located to the rear of each building or structure, shall be
screened on three (3) sides (one long side and two short sides) by a shadow
box fence and shall be placed upon a concrete slab, in accordance with the
diagram below.



      (3)    The contract hauler shall be responsible for wheeling
the containers from the rear of the structures to the street and returning
the empty cans to the storage area. Property owners shall pay the contract
hauler for rear door collection service.



      (4)   A concrete walkway, a minimum of four (4) feet wide
shall be provided from the storage area to the front of the building or
structure.



      (5)    The fenced receptacle area shall be large enough to
accommodate, in addition to the required number of garbage and trash
containers, three (3) sixty (60) gallon recycling containers, which shall be
provided by the City.



      (6)    Storage areas abutting single-family lot lines shall be
set back at least two (2) feet of pervious area from any property line and
shall be located in a manner providing for safe and easy accessibility by
collection personnel.







   (c)   Maintenance of receptacles.



      (1)   Lids shall be kept closed at all times on those
receptacles required pursuant to subsection (b). Said containers and/or
surrounding storage areas must be maintained in a safe and sanitary and
operable condition, free from odor and extraneous debris.



      (2)    It is the owner’s responsibility of each building
within a multi-family residential complex to assure that an adequate number
of containers are provided for building residents, and that all the
provisions of this section are met.  Additionally, owners shall be
responsible for any failure to have garbage placed within tied plastic bags,
within containers. Under no circumstances will the city permit garbage to be
placed outside of containers.



      (3)   Should it become necessary for city workers, independent
contractors retained by the city or the holder of the city’s garbage
franchise to enter a multi-family residential dwelling complex to maintain or
replace garbage containers or storage areas not conforming to those standards
of safety and sanitation set forth herein, then all costs incurred by the
city in taking such actions shall be charged to the owners of the dwelling
unit for which such receptacle is being utilized.  Failure of the dwelling
unit owner to respond to such a bill within a fifteen (15) day period of
receipt, will result in a lien being placed against real or personal property
owned by said dwelling unit owner, said lien to be treated in the same manner
as a lien for municipal taxes to the extent such a provision is permitted by
state law.

   Exemptions shall be applicable to existing developed lands and lands
the city may annex in the future.  If a property owner of an existing
developed lot or a lot subsequently annexed by the city can demonstrate that
compliance with the provisions of this section would cause an extraordinary
hardship on such property owner, he or she may seek an exemption to the
strict and literal terms of this section from the city commission.  In
considering petitions for exemption, the commission shall consider:



      (1)   Whether the hardship was caused intentionally by the
action of the applicant;



      (2)   Whether a reasonable alternative exists for the
treatment of sewage;



      (3)   Whether the discharge from the individual sewage
disposal system will adversely affect the health of the applicant or other
members of the public or significantly degrade the ground or surface waters;



      (4)   Whether the city could extend the time and terms of
payment.



      (5)   The location of the property in relation to the city’s
wellfield; and any physical barriers that may exist which would prevent hook
up to the city’s system.



      (6)   The city shall inform the property owner of the benefits
to the environment and public for eliminating septic tank systems.  This
shall be accomplished by way of providing the property owner with an
informational packet.



      (7)   The economic circumstances of the petitioner; which
indicates that the cost of extending services would exceed the benefits to be
received by extending the services; for the petitioner and for the
environment.



      (8)   The prior history of the performance of the particular
septic system;



      (9)   The plan of the petitioner to ensure continued
successful performance of the system;



      (10)   The environment effects of continuing use of the system
in the particular circumstances presented.



   In making such a determination, the city shall require the petitioner
to submit all information necessary to fully show the asserted hardship. The
commission may deny the exemption, grant the exemption or grant the exemption
subject to conditions.  Conditions which may be imposed upon the granting of
any exemptions may include a time period within which compliance may be
achieved and such other reasonable conditions as may be necessary in the
opinion of the city to ensure that adequate precautions are taken to protect
the city’s wellfields.  All exemptions shall be accompanied by a condition
requiring that the septic system be inspected and cleaned by a licensed
contractor at least once every year if a garbage disposal is connected to the
septic system and once every two (2) years for all other septic systems, that
evidence of such inspection be submitted to the city manager within ten (10)
days of the inspection conditions, appropriate remedial steps approved by the
city, will be taken. The city manager will make these inspection reports
available to the city commission and the public on an annual basis.  Should
the city commission grant an exemption as provided for in this subsection,
the petitioner(s) shall immediately enter into an agreement with the city to
provide for the terms and conditions for payment of the cost of the extension
of the municipal sewerage collection system and the utility connection
charge. The city shall thereafter provide the collection system to the
Petitioner(s) when the costs therefore are properly budgeted and when the
construction procedures of the city are properly implemented. Should the
petitioner(s) fail to comply with the terms of the agreement, then the city
shall have the right to file a lien against the property of the petitioner(s)
and foreclose on said property as provided by law.

minimum standards of the city and the applicable county and state regulatory
