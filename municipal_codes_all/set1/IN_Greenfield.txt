§ 30.38  PREVENTION AND MITIGATION OF IDENTITY THEFT.



   (A)   In the event that any employee responsible for or involved in
restoring an existing covered account or accepting payment for a covered
account becomes aware of red flags indicating possible identity theft with
respect to existing covered accounts, such employee shall use his or her
discretion to determine whether such red flag or combination of red flags
suggests a threat of identity theft. If, in his or her discretion, such
employee determines that identity theft or attempted identity theft is likely
or probable, such employee shall immediately report such red flags to the
Greenfield Police Department. If, in his or her discretion, such employee
deems that identity theft is unlikely or that reliable information is
available to reconcile red flags, the employee shall convey this information
to the utility billing supervisor, who may in his or her discretion determine
that no further action is necessary. If the utility billing supervisor in his
or her discretion determines that further action is necessary, one or more of
the following responses as determined to be appropriate by the utility
billing supervisor shall be performed:



      (1)   Contact the customer;



      (2)   Make the following changes to the account if, after
contacting the customer, it is apparent that someone other than the customer
has accessed the customer’s covered account:



         (a)   Change any account numbers, passwords, security
codes, or other security devices that permit access to an account; or



         (b)   Close the account;



      (3)   Cease attempts to collect additional charges from the
customer and decline to sell the customer’s account to a debt collector in
the event that the customer’s account has been accessed without
authorization and such access has caused additional charges to accrue;



      (4)   Notify law enforcement in the event that someone other
than the customer has accessed the customer’s account causing additional
charges to accrue or accessing personal identifying information; or



      (5)   Take other appropriate action to prevent or mitigate
identity theft.



   (B)   In the event that an employee responsible for or involved in
opening a new covered account becomes aware of red flags indicating possible
identity theft with respect to an application for a new account, such
employee shall use his or her discretion to determine whether such red flag
or combination of red flags suggests a threat of identity theft. If, in his
or her discretion, such employee determines that identity theft or attempted
identity theft is likely or probable, such employee shall immediately report
such red flags to the Greenfield Police Department. If, in his or her
discretion, such employee deems that identity theft is unlikely or that
reliable information is available to reconcile red flags, the employee shall
convey this information to the utility billing supervisor, who may in his or
her discretion determine that no further action is necessary. If the utility
billing supervisor in his or her discretion determines that further action is
necessary, one or more of the following responses as determined to be
appropriate by the utility billing supervisor shall be performed:



      (1)   Request additional identifying information from the
applicant;



      (2)   Deny the application for the new account;



      (3)   Notify law enforcement of possible identity theft; or

identity theft.

flags that may arise in the performance of the service provider’s
activities and take appropriate steps to prevent or mitigate identity theft.

POLICY ADMINISTRATION



§ 36.01  INTRODUCTION AND PURPOSE.



   (A)   The purpose of this personnel policy and procedure manual is
to provide a consistent, systematic, and organized approach to the
establishment, implementation, and administration of the city’s personnel
policies. It is written, adopted, and interpreted exclusively by the city’s
elected officials, and their designees, and is not subject to modification,
change, or contrary interpretation by any employee or employee representative
organization, except as may otherwise be specifically authorized and
recognized by the laws and/or Constitutions of the State of Indiana and
United States.



   (B)   This manual is to be used to assist and guide personnel in the
day-to-day direction and performance of the general workforce, the result
being that a number of important and responsible goals may be achieved:



      (1)   First, by implementing uniform personnel policies that
are applied in as consistent and impartial a manner as is practicable, the
goal is to promote the best possible working relationships and highest morale
among all city employees. This policy manual was created for city employees
not covered by any other bargaining agreement. Furthermore, it is not
intended to supersede or overrule any state or federal rules and regulations
governing the operation of a department (the Police and Fire Department). It
is, however, the intent of this personnel policy manual to provide support,
direction, and procedures that will enable the city to practice fair and
consistent daily personnel administration.



      (2)   Second, by providing employees with fair and equal
opportunities in their recruitment and advancement, by evaluating their
services on the basis of merit and fitness, and by giving consideration to
their needs and desires, the goal is to provide an employment atmosphere that
increases the cooperation and productivity of the employees, together with
the prospects for career opportunities within the city and each office or
department of city government.



      (3)   Third, by providing dependable and courteous services to
the residents of the city, the goal is to enhance the reputation and stature
of the city’s departments and offices within the community.



(Ord. 2013-7, passed 8-28-13)



§ 36.02  ORGANIZATION AND RESPONSIBILITY.

The Elected Official is responsible for their area of administration of city
business.



   (B)   The city is organized into various departments, or offices, to
ensure adequate expertise, specialization, and efficient functioning. These

management and operation of the city.



   (C)   Department heads are appointed by the Elected Officials and

his/her pleasure. These employees can be separated without cause. 



   (E)   Each employee’s particular duties, obligations, and areas of
responsibility are defined in his/her position description and/or by
assignment or directive of any supervisor. Employees are primarily
responsible to their immediate supervisor for completion of specific work
assignments and the quality, quantity, and timeliness of the work performed.



   (F)   The rights, authorities, powers, and responsibilities of city
employees at all levels, with respect to the policies in this manual, are
more clearly delineated in the specific subject areas. However, in general,
the Elected Official, the Board of Works, and the City Council are charged
with the development, promulgation, and adoption of the provisions of this
manual. The various management and supervisory personnel are charged with
applying, interpreting, enforcing, and generally ensuring compliance with the
provisions of this manual. It is the obligation, and a requirement as a
condition of employment, for each individual person employed by the city to
comply in every respect with the provisions of this manual, and any related
procedures and work rules, and to perform their assigned duties in a
responsible manner creditable to the city. As such, all city employees are
expected to become knowledgeable about its contents and abide by the policies
set forth herein. Any questions, concerns, or lack of understanding about a
particular provision of this manual should be promptly discussed with one’s
department head.



   (G)   The Clerk-Treasurer has adopted this manual into his/her
department and for this particular branch of city government.



(Ord. 2013-7, passed 8-28-13)



§ 36.03  POLICY MANUAL ADMINISTRATION.

      (2)   This manual will also be made available to part-time and
temporary city employees.



   (B)   The contents of this manual are subject to change without
notice at the discretion of the city. Only the Elected Official, Board of
Works, and City Council will have the authority to make revisions of policies
contained herein for their areas of responsibility.



   (C)   Any changes in the policy and procedure manual shall in no way
alter the employment-at-will policy or create a binding contract between the
city and any employee.



   (D)   Employees are encouraged to make suggestions for improvements
in personnel policies and practices. Suggestions should be directed to the
department head, in writing, together with an explanation as to how such a
change could benefit the city, the department, and/or the public.



   (E)   The city will undertake to accomplish a review of the manual
at 12-month intervals, or as may be indicated by law or change in
characteristics of the city workforce.



   (F)   The department heads maintain the ultimate right to manage
their workforces, consistent with the policies set forth in this manual and
all applicable state and federal laws. The department heads’ rights
include, but are not limited to, determining methods and procedures,
recommending:  number of workforce, assignment of duties, hours of
employment, compensation of personnel, hiring, disciplining, discharging,
promoting and transferring employees, and laying off employees for lack of
work, lack of funds, or due to job abolishment.



   (G)   The policies of this manual supersede all previous city
policies or ordinances, written or unwritten, on subject matters covered or
referred to herein. The policy and procedure manuals of the Police and Fire
Departments will supersede this manual in situations where their SOP is
written with more stringent  requirements than the city requires. In policy
areas in which the Police and Fire policy manuals are silent on a topic, the
Greenfield Policy and Procedure Manual will be in effect.



   (H)   In the event that any section of this manual, or amendment or
revisions thereto, is held to be unenforceable, contrary to law or otherwise
restrained from its full force and effect by a court or other tribunal of
competent jurisdiction, the remaining section(s) of the manual, to the extent
that they remain unaffected by such declaration restraint, shall continue in
full force and effect.

§ 36.04  EQUAL EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITY.



   It is the policy of the city that all personnel actions, such as hires,
rates of compensation, benefits, promotions, transfers, layoffs, recalls,
city-supported training, and social or recreational programs, shall be
administered without regard to race, color, religion, national origin, sex,
age, marital status, sexual orientation, or non-job-related handicap.
Therefore, all such personnel actions should be consistently administered to
all employees without compromise, and thus should be based on the results
achieved on the job, as well as objective job-relatedness in both job
qualifications and performance standards.



(Ord. 2013-7, passed 8-28-13)



§ 36.05  DISCRIMINATION; SEXUAL HARASSMENT.



   (A)   All city employees should be able to work in an atmosphere
free from all forms of employment discrimination, including sexual
harassment. The city’s policy is to forbid sexual harassment and any type
of discrimination. This policy extends to every level of its operations.
Accordingly, discrimination and sexual harassment, whether by a fellow
employee, supervisor, or Elected Official, will not be tolerated. Activities
of this nature serve no legitimate purpose, have a disruptive effect on the
employee’s ability to perform, and undermine the integrity of the
employment relationship.



   (B)   The city takes allegations of discrimination and sexual
harassment very seriously. Any employee who believes that he/she is a victim
of discrimination or sexual harassment should immediately bring the matter to
the attention of his/her supervisor, or in the case where the supervisor is
the problem, contact the Elected Official. All such matters will be treated
confidentially, and with the utmost discretion. The city will actively
investigate all discrimination and sexual harassment complaints, and if it
determined that discrimination or sexual harassment has occurred, the Elected
Official/Board of Works will take appropriate disciplinary action against the
offending party, up to and including termination.



   (C)   Acts considered to constitute SEXUAL HARASSMENT include, but
are not limited to, unwanted, uninvited or offensive touching; displaying
sexually suggestive or explicit material, pictures or cartoons; telling
sexually suggestive or explicit stories or jokes; making sexually suggestive
or explicit gestures, unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors
and other verbal or physical conduct of a sexual nature where:



      (1)   Submission to such conduct is either an expressed or
implied term or condition of employment;



      (2)   Submission to or rejection of such conduct is used as a
basis for an employment decision affecting the harassed person;  and/or



      (3)   The purpose or the effect of such conduct is to
interfere with the affected individual’s job performance, or to create an
intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment.



   (D)   Acts considered to constitute DISCRIMINATION include, but are
not limited to:



      (1)   Hiring based upon race, color, religion, national
origin, sex, age, marital status, sexual orientation, or non-job-related
handicaps;



      (2)   Promotions based upon race, color, religion, national
origin, sex, age, marital status, sexual orientation, or non-job-related
handicaps;



      (3)   Pay increases based upon race, color, religion, national
origin, sex, age, marital status, sexual orientation, or non-job-related
handicaps;



      (4)   Conduct that denigrates or shows hostility or aversion
towards an individual because of their race, color, religion, national
origin, sexual orientation, gender, age or disability;



      (5)   Making derogatory ethnic or racial statements, or
belittling one’s religion or religious practices;



      (6)   Perpetuating stereotypes about one’s age, gender, and
the like;



      (7)   Refusing to assist an employee or victim/patient because

§ 36.06  VERBAL HARASSMENT.



   (A)   VERBAL ABUSE, as used in this policy, means to disturb or
persistently irritate through repeated attacks on fellow employees and/or
supervisors so as to disrupt their work or reputations.



   (B)   The city will actively investigate all verbal harassment
complaints, and if it determined that harassment has occurred, the Elected
Official/Board of Works will take appropriate disciplinary action against the
offending party, up to and including termination.



(Ord. 2013-7, passed 8-28-13)



§ 36.07  PHYSICAL HARASSMENT.

physical harassment has occurred, the Elected Official/Board of Works will
take appropriate disciplinary action against the offending party, up to and
including termination.



(Ord. 2013-7, passed 8-28-13)



§ 36.08  HARASSMENT/DISCRIMINATION GRIEVANCE PROCEDURES.



   It is helpful for the victim to inform the harasser directly that the
conduct is unwelcome and must stop.

anyone in the city, the following procedures shall be followed.



   (A)   Any individual who believes that he/she has been harassed or
discriminated against must report this information to the Mayor or his/her
designee as soon as possible.



   (B)   Upon notification, the Mayor/designee will conduct a thorough
investigation of the alleged incident. The investigation will consist of the
following:



      (1)   A written statement from the victim, along with an
interview;



      (2)   Interviewing all of the witnesses to the alleged
violation; and



      (3)   Interviewing  the alleged violator.



   (C)   A written analysis and decision will be provided to the
victim, alleged violator, and the Board of Works/Mayor.

§ 36.09  AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES ACT (ADA).



   (A)   It is the policy of the city that qualified individuals with
disabilities are not to be excluded from participation in or benefit from its
services, programs, or activities. It is the policy of the city not to
discriminate against a qualified individual with a disability in: job
application procedures; the hiring, advancement or discharge of employees;
employee compensation, job training, and other terms, conditions and
privileges of employment. It is the intent of the city to comply with all
applicable requirements of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).



   (B)   The city will reasonably accommodate persons with disabilities
on a case-by-case basis, which may include making facilities readily
accessible to individuals with disabilities, restructuring jobs, modifying
work schedules and/or equipment, or similar accommodations.



   (C)   Employees who want an accommodation should inform the Elected
Official of their condition. Such employees are required to provide pertinent
medical information. Employees and the supervisors should contact the Elected
Official for assistance when an accommodation is necessary.



   (D)   Accommodations may not create an undue hardship for the city
or other employees. An individual who cannot be reasonably accommodated for a
job, without undue hardship, will not be selected for that position. The
Elected Official and the City Attorney will make the determination of
reasonable accommodation.



   (E)   All employees are required to comply with safety standards.
Applicants who pose a direct threat to the health or safety of other
individuals in the workplace, and where the threat cannot be eliminated by
reasonable accommodation, will not be hired or retained. Current employees
who pose a direct threat to the health or safety of the other individuals in
the workplace will be placed on the appropriate leave.



   (F)   Further, disabled individuals cannot pose a direct threat to
the safety of themselves or others. Generally, a DIRECT THREAT means a
significant risk to the health or safety of others that cannot be eliminated
by reasonable accommodation. Benefits provided to disabled individuals who
are qualified to perform the work must be consistent with the benefits
provided to other employees. Any individual who believes he/she has received
treatment inconsistent with the policies set forth above, or any other
requirement of ADA, may file a complaint with the Elected Official.



(Ord. 2013-7, passed 8-28-13)



§ 36.10  EMPLOYMENT-AT-WILL.



   (A)   Public employment is based on the “at-will” doctrine.
“At-will” employment means any individual may voluntarily leave
employment or may be terminated by the city at any time with or without
cause. Any change to this policy will be effective only if set forth in
writing and signed by both the employee and the appropriate Elected Official.



   (B)   There are exceptions to the “at-will” doctrine that
prevent wrongful termination.



   (C)   This policy may not be modified by any statements contained in
this manual or any other employee materials, including applications,
memoranda, or other documents provided to applicants and employees in
connection with their employment. None of these documents, whether single or
combined, create an expressed or implied contract of employment for a
definite period, or an expressed or implied contract concerning any terms or
conditions of employment.



   (D)   Similarly, city policies and practices with respect to any
matter should not be considered as creating any contractual obligation on the
city’s part or as stating in any way that termination would occur only
“for cause.” Statements of specific grounds for termination set forth in
this manual or in any other city documents are examples only, not
all-inclusive lists, and are not intended to restrict the city’s right to
terminate at-will.



   (E)   Police and Fire Departments will be required to follow the
SOPs for their respective departments.



   (F)   Completion of a probationary period or conferral of regular
status does not change an employee’s status as an at-will employee, or in
any way restrict the city’s right to terminate the employee or change the
terms or conditions of employment.



(Ord. 2013-7, passed 8-28-13)



§ 36.11  NEPOTISM.



   (A)   The city selects employees based on their job qualifications.



      (1)   To make sure this standard is always followed and to
protect the integrity of business operations, the city has certain
restrictions on when and where relatives of employees can be hired, and how
related employees can work together.



      (2)   Members of an employee's IMMEDIATE FAMILY for this
section of the policy include parents, spouse, or stepparent, child or
stepchild, brother, sister, stepbrother, stepsister, niece, nephew, aunt,
uncle, daughter-in-law or son-in-law.



   (B)   Unless otherwise specified by state law, relatives will not be
hired, promoted, or transferred to positions that:



      (1)   Place them in direct or indirect supervisory or
managerial capacity over an immediate family member;



      (2)   Allow them to directly or indirectly influence salary
adjustments, career progress, or other managerial activities involving an
immediate family member; or



      (3)   Require them to audit or review the work of another
relative.



   (C)   If an Elected Official has an immediate family member working
for the city, that Elected Official shall abstain from any vote affecting
that employee's pay wage, benefits, promotion, demotion, and the like.



   (D)   There is a “grandfathering clause” for current elected
officials or employees with family relationships that would otherwise be in
violation of the nepotism policy unless there is a break in the office
holding or in employment.



      (1)   Grandfathered employees may remain in their positions
and they may be promoted as long as they do not report directly to the family
member.



      (2)   Employees hired after July 1, 2012, who in later years
have relatives elected that are in the direct line of supervision, will have
no promotion possibilities unless the promotion is within the merit ranks for
the Police and Fire Departments.



   (E)   State law requires that each elected officer of the unit must
annually certify in writing, subject to the penalties for perjury, that the
officer has not violated the nepotism law, and submit the certification to
the Clerk-Treasurer no later than December 31 of each year.

§ 36.12  EMPLOYER-EMPLOYEE RELATIONS.



   (A)   The city is committed to a mutually rewarding and direct
relationship with its employees. Thus, the city attempts to be receptive to
constructive suggestions, criticisms, and questions. Departmental meetings
are regularly scheduled to keep employees informed about items of interest
and to discuss issues of concern to employees. The city, as part of its
commitment to delivering the highest level of services to its residents and
guests, expects all employees:



      (1)   To treat all residents, guests, and suppliers as
customers of all city services;



      (2)   To represent the city in a positive and ethical manner;



      (3)   To perform assigned tasks in a safe and efficient manner



      (4)   To attend work as required and to be punctual;



      (5)   To demonstrate a considerate, friendly, and constructive
attitude toward fellow employees, supervisors, and Elected Officials; and



      (6)   To follow the city and departmental policies and
practices.



   (B)   The city retains the sole discretion to exercise all
managerial functions, including the following rights:



      (1)   To dismiss, assign, supervise, and discipline employees;



      (2)   To determine and change employee work schedules to meet
the needs of customers and guests of the city;



      (3)   To assign employees to other jobs within departments or
into other departments;



      (4)   To determine and adjust the employee number and specific
qualifications of the workforce;



      (5)   To assign duties to employees in accordance with the
city’s needs and requirements, and to carry out all ordinary administrative
and management functions; and



      (6)   To establish, change, and abolish policies, practices,
roles, and regulations as the city works to meet the needs of its
constituents.

§ 36.13  ALCOHOL AND DRUG FREE WORKPLACE.



   (A)   (1)   It is the intent and obligation of the city to
provide its employees with an alcohol and drug free workplace.



      (2)   City employees are expected and required to report to
work on time and in appropriate mental and physical condition. It is unlawful
to manufacture, consume, possess, control, distribute, or sell alcohol or
illegal drugs, in any amount, at any time during working hours, or at any
time while on city premises. Alternatively, when the employee is performing
his/her job functions while off city premises will also constitute a
violation of this policy. Violation of this policy is strictly prohibited.
Violation of this policy may result in disciplinary procedures, up to and
including termination.



      (3)   The city recognizes alcohol or drug dependency as an
illness and a major health problem. Additionally, the city also recognizes
alcohol or drug abuse as a potential health, safety, and security problem.
The city understands that some employees are hesitant or afraid to ask for
help even when they are aware that they may have a drug and or alcohol
problem. Employees needing help in dealing with such problems will have one
opportunity to ask for help without repercussion. They should contact their
department head, who in turn will notify the Elected Official’s office for
guidance and direction. Every effort will be made to confidentially refer the
employee who needs and requests such help to qualify for help. Conscientious
efforts to seek such help may not jeopardize any employee’s job.



   (B)   Pre-employment screening.



      (1)   Applicants for positions with the city, and former
employees seeking to be rehired, will be notified of the city’s drug and
alcohol screening policy at the time they apply.



      (2)   As a condition of employment, the candidate will be
required to pass a physical exam, including a drug and alcohol screening, at
the applicant’s expense, before becoming employed by the city.  If the
applicant is hired, he/she will be reimbursed for the physical, including
drug and alcohol screening.



      (3)   The prospective employee will be denied employment if
he/she fails the drug or the alcohol screening, or refuses to submit to the
drug and alcohol screening.



   (C)   Random drug and alcohol screening.



      (1)   The city will test employees on a random basis, and all
such tests will be unannounced. Every employee will have an equal chance of
being selected every time the selection is conducted. Appropriate safeguards
are also present to ensure that the identity of the employees cannot be
determined before or at the time of their selection. When an employee is
randomly selected to be tested, he/she will be notified and instructed to
report to the collection site immediately.



      (2)   An employee who tests positive for drugs and or alcohol,
or who refuses or fails to submit to a random drug and alcohol test, will be
subject to disciplinary action, up to and including discharge.



   (D)   Reasonable suspicion screening.



      (1)   The city will administer an alcohol and/or drug test
when there are specific and objective reasons to believe that an employee’s
behavior is jeopardizing workplace safety. No test is to be performed until
there is “cause” to believe that the employee is impaired, and the
impairment is properly documented, preferably in writing by at least two city
supervisors. (If two trained individuals are not available to show cause, the
supervisor who observes the impairment will use his/her best judgment to
determine whether a test is necessary.)



      (2)   All department heads, city supervisors, and/or foremen
shall be required to undergo annual training by the Police Department to be
able to observe and detect indication of impairment of an employee due to the
use of alcohol or drugs.

alcohol test as soon as possible after an accident, whenever he/she receives
a citation for a moving violation involving the accident, and either (i) a
person is injured because of the accident and the injuries require immediate
medical treatment to the person away from the accident scene; or (ii) one or
more motor vehicles involved in the accident incur disabling damage and must
be transported away from the accident scene by a tow truck or another
vehicle. (A supervisor on the scene can ask the employee to submit to drug
and or alcohol test if the supervisor believes the situation warrants one,
even if there is no personal injury or disabling vehicle damage.) Note: the
police can also request that a test be done following an accident.



      (2)   An employee who is required to take a post-accident drug
and alcohol test will, at the city’s discretion, either be assigned to a
position that does not require driving city vehicles, or placed on
non-disciplinary suspension with pay while awaiting the post-accident test
results.



      (3)   An employee who tests positive for drugs and or alcohol,
or who refuses or fails to submit to a post-accident drug and alcohol, test

accident; or (ii) either a person is injured because of the accident and the
injuries require immediate medical treatment to the person away from the
accident scene; or (iii) one or more motor vehicles involved in the accident
incur disabling damage and must be transported away from the accident scene
by a tow truck or another vehicle. (A supervisor on the scene can ask the
employee to submit to drug and or alcohol test if the supervisor believes the
situation warrants one, even if there is no personal injury or disabling
vehicle damage.) Note: the police can also request that a test be done
following an accident.



      (2)   An employee who is required to take a post-accident drug
and alcohol test will, at the city’s discretion, either be assigned to a
position that does not require driving city vehicles, or placed on
non-disciplinary suspension with pay while awaiting the post-accident test
results.



      (3)   An employee who tests positive for drugs and/or alcohol,
or who refuses or fails to submit to a post-accident drug and alcohol test,

   (C)   Random testing.

alcohol test whenever the city has reasonable suspicion to believe that the
driver has used drugs and/or alcohol in violation of DOT regulations and/or
this policy.



      (2)   Reasonable suspicion will exist when an employee’s
appearance, behavior, speech, or body odors indicate drug or alcohol use, or
the withdrawal effects of drugs. Such observations must be personally
observed and documented by at least one city official who has received
training covering the physical, behavioral, speech, and performance
indicators of probable drug and alcohol use. (If the trained individual is
not available, the supervisor who observes the impairment will use his/her
best judgment to determine whether a test is necessary.)

suspicion test will be escorted by his/her supervisor to the appropriate
specimen collection site for the drug and alcohol test.

normal operations.



      (2)   Effective security is a team effort involving the
participation and support of every city employee and affiliate who deals with
information and/or information systems. It is the responsibility of every
computer user to know these guidelines, and to conduct their activities
accordingly.



   (B)   Acceptable use and ownership.  City information technology
should only be used for conducting productive city business. Employees may

the workers’ compensation check over to the city to be reimbursed for the
difference.



   (D)   Insurance coverage. Group health insurance coverage and other
insurance benefits will continue on the same basis, as coverage would have
been provided had the employee been continuously employed during the period
of a workers’ compensation disability leave, as long as the employee pays
his/her regular portion of the premium on a timely basis. Employees must
arrange with the Clerk-Treasurer’s Office to pay their portion of this
insurance coverage.



   (E)   If an employee has a secondary job and is required to be off
work from his/her primary job with the city due to a workers’ compensation
injury, he/she will be prohibited from working the secondary job until he/she
is released to return to work at his/her primary job.

INTERNAL CONTROL STANDARDS



§ 37.01  AUTHORITY AND ADOPTION.



   (A)   I.C. 5-11-1-27 requires all Indiana political subdivisions to
adopt minimum levels of internal control standards developed by the State
Board of Accounts, as published in the Uniform Internal Control Standards for
Indiana Political Subdivisions prior to June 30, 2016.



   (B)   The Clerk-Treasurer has reviewed and recommends adoption of
the proposed internal control standards and materiality threshold.



   (C)   The city hereby adopts the following internal control policy
and materiality threshold.



(Res. 2016-15, passed 12-14-16)



§ 37.02  PURPOSE.



   The purpose of this policy is to communicate the Common Council’s
internal control objectives to all employees and elected officials of the
city, and to firmly commit the city to the 17 key principles of internal
controls as established by the State Board of Accounts.



(Res. 2016-15, passed 12-14-16)



§ 37.03  COMPONENT ONE:  CONTROL ENVIRONMENT.



   (A)   Principle 1: The oversight body and management demonstrate a
commitment to integrity and ethical values.



      (1)   The city has the responsibility to establish and
maintain an adequate system of internal control and to furnish to the Common
Council, various boards and commissions, governmental agencies, creditors and
others reliable financial information on a timely basis. An adequate system
of internal control is necessary for the city to discharge these
responsibilities.



      (2)   Controls help ensure that assets are not exposed to
unauthorized access and use, transactions are properly recorded in the
financial records, and the resultant financial information is reliable.
External organizations and stakeholders of the city rely on financial
information to make decisions toward appropriations, loans and other debt,
grants, and other contractual relationships. City resources are dependent
upon the system of internal control. Auditors are required annually to report
upon the adequacy of the city’s systems for control over financial
reporting and compliance per I.C. 5-11-l-27(e). The safeguarding of city
assets and the reliability that the city and others can place upon its
financial records is dependent upon the effectiveness of the internal control
process.



      (3)   As the fiscal body, the Common Council expects the city
administration to effect an internal control environment with policies and
procedures necessary to provide reasonable assurance that practices cause
effective and efficient operations, reliable financial reporting, and
compliance with applicable laws and regulations.



      (4)   The system of internal control is meant to keep the city
on course toward its mission and to minimize surprises. The system promotes
efficiency, minimizes risks of asset loss, helps ensure the reliability of
financial information, and compliance with applicable laws, rules, and
regulations.



      (5)   Internal control is a process; a means to an end, and
not an end unto itself. The control environment is the foundation upon which
all components of internal control are based. It sets the tone for city
operations. Internal control is about people, operations, communications, and
the work environment. It is not about policies and forms, though it takes
shape through the implementation of relevant policies, procedures, and
practices. Internal control can provide reasonable assurance, but no system
of control can provide absolute assurance to the Common Council and other
users of financial information.



      (6)   The Finance Department shall be charged with:



         (a)   Conveying periodic messages of the city’s
internal control philosophy and expectations to all appropriate employees;



         (b)   Evaluating the city’s internal control system
for weaknesses on a periodic (but no less frequently than annual) basis,
providing solutions to any discovered weaknesses, and informing employees of
necessary changes in procedure;



         (c)   Working alongside the newly formed Human Resources
Department to establish a confidential reporting system for individuals to
report suspected fraud and abuse of internal control policies; and



         (d)   Working alongside the newly formed Human Resources
Department to institute procedures to address violations of policies and
consequences for violations.



   (B)   Principle 2:  The oversight body oversees the entity's
internal control system.  As the fiscal body for the city, the Common
Council is responsible for setting the institutional expectations for
internal control, ensuring management is aware of the those expectations,
requiring the upward communications channels are open through all levels of
management, and evaluating management’s effectiveness toward monitoring the
control environment and implementing sound control policies and procedures.
As the city’s chief fiscal officer, the Clerk-Treasurer will be the Common
Council’s chief agent in implementing and managing the internal control
policies and procedures.



   (C)   Principle 3: Management establishes an organizational
structure, assigns responsibility, and delegates authority to achieve the
entity's objectives.



      (1)   Individuals with delegated approval authority, e.g.,
elected officials, Board of Works and Safety appointees, and department heads
are responsible for establishing, maintaining, and supporting a system of
internal controls within their areas of responsibility, and for creating the
control environment that encourages compliance with city policies and
procedures.



      (2)   Adequate supervision is necessary to monitor that
internal controls are operating as intended, and to help ensure the
reliability of accounting and operational controls by pointing out errors,
omissions, exceptions, and inconsistencies in procedures. All staff members
in leadership roles are responsible for the application of this policy and
the design, development, implementation, and maintenance of systems of
internal controls focusing on the effectiveness of operations and the
safeguarding of assets within their respective areas of responsibility. All
levels of management and supervision are responsible for strengthening
internal controls when weaknesses are detected. Department managers should
periodically review departmental procedures to ensure that the general
principles of internal control are being followed.



      (3)   The Finance Department has the primary responsibility
for internal control over financial reporting and compliance with applicable
laws, rules, and regulations. The Clerk-Treasurer is the city’s chief
source for information and assistance to staff and department heads on this
topic, and will make resources available to assist in administering this
policy.



      (4)   The Mayor, department heads and Board of Public Works
and Safety members are responsible for internal controls over employee
recruitment, hiring, separation, promotion, job classification, employee
rights, and salary administration.



      (5)   The Clerk-Treasurer and members of the Common Council
are the city sources for information and assistance on this topic, and will
make resources available to assist in administering this policy.



      (6)   All levels of internal control are subject to
examination by external auditors who are required to report on the adequacy
of internal controls over finance and compliance. Department heads are
responsible for prompt corrective action on all internal control findings and
recommendations made by internal and external auditors. The audit process is
completed only after department heads receive the audit results and take
action to correct internal control weaknesses, improve systems, or
demonstrate that management action is not warranted. Department heads have
the responsibility to ensure that those who report to them have adequate
knowledge, skills, and abilities to function within, and contribute to, an
effective internal control environment. This includes providing access to
appropriate training on topics relevant to their job responsibilities.



   (D)   Principle 4: Management demonstrates a commitment to recruit,
develop, and retain competent individuals.



      (1)   The city employee handbook provides a roadmap for
recruiting and maintaining quality employees. Prior to employment,
individuals may be subject to pre-employment background screening. While
employed full time, city employees are entitled to a benefits package,
including health insurance and certain other post-employment benefits. The
city will continue to assess the best recruitment pools and tools for the
different skill sets of skills necessary to adequately implement and maintain
quality internal controls.



      (2)   Job descriptions will be updated where necessary to
reflect internal control responsibilities and duties. Employees will be
regularly trained in internal control methods and all training will be
documented in employees’ personnel files. Employees will be regularly
evaluated by their supervisors on internal control duties and receive
feedback on possible improvements.



   (E)   Principle 5: Management evaluates performance and holds
individuals accountable for their internal control responsibilities. 
Individuals are held accountable for their internal control responsibilities
through a recognized structure that includes relevant job descriptions,
operating procedures, periodic reviews, regular feedback, and a progressive
disciplinary policy. Additionally, city administration seeks to address
issues in specific departments and positions through regular one-on-ones with
department heads.



(Res. 2016-15, passed 12-14-16)



§ 37.04  COMPONENT TWO:  RISK ASSESSMENT.



   (A)   Principle 6:  Management defines objectives clearly to enable
the identification of risks and risk tolerances.



      (1)   Through the creation of standard operating procedures
and accurate organizational reporting charts, management conveys and
identifies objectives, missions, policies, and risk tolerances to employees.



      (2)   The Finance and/or Human Resources Departments will lead
a risk analysis of three major areas:



         (a)   The effectiveness and efficiency of operations.



         (b)   The reliability of reporting for internal and
external use.



         (c)   Compliance with applicable laws and regulations.



      (3)   For each category, the Finance and/or Human Resources
Department will define objectives in specific measurable terms in order to
enable the design of internal control for related risk, to increase
understanding at all levels, to assess performance, to identify what is to be
achieved, who is to achieve it, how it will be achieved, when it will be
achieved, and to incorporate external requirements.



   (B)   Principle 7:  Management identifies, analyzes, and responds
to risks related to achieving the defined objectives.



      (1)   The Finance Department will identify, analyze and
respond to the risks identified in Principle 6 by determining:



         (a)   How likely is the risk to occur?



         (b)   How will it impact the objective?



         (c)   Is the risk based on complex or unusual
transactions?



         (d)   Is the risk based on fraud?



      (2)   Once each risk has been identified and analyzed, the
Finance Department or the Human Resources Department will work with
department heads to determine how to respond to each risk with a specific
solution and action.



   (C)   Principle 8: Management considers the potential for fraud when
identifying, analyzing, and responding to risks.  Management is committed to
fraud prevention by utilizing a “trust but verify” approach. The
potential for fraud, misappropriation, and outright theft are contemplated as
controls are designed for various city divisions. Fraud responses will
include statutorily required responses to fraud, including but not limited
to, I.C. 5-11-1-27(l), relating to the report of misappropriation of funds to
State Board of Accounts, and prosecuting attorney, and I.C. 5-11-l-27(j),
relating to the report of material variances, losses, shortages or thefts to
the State Board of Accounts. The city shall utilize a materiality threshold
as outlined in §§ 37.20 et seq.



   (D)   Principle 9:  Management identifies, analyzes, and responds
to significant changes that could impact the internal control system.  The
Finance Department, in coordination with department heads, will regularly
evaluate and adjust internal control policies in order to accommodate for the
impact of future changes, including but not limited to, personnel changes,
newly elected officials, new programs, new technology, new laws and
regulations, and financial fluctuations.



(Res. 2016-15, passed 12-14-16)



§ 37.05  COMPONENT THREE:  CONTROL ACTIVITIES.



   (A)   Principle 10:  Management designs control activities to
achieve objectives and respond to risks.



      (1)   The Finance Department will establish and maintain a
system of internal controls that satisfies the city’s objectives in the
following categories:



         (a)   Risks are identified and effectively managed;



         (b)   Safeguarding of city assets;



         (c)   Reliability and integrity of financial information;



         (d)   Compliance with city policy, plans, procedures,
laws and regulations;



         (e)   Economical and efficient use of city resources;



         (f)   Meeting established objectives and goals for city
operations and programs.



      (2)   General internal control principles for departments are:



         (a)   Separation of duties.



            1.   Duties are separated so that one person’s
work routinely serves as a check on another’s work.



            2.   No one person has complete control over more
than one key function or activity (e.g., authorizing, approving, certifying,
disbursing, receiving, or reconciling).



         (b)    Authorization and approval.



            1.    Proposed transactions are authorized when
proper and consistent with city policy and the department’s plans.



            2.    Transactions are approved by the person who
has delegated approval authority, which is usually delegated on the basis of
special competency or knowledge.



         (c)   Custodial and security arrange-ments.



            1.    Responsibility for physical security/custody
of city assets is separated from record keeping/accounting for those assets.



            2.    Unauthorized access to city assets and
institutional data is prevented.



         (d)   Timely and accurate review and reconciliation.



            1.    Departmental accounting records and
documents are examined by employees who have sufficient understanding of the
city accounting and financial systems to verify that recorded transactions
actually took place and were made in accordance with city policies and
procedures.



            2.    Departmental accounting records and
documentation are compared with city accounting system reports and financial
statements to verify their reasonableness, accuracy, and complete-ness.



         (e)   The general internal control principles should be
applied to all departmental operations, especially accounting records and
reports, payroll, purchasing/receiving/disbursemen t approval, equipment and
supply inventories, cash receipts, petty cash and change funds, billing and
accounts receivable.



      (3)   All city systems, processes, operations, functions, and
activities are subject to evaluations of internal control systems. The
results of these evaluations provide information regarding the city's overall
system of control.



      (4)   Information and communication.  Information must be
timely and communicated in a manner that enables people to carry out their
responsibilities.



         (a)   All covered employees must be trained on internal
controls according to I.C. 5-11-1-27(g). All personnel must receive a clear
message from the city’s administration that control responsibilities are to
be taken seriously. Failure to comply with established practices will subject
individuals to the terms of disciplinary action or dismissal.



         (b)   Employees must understand their own roles in the
internal control system, as well as how individual activities relate to the
work of others. To this end, whenever a new budgetary unit, financial
activity, and the like is set up, the Clerk-Treasurer will provide
notification to the appropriate parties of the responsibilities incumbent on
them for good business practices and sound financial management, including
reference to the principles within this policy.



         (c)   Employees must have a means of communicating
significant information to the city’s administration.



         (d)   The city must communicate effectively with
external parties, such as auditors, creditors, contractors, suppliers,
regulators and other stakeholders.



      (5)   Internal control is meant to keep the city focused on
achieving its mission while avoiding surprises. There is a balance between
effective controls and mission accomplishment. Costs associated with internal
controls should not exceed their benefit, nor should controls be allowed to
stifle mission effectiveness and timely action. All levels of management must
assess the costs, benefits, and risks when designing controls to develop a
positive control environment and compensate for the risks of noncompliance,
loss of assets, or unreliable reporting while accomplishing the city mission.



   (B)   The following specific internal control policies are adopted
for use by city departments.



      (1)   Payroll activities.



         (a)   Salaries and wage rates are verified by the

         (c)   The responsibilities for approving time sheets are
segregated from those for preparing payroll transactions or inputting data.

checks.



         (f)   Vendor checks are accounted for in numerical order
and reconciled to the disbursement ledger.



         (g)   Invoices or other receipts are attached to each
claim to support the disbursement.



         (h)   A review is completed by another individual
outside of the disbursement process or the Clerk-Treasurer, in which the
claim amount is compared to the supporting documentation attached to the
claim and the amount of the check.



         (i)   Access to disbursement applica-tions is
appropriately controlled by user logins and passwords.



      (3)   Receipting activities (provided enough employees,
including the Clerk-Treasurer, are available to comply).



         (a)   The responsibility for collecting money and
issuing receipts is segregated from those making the bank deposit.



         (b)   The responsibility for making bank deposits is
segregated from those preparing the monthly bank reconcilement.



         (c)   Pre-numbered receipts are issued for all money

receipts.



         (e)   Posting of receipts to the ledger is completed by
an individual other than the one who collects money and makes the deposit.



         (f)   Receipts indicate the type of payment received
(cash, check, and the like) and this is reconciled to the make-up of the bank
deposit.



      (4)   Cash activities.



         (a)   A reconcilement between the receipts ledger and
the credits to the bank account is completed monthly during the bank

Clerk-Treasurer as often as he or she deems necessary, and whenever a
department head is replaced.



      (5)   Credit card transactions.



         (a)   The Office of the Clerk-Treasurer oversees the
issuance and use of the credit cards.



         (b)   Section § 30.07.3  specifically states the
purposes for which the credit card may be used.



         (c)   A designated person separate from disbursement
process reviews transactions listed on the credit card statements for
sufficient documentation and inclusion in claims to the Board of Works.



   (C)   Principle 11:  Management designs the political
subdivision’s information system and related control activities to achieve
objectives and respond to risks.  The Finance Department and department
heads will work with the Information Technology Depart-ment to ensure that
information technology is used as an integral part of the internal control
system. This may include, but not be limited to:



      (1)   Setting permission such that only certain users may
perform certain tasks;



      (2)   Using technology to accomplish segregation of duties by
forcing duties to be completed by different users;



      (3)   Automating certain processes and calculations;



      (4)   Limiting the authority to access different components of

      (8)   Requiring the use of prescribed forms or the approval of
alternative forms



   (D)   Principle 12:  Management implements control activities
through policies.  The city has an employee handbook that is updated to
communicate policies to employees. Additionally, the Finance Department
regularly works with departments and employees who handle financial
transactions to recommend and ensure best practices. All procedures are in
writing and communicated frequently to all relevant employees. Policies are
available.



(Res. 2016-15, passed 12-14-16)



§ 37.06  COMPONENT FOUR:  INFORMATION AND COMMUNICATION.



   (A)   Principle 13:  Management uses quality information to achieve
the political subdivision's objectives. The city strives to lead in the areas
of financial transparency and accountability. By adopting standards and
investing in systems that exceed state-mandated minimums, city management
provides employees and stakeholders with high quality information and
information systems.



   (B)   Principle 14: Management internally communicates the necessary
quality information to achieve the political subdivision's objectives. 
Internal communications on internal controls are communicated through
adoption of formal policies by relevant boards and commissions and/or the
legislative body, or documented through memos from the finance, legal or
relevant department head. Internal memos and reports are maintained to
document communication.



   (C)   Principle 15:  Management externally communicates the
necessary quality information to achieve the entity's objectives. 
Communications with the State Board of Accounts, other state agencies,
grantor agencies, and regulatory agencies are documented by email, memos,
letters, and other forms of written correspondence. All documents are
maintained in accordance with the city and state’s record retention
policies. Reports and policies are cross checked for accuracy, relevancy, and
timeliness of information.



(Res. 2016-15, passed 12-14-16)



§ 37.07  COMPONENT FIVE:  MONITORING ACTIVITIES.



   (A)   Principle 16: Management establishes and operates monitoring
activities to monitor the internal control system and evaluate the results.



      (1)   City administration monitors and evaluates compliance
with internal control policies via multiple vectors. Separation of duties,
redundancy polices, layered approval systems, monthly reports, and physical
controls such as video monitoring allow management to both review and
evaluate control systems.



      (2)   The Finance Department shall implement a system of
monitoring that includes:



         (a)   Periodic checks to determine if controls are in

GENERAL



§ 50.001  RULES AND REGULATIONS.



   The following rules and regulations for the use of electricity and
protection of equipment shall be in force:



   (A)   Consumers shall make written application for service at the
office of the Utility-Cashier at least 24 hours prior to the time service is
required, specifying in the application the location and kind of service
required.



   (B)   Consumers, moving or in any manner changing the location or
nature of the service, shall notify the Utility-Cashier at once of such
change, and any new consumer desiring service at such vacated or changed
location shall immediately make application for service at such location.



   (C)   The Superintendent of the Light Department shall locate the
point of service entrance and the location of the meter, which shall be as
close as possible under the circumstances to the city's service lines.



   (D)   No meter shall hereafter be located inside any residence or in
any other building or structure where such meter will not be plainly visible
and at all times accessible to the Superintendent of the Light Department,
and at a height it can be easily read from the floor.  All meters installed
prior to the enactment of this chapter may be changed by agreement with the
consumer.



   (E)   When service to any consumer is discontinued, by reason of
such consumer having vacated  the  location  served  or  on  account 
of delinquency in the payment of any charge against such consumer, and in the
judgment of the Superintendent of the Light Department the service entrance
of the meter at such location is inconveniently or improperly located,
service shall not be restored, continued, or renewed at such location until
such service entrance or meter is relocated or changed to a place designated
by the Superintendent.



   (F)   Whenever any new service entrance is located or changed, or
any meter is installed or its location changed, each installation shall be
made with a type of cable and in such boxes or receptacles that can be sealed
so that such meter cannot in any manner be tampered with, wired around, or in
any other manner interfered with to prevent its registering the correct
amount of current passing through.



   (G)   (1)   No consumer shall be hereafter connected or
reconnected for service by the Light Department or entitled to receive
electricity from that Department until such consumer shall apply at the
office of the Utility-Cashier for such service, pay all delinquencies, if
any, standing against such consumer, and make a deposit with such
Utility-Cashier according to the class of service desired, as follows:



         (a)   For residence connection, two months estimated
electrical bill, but in no event less than $25.



         (b)   For office connection, two months estimated
electrical bill, but in no event, less than $25.



         (c)   For power connection, two months estimated
electrical bill, but in no event less than $25.



      (2)   The deposit shall be held and retained by the
Utility-Cashier for the use and benefit of such consumer, and shall be
returned to the consumer with interest at the rate of 3% per annum from the
time of deposit whenever the consumer shall discontinue the use of such
service, after deducting therefrom any amount that may be owing by the
consumer to the city as a charge for such service.  No interest shall be
paid on deposits held less than six months.



   (H)   No consumer shall be permitted to resell the current furnished
to him or her at a higher rate than billed to him.



   (I)   (1)   The meters furnished to measure and register the
current furnished to consumers are the absolute property of the city and
moving, altering, tampering with, connecting, or disconnecting such meters or
meter equipment, or connection, or in any manner rendering the same
inaccessible or difficult to read by the Superintendent or authorized
employees of the Light Department, is prohibited.



      (2)   Authorized employees or representatives of the city
shall have the right of access to its meters or meter equipment at all
reasonable hours for the purposes of inspecting, testing, or reading the same.



   (J)   The city shall have the right to discontinue service for any
of the following reasons:



      (1)   While making repairs or alterations to the system or any
part thereof.



      (2)   Breakdown in generating or distributing system.



      (3)   Nonpayment of bills when due.



      (4)   Interfering or tampering with equipment, appliances,
meters, or connections.



      (5)   Failure on the part of any consumer to comply with these
rules.



      (6)   Whenever, in the judgment of the Superintendent of the
Light Department, the wiring in or on consumer's premises is in such
condition as to be dangerous.



(Ord. 1960-10, passed 6-1-60)  ('66 Code, § 30.08)



§ 50.002  SERVICE INSTALLATION.



   The Light Department shall place all services from  its pole line to
the attachments  on  consumer's buildings or structures, or other point
designated by the city.  The consumer shall furnish proper entrance therefor
as described in the rules and regulations of the Electric Department of the
city.



(Ord. 1961-11, passed 3-22-61)  ('66 Code, § 30.04)



§ 50.003  METER INSTALLATIONS.



   (A)   All meters shall be the property of the city, and shall be
installed by and under the control of the city, but the consumer shall

   (B)   No person shall move, tamper with, connect, or disconnect such
meter or meter equipment.



   (C)   Whoever violates any provision of this section shall be fined
not more than $300 for each offense.



('66 Code, §§ 30.05, 30.99)



§ 50.004  INOPERATIVE METERS.



   When any meter shall fail to register, charges for service shall be
made and paid for by the consumer as provided by Rule 19 of the Public
Service Commission of Indiana Standards, provided the amount of current used
by the consumer for any similar past period may be used as the basis of
charges for the period during which the meter failed to register.



('66 Code, § 30.06)



§ 50.005  COMPLAINTS.



   All complaints as to the amount of bills or reading must be filed by
the consumer at the office of the Billing Department before the bill becomes
delinquent.  No credit shall be given on any bill because of any defect,
trouble, or insufficiency of the lines or wiring in the building or other
structure of the consumer.  However, if such consumer presents a 
reasonable  excuse for not making  such  complaint within the time above
specified, such adjustments may be made at any time thereafter.



('66 Code, § 30.06)



§ 50.006  PAYMENT OF BILLS; COLLECTION CHARGE; INSUFFICIENT FUNDS.



   (A)   Electric service bills are issued monthly.  They are due upon
receipt, and are payable to the cashier at the office of the utility during
regular office hours.  All other employees of the city or utility are
expressly prohibited from receiving payments for utility bills.



   (B)   If payment is not made on or before 15 days from the date of
the bill, the account is then delinquent and the collection charge in the
amount of 10% of the first $3 of the bill plus 3% of the excess of $3 as
provided in the rate subchapter is applicable. If payment is not made within
the next five days, the customer is informed by mail that the service is
subject to disconnection, without further notice.



   (C)   In case of disconnection for nonpayment of the bill, the
customer will not be reconnected until he has paid the reconnection charge
plus all amounts owed to the utility, or make an arrangement for their
payment which is satisfactory to the utility.



   (D)   The utility shall not be required to restore service on the
date delinquent bills are paid unless the payment is made prior to 2:00 p.m.
of this same  day. When payment of delinquent bills is made after 2:00 p.m.,
the service will not be restored until after 8:00 a.m. on the next work day.



   (E)   In addition to rates for service, when it is necessary for an
employee of the electric utility to go to a consumer's premises to collect a
delinquent bill, a collection charge of $10 will be made.



   (F)   When a check that was received in payment of a consumer’s
account is returned unpaid by the bank for any reason (not the fault of the
electric utility) the consumer shall be assessed a handling  charge of $30
for each check returned by the bank.

nonpayment of bills, a charge of $20 must be paid by the consumer before the
service is reconnected.



   (B)   When service has been disconnected by the electric utility at
the customers option, a request to reconnect service during normal business
hours will require a reconnect charge of $20 prior to service being restored.



   (C)   If the consumer, at their option, requests service to be
restored after normal business hours, as provided above under payment of
bills, a charge of $80 must be paid prior to reconnection.

§ 50.008  DAMAGE TO UTILITY FACILITIES.



   If a consumer causes damage to any facility of the utility, the
consumer shall be responsible for all costs associated with repairing or
replacing the damaged facilities.



(Ord.  1988-20, passed 9-8-88; Am. Ord. 1993-8, passed 8-26-93)



§ 50.009  CONSUMER FALSE CALL-OUT.



   When a consumer calls the utility for service restoration or repairs on
the consumer's premises and it is determined that the problem is confined to
the consumer's property or facilities (such as tripped breaker, blown fuse,
faulty wiring, and the like), a service charge of $20 may be assessed toward
the consumer's account.

§ 50.011  CAPITAL COST REIMBURSEMENT REQUIREMENTS FOR DEVELOPERS REQUIRING
ON-SITE ELECTRIC DISTRIBUTION FACILITIES.



   (A)   The Municipal Electric Utility is authorized to collect from
sub-division developers, prior to the installation of on-site electric
distribution facilities, the cost of said on-site distribution system
extension, including, but not limited to, overhead and underground lines,
transformers, labor and engineering costs, but excluding the cost of
individual customer service lines and metering equipment.



   (B)   The cost for the on-site distribution system extension shall
be determined by the Common Council with a listing of the cost to be
published and available to all developers or interested persons through the
office of the City Engineer and the electric utility offices.  The on-site
availability fee of $800 per lot shall be applicable to all residential
subdivision developments within the city which do not have recorded plats or
have not received approval by the Greenfield Plan Commission of its detailed
unit development plat prior to January 23, 1997.  Provided, however, that
the fee shall be increased to $1,300 per lot for all plats which have not
recorded prior to July 1, 2005, or which have not received preliminary
approval by the Greenfield Plan Commission prior to July 1, 2005, or which
fee has not been paid prior to July 1, 2005.



   (C)   The capital costs, as determined by the Common Council, shall
be submitted by the electric utility offices by the developer prior to the
construction of the on-site electric distribution facilities.



   (D)   The Common Council hereby authorizes the establishment of a
fee to be paid in conjunction with the issuance of the building permit to
reimburse the electric utility the cost of providing the extension of service
to an individual customer.  The fee shall be applicable to all new
customers, residential or non- residential, locating within the city’s
assigned service territory after January 23, 1997, and shall be $500 per
meter, which includes the meter base fee.



   (E)   The fee, as set by the Common Council, shall be paid to the
electric utility and a copy of the receipt evidencing such payment shall be
submitted in conjunction with the application for a building permit.

§ 50.012  REMOVAL FROM JURISDICTION OF INDIANA UTILITY REGULATORY
COMMISSION.



   The city's electric utility shall be removed from the jurisdiction of
the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission for approval of rates and charges
and of the issuance of stocks, bonds, notes, or other evidence of
indebtedness.



(Ord. 2002-3, passed 2-14-02)



§ 50.013  PAYMENT IN LIEU OF TAXES.



   The municipal electric utility of the city shall annually provide to
the civil city an amount the civil city could have received if the municipal
electric utility property were publicly owned, and therefore, directs the
municipal electric utility to pay to the civil city an amount not to exceed
1.5% of the gross revenue of the prior calendar year, as decided by the
Common Council in its annual budget, with one- twelfth of said amount to be
paid monthly to the Clerk-Treasurer.

§ 50.014  NET METERING TARIFF.



   (A)   Availability.



      (1)   Net metering is provided upon request and on a
first-come, first-served basis. Net metering is available to residential,
commercial, and industrial customers in good standing that own and operate an
eligible solar, wind, biomass, geothermal, hydroelectric, or other renewable
generation source. The name plate rating of customer's generator must not
exceed 10 kW. Customers served under this tariff must also take service from
the Utility under the otherwise applicable standard service tariff.



      (2)   Total net metering participation under this tariff is
limited to a total name plate rating of all customers' generators of
one-tenth of one percent (0.1%) of the Utility's most recent summer peak load.



   (B)   Definitions. For the purpose of this chapter the following
definitions shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a
different meaning.



      NET METERING, Measuring the difference in an applicable billing
period between the amount of electricity supplied by Utility to customer who
generates electricity using an eligible solar, wind, biomass, geothermal,
hydroelectric or other renewable generation source and the amount of
electricity generated by such respective customer that is delivered to
Utility.



   (C)   Billing. Monthly charges for energy and demand, where
applicable, to serve the customer's net or total load shall be determined
according to the Utility's standard service tariff under which the customer
otherwise would be served, absent the customer's eligible net metering
facility. The measurement of net energy supplied by Utility and delivered to
Utility shall be calculated in the following manner. Utility shall measure
the difference between the amount of electricity delivered by Utility to
customer and the amount of electricity generated by the customer and
delivered to Utility during the billing period, in accordance with normal
metering practices. If the kWh delivered by Utility to the customer exceeds
the kWh delivered by the customer to Utility during the billing period, the
customer shall be billed for the kWh difference. If the kWh generated by the
customer and delivered to Utility exceeds the kWh supplied by the Utility to
customer during the billing period, the customer shall be credited in the
next billing cycle for the kWh difference. When customer elects to
discontinue net metering service, any unused credit will be granted to
Utility. The Utility shall not purchase or wheel power produced by net
metering facilities. Bill charges and credits will be in accordance with the
standard tariff that would apply if the customer did not participate in net
metering under this tariff.



   (D)   Metering. The customer's standard meter, if capable of
measuring electricity in both directions, will be used. If Utility determines
new metering is necessary, the Utility will install metering capable of net
metering at the customer's expense. Additionally, the Utility reserves the
right to install, at its own expense, a meter to measure the output of the
solar, wind, biomass, geothermal, hydroelectric, or other renewable
generation system.



   (E)   Terms and conditions.



      (1)   In order to be eligible for net metering, the customer's
generator must meet the following requirements:



         (a)   All kWh must be generated from the output of
solar, wind, biomass, geothermal, hydroelectric, or other renewable
generation sources;



         (b)   The generation equipment must be operated by the
customer and located on the customer's premises;



         (c)   The generator must operate in parallel with the
Utility's transmission and distribution facilities without adversely
affecting the Utility's system and equipment and without presenting safety
hazards or threats to the reliability of service to the Utility, its
personnel and other customers;



         (d)   The customer's generation must be intended

NON-RECURRING CHARGES



§ 50.200  SCHEDULE OF NON-RECURRING CHARGES.



   (A)   Payment of bills.



      (1)   Electric service bills are issued monthly. They are due
upon receipt, and are payable to the cashier at the office of the utility
during regular office hours or in the drop box at City Hall after hours.



      (2)   All other employees of the city or the utility are
expressly prohibited from receiving payment for utility bills.



      (3)   If payment is not made two days from the due date of the
bill, the account is then delinquent and the “collection charge” in the
amount of 3% of the current unpaid balance as provided in the rate schedule
is applicable. If payment is not made within the due date, the customer is
informed by mail that the service is subject to disconnection, without
further notice.



      (4)   In case of disconnection for non-payment of the bill,
the customer will not be reconnected until he or she has paid the
reconnection charge plus all amounts owed to the utility, or make an
arrangement for his or her payment which is satisfactory to the utility.



   (B)   Collection charge. In addition to rates for service when it is
necessary for an employee of the electric utility to go to a consumer’s
premises to collect a delinquent bill, a collection charge of $50.00 will be
made. After business hours service charge is $100.00.



   (C)   Disconnection charge. When service has been disconnected by
the electric utility for non-payment of bills, a charge of $50.00 must be
paid by the consumer before such service is reconnected. After business hours
service charge is $100.00.



   (D)   Reconnection charge.



      (1)   When service has been disconnected by the electric
utility at the customer’s option, a request to reconnect service during

the fault of the electric utility), the consumer shall be assessed a handling
charge of $30.00 for each check returned by the bank.



   (F)   Consumer false callout. When a consumer calls the utility for
service restoration or repairs on the consumer’s premises and it is
determined that the problem is confined to the consumer’s property or
facilities (such as a tripped breaker, blown fuse, faulty wiring, and the
like), a service charge of $50.00 may be assessed toward the consumer’s
account. The charge for this service after business hours is $100.00.



   (G)   Damage to utility facilities. If a consumer causes damage to
any facility of the utility, the consumer shall be responsible for all costs
associated with repairing or replacing the damaged facilities.

   (A)   Authority.  The city owns and operates the Greenfield
Wastewater Utility. I.C. 36-9-2-16 permits a municipality to  regulate the
furnishing of the service of collecting, processing and disposing of waste
substances and domestic or sanitary sewage to the public. I.C. 36-9-2-18
permits a municipality to exercise powers granted by I.C. 36-9-2-16 in areas
within four miles outside its corporate boundaries. I.C. 8-1.5-6 et seq.
permits the city to adopt a regulatory ordinance which is then submitted to
the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission for its review and approval. The
regulatory ordinance allows the municipality to regulate the furnishing of
wastewater utility service in areas within four miles outside the city’s
corporate boundaries.



   (B)   Agreement. 



      (1)   Pursuant to an agreement between Hancock County Rural
Telephone Corporation d/b/a NineStar Connect and the city, the parties agreed
to an exclusive wastewater service territory for the city within four miles
of the city’s corporate limits.



      (2)   The Hancock County Regional Water and Sewer District
adopted a consent to transfer certified territorial authority, a copy of
which is attached to Ordinance 2016-5 as Exhibit A, in which it approved and
ratified the agreement.



      (3)   The agreement, a copy of which is attached to Ordinance
2016-5 as Exhibit B, is hereby approved. In approving the agreement, the city
understands and affirms that the agreement and  Ordinance 2016-5 shall not,
in any way, prevent the city from:



         (a)   Later seeking and obtaining from the Hancock
Regional Water and Sewer District the right to serve any area within the
District's jurisdiction;



         (b)   Retaining any and all rights to acquire any or all
of NineStar's assets used in providing wastewater services in the additional
service area; or



         (c)   Exercising any power it has under I.C. 8-1.5-1-1
et seq. or 36-9-23-1 et seq.



   (C)   Wastewater service area.



      (1)   The City of Greenfield Wastewater Service Area is hereby
defined and established as those areas within the corporate boundaries of the
city, as well as certain areas within four miles outside the city’s
boundaries, as shown on the map attached to Ordinance 2016-5 as Exhibit C.



      (2)   Upon the adoption of Ordinance 2016-5 and its approval
by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, the city shall hold an
exclusive license to furnish wastewater service within the City of Greenfield
Wastewater Service Area, and the Greenfield Water Utility shall be the
exclusive provider of wastewater to the public within the City of Greenfield
Wastewater Service Area.



      (3)   Upon the adoption of Ordinance 2016-5 and its approval

relating to pretreatment or control facilities shall be submitted for
approval of the city and the State of Indiana, and no construction of 
such  facilities shall be commenced  until  written approval is granted. 
Where such facilities are provided, they shall be maintained continuously in
satisfactory and effective operating order by the owner at his expense, and
shall be subject to periodic inspection by the city to determine that such
facilities are being operated in conformance with applicable federal, state,
and local laws and permits.  The owner shall maintain operating records, and
shall submit to the city a monthly summary report of the character of the
influent and effluent to show performance of the treatment facilities and for
comparison against city monitoring records.



   (C)   Unpolluted water from air conditioners, cooling and condensing
systems, or swimming pools shall be discharged to a storm sewer, where it is
available, or to a combined sewer approved by the city.  Where a storm sewer
is not available, discharge may be to a natural outlet approved by the city
and by the State of Indiana.  Where a storm sewer, combined sewer, or
natural sewer is not available, such unpolluted water may be discharged to a
sanitary sewer pending written approval by the city.



   (D)   Industrial cooling water, which may be polluted with insoluble
oils or grease or suspended solids, shall be pretreated for removal of
pollutants and the resultant clear water shall be discharged in accordance

§ 51.11  SAMPLES; REPORTS.



   (A)   The city may require users of the treatment works, other than
residential users, to supply pertinent information on wastewater flows
characteristics.  Such measurements, tests, and analyses shall be made at
the users' expense.  If the City Engineer and/or the Superintendent of the
Sewer Treatment Plant requests measurements, test and analyses or other
information from the user which the user either refuses or fails to provide,
the city may obtain all such information deemed necessary with the cost for
collecting, measuring, testing, and analyses of any samples to be charged to
the user as a part of the user's next monthly sewer utility statement.



   (B)   The strength of wastewaters shall be determined, for periodic
establishment of charges provided for in §§ 51.20 through 51.26, from
samples taken at the aforementioned structure at any period of time and of
such duration and in such manner as the city may elect, or at any place
mutually agreed on between the user and the city. Appropriate charges for
sampling and analysis may be assessed to the user at the option of the
city.  The results of routine sampling and analysis by the user may also be
used for determination of charges after verification by the city.



   (C)   Users of the treatment works shall immediately notify the city
of any unusual flows or wastes that are discharged accidentally or otherwise
to the sewer system.

§ 51.22  SEWER RATES.



   For the use of and the service rendered by the sewage works, rates and
charges shall be collected from the owners of each and every lot, parcel of
real estate, or building that is connected with the city sanitary system or
otherwise discharges sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water, or other
liquids, either directly or indirectly, into the sanitary sewerage system of
the city. Such rates and charges include user charges, debt service costs,
excessive strength surcharges, and other service charges, which rates and
charges shall be payable as hereinafter provided and shall be in an amount
determinable as follows:



   (A)   The sewage rates and charges shall be based on the quantity of
water used on or in the property or premises subject to such rates and
charges, as the same is measured by the water meter there in use, plus a base
charge based on the size of the water meter installed, except as herein
otherwise provided.  Water meters will be read once each month, and sewage
service bills shall be rendered once each month (or period equalling a
month).  The water usage schedule on which the amount of said rates and
charges shall be determined shall be as follows:



      (1)   Flow rate.



         Rate per 1,000 gallons of metered usage for all user
classes    $ 3.16

*Provided,  however,  that when the Potts Ditch Sewage Works Revenue Bonds
of 2014 have been fully retired, then the above stated monthly base rate
shall be reduced by $2.50.





 



   (B)   For the service rendered to the city, the city shall be
subject to the same rates and charges hereinabove provided.



   (C)   There shall be a charge of $15 per sample for each industrial
sample taken by the city.  The charge shall be revised on the same basis as
all other rates and charges and shall reflect the actual cost incurred by the
city.  The results of the sampling shall be the basis for excessive strength
surcharges and industrial cost recovery charges as required by PL 92-500 and
subsequent amendments and revisions.



   (D)   The Board is authorized to enter into special rate contracts
with customers of the sewage works where clearly definable reductions in cost
to the sewage works can be determined, and such reduction shall be limited to
such reduced costs.  Such proposed contracts shall be subject to the
approval of the Common Council.

§ 51.23  WATER FURNISHED FROM OTHER THAN CITY SUPPLY; SPRINKLING RATE.



   (A)   The quantity of water discharged into the sanitary sewerage
system and obtained from sources other than the utility that serves the city
shall be determined by the city in such manner as the city shall reasonably
elect, and the sewage service shall be billed at the above appropriate
rates.  Further, as is hereinafter provided in this section, the city may
make proper allowance in determining the sewage bill for quantities of water
shown on the records to be consumed, but which are also shown to the
satisfaction of the city that such quantities do not enter the sanitary
sewage system.



   (B)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate, or building
discharging sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water, or other liquids into
the city sanitary sewage system, either directly or indirectly, is not a user
of water supplied by the water utility serving the city, and the water used
thereon or therein is not measured by a water meter, or is measured by a
water meter not acceptable to the city, then the amount of water used shall
be otherwise measured or determined by the city.  In order to ascertain the
rate or charge provided in this chapter, the owner or other interested party
shall, at his expense, install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric
measuring devices, or any adequate and approved method of measurement
acceptable to the city for the determination of sewage discharge.  If there
is no meter or any adequate and approved method of measurement for
residential lots or residential parcels of real estate, then the service
charge for such sewage service shall be $30.00 per month.  For all other
unmetered users, the rate shall be determined by the city on an individual
basis by applying the above rates to estimated usage.



   (C)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate, or building
discharging sanitary sewage, industrial  wastes,  water,  or  other 
liquids  into  the  city's sanitary sewerage system, either directly or
indirectly, is a user of water supplied by the water utility serving the city
and, in addition, is a user of water from another source which is not
measured by a  water  meter  or  is  measured by a meter not acceptable
to the city, then the amount of water used shall be otherwise measured or
determined by the city.  In order to ascertain the rates or charges, the
owner or other interested parties shall, at his or their expense, install and
maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices, or any adequate and
approved method of measurement acceptable to the city for the determination
of sewage discharge.



   (D)   During the months of July, August and September, all
residential customers will be eligible for the summer sewer monthly
reduction, hereinafter referred to as “SSMR”, automatically if the
customers were water utility customers for each month during the immediately
preceding March, April and May usage periods. The SSMR formula will be based
upon 125% of the average usage during the March, April and May usage periods
for determination of the related wastewater bill for the July, August and
September billing cycles. It is presumed that any excess water usage is
related to watering lawns, flowers, washing cars and other summer activities
where water used does not enter the city’s sanitary sewer system. If actual
water usage is less than 125% of the computed average usage during the March,
April and May usage periods, the residential user shall only pay for the
actual water used. Simply stated, the SSMR will be the lesser of actual water
usage during July, August and September and the computed 125% of the average
usage during the March, April and May usage periods.



   (E)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate, or building
discharges sanitary sewage, industrial waste, water, or other liquids into
the city’s sanitary sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, and
uses water in excess of 50,000 gallons per month, and it can be shown to the
satisfaction of the city that a portion of water as measured by the water
meter or meters does not and cannot enter the sanitary sewage system, then
the owner or other interested party shall install and maintain meters, weirs,
volumetric measuring devices, or any adequate and approved method of
measurement acceptable to the city for the determination of sewage discharge.

§ 51.24  EQUITABLE ADJUSTMENT.



   (A)   In order that the rates and charges may be justly and
equitably adjusted to the service rendered to industrial users, the city
shall base its charges not only on the volume, but also on strength and
character of the stronger-than-normal domestic sewage and wastes which it is
required to treat and dispose of.  The city shall require the industrial
user to determine the strength and content of all sewage and wastes
discharged, either directly or indirectly, into the sanitary sewage system in
such manner and by such method as the city may deem practicable in the light
of the conditions and attending circumstances of the case, in order to
determine the proper charge.  The industrial user shall furnish a central
sampling point available to the city at all times.



   (B)   Normal sewage domestic waste strength should not exceed a
B.O.D. of 204 milligrams per liter of fluid, suspended solids in excess of
240 milligrams per liter of fluid, or ammonia nitrogen (NH3) in excess of 30
milligrams per liter of fluid.  Additional charges for treating
stronger-than-normal domestic waste shall be made on the following basis:



      (1)   Rate surcharge based on suspended solids.  There shall
be an additional charge of $0.30 per pound for suspended solids in excess of
240 milligrams per liter of fluid.



      (2)   Rate surcharge based on B.O.D. There shall be an
additional charge of $0.30 per pound of B.O.D. for B.O.D. received in excess
of 204 milligrams per liter of fluid.



      (3)   Rate surcharge based of NH3.  There shall be an
additional charge of $0.65 per pound of NH3 in excess of 30 milligrams per
liter of fluid.



   (C)   The determination of suspended solids and five-day B.O.D.
contained in the waste shall be in accordance with the latest copy of
“Standard Methods for  the Examination of Water, Sewage and Industrial
Wastes,” as written by the American Public Health Association, the American
Water Works Association, the Water Pollution Control Federation, and in
conformance with “Guidelines Establishing Test Procedures for Analysis of
Pollutants,” Regulation CFR Part 136, the Federal Register on October 16,
1973.

§ 51.25  BILLING.



   (A)   Such rates and charges shall be prepared, billed, and
collected by the city in the manner provided by law and ordinance.



   (B)   The rates and charges for all users shall be prepared and
billed monthly.



   (C)   The rates and charges may be billed to the tenant or tenants
occupying the properties served, unless otherwise requested in writing by the
owner, but such billing shall in no way relieve the owner from the liability
in the event payment is not made as herein required.  The owners of
properties served, which are occupied by a tenant or tenants, shall have the
right to examine the collection records of the city for the purpose of
determining whether bills have been paid by such tenant or tenants, provided
that such examination shall be made at the office at which said records are
kept and during the hours that such office is open for business.



   (D)   As is provided by statute, all rates and charges not paid when
due are declared to be delinquent, and a penalty of 10% of the rates or
charges shall thereupon attach thereto.  The time at which such rates or
charges shall be paid is now fixed at 15 days after the date of mailing of
the bill.



   (E)   (1)   In order that the rates and charges for sewage
services may remain fair and equitable and be in proportion to the cost of
providing services to the various users of user classes, the city shall cause
a study to be made within a reasonable period of time following  the  first
12 months of operation  after  the date which this section goes into
effect.  Such study shall include, but not be limited to, an analysis of the
costs associated with the treatment of excessive strength effluents from
industrial users or user classes, the financial position of the sewage works,
and the adequacy of its revenue to provide reasonable funds for operation and
maintenance, replacements, debt service requirements, and capital
improvements to the waste treatment systems.



      (2)   Thereafter, on an annual basis, within a reasonable
period of time following the normal accounting period, the city shall cause a
similar study to be made for the purpose of reviewing the fairness and equity
of the rates and charges for sewage services on a continuing basis.  Said
studies shall be conducted by officers or employees of the city, by a firm of
certified public accountants, or a firm of consulting engineers, which firms
shall have experience in such studies, or by such combination of officers,
employees, certified public accountants, or engineers as the city shall
determine to be best under the circumstances.

   For the purpose of §§ 51.30 through 51.35 the following definitions
shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning.



   ACT.  The Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972,
Public Law 92-500, adopted by the 92nd U.S. Congress on October 18, 1972.



   AMOUNTS FOR RECONSTRUCTION AND EXPANSION.  Those amounts which
represent a minimum of 80% of the amount retained by the city, together with
interest earned thereon.  These amounts shall be used solely for the
eligible costs of the expansion or reconstruction of treatment works
associated with the project and necessary to meet the requirements of the
act.  The city shall obtain the written approval of the Regional
Administrator of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency prior to commitment
of the retained amounts for any expansion and reconstruction.  The remaining
20% of retained amounts may be used at the discretion of the city.



   FEDERAL GRANT AMOUNTS.  That portion of the total construction costs
for Project Number C-180611 which was sponsored by the U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency.  The federal grant will amount to approximately
$4,040,000.



   INDUSTRIAL COST RECOVERY PERIOD.  That period during which the grant
amount allocable to the treatment of wastes from industrial users is
recovered from the industrial users of such works, which shall be a period of
30 years.



   INDUSTRIAL USER.  Any nongovernmental user of the treatment works
identified in the Standard Industrial Classification Manual, 1972, Office of
Management and Budget, as amended and supplemented, under the following
divisions:



   (1)   Division A -   Agriculture, Forestry, and Fishing



   (2)   Division B -   Mining



   (3)   Division D -   Manufacturing



   (4)   Division E -   Transportation, Communica-tion, Electric,
Gas, and Sanitary Services



   (5)   Division I -   Services



A user in the divisions listed may be excluded if it is determined that such
will introduce primarily segregated domestic wastes or wastes from sanitary
conveniences.



   NONINDUSTRIAL USER.  Any governmental or residential user.  The term
also includes commercial, institutional, and other industrial users where it
has been determined that the waste contributed by these users is primarily
segregated domestic wastes or wastes from sanitary conveniences.



   PAYMENT TO U.S. TREASURY.  That portion of the recovered amounts that
must be returned to the U.S. Treasury on an annual basis.  The annual
payments to the U.S. Treasury amount to 50% of the annual recovered amounts,
together with interest earned thereon.



   PROJECT NUMBER C-180611.  A separate and distinct construction project
for construction of the Greenfield Municipal Sewage Works which was sponsored
by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under the provisions of Public
Law 92-500.  This project does not include past or future construction,
equipment, or other services not included under the specific project number
and the approved plans, specifications, and approved change orders for the
project which are on file in the City Hall, and by reference made a part of
this chapter as fully as if it were attached hereto or incorporated herein.



   RECOVERED AMOUNTS.  The annual payments from industrial users for
their share of the federal grant allocable to the cost of treating
industrial  waste, which is determined by dividing the amount of the total
federal grant allocable to the treatment of industrial waste by the recovery
period.



   RETAINED AMOUNTS.  That portion of the recovered amounts retained by
the city.  The retained amounts shall be equal to 50% of the recovered
amounts, together with interest earned thereon.



   SEGREGATED DOMESTIC WASTES.  Wastes from nonresidential sources
resulting from normal domestic activities, and measurable and set apart from
industrial trade or process discharges.



(Ord. 1977-21, passed 11-10-77)



§ 51.31  CHARGES; BILLING.



   (A)   In order to comply with the federal regulations, in the case
of federal grant assistance for the construction of waste treatment works,
where it has been determined that industrial users are required to reimburse
a portion of the federal grant amount allocable to the capital cost of
constructing facilities for the treatment of industrial wastes, rates and
charges shall be collected from each industrial user connected to the
Municipal Sewage Works or who otherwise discharges sewage, water, or liquids,
either directly or indirectly, into the Municipal Waste Treatment System,
which charges shall be payable as hereinafter provided, and shall be in an
amount determinable as follows.



   (B)   The industrial cost recovery charges for the treatment of
industrial wastes shall be based on the volume of sewage flow billed to
industrial users, as determined in accordance with appropriate provisions for
determining billed flow included in §§ 51.20 through 51.26.  The strength
and character of industrial wastes shall be measured at the industrial users'
expense as provided for in § 51.24.  The owner or industrial user shall
furnish a central sampling point available to the city at all times.  In the
event that measurement of the strength and character of industrial wastes are
not provided to the city on a timely basis, the measurements of the strength
and character of industrial wastes shall be determined by the city on the
basis of a sample to  be taken by the city for the purpose of appropriate
billing.  The industrial cost recovery rate for the treatment of wastes
shall be as follows:



 


Waste Factors

 
Charges


Monthly volume flow
 
$.116 per 1000 gallons


B.O.D. in excess of 204 mg/l
 
.018 per pound


S/S in excess of 240 mg/l
 
.015 per pound



 



   (C)   However, in the event an industrial user can and does show to
the satisfaction of the city that a portion of the total monthly billed
sewage flow is from sanitary conveniences, then the flow to which the
industrial cost recovery charge is applied shall be determined on the basis
of net flow excluding sanitary conveniences.



   (D)   The industrial cost recovery charges for treatment services
shall be prepared and billed quarterly.



   (E)   The industrial cost recovery rates and charges shall be
prepared, billed, and collected in the manner provided by law and ordinance.



   (F)   The industrial cost recovery charges for treatment services
shall become effective for services rendered during the first calendar
quarter following completion of construction, and shall be prepared and
billed quarterly.



(Ord. 1977-21, passed 11-10-77)



§ 51.32  DETERMINATION OF USERS SUBJECT TO INDUSTRIAL COST RECOVERY.



   The city shall determine which users are subject to paying the
industrial cost recovery charges, in the following manner:



   (A)   The city shall require appropriate employees of the sewage
works to review billing records and prepare a list of all potential
industrial users, as identified in each of the Divisions listed in § 51.30.



   (B)   The list of all potential industrial users shall be analyzed
on the basis of data available at the sewage works billing office (i.e. type
of business, volume charges, excessive loading charges, estimated number of
employees) for the purpose of developing preliminary lists of probable
industrial and probable nonindustrial users.



   (C)   The city shall conduct an immediate survey of all probable
industrial users in order to substantiate the validity of classifying a
particular user as an industrial user.  Each user initially classified as an
industrial user shall be notified as to its classification.



   (D)   After completing the survey of all probable industrial users,
the city shall review the list of probable nonindustrial users to determine
if the initial classification of any of these users should be reconsidered. 
Where appropriate, individual users will be contacted in order to determine
the proper classification.



   (E)   After an industrial user has been notified of his
classification, the user may request reconsideration by furnishing data and
measurements acceptable to the city for the determination of sewage
discharges.  The city shall have the right to measure and determine the
strength and content of all sewage and waste discharges, either directly or
indirectly into the city's sanitary sewage system, in such manner and by such
method as it may deem practicable in the light of the conditions and
attending circumstances of each case, in order to determine the proper user
classification.



   (F)   Within a reasonable period of time following completion of the
sewage works construction project, the city shall have completed the initial
classification of all industrial users.  During the first calendar year of
operation subsequent to completion of the construction project, and annually
thereafter, the city will review, classify, and reclassify all users as
either industrial or nonindustrial users based on measurements and data
obtained by the city or furnished by individual users.  Normally, each user
will retain his classification until the next succeeding classification
period.  However, if there is a substantial change in the strength, volume,
or delivery flow rate characteristics introduced into the treatment works by
an individual user, then the classification of that user may be reviewed and
established during the year in the light of the conditions and attending
circumstances of each case.



(Ord. 1977-21, passed 11-10-77)



§ 51.33  BASIS FOR CHARGES.



   The basis for the industrial cost recovery rates and charges included
in § 51.31 are as follows:



   (A)   Total estimated federal grant amount to be awarded for the
plant improvements and interceptor sewers under Project Number C-180611 is
approximately $4,040,000.



   (B)   The consulting engineers estimate that an equitable
distribution on a percentage basis of the total cost of construction and
equipment included in the Treatment Plant Project would be as follows:



Treatment of sanitary waste flow   49%



Treatment of suspended solids   25%



Treatment of B.O.D.   26%



   (C)   The design capacity of the Treatment Plant is as follows:



      (1)   Flow:  Annual design flow capacity of 1,168 M.G.



      (2)   Suspended Solids:  Design capacity 240 mg/1, times
annual flow capacity 1168 M.G., times weight will result in 2,335,907 pounds
average annual design capacity.



      (3)   Biochemical Oxygen Demand    Design capacity 204 mg/l
times annual flow capacity 1168 M.G., times weight will result in 1,985,521
pounds average annual design capacity.



   (D)   Industrial cost recovery period will be 30 years.



   (E)   Average annual basis for the cost recovery charge will amount
to $134,667 ($4,040,000 federal grant divided by 30-years recovery period)
for treatment.



   (F)   The annual basis for the cost recovery charge allocated to
treatment functions is as follows:



   Treatment of waste volume



     ($134,667 x 49%) = $65,987



   Treatment of suspended solids



     ($134,667 x 25%) = $33,667



   Treatment of B.O.D.



     ($134,667 x 26%) = $35,013



   (G)   The industrial cost recovery rates for the treatment charges
are computed on the basis of the annual functional costs of treatment divided
by average annual design capacity in the following manner:



      (1)   Treatment of waste volume. Annual functional cost of
$65,987 divided by annual capacity of 1,168 M.G. equals $.0565 per 1000
gallons.



      (2)   Treatment of suspended solids.



         Annual functional cost of $33,667 divided by annual
capacity of 2,335, 907 pounds equals $.015 per pound.



      (3)   Treatment of biochemical oxygen demand.  Annual
functional cost of $35,013 divided by annual capacity of 1,985,521 pounds
equals $.018 per pound.



   (H)   The rates computed in (G) above would result in total recovery
of the federal grant amount if all users were subject to the industrial cost
recovery requirements, and provided that the Treatment Plant was used to
capacity during the cost recovery period. Therefore, these rates will ensure
that each industrial user will pay only that portion of the federal grant
amount applicable to the costs of the treatment facilities actually utilized
to treat industrial wastes, as determined by each industrial user's flow and
pollutant loadings.



(Ord. 1977-21, passed 11-10-77)



§ 51.34  SEWAGE WORKS INDUSTRIAL COST RECOVERY FUND.



   The city shall account for all industrial cost recovery payments in the
following manner:



   (A)   All revenues derived from the industrial cost recovery rates
and charges shall be segregated and kept in a special fund, separate and
apart from all other funds of the city.  The special fund shall be
designated the “Sewage Works Industrial Cost Recovery Fund,” and payment
of said amount into said fund shall be deemed a reasonable expense of
operation of the sewage works for the purpose of computing net operating
revenue.



   (B)   Within 45 days following the end of the first calendar year
after completion of construction of the sewage facilities, and annually
thereafter, the city shall return 50% of the amounts recovered through the
industrial cost recovery charges, together with any interest earned thereon,
to the U.S. Treasury.  Pending use, the city shall invest the retained
amounts for reconstruction and expansion in obligations of the U.S.
Government; obligations guaranteed as to principal and interest by the U.S.
Government or any agency thereof; or in accounts fully collateralized by
obligations of the U.S. Government or by obligations fully guaranteed as to
principal and interest by the U.S. Government or any agency thereof.



   (C)   Eighty percent of the funds retained by the city  in the
“Sewage Works Industrial Cost  Recovery Fund” or authorized investments
and the interest earned thereon shall be expended only for the purpose of
eligible costs of expansion or reconstruction of the treatment works.  The
city shall obtain the written approval of the Regional Administrator of the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency prior to commitment of the retained
amounts for any expansion and reconstruction.  The remaining 20% of the
funds retained by the city may be utilized for any authorized use associated
with the sewage works.



(Ord. 1977-21, passed 11-10-77)



§ 51.35  INSPECTIONS.



   On request from the EPA, the city shall encourage each industrial user
to permit representatives of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to
review appropriate industrial sewage records for the purpose of independently
verifying the flow and characteristics of industrial wastes which are
introduced into the treatment works.  No waste introduced into the waste
treatment system shall interfere with the operation or performance of the
sewage treatment works. All users are subject to the requirements of
pretreatment standards established by federal and state law.

§ 51.40  DEFINITIONS.



   For the purpose of this subchapter the following definitions shall
apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.



   INTERCEPTOR OR TRUNK SEWER COSTS. Sewer costs external to a
development.  Sewer costs within a development will be classed as local
sewer costs.  Oversizing costs, as outlined in § 51.43, shall be considered
interceptor costs and shall qualify for refunding.



   OWNERS OF REAL ESTATE.  An individual, firm, company, association,
corporation, governmental unit, or charitable or other nonprofit
organizations.



(Ord. 1972-17, passed 1-18-73)



§ 51.41  AVAILABILITY COSTS.



   (A)   From and after the effective date of this subchapter, no
connection to any city-owned interceptor or trunk sanitary sewer shall be
allowed until a permit is obtained and payment, or satisfactory surety for
payment, has been made into the city “Interceptor Expansion Fund” which
is a depository for interceptor extension funds. This is a connection cost
intended to provide funds for future extensions, improvements, or additions
to the sewage facilities as contemplated by I.C. 36-8-23-17 and 36-8-23-18. 
These costs, designated as “availability costs,” shall be from time to
time updated and fixed by the city, but shall be established in the sum of
$1,700 (commencing October 1, 2008) increasing to $1,800 (commencing July 1,
2009) and thereafter until further amended commencing January 1, 2010 in the
amount of $1,900 per acre of ground to be served by the interceptor or trunk
sewer system developed by the city.  However, the owners of real estate
applying for service may make payment by platted sections before they are
approved and recorded, but in no event shall any subdivision or final plats
be approved or building permits issued until satisfactory proof, or surety of
payment, is on file with the city.  The availability costs of $1,700 per
acre will be allocated to and paid into the project cost of the specific
interceptor extension (off-site interceptor and on-site oversizing) for which
it is paid.  Project costs in all cases shall expressly include construction
costs, legal fees, engineering expenses, inspection costs, project
administrative costs, and easement acquisition costs.  All elements of these
project costs must be disbursed by the city from the funds deposited as
availability costs for that specific project.  Easements in each case must
be obtained by the owners of real estate prior to designing the project.  If
the entire availability cost at the rate of $1,700 per acre is not needed for
interceptor extension, the excess, if any, will remain in the Fund, to be
disbursed for other interceptor extension projects.



   (B)   Acreage availability costs for interceptor or trunk sewer
construction may, at the city's discretion, be excluded for areas platted for
use as cemeteries, golf courses, or parks.



(Ord.1972-17, passed 1-18-73; Am. Ord. 1985-18, passed 7-25-85; Am. Ord.
1995-7, passed 6-9-95; Am. Ord. 2008-26, passed 9-24-08)



§ 51.42  ADDITIONAL FUNDS CONTRIBUTED.



   Acreage availability costs shall be strictly nonrefundable.  If in
order to extend the interceptor or trunk sewer additional funds are necessary
to extend or oversize the sanitary sewer to the owners of real estate, the
additional funds advanced or contributed by the owners of real estate for the
extension or oversizing to meet the city's requirements are refundable,
without interest, but only from funds deposited at a future date by owners of
real estate under such terms and conditions as the city shall from time to
time set forth.  These additional funds must be first deposited with the
city and disbursed in a manner prescribed by the city if the funds are to
qualify for refunding.  In no event will any of the city sewer system
revenues be used, committed, or encumbered to repay any such funds advanced
or contributed, nor will the city's general funds be used, committed, or
encumbered to repay any such funds, advanced or contributed.  It is
expressly declared that such repayment, if any, will be repaid only from
deposits outstanding in the Interceptor Expansion Fund, first-in, first-out.



(Ord. 1972-17, passed 1-18-73)



§ 51.43  OVERSIZING COSTS.



   Refunding of costs for oversizing to meet the city specifications shall
be made only as to that portion of the oversizing which lies in the real
estate owner's development.  In the event the availability costs per acre do
not provide sufficient funds to extend or oversize the interceptor or trunk
sewer as needed, no construction permit will be issued by the city unless the
owners of real estate desire to advance and pay the  excess project costs. 
If oversizing of sewage  lift stations or oversizing or extensions of local
sewers constructed within their development by owners of real estate are
necessary to deliver sewage from other areas to an interceptor or from one
interceptor to another, such  oversizing or extension costs will be
considered as part of the interceptor costs and not part of the on-site local
sewer costs and, as such, are refundable.



(Ord. 1972-17, passed 1-18-73)



§ 51.44  INDIVIDUAL CONNECTION TO SEWERS.



   (A)   Where an individual connection is sought for developed areas
already being served by an interceptor or trunk sewer and local sewers, a
connection charge shall be paid to the city which shall be based upon the
size of the water meter. Only one water meter, of adequate size to properly
serve the facility, shall be permitted in a structure/building. The
connection charges shall be as follows:

   The above schedule reflects the initial sewage connection fees. After
the initial connection is made, if the service is ever up-graded from the
initial service to a larger service, the property owner shall pay the
difference between the connection fees for the larger service and the
existing service that is effective at such time.



   (B)   Except for single-family residences where a user has consumed
metered water for a continuous 12-month period beginning 6 months after time
of connection, the city will review its unit cost set forth for the preceding
12-month metered period and will adjust the unit cost in accordance with
actual usage, either upward or downward, as the metered usage reflects. 
This adjustment will determine the unit cost for the particular user and no
further adjustment will thereafter be made.  For the purpose of reviewing
the unit cost, the usage of a single-family residence will be considered
6,000 gallons per month.

§ 51.46  OFF-SITE SEWERS.



   All plans for interceptor or trunk sewers to be installed outside the
area being developed by the applicant for sewer service (hereinafter called
off-site sewers) shall be prepared by the city. All easements shall be made
in favor of the city and shall be obtained by and, if necessary, paid for by
the owners of the real estate.  Easements shall also be in a form approved
by the city.  The owners of real estate applying for interceptor or trunk
sewer service shall deposit with the city adequate funds or surety of payment
to pay engineering and appurtenant nonconstruction project costs prior to the
city proceeding with preparation of plans.  If the project does not proceed
to completion after project costs are established, the money so deposited by
the owners of real estate shall be nonrefundable and will be used to pay
incurred expenses.  If the funds are in excess of expenses, they will be
returned to the owners of real estate making the deposit.  If the project is
completed, the deposit will be credited to the total project cost as defined
in § 51.41(A).



(Ord. 1972-17, passed 1-18-73)



§ 51.47  ON-SITE SEWERS.



   The owners of real estate obtaining a permit for interceptor  or trunk
sewers shall submit plans for on-site sewers, including interceptors, or
trunk sewers to be constructed within his development to the city for review
and approval before start of construction.  During construction of the
on-site sewers, the owners of real estate shall pay the expense of an
inspector for the city, and, on completion of construction, shall provide
certified “as-built” construction drawings to the city.  If
“as-built” drawings are not provided within three months after completion
of construction, the city may prepare these drawings at the expense of the
owners of the real estate.  The city will provide the inspector or may
approve, in writing, some person designated by the owners of real estate. 
In any case, the owners of real estate will pay the costs thereof to the
city, which will, in turn, pay the inspector.



(Ord. 1972-17, passed 1-18-73)



§ 51.48  CONNECTIONS IN DEVELOPED AREAS.



   If individual applicants for sewage service in already developed
acreage or platted subdivisions wish to be served by an interceptor or trunk
sewer and local sewers, they shall obtain a permit and deposit adequate funds
with the city to pay engineering and appurtenant costs prior to the
authorization of such design by the city and the receipt of bids.  If the
project does not proceed to completion after project costs are established,
the money so deposited by individual applicants shall be nonrefundable and
used to pay incurred expenses.  If moneys are in excess of expenses, the
excess will be returned to the individual making the deposit.  If the
project, on the other hand, is completed, the deposit of individual
applicants shall be credited to the individual's costs outlined in §
51.49.  If a connection is made to an interceptor, trunk, or local sewer
without obtaining a permit and paying the required availability, connection,
and local sewer costs, the individual or owner of real estate will be subject
to a fine of $150 a day for each day the connection was unlawfully installed,

§ 51.55  SEWER REHABILITATION PROJECT GENERAL FORMAT.



   The project shall be directed by the City Engineer and/or the
Greenfield Wastewater Utility Superintendent, who are hereafter referred to
as the “Project Director”.  City personnel and/or a private contractor
authorized by the Board of Works and Public Safety through a normal bidding
process shall complete the rehabilitation work.  When determined by the
Project Director, and agreed upon by the Contractor, the Greenfield
Wastewater Utility Superintendent may renew the contract for one year when it
is in the city’s best interest to do so.  The area for rehabilitation will
be determined by the Project Director, who will notify the affected parties
by a hand delivered flier or other approved notification manner.  The
contractor will be instructed as to the appropriate rehabilitation methods
for that area.  The sewer mains, laterals and associated manholes will be
repaired or replaced as instructed by the Project Director.  The Project
Director will determine the length of each private lateral replacement, which
at a minimum, will be from the sewer main to a location approximately two
feet from the building foundation.  Decorative landscaping, decks or other
structures may prohibit the length of the lateral replacement. 
Pre-televising of the mains and laterals will determine the sewer lines that
will receive repairs or replacement.  A purchased home, rental home,
business, commercial establishment or other structure approved by the Project
Director will be included in the rehabilitation project.  Along with a one
year warranty on workmanship, all streets, sidewalks, lawns, easements or
other items involved in the sewer rehabilitation are the responsibility of
the contractor to repair unless other arrangements have been made with the
Project Director.  Ownership of the private laterals remains with the
property owner and in no way relieves the responsibility of maintenance or
upkeep by the property owner as required by previous sections of this chapter.



(Ord. 2008-20, passed 6-25-08)



§ 51.56  EMERGENCY LATERAL REPLACEMENT PROGRAM.



   The Greenfield Wastewater Utility may fund a project to assist
single-family homeowners with the total replacement of a private lateral. 
Under no circumstances can ownership of the private line be relinquished to
the Greenfield Wastewater Utility.  Assistance by such program requires the
residing single-family homeowner of the property to notify the Greenfield
Wastewater Utility of a major or continuing problem with interrupted sanitary
sewer service.  The applicant shall first have received the approval of the
Wastewater Utility Superintendent or appointed representative to participate
in the program, which participation shall require each property owner to
perform the following steps, as well as any other actions required by the
Wastewater Utility Superintendent:  (1) complete an application provided by
the Wastewater Utility, (2) at the owner’s expense, have their lateral
service and televised concurrently, if possible, (3) provide property access
to a contractor for the repair or replacement of the lateral.  The
Wastewater Utility will require sufficient time to acquire an outside
contractor when needed and request locates from the Indiana Underground Plant
Protection Service to prevent other service lines from being damaged.  The
contractor will repair all lawns, sidewalks, drives and streets.  The
Wastewater Utility Superintendent reserves the right to refuse or delay the
assistance offered by this program to anyone, providing the reasons for such
actions are explained to the residing homeowner.  Commercial, industrial and
rental properties are not eligible for this program.  Grievances shall be
addressed at a Board of Works and Public Safety meeting for resolution. A
financial penalty may occur for a homeowner who sells a property within two
years of applying for an emergency lateral replacement. The Greenfield Board
of Public Works and Safety may impose a penalty equal to the greater of
$1,000.00, or an amount equal to the quotation obtained by the Wastewater
Utility, for the emergency lateral replacement at the time of the proposed
transfer of any legal interest in the subject real estate.

POTW - GENERAL SEWER USE REQUIREMENTS



§ 51.70  PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY.



   This subchapter sets forth general requirements for all users of the
sanitary sewer system.



(Ord. 2008-38, passed 12-10-08)



§ 51.71  PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS.



   (A)   General prohibitions.  No user shall introduce or cause to be
introduced into the POTW any pollutant or wastewater which causes pass
through or interference.  These general prohibitions apply to all users of
the POTW whether or not they are subject to categorized pretreatment
standards or any other national, state, or local pretreatment standards or
requirements.



   (B)   Specific prohibitions. No user shall introduce or cause to be
introduced into the POTW the following pollutants, substances, or wastewater:



      (1)   Pollutants which create a fire or explosive hazard in
the POTW, including, but not limited to, wastestreams with a closed-cup
flashpoint of less than 140°F (60°C) using the test methods specified in 40
CFR 261.21;



      (2)   Wastewater having a pH less than 5.0 or more than 9.0
without written consent from the Wastewater Superintendent, or otherwise
causing corrosive structural damage to the POTW or equipment;



      (3)   Solid or viscous substances in amounts which will cause
obstruction of the flow in the POTW resulting in interference. Total
suspended solids levels in excess of 240 mg/l daily average may be subject to
a surcharge per § 51.72;



      (4)   Pollutants, including oxygen- demanding pollutants (BOD
and the like), released in a discharge at a flow rate or pollutant
concentration which, either singly or by interaction with other pollutants,
will cause interference with the POTW. BOD levels in excess of 205 mg/l daily
average may be subject to a surcharge per § 51.72;



      (5)   Wastewater having a temperature greater than 150°F
(65°C), or which will inhibit biological activity in the treatment plant
resulting in interference, but in no case wastewater which causes the
temperature at a location 1,000 feet downstream from the point of
introduction to exceed 104°F (40°C);



      (6)   Petroleum oil, non-biodegradable cutting oil, or
products of mineral oil origin, in amounts that will cause interference or
pass through;



      (7)   Pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases,
vapors, or fumes within the POTW sewers including in a quantity that may
cause acute worker health and safety problems;



      (8)   Trucked or hauled pollutants, except at discharge points
designated by the Wastewater Superintendent in accordance with § 51.73;



      (9)   Noxious or malodorous liquids, gases, solids, or other
wastewater which, either singly or by interaction with other wastes, are
sufficient to create a public nuisance or a hazard to life, or to prevent
entry into the sewers for maintenance or repair;



      (10)   Wastewater which imparts color which cannot be removed
by the treatment process, such as, but not limited to, dye wastes and
vegetable tanning solutions, which consequently imparts color to the
treatment plant’s effluent, thereby causing the city’s NPDES permit
requirements to be violated;



      (11)   Wastewater containing any radioactive wastes or
isotopes except in compliance with applicable state or federal regulations;



      (12)   Storm water, surface water, ground water, artesian well
water, roof runoff, subsurface drainage, sump pumps, dechlorinated swimming
pool water, condensate, deionized water, noncontact cooling water, and
unpolluted wastewater, unless specifically authorized by the Wastewater
Superintendent;



      (13)   Sludges, screenings, or other residues from the
pretreatment of industrial wastes;



      (14)   Medical wastes, except as specifically authorized by
the Wastewater Superintendent in a wastewater discharge permit;



      (15)   Wastewater causing, alone or in conjunction with other
sources, the treatment plant’s effluent to fail a toxicity test; and



      (16)   Detergents, surface-active agents, or other substances
which may cause excessive foaming in the POTW.



   (C)   Pollutants, substances, or wastewater prohibited by this
section shall not be processed or stored in such a manner that they could be
discharged to the POTW.



(Ord. 2008-38, passed 12-10-08)



§ 51.72  ABNORMAL WASTE SURCHARGE.



   (A)   In the event the approving authority excludes a customer from
the requirements of § 51.71 and the customer discharges abnormal industrial
wastes to the public sanitary sewerage system having an average TSS in excess
of 240 mg/l or an average of five-day BOD in excess of 204 mg/l, or an
average of COD in excess of 500 mg/l, the customer shall pay a surcharge
based upon the excess strength of his or her wastes.



   (B)   The costs of treatment for each pound of BOD, suspended
solids, or grease removed by each treatment works shall be reviewed by the
city annually.  If a discrepancy exists between the actual costs as found by
the city and the estimated costs, the BOW shall increase or decrease the
surcharge rates sufficiently to cover only the projected actual costs for the
ensuing year.



   (C)   No reduction in sewerage service charges, fees, or taxes will
be permitted because of the fact that certain industrial wastes discharged to
the public sanitary sewerage system contain less than 240 mg/l of total
suspended solids, or 204 mg/l BOD.



(Ord. 2008-38, passed 12-10-08)



§ 51.73  NATIONAL CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS.



   The categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR Chapter 1,
Subchapter N, Parts 405-471 are hereby incorporated.



   (A)   Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed only in
terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollutant in wastewater,
the Wastewater Superintendent may impose equivalent concentration or mass
limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c).



   (B)   When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard
is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the Wastewater
Superintendent shall impose an alternate limit using the combined wastestream
formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e).



   (C)   A user may obtain a variance from the Board of Public Works
and Safety from a categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove,
pursuant to the procedural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that
factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the
factors considered by EPA when developing the categorical pretreatment
standard.



   (D)   A user may obtain from the Board of Public Works and Safety a
net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR
403.15.



(Ord. 2008-38, passed 12-10-08)



§ 51.74  LOCAL LIMITS.



   (A)   The following pollutant limitations are established to protect
against pass through and interference. No person shall discharge wastewater
containing in excess of the following concentrations based upon a 24-hour
composite sample. Additionally, no person shall discharge wastewater
containing in excess of 1.5 times the following concentrations for any grab
sample. Since analytical procedures do not allow for composite sampling
techniques when sampling for Hexavalent Chromium and Cyanide, three grab
samples shall be analyzed with no single result exceeding the concentration.



   0.1      mg/l Cadmium (total)[2]



   30      mg/l Chlorine



   0.13      mg/l Hexavalent Chromium [3]



   2.77      mg/l Total Chrome [2]



   2.6      mg/l Copper (total)[3]



   0.2      mg/l Cyanide (total)[3]



   0.4      mg/l Lead (total)[3]



   .0003      mg/l Mercury (total)[3]



   2.9      mg/l Nickel (total)[3]



   100      mg/l Oil and Grease [1]



   2.6      mg/l Zinc (total)[3]



   0.85      mg/l Silver (total)



   (B)   The above limits apply at the point where the wastewater is
discharged to the POTW.  All concentrations for metallic substances are for
“total” metal unless indicated otherwise. The Wastewater Superintendent
may impose mass limitations in addition to, or in place of, the
concentration-based limitations above.



   (C)   Upon the promulgation of the National Categorical Pretreatment
Standard (NCPS) from the EPA for a particular user, the said standard, if
more stringent than the limitations imposed under the POTW subchapters for
sources in that category, shall, when effective, immediately supersede the
limitations and conditions imposed under this subchapter. The City of
Greenfield, when acting as the permitting authority, shall notify all known
affected users of the applicable permitting and reporting requirements under
40 CFR 403.12.



[1]   As an alternative to the total oil and grease limitations
established by this section, the Wastewater Superintendent may establish in
an IWP a limitation of 100 mg/l for non-polar grease.  The alternative
limitation is subject to the following conditions:



   1.   The user submits an application for the alternative limit;



   2.   The user provides information regarding the user’s products,
processes, and operations that show to the Wastewater Superintendent’s
satisfaction that the oil and grease discharged by the user is predominantly
of animal or vegetable origin;



   3.   The user shows that the oil and grease in the user’s
discharges is not visible, free, or floating at 50°F at any time;



   4.   The user has sampling facilities that allow for both visual
inspection of the user’s discharge and using the equipment necessary for
collection samples for floatable oil and grease;



   5.   The oil and grease in the user’s discharge is not related to
past instances of obstruction, interference, or pass through;



   6.   Users subject to the alternative limit shall continue to
operate and maintain grease traps and any other oil and grease separation and
treatment equipment and shall continue all existing practices that reduce
discharges of oil and grease;



   7.   If the Wastewater Superintendent determines that a user subject
to the alternative limit has caused, alone or in conjunction with other
discharges, obstruction, interference, or pass through, then the user shall
comply with the total oil and grease limitation or another appropriate
limitation established by the District in the user’s IWP; and



   8.   Any other appropriate conditions set forth in the user’s
permit.

(Ord. 2008-38, passed 12-10-08)



§ 51.76  DILUTION.



   No user shall ever increase the use of process water, or in any way
attempt to dilute a discharge, as a partial or complete substitute for
adequate treatment to achieve compliance with a discharge limitation unless
expressly authorized by an applicable pretreatment standard or requirement. 
Wastewater Superintendent may impose mass limitations on users who are using
dilution to meet applicable pretreatment standards or requirements or in
other cases when the imposition of mass limitations is appropriate.



(Ord. 2008-38, passed 12-10-08)

shall be taken at times which reflect the full range and concentration of
effluent pollutants normally expected to be present.  Samples shall not be
taken at times to avoid showing elevated levels of any pollutant.



(Ord. 2008-38, passed 12-10-08)



§ 51.79  REQUEST FOR INFORMATION.



   The user shall furnish the city, within a reasonable period of time,
any information which the city may request to determine compliance with the
POTW subchapters or the applicable pretreatment permit.  Requested
information may include, but is not limited to, sampling data, waste disposal
records, and maintenance records.



(Ord. 2008-38, passed 12-10-08)



§ 51.80  ADDITIONAL MONITORING BY PERMITTEE.

POTW - PRETREATMENT OF WASTEWATER



§ 51.110  PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY.



   The purpose of this section is to set out minimum pretreatment
guidelines for any contributor to the POTW.



(Ord. 2008-38, passed 12-10-08)



§ 51.111  PRETREATMENT FACILITIES.



   Users shall provide wastewater treatment as necessary to comply with
this subchapter and shall achieve compliance with all categorical
pretreatment standards, local limits, the applicable NPDES permit, and the
prohibitions set out in § 51.71 within the time limitations specified by
EPA, IDEM, or the Wastewater Superintendent, whichever is more stringent. 
Any facilities necessary for compliance shall be provided, operated, and
maintained at the user's expense.  Detailed plans describing such facilities
and operating procedures shall be submitted to the Wastewater Superintendent
and the City Engineer for review, and shall be acceptable to the Wastewater
Superintendent before such facilities are constructed. The review of such
plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the
responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a
discharge acceptable to the city under the provisions of this subchapter. All
necessary permits shall be obtained as necessary from IDEM prior to discharge
to the city.  The City of Greenfield may utilize the services of a contract,
or otherwise retained, consultant to review such plans.  The permittee bares
all costs associated with the review of such plans.



(Ord. 2008-38, passed 12-10-08)



§ 51.112  ADDITIONAL PRETREATMENT MEASURES.



   (A)   Whenever deemed necessary, the Wastewater Superintendent may
require users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate
that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate or
consolidate points of discharge, separate sewage wastestreams from industrial
wastestreams, and such other conditions as may be necessary to protect the
POTW and determine the user’s compliance with the requirements of this
subchapter.



   (B)   The Wastewater Superintendent may require any person
discharging into the POTW to install and maintain, on their property and at
their expense, a suitable storage and flow-control facility to ensure

for flow equalization.



   (C)   Users with the potential to discharge flammable substances may
be required to install and maintain an approved combustible gas detection
meter or provide appropriate treatment to remove any such substance.



   (D)   Users that operate vehicular wash facilities shall provide,
operate and maintain pretreatment facilities approved by the Wastewater
Superintendent to control solids and preclude the discharge of toxics to the
POTW.



   (E)   Users which operate food preparation facilities shall provide,
operate and maintain pretreatment facilities approved by the Wastewater
Superintendent to control the discharge of greases, fats, oils and food
solids to the POTW.  The design, installation, operation and maintenance of
these facilities shall, at a minimum, comply with the provisions set forth in
§§ 51.90 through 51.101.



   (F)   The Wastewater Superintendent may require users to purchase,
install, and maintain, for the city’s monitoring purposes, such sampling,
flow monitoring, laboratory or other such equipment deemed necessary to
determine compliance with categorical pretreatment standards, local
limitations, NPDES pretreatment permit limitations or any other discharge
limitation imposed by this subchapter or at the express authorization of the
Wastewater Superintendent.



   (G)   The Wastewater Superintendent may require users to reimburse
the City of Greenfield for fees incurred for any analytical testing deemed
necessary to determine compliance with categorical pretreatment standards,
local limitations, NPDES pretreatment permit limitations or any other
discharge limitation imposed by this subchapter or at the express
authorization of the Wastewater Superintendent.



   (H)   Calibration of flow measurement devices, continuous monitoring
devices, process control devices, treatment control devices or any other
device utilized for the monitoring or treatment of wastewater must be
calibrated on a schedule approved by the Wastewater Superintendent.



   (I)   When required by the Wastewater Superintendent, the user of
any property served by a building sewer carrying industrial wastes shall
install a suitable control manhole in the building sewer to facilitate the
observation, sampling, and measurement of the wastes.  Such manhole, when
required, shall be accessible and safely located, and shall be constructed
and located in accordance with plans approved by the City Engineer.  The
manhole shall be installed so as to be safe and accessible at all times.



   (J)   All measurements, tests and analyses of characteristics of
waters and wastes shall be determined in accordance with 40 CFR Part 136 and
shall be at an approved location and in accordance with § 51.79.



   (K)   No unauthorized person shall maliciously, willfully, or
negligently break, damage, destroy, uncover, deface, or tamper with any
structure appurtenance, or equipment which is part of the POTW or installed
for the purpose of determining compliance with categorical pretreatment
standards, local limitations, NPDES pretreatment permit limitations or any
other discharge limitation or requirement imposed by this subchapter.



   (L)   If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be
discharged, to the POTW which contain substances or possess characteristics
outlined in § 51.74, or, in the judgment of the Wastewater Superintendent or
the City Engineer, may have a deleterious effect on the POTW or which
otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the
Wastewater Superintendent shall:



      (1)   Require new industries or industries with significant
increase in discharges to submit information on wastewater characteristics
and obtain prior approval for discharges; or



      (2)   Require other methods of disposal; or



      (3)   Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for
discharge to the POTW; or



      (4)   Require control over the quantities and rates of
discharge; or



      (5)   Require facilities to prevent accidental discharge of
any unacceptable wastes; and



      (6)   Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and
treating the discharge not covered by sewer charges under the provisions of
Chapter 51 and all ordinances amendatory thereof and supplemental thereto,
and any fines, penalties, or damages assessed against the city for discharge
of such wastes to the city.



(Ord. 2008-38, passed 12-10-08)



§ 51.113  ACCIDENTAL DISCHARGE/SLUG CONTROL PLANS.



   At least once every two years, the Wastewater Superintendent shall
evaluate whether each significant industrial user needs an accidental
discharge/slug control plan.  The Wastewater Superintendent may require any
user to develop, submit for approval, and implement such a plan.  An
accidental discharge/slug control plan shall address, at a minimum, the
following:



   (A)   Description of discharge practices, including non-routine
batch discharges;



   (B)   Description of stored chemicals;



   (C)   Procedures for immediately notifying the Wastewater
Superintendent of any accidental or slug discharge, as required by § 51.157;
and



   (D)   Procedures to prevent adverse impact from any accidental or
slug discharge.  Such procedures must include, but are not limited to,
inspection and maintenance of storage areas, handling and transfer of
materials, loading and unloading operations, control of plant site runoff,
worker training, building of containment structures or equipment, measures
for containing toxic organic pollutants, including solvents, and measures and
equipment for emergency response.



Acceptance or approval of any discharge/slug control plan by the Wastewater
Superintendent does not in any way provide protection for any industrial user
from enforcement, legal actions or other actions as allowed by this
subchapter.



(Ord. 2008-38, passed 12-10-08)



§ 51.114  HAULED WASTEWATER.



   (A)   Wastewater haulers shall have a valid wastewater hauler permit
issued by the State of Indiana before discharging wastes to the POTW.
Wastewater haulers that discharge to the City of Greenfield shall provide
access to all documentation required to be kept by the wastewater hauler
permit issued by the State of Indiana.



   (B)   Wastewater may be introduced into the POTW only at locations
designated by the Wastewater Superintendent, and at such times as are
established by the Wastewater Superintendent.  Such waste shall not violate
§§ 51.70 through 51.82 or any other requirements established by the city.



   (C)   All procedures for discharging, for cleanliners, and for
general sanitary operation on city property as prescribed by the city shall
be strictly adhered to by all wastewater haulers delivering wastewater to the
designated city dumping station.



   (D)   Wastewater from a domestic level user shall not be mixed with
wastewater from an industrial user. Vehicles hauling wastewater from an
industrial user shall not be used to haul wastewater from a domestic level
user for disposal at the POTW.



   (E)   Hauled wastewater shall be from domestic sources only and
shall not, partly or completely, contain industrial waste of any kind.



   (F)   The Wastewater Superintendent has the right to refuse any
waste from any wastewater hauler for any reason.



(Ord. 2008-38, passed 12-10-08)



§ 51.115  BYPASS.



   Upon delegation of a local Pretreatment Program from IDEM and the U.S.
EPA to the City of Greenfield. Bypass shall follow the IDEM permit conditions
as well as the following:



   (A)   For the purposes of this section.



      (1)   BYPASS means the intentional diversion of wastestreams
from any portion of a user’s treatment facility.



      (2)   SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE means substantial physical damage
to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become
inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can
reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. SEVERE PROPERTY
DAMAGE does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.



   (B)   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause
pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is
for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These bypasses are
not subject to the provision of divisions (C) and (D) of this section.



   (C)   (1)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass,
it shall submit prior notice to the Wastewater Superintendent, at least ten
days before the date of the bypass.



      (2)   A user shall submit oral notice to the Wastewater
Superintendent of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable
pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the
bypass.  A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the
time the user becomes aware of the bypass.  The written submission shall
contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the
bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been
corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken
or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The
Wastewater Superintendent may waive the written report on a case-by-case
basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours.



   (D)   (1)   Bypass is prohibited, and the Wastewater
Superintendent may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass,
unless



         (a)   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life,
personal injury, or severe property damage;



         (b)   There were no feasible alternatives to the bypass,
such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of untreated
wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime.  This
condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been
installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent a
bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or
preventive maintenance; and



         (c)   The user submitted notices as required under
division (C) of this section.



      (2)   The Wastewater Superintendent may approve an anticipated
bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the Wastewater
Superintendent determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in
division (D)(1) of this section.

   The Wastewater Superintendent shall provide notice by publication of
the issuance of a wastewater discharge permit.  Any person, including the
user, may petition City of Greenfield’s Board of Public Works and Safety to
reconsider the terms of a wastewater discharge permit within 15 days of the
published notice of its issuance.



   (A)   Failure to submit a timely petition for review shall be deemed
to be a waiver of the administrative appeal.



   (B)   In its petition, the appealing party must indicate the
wastewater discharge permit provisions objected to, the reasons for this
objection, and the alternative condition, if any, it seeks to place in the
wastewater discharge permit.



   (C)   The effectiveness of the wastewater discharge permit shall not
be stayed pending the appeal.



   (D)   If the Board of Public Works and Safety fails to act within 30
days, a request for reconsideration shall be deemed to be denied.  Decisions
not to reconsider a wastewater discharge permit, not to issue a wastewater
discharge permit, or not to modify a wastewater discharge permit shall be
considered final administrative actions for purposes of judicial review. If a
permit is issued under IDEM’s authority, Indiana’s appeals process shall
apply.



   (E)   Aggrieved parties seeking judicial review of the final
administrative wastewater discharge permit decision must do so by filing a
complaint with the Hancock County Circuit Court within 30 days.  If a permit
is issued under IDEM’s authority, Indiana’s appeals process shall apply.

complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if
appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return to the established
schedule.



(Ord. 2008-38, passed 12-10-08)



§ 51.154  REPORTS ON COMPLIANCE WITH CATEGORICAL PRETREATMENT STANDARD
DEADLINE.



   Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable
categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following
commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user
subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the
Wastewater Superintendent a report containing the information described in §
51.151(B)(4) - (6) and all applicable Indiana and federal rules, laws, and
regulations.  For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits
established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report
shall contain a reasonable measure of the user’s long-term production
rate.  For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards
expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production
(or other measure of operation), this report shall include the user’s
actual production during the appropriate sampling period.  All compliance
reports must be signed and certified in accordance with § 51.126 or, if the
permit is issued by IDEM, in accordance with applicable Indiana and federal
rules, laws, and regulations.



(Ord. 20008-38, passed 12-10-08)



§ 51.155  PERIODIC COMPLIANCE REPORTS.



   (A)   All significant industrial users shall, at a frequency
determined by the Wastewater Superintendent, but in no case less than twice
per year (in June and December), submit a report indicating the nature and
concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by
pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum
daily flows for the reporting period. All periodic compliance reports must be
signed and certified in accordance with § 51.126.



   (B)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the user’s
discharge.  Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be
properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all
times.  The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good
working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results
are unrepresentative of its discharge.



   (C)   If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section
monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the Wastewater
Superintendent, using the procedures prescribed in § 51.161, the results of
this monitoring shall be included in the report.



   (D)   If the permit is issued by IDEM, a periodic compliance report
shall be completed and submitted in accordance with permit conditions.



(Ord. 2008-38, passed 12-10-08)



§ 51.156  REPORTS OF CHANGED CONDITIONS.



   All discharges authorized by the applicable pretreatment permit shall
be consistent with the terms and conditions of that permit.  The discharge
of any pollutant identified in the applicable permit more frequently than or
at a level in excess of that authorized shall constitute a violation of the
permit. Any anticipated facility expansions, production increases, or process
modifications which will result in new, different, or increased discharges of
pollutants must be reported by the submittal of a new permit application at
least 180 days prior to a planned expansion or modification or, if such
changes will not violate the effluent limitations specified in this permit,
by notice to the Wastewater Superintendent of such changes.



   (A)   The Wastewater Superintendent may require the user to submit
such additional information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the
changed condition.



   (B)   The Wastewater Superintendent may issue a wastewater discharge
permit under § 51.127 or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit
under § 51.134 of this subchapter in response to changed conditions or
anticipated changed conditions.



(Ord. 2008-38, passed 12-10-08)



§ 51.157  REPORTS OF POTENTIAL PROBLEMS.



   (A)   In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to,
accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a
noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential
problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the
Wastewater Superintendent of the incident. This notification shall include
the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, and
corrective actions taken by the user.



   (B)   Within five days following such discharge, the user shall,
unless waived by the Wastewater Superintendent, submit a detailed written
report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken
by the user to prevent similar future occurrences.  Such notification shall
not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which
may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any
other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the
user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed
pursuant to this subchapter.



   (C)   A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin
board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event
of a discharge described in division (A) above.  Employers shall ensure that
all employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the
emergency notification procedure.

   All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall
provide appropriate reports to the Wastewater Superintendent as the
Wastewater Superintendent may require.



(Ord. 2008-38, passed 12-10-08)



§ 51.159  NOTICE OF VIOLATION/REPEAT SAMPLING AND REPORTING.



   If sampling performed by a user indicates an effluent limitation
violation, the user must notify the Wastewater Superintendent within 24 hours
of becoming aware of the violation.  The user must also immediately repeat
the sampling and analysis.  The user shall continue to collect and analyze
samples, at a frequency determined by the Wastewater Superintendent, until
such time that the facility has returned to compliance.  The user shall
submit the results of the initial and any repeated analysis to the Wastewater
Superintendent within 30 days after becoming aware of the initial violation
or at a deadline established by the Wastewater Superintendent.  When the
user has continued violations that exceed two monitoring periods, the user
shall provide a compliance update to the Wastewater Superintendent every 15
days.  Any samples collected by the Wastewater Superintendent does not limit
the user’s responsibility to comply with this provision. Additional
monitoring as part of post violation monitoring shall not be utilized to
fulfill routine monitoring required in any discharge permit.



(Ord. 2008-38, passed 12-10-08)



§ 51.160  NOTIFICATION OF THE DISCHARGE OF HAZARDOUS WASTE.



   (A)   Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall
notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and
State hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW
of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste
under 40 CFR Part 261.  Such notification must include the name of the
hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste
number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other).  If the
user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to
the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to
the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an
identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an
estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the
wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the
mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the
following 12 months.  All notifications must take place no later than 180
days after the discharge commences.  Any notification under this division 
need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged.  However,
notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under § 51.156 and in
accordance with all applicable state and federal rules, laws, and
regulations.  The notification requirement in this section does not apply to
pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment
standards under the self-monitoring requirements of § 51.151, § 51.154 and
§ 51.155.



   (B)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of division (A)
above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15
kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes
as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 26133(e).  Discharge of more than 15
kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any
quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and
261.33(e), requires a one-time notification.  Subsequent months during which
the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not
require additional notification.



   (C)   In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA
identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the
Wastewater Superintendent, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division
Director, and the Indiana Department of Environmental Management (IDEM) of
the discharge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such
regulations.



   (D)   In the case of any notification made under this section, the
user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and
toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be
economically practical.



   (E)   This provision does not create a right to discharge any
substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this subchapter, a
permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.



(Ord. 2008-38, passed 12-10-08)



§ 51.161  ANALYTICAL REQUIREMENTS.



   All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted
as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be
performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136,
unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment
standard.  If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical
techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be
performed in accordance with current procedures approved by EPA.



(Ord. 2008-38, passed 12-10-08)



§ 51.162  SAMPLE COLLECTION.



   (A)   Except as indicated in division (B) below, the user must
collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection
techniques.  In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the
Wastewater Superintendent may authorize the use of time proportional sampling
consisting of a minimum of four grab samples if the user demonstrates, to the
satisfaction of the Wastewater Superintendent, that time proportional
sampling will provide a representative sample of the effluent being
discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with
instantaneous discharge limits.



   (B)   Samples for COD, oil and grease (O&G), temperature, pH,
cyanide, phenols, sulfides and volatile organic compounds must be obtained
using grab sample collection techniques.



(Ord. 2008-38, passed 12-10-08)



§ 51.163  TIMING.



   Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date
postmarked.  The date of receipt by the Wastewater Superintendent shall be
deemed the submittal date for reports that are not mailed.

§ 51.171  SEARCH WARRANT.



   If the Wastewater Superintendent or an authorized representative has
been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part
thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may
be a violation of this subchapter, or that there is a need to inspect or
sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the city
designed to verify compliance with this subchapter or any permit or order
issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and welfare
of the community, then the Wastewater Superintendent may seek issuance of an
administrative search warrant from Hancock County Circuit Court and/or
Hancock County Superior Court No. 1 in Greenfield, Indiana



(Ord. 2008-38, passed 12-10-08)



§ 51.172  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.



   Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys,
wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and
monitoring programs, and from the Wastewater Superintendent’s inspection
and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without
restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the Wastewater Superintendent and the City
Attorney, that the release of such information would divulge information,
processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets
under applicable state law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of
submission of the information or data.  When requested and demonstrated by
the user furnishing a report that such information should be held
confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or
secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public,
but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies
for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in
enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. 
Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other “effluent data” as
defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information
and will be available to the public without restriction.

POTW - ADMINISTRATIVE ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES;  EFFECTIVE DELEGATION OF A LOCAL
PRETREATMENT PROGRAM



§ 51.180  NOTIFICATION OF VIOLATION.



   When the Wastewater Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this subchapter, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement, the Wastewater Superintendent may serve upon that
user at the address contained within the permit, by hand delivery or by First
Class, U.S. Mail, a written notice of violation.  Within 30 days of the
receipt of this notice, or such shorter time as may be contained within the
notice of violation, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the
satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required
actions, shall be submitted by the user to the Wastewater Superintendent. 
Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any
violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. 
Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the Wastewater
Superintendent to take any action, including emergency actions or any other
enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation.



(Ord. 2008-38, passed 12-10-08)



§ 51.181  COMPLIANCE AGREEMENTS.



   The Wastewater Superintendent may enter into Compliance Agreements,
assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing
an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will
include specific actions to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance
within a time period specified by the document.  Such documents shall have
the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to §
51.183 and § 51.184 and shall be judicially enforceable.



(Ord. 2008-35, passed 12-10-08)



§ 51.182  SHOW CAUSE HEARING.



   The Wastewater Superintendent may order a user which has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this ordinance, a wastewater discharge
permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or
requirement, to appear before the Wastewater Superintendent and show cause
why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken.  Notice shall be
served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the
proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that
the user show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be
taken.  The notice of the meeting shall be served personally or by
registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least 15 days
prior to the hearing.  Such notice may be served on any authorized
representative of the user.  A show cause hearing shall not be a bar
against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.



(Ord. 2008-38, passed 12-10-08)



§ 51.183  COMPLIANCE ORDERS.



   When the Wastewater Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this subchapter, a wastewater
discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement, the Wastewater Superintendent may issue an order to
the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into
compliance within a specified time.  If the user does not come into
compliance within the time provided, sewer service may be discontinued unless
adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are
installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other
requirements to address the noncompliance, including additional
self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of
pollutants discharged to the sewer.  A compliance order may not extend the
deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment standard or
requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for
any violation, including any continuing violation.  Issuance of a compliance
order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user.



(Ord. 2008-38, passed 12-10-08)



§ 51.184  CEASE AND DESIST ORDERS.



   (A)   When the Wastewater Superintendent finds that a user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are
likely to recur, the Wastewater Superintendent may issue an order to the user
directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user
to:



      (1)   Immediately comply with all requirements; and



      (2)   Take such appropriate remedial or preventive action as
may be necessary to properly address a continuing or threatened violation,
including halting operations or terminating the discharge.



   (B)   Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar
against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.



(Ord. 2008-38, passed 12-10-08)



§ 51.185  ADMINISTRATIVE FINES.



   (A)   When the Wastewater Superintendent finds that a user has
violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, a
wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other
pretreatment standard or requirement, the Wastewater Superintendent may fine
such user in accordance with I.C. 13-1-3-8 to the amount not to exceed $2,500
for the first offense and the amount not to exceed $7,500 for each subsequent
offense.  Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. 
In the case of monthly or other long term average discharge limits, fines
shall be assessed for each day during the period of violation.  The user
shall also be responsible for all costs, damages, expenses, attorney’s fees
and fines levied by regulatory agencies due to and attributed to the user’s
noncompliance.



   (B)   Unpaid charges, accrued interest, attorney’s fees, fines and
penalties shall, after 60 calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of
10% of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of
1.8% per month.  A lien against the user’s property will be sought for
unpaid charges, fines and penalties.



   (C)   Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written
request for the Wastewater Superintendent to reconsider the fine along with
full payment of the fine amount within 30 days of being notified of the fine.
Where a request has merit, the Wastewater Superintendent may convene a
hearing on the matter. In the event the user’s appeal is successful, the
payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to
the user.  The Wastewater Superintendent may add the costs of preparing
administrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine.



   (D)   Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against,
or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.



(Ord. 2008-38, passed 12-10-08)



§ 51.186  EMERGENCY SUSPENSION.



   (A)   The Wastewater Superintendent may immediately suspend a user's
discharge, after informal notice, delivered personally, telephonically or
electronically to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an
actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause
an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or welfare of the
public, the environment, or which threatens to interfere with the operation
of the POTW.  The Wastewater Superintendent may also immediately suspend a
user’s discharge after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to
interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present,
an endangerment to the environment.



      (1)   Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall
immediately stop or eliminate its discharge.  In the event of a user’s
failure to immediately comply voluntarily with the suspension order, the
Wastewater Superintendent may take such steps as deemed necessary, including
immediate severance of the sewer connection or other means necessary to
prevent or minimize an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably
appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the
health or welfare of the public, the environment, or which threatens to
interfere with the operation of the POTW.  The pretreatment facility bares
all costs, including, but not limited to, damages to the sewer connection,
damage to any pretreatment facilities, or transport and disposal costs
associated with a severance or other means to cease the discharge to the
POTW.  The Wastewater Superintendent may allow the user to recommence its
discharge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the
Wastewater Superintendent that the period of endangerment has passed, unless
the termination proceedings in § 51.187 are initiated against the user.



      (2)   A user that is responsible, in whole or in part, for any
discharge presenting an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably
appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the
health or welfare of the public, the environment, or which threatens to
interfere with the operation of the POTW shall submit a detailed written
statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures
taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the Wastewater Superintendent
prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under § 51.182 or
§ 51.187.



   (B)   Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a
hearing prior to any emergency suspension under this section.

§ 51.187  TERMINATION OF DISCHARGE.



   (A)   In addition to the provisions in § 51.71, any user who
violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination:



      (1)   Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions;



      (2)   Failure to accurately report the wastewater constituents
and characteristics of its discharge;



      (3)   Failure to report significant changes in operations or
wastewater volume, constituents, and characteristics prior to discharge;



      (4)   Refusal of reasonable access to the user’s premises
for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or



      (5)   Violation of the sewer use requirements in §§ 51.70
through 51.82, §§ 51.90 through 51.101 or §§ 51.110 through 51.115.



   (B)   Such user will be notified personally, telephonically or
electronically of the proposed termination of its discharge and be offered an
opportunity to show cause under § 51.182 of this ordinance why the proposed
action should not be taken.  Exercise of this option by the Wastewater
Superintendent shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other
action against the user.

POTW - JUDICIAL ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES; EFFECTIVE UPON DELEGATION OF A LOCAL
PRETREATMENT PROGRAM



§ 51.200  INJUNCTIVE RELIEF.



   When the Wastewater Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this subchapter, a wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement, the BOW may petition the Hancock County Circuit
Court and/or Hancock County Superior Court No. 1 through the city’s
Attorney for the issuance of a preliminary and/or permanent injunction, as
appropriate, which enjoins or compels the specific performance by the user of
the provisions of the wastewater discharge permit, order, or other
requirement imposed by this subchapter on activities of the user.  The
Wastewater Superintendent may also seek such other action as is appropriate
for legal and equitable relief, including a requirement for the user to
conduct environmental remediation.  A petition for injunctive relief shall
not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against
a user.



(Ord. 2008-38, passed 12-10-08)



§ 51.201  REMEDIES NONEXCLUSIVE.



   The remedies provided for in this subchapter are not exclusive.  The
Wastewater Superintendent may take any, all, or any combination of these
actions against a noncompliant user.  Enforcement of Code violations will
generally be in accordance with the city’s enforcement response plan. 
However, the Wastewater Superintendent may take other action against any user
when the circumstances, in his or her sole discretion, warrant.  Further,
the Wastewater Superintendent is authorized to take more than one enforcement
action against any noncompliant user.

POTW - AFFIRMATIVE DEFENSES TO DISCHARGE VIOLATIONS



§ 51.210  UPSET.



   (A)   For the purposes of this section, UPSET means an exceptional
incident in which there is unintentional and temporary noncompliance with
categorical pretreatment standards because of factors beyond the reasonable
control of the user.  An UPSET does not include noncompliance to the extent
caused by operational error, improperly designed treatment facilities,
inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive maintenance, or careless
or improper operation.



   (B)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an action
brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if the
requirements of division (C) below, are met.



   (C)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense of
upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous operating
logs, or other relevant evidence that:



      (1)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the cause(s)
of the upset.



      (2)   The facility was at the time being operated in a prudent
and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation and
maintenance procedures; and



      (3)   The user has submitted the following information to the
Wastewater Superintendent within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset.



         (a)   A description of the indirect discharge and cause
of noncompliance;



         (b)   The period of noncompliance, including exact dates
and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is
expected to continue; and



         (c)   Steps being taken or planned to reduce, eliminate,
and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.



   (D)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish
the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.



   (E)   Users shall have the opportunity for an administrative
determination by the BOW on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action
brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards.



   (F)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon
reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided.  This
requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary
source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.



(Ord. 2008-38, passed 12-10-08)



§ 51.211  PROHIBITED DISCHARGE STANDARDS.



   (A)   A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement
action brought against it for noncompliance with the general prohibitions in
§ 51.71(A) or the specific prohibitions in § 51.71(B)(3) through § 51.82
if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its
discharge, alone or in conjunction with discharges from other sources, would
cause pass through or interference and that either:



      (1)   A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and
the user was in compliance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the
pass through or interference; or



      (2)   No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change
substantially in nature or constituents from the user's prior discharge when
the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit (No. IN0020109),
and in the case of interference, was in compliance with applicable sludge use
or disposal requirements.



   (B)   If a user operates under the conditions of an IDEM issued
permit, the user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action
brought against it for noncompliance with said permit in accordance with
applicable state and federal laws, rules and regulations.

Utility. I.C. 36-9-2-14 permits a municipality to regulate the furnishing of
water to the public. I.C. 36-9-2-18 permits a municipality to exercise powers
granted by I.C. 36-9-2-14 in areas within four miles outside its corporate
boundaries. I.C. 8-1.5-6 et seq. permits the city to adopt a regulatory
ordinance which is then submitted to the Indiana Utility Regulatory
Commission for its review and approval. The regulatory ordinance allows the
municipality to regulate the furnishing of water utility service in areas
within four miles outside the city's corporate boundaries.



   (B)   Agreement. 



      (1)   Pursuant to an agreement between Hancock County Rural
Telephone Corporation d/b/a NineStar Connect and the city, the parties agreed
to an exclusive water service territory for the city within four miles of the
city’s corporate limits.



      (2)   The Hancock County Regional Water and Sewer District
adopted a consent to transfer certified territorial authority, a copy of
which is attached to Ordinance 2016-4 as Exhibit A, in which it approved and
ratified the agreement.



      (3)   The agreement, a copy of which is attached to Ordinance
2016-4 as Exhibit B, is hereby approved. In approving the agreement, the city
understands and affirms that the agreement and  Ordinance 2016-4 shall not,
in any way, prevent the city from:



         (a)   Later seeking and obtaining from the Hancock
Regional Water and Sewer District the right to serve any area within the
District's jurisdiction;



         (b)   Retaining any and all rights to acquire any or all
of NineStar's assets used in providing water services in the additional
service area; or



         (c)   Exercising any power it has under I.C. 8-1.5-1-1
et seq. or 36-9-23-1 et seq.

defined and established as those areas within the corporate boundaries of the
city, as well as certain areas within four miles outside the city’s
boundaries, as shown on the map attached to Ordinance 2016-4 as Exhibit C.



      (2)   Upon the adoption of Ordinance 2016-4 and its approval

Greenfield Water Service Area, and the Greenfield Water Utility shall be the
exclusive provider of potable water to the public within the City of
Greenfield Water Service Area.



      (3)   Upon the adoption of Ordinance 2016-4 and its approval
by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission, no other utilities are
permitted to provide potable water service within the city, or within the
City of Greenfield Water Service Area. This ordinance does not mandate the
city to extend service to areas where technically or financially not
feasible. Rather, it expressly prohibits other utilities from furnishing
water service to customers within the city or within the City of Greenfield
Water Service Area.



      (4)   No end service user shall permit a connection to potable
water service within the City of Greenfield Water Service Area by any other
water service provider.



      (5)   The city’s existing rules and regulations for water
service, as amended from time to time, shall apply to and within the City of
Greenfield Water Service Area.

STORMWATER UTILITY USER FEE STRUCTURE



§ 54.20 STORMWATER UTILITY USER FEE STRUCTURE.



   (A)   A stormwater utility user fee shall be imposed on all
residential and non-residential property within the city, including those
classified as non-profit or tax exempt, for services and facilities provided
by the stormwater utility.  This user fee is deemed reasonable and is
necessary to pay for the repair, replacement, planning, improvement,
operation, regulation and maintenance of the existing and future stormwater
system for the city.



   (B)   For the purposes stated herein, there is hereby assessed a
stormwater utility user fee to each stormwater utility user within the
corporate limits of the city, in an amount determined below.  For purposes
of imposing the stormwater utility user fee, all lots and parcels within the
city are classified as either residential or non-residential and shall be
assessed a monthly base fee of $4 effective October 1, 2008.  In addition to
the base fee, the following variable charge shall also be levied:



      (1)   Residential.  A monthly user fee of $2 per ERU shall be
charged to each residential property. Each residential property is hereby
assigned one ERU.  Each parcel of undeveloped property, notwithstanding
zoning or property classification, is assigned one ERU.



      (2)   Non-residential properties. A monthly user fee of $2 per
ERU shall be charged to each non-residential (NR) property.  For each NR
property, the total amount of impervious surface will be computed in square
feet and divided by 2,250 square feet to determine the number of ERU
contained on the property.  The resultant will be rounded up or down to the
nearest whole number to determine the total ERU, but the minimum shall not be
less than one ERU.  Provided, however, that the maximum total monthly charge
for each municipal, township, county, state, or federal NR property shall not
exceed $450.



   (C)   The stormwater utility user fee shall be based on the relative
contribution of surface and stormwater runoff from a given parcel to the
city's stormwater system and shall be assessed per ERU per month.  Any
billings for stormwater service outside this time shall be on a per diem
basis.  This stormwater utility user fee rate is designed to recover and be
able to pay the cost of rendering stormwater service to the users of the
stormwater system, and shall be the basis for assessment of the city's
stormwater utility user fee.  This rate is established so as to maintain
adequate fund reserves to provide for reasonably expected variations in the
cost of providing services, as well as variation in the demand for
services.  This rate shall be evaluated annually as to its sufficiency to
satisfy the needs of the stormwater utility.  The following methods may be
used to determine the non-residential factors:



      (1)   Computation of the impervious area using on-site
measurements of the apparent outside boundaries in or on such developed
property made by the city or on its behalf;



      (2)   Computation of the impervious area using the dimensions
which are set forth and contained in the records of the office of the Hancock
County Assessor or Center Township Assessor;



      (3)   Estimation, calculation and computation of the
impervious area using aerial photography or photogrammertry, or as contained
in the records of the city or county; or



      (4)   Computation of impervious area using data provided by
the owner, tenant or developer.  The authorized official may require
additional information as necessary to make the determination.

   (A)   Bills or statements for the stormwater utility user fee shall
be rendered monthly, in accordance with the regular Greenfield Utilities
billing cycle, for all properties subject to the fee.  Bills shall be
payable at the same time and in the same manner and subject to the same
penalties as set forth for the sewer utility. Any partial payment of a
combined utility bill shall be applied first to the stormwater utility user
fee.  Any  unpaid stormwater utility user fees shall constitute a lien on
such property and shall be on a parity with the lien of state, county and
municipal taxes. The lien, when delinquent for more than 30 days, may be
foreclosed by the city in the manner provided by the laws of Indiana for the
foreclosure of mortgages on real property.



   (B)   For properties normally receiving monthly utility bills for
other city services, the stormwater utility user fee shall be included in the
monthly bill rendered to the established owner/customer.



   (C)   For properties not receiving monthly utility bills for other
city services, the bill or statement for the stormwater utility user fee
shall be sent to the stormwater utility user as determined from the tax rolls.



   (D)   The owner of a property is ultimately responsible for all fees
imposed under this chapter.



   (E)   Requests for adjustment of the stormwater utility user fee
shall be submitted through the authorized official, who shall be given
authority to administer the procedures and standards and review criteria for
the adjustment of fees as established herein.  All requests shall be judged
on the basis of category and classifications as herein defined.  No credit
shall be given for the installation of facilities required by city or county
development codes or state stormwater rules.  The following procedures shall
apply to all adjustment requests of the stormwater utility user fee:

paid by an owner making the request shall be in writing and set forth, in
detail, the grounds upon which relief is sought.



      (3)   Adjustment requests made during the first calendar year
that the stormwater utility user fee is imposed will be reviewed by the
authorized official within a four-month period from the date of filing of the
adjustment request.  Adjustments resulting from such request shall be
retroactive to the beginning of billings but shall not exceed one year.



      (4)   The owner requesting the adjustment may, at his or her
own cost, provide supplemental information to the authorized official
including, but not limited to facts, opinions or professional services to
substantiate his or her case.



      (5)   Adjustments to the stormwater utility user fee will be
made by the utility billing personnel upon the granting of the adjustment
request in writing, by the authorized official.  Denials of adjustment
requests shall be made in writing by the authorized official.



   (F)   Upon receipt of the written denial of the adjustment request,
the owner who initially requested the adjustment may, within 30 days of
receipt of such denial, appeal to the Board for review of the denial. The
Board shall complete its review within 60 days of receipt of said request for
appeal.  The Board's determination on the appeal shall be in writing and set
forth in detail the reason for its decision.  In evaluating the appeal, the
Board shall be bound by the standards and review criteria contained herein.
All determinations of the Board arising out of this section shall be final.

§ 54.62  PURPOSE.



   (A)   The purpose of this subchapter is to provide for the health,
safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the city through the
regulation of stormwater and non-stormwater discharges to the storm drainage
system and to protect, conserve and promote the orderly development of land
and water resources within the city. This subchapter establishes methods for
managing the quantity and quality of stormwater entering into the stormwater
drainage system in order to comply with state and federal requirements. The
objectives of this subchapter are:



      (1)   To reduce the hazard to public health and safety caused
by excessive stormwater runoff;



      (2)   To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the
stormwater drainage system from construction site runoff;



      (3)   To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the
stormwater drainage system from runoff from new development and
re-development;



      (4)   To prohibit illicit discharges into the stormwater
drainage system; and



      (5)   To establish legal authority to carry out all
inspection, monitoring, and enforcement procedures necessary to ensure
compliance with this subchapter.



   (B)   As required by Rule 13 (327 IAC 15-13), the requirements of
this subchapter are formulated in such a way to promote maximization of open
space and minimization of land disturbance and surface imperviousness, where
practical, in order to minimize the potential for introduction of pollutants
to the city's drainage conveyance system. The requirements of this subchapter
are meant to guide the development within the city so that such development
does not negatively impact the quality of stormwater.

an active construction site or a stabilized site. These discharges include
flows from direct connections to the stormwater drainage system, illegal
dumping, and contaminated runoff.



      (2)   Stormwater runoff from agricultural, timber harvesting,
and coal mining activities is exempted from the requirements of this section
unless determined to contain pollutants not associated with such activities
or in excess of standard practices. Farm residences are not included in this
exemption.



      (3)   Any non-stormwater discharge permitted under an NPDES
permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the discharger and
administered under the authority of the Federal Environmental Protection
Agency, provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all
requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and
regulations, and provided that IDEM issues written acceptance for the subject
discharge to the stormwater drainage system, is also exempted from this
section.



   (B)   Prohibited discharges and connections.



      (1)   No person shall discharge to a MS4 conveyance,
watercourse, or waterbody, directly or indirectly, any substance other than
stormwater or an exempted discharge. Any person discharging stormwater shall
effectively minimize pollutants from also being discharged with the
stormwater, through the use of best management practices (BMPs) referred to
in the City of Greenfield Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.



      (2)   The City of Greenfield is authorized to require
dischargers to implement pollution prevention measures, utilizing BMPs,
necessary to prevent or reduce the discharge of pollutants into the city
stormwater drainage system.



   (C)   Exempted discharges and connections. Notwithstanding other
requirements in this subchapter, the following categories of non-stormwater
discharges or flows are exempted from the requirements of this section:



      (1)   Water line flushing;



      (2)   Landscape irrigation;



      (3)   Diverted streamflows;



      (4)   Rising ground waters;



      (5)   Uncontaminated groundwater infiltration;



      (6)   Uncontaminated pumped ground water;



      (7)   Discharges from potable water sources;



      (8)   Foundation drains;



      (9)   Air conditioning condensation;



      (10)   Irrigation water;



      (11)   Springs;



      (12)   Water from crawl space pumps;



      (13)   Footing drains;



      (14)   Lawn watering;



      (15)   Individual residential car washing;



      (16)   Flows from riparian habitats and wetlands;



      (17)   Dechlorinated swimming pool discharges;



      (18)   Street wash water;



      (19)   Discharges from firefighting activities;



      (20)   Naturally introduced detritus (e.g. leaves and twigs).



   (D)   Storage of hazardous or toxic material.  Storage or
stockpiling of hazardous or toxic material within any watercourse, or in its
associated floodway or floodplain, is strictly prohibited. Storage or
stockpiling of hazardous or toxic material on active construction sites must
include adequate protection or containment so as to prevent any such
materials from entering any temporary or permanent stormwater conveyance or
watercourse.



   (E)   Private property maintenance duties.  Every person owning
property through which a watercourse passes, or such person's lessee, shall
keep and maintain that part of the watercourse located within their property
boundaries, free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles
that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water
through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain
existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so
that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or
physical integrity of the watercourse.



   (F)   Spill reporting. 



      (1)   Any discharger who accidentally discharges into a
waterbody any substance other than stormwater or an exempted discharge shall
immediately inform the Hancock County Health Department and Greenfield Fire
Department concerning the discharge. A written report concerning the
discharge shall be filed with the city and IDEM, by the dischargers, within
five days. The written report shall specify:



         (a)   The composition of the discharge and the cause
thereof;



         (b)   The date, time, and estimated volume of the
discharge;



         (c)   All measures taken to clean up the accidental
discharge, and all measures proposed to be taken to prevent any recurrence;



         (d)   The name and telephone number of the person making
the report, and the name and telephone number of a person who may be
contacted for additional information on the matter.



      (2)   A properly reported accidental discharge shall be an
affirmative defense to a civil infraction proceeding brought under this
subchapter against a discharger for such discharge. It shall not, however, be
a defense to a legal action brought to obtain an injunction, to obtain
recovery of costs or to obtain other relief because of or arising out of the
discharge. A discharge shall be considered properly reported only if the
discharger complies with all the requirements of this section. This
requirement does not relieve the discharger from notifying other entities as
required by other local, state, and federal regulations.



   (G)   Inspections and monitoring.



      (1)   Storm drainage system.  The city has the authority to
periodically inspect any portion of the storm drainage system, whether
publicly or privately owned, in an effort to detect and eliminate illicit
connections and discharges into the system. This inspection may include a
screening of discharges from outfalls connected to the system in order to
determine if prohibited flows are being conveyed into the storm drainage
system. It could also include spot testing of waters contained in the storm
drainage system itself to detect the introduction of pollutants into the
system by means other than a defined outfall, such as dumping or contaminated
sheet runoff.



      (2)   Potential polluters.  If, as a result of the storm
drainage system inspection, a discharger is suspected of an illicit
discharge, the city may inspect or obtain stormwater samples from stormwater
runoff facilities of the subject discharger, to determine compliance with the
requirements of this subchapter. Upon request, the discharger shall allow the
city’s properly identified representative to enter upon the premises of the
discharger at all hours necessary for the purposes of such inspection or
sampling. The city’s properly identified representative may place on the
discharger’s property the equipment or devices used for such sampling or
inspection. Identified illicit connections or discharges shall be subject to
enforcement action as described in § 54.73.



      (3)   New development and re-development.  Following the
final completion of construction and the receipt of as-built drawings, the
city has the authority to inspect new development and re-development sites to
verify that all on-site stormwater conveyances and connections to the storm
drainage system are in compliance with this section.



(Ord. 2006-13, passed 10-26-06)



§ 54.69  STORMWATER QUANTITY MANAGEMENT.



   (A)   Applicability and exemptions. The storage and controlled
release rate of excess stormwater runoff shall be required for all new
business, commercial and industrial developments, residential subdivisions,
planned development, rural estate subdivisions, and any redevelopment or
other new construction located within the city. The city, after thorough
investigation and evaluation, may waive the requirement of controlled runoff
for minor subdivisions and parcelization.



   (B)   Policy on stormwater quantity management.



      (1)   Detention policy. It is recognized that most streams and
drainage channels serving the city do not have sufficient capacity to receive
and convey stormwater runoff resulting from continued urbanization.
Accordingly, the storage and controlled release of excess stormwater runoff
shall be required for all developments and redevelopments (as defined in §
54.64) located within the city.



         (a)   General release rates.



            1.   In general, the post- development release
rates for developments up to and including the ten-year return period storm
may not exceed 0.1 cfs per acre of development. The post-development release
rate for developments for the 11 - 100-year return period storms shall not
exceed 0.3 cfs per acre of development. The above fixed general release rates
may be set at a lower value by the city for certain watersheds if more
detailed data becomes available as a result of comprehensive watershed
studies conducted or formally approved and adopted by the City Council. The
applicant shall confirm the applicable release rates with the city prior to
initiating the design calculations to determine whether a basin-specific rate
has been established for the watershed.



            2.   The release rate for pre- developed areas
that have more than one outlet must be computed based on pre-developed
drainage area tributary to each outlet point. The computed release rate at
each outlet point shall not be exceeded at the respective outlet point, even
if the post-developed conditions would involve a different arrangement of
outlet points. Also, if an outlet control structure includes an orifice to
restrict the flow rate, such orifice shall be no less than four inches in
diameter, even if the four-inch diameter orifice results in a discharge that
exceeds the above-noted general release rates.



         (b)   Site-specific release rates for sites with
depressional storage.



            1.   For sites where depressional storage exists,
the general release rates provided above may have to be further reduced. If
depressional storage exists at the site, site-specific release rates must be
calculated according to methodology described in the City of Greenfield
Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, accounting for the depressional
storage by modeling it as a pond whose outlet is a weir at an elevation that
stormwater can currently overflow the depressional storage area. Post
developed release rate for sites with depressional storage shall be the
two-year pre-developed peak runoff rate for the post-developed ten-year storm
and ten-year pre-developed peak runoff rate for the post- developed 100-year
storm. In no case shall the calculated site-specific release rates be larger
than general release rates provided above.



            2.   Also note that for determining the
post-developed peak runoff rate, the depressional storage must be assumed to
be filled unless the city can be assured, through dedicated easement, that
the noted storage will be preserved in perpetuity.



         (c)   Management of off-site runoff.



            1.   Runoff from all upstream tributary areas
(off-site land areas) may be bypassed around the detention/retention facility
without attenuation. Such runoff may also be bypassed through the
detention/retention facility without attenuation, provided that a separate
secondary outlet system is incorporated for the safe passage of such flows,
i.e., not through the primary outlet of a detention facility. Unless the pond
is being designed as a regional detention facility and therefore all off-site
runoff to the pond detained, the primary outlet structure shall be sized and
the invert elevation of the secondary outlet for bypassing off-site runoff
determined according to the on-site runoff only. To accomplish this, the
100-year on-site runoff must be determined by temporarily ignoring the
off-site runoff and routed through the pond and through the primary outlet
pipe. The resulting pond elevation would be the invert elevation of the
secondary outlet. Once the size and location of primary outlet structure and
the invert elevation of the secondary outlet for bypassing off-site runoff
are determined by considering on-site runoff only, the size of the secondary
outlet and the 100-year pond elevation is determined by routing the entire
inflow, on-site and off-site, through the pond. Once the 100-year pond
elevation is determined in this manner, the crest elevation of the open
emergency weir is set at that elevation.



            2.   Note that the efficiency of the
detention/retention facility in controlling the on-site runoff may be
severely affected if the off-site area is considerably larger than the
on-site area. As a general guidance, on-line detention may not be effective
in controlling on-site runoff where the ratio of off-site area to on-site
area is larger than 5:1. Additional detention (above and beyond that required
for on-site area) may be required by the city when the ratio of off-site area
to on-site area is larger than 5:1.



         (d)   Downstream restrictions.



            1.   In the event the downstream receiving channel
or storm sewer system is inadequate to accommodate the post-developed release
rate provided above, then the allowable release rate shall be reduced to that
rate permitted by the capacity of the receiving downstream channel or storm
sewer system. Additional detention, as determined by the city, shall be
required to store that portion of the runoff exceeding the capacity of the
receiving storm sewers or watercourses. When such downstream restrictions are
suspected, the city may require additional analysis to determine the
receiving system's limiting downstream capacity.



            2.   If the proposed development makes up only a
portion of the undeveloped watershed upstream of the limiting restriction,
the allowable release rate for the development shall be in direct proportion
to the ratio of its drainage area to the drainage area of the entire
watershed upstream of the restriction.



   (C)   Grading and building pad elevations.



      (1)   Maximum yard slopes are 3:1 where soil has been
disturbed during construction processes. Finished floor elevation or the
lowest building entry elevation must be no less than six inches above
finished grade around the building. The building's lowest entry elevation
that is adjacent to and facing a road should be a minimum of 15 inches above
the road elevation or top of curb.



      (2)   All buildings shall have a minimum flood protection
grade shown on the secondary plat. Minimum flood protection grade of all
structures fronting a pond or open ditch shall be no less than two feet above
any adjacent 100-year local or regional flood elevations, whichever is
greater, for all windows, doors, unsealed pipe entrances, window well rim
elevations, and any other structure member where floodwaters can enter a
building.



      (3)   The lowest floor elevation of all residential,
commercial, or industrial structures, located within the Special Flood
Hazards Area (SFHA), as shown on the FEMA maps, shall be at the flood
protection grade and therefore have two feet of freeboard above the 100-year
flood elevation.



      (4)   The lowest adjacent grade for residential, commercial,
or industrial buildings outside a FEMA or IDNR designated floodplain shall
have two feet of freeboard above the flooding source's 100-year flood
elevation under proposed conditions, unless the flooding source is a
rear-yard swale. When the flooding source is a rear-yard swale, the lowest
adjacent grade for residential, commercial, or industrial buildings shall
have two feet of freeboard above the 100-year flood elevation under proposed
conditions.



      (5)   The lowest adjacent grade to ponds for all residential,
commercial or industrial buildings (including walkout basement floor
elevation) shall be set a minimum of two feet above the 100-year pond
elevation or two feet above the emergency overflow weir elevation, whichever
is higher. In addition to the lowest adjacent grade requirements, any
basement floor must be at least a foot above the permanent water level
(normal pool elevation).



      (6)   The 100-year overflow paths throughout the development,
whether shown on FEMA maps or not, must be shown as hatched area on the
plans. A minimum of 20 feet along the centerline of the flow path contained
within permanent drainage easements. A statement shall be added to the plat
that would refer the viewer to the construction plans to see the entire
extent of overflow path as hatched areas. No fences or landscaping can be
constructed within the easement areas that may impede the free flow of
stormwater. These areas are to be maintained by the property owners or be
designated as common areas that are to be maintained by the homeowners
association. The lowest adjacent grade for all residential, commercial, or
industrial buildings shall be set a minimum of one foot above the noted
overflow path/ponding elevation, calculated based on all contributing
drainage areas, on-site and off-site, in their proposed or reasonably
anticipated land use and with storm pipe system assumed completely plugged.



      (7)   It shall be the property owners' responsibility to
maintain the natural features and the natural flow of drainage on their lots
and to take preventive measures against any and all erosion or deterioration
of natural or manmade features on their lots.



   (D)   Acceptable outlet and adjoining property impact policies.



      (1)   Design and construction of the stormwater facility shall
provide for the discharge of the stormwater runoff from off-site land areas
as well as the stormwater from the area being developed (on-site land areas)
to an acceptable outlet(s) (as determined by the city) having capacity to
receive upstream (off-site) and on-site drainage. The flow path from the
development outfall(s) to a regulated drain or natural watercourse (as
determined by the city) shall be provided on an exhibit that includes
topographic information. Any existing field tile encountered during the
construction shall also be incorporated into the proposed stormwater drainage
system or tied to an acceptable outlet. In addition, no activities conducted
as part of the development shall be allowed to obstruct the free flow of
flood waters from an upstream property.



      (2)   Where the outfall from the stormwater drainage system of
any development flows through real estate owned by others prior to reaching a
regulated drain or watercourse, no acceptance shall be granted for such
drainage system until all owners of real estate and/or tenants crossed by the
outfall consent in writing to the use of their real estate through a recorded
easement.



      (3)   If an adequate outlet is not located on site, then
further reduction in allowable release rates or off-site drainage
improvements may be required. Those improvements may include, but are not
limited to, extending storm sewers, clearing, dredging or removal of
obstructions to open drains or natural water courses, and the removal or
replacement of undersized culvert pipes as required by the city.



   (E)   No net loss floodplain storage policy.



      (1)   Floodplains exist adjacent to all natural and man-made
streams, regardless of contributing drainage area or whether they have been
previously identified or mapped. Due to potential impacts of floodplain loss
on peak flows in streams and on the environment, disturbance to floodplains
must be avoided. When the avoidance of floodplain disturbance is not
practical, the natural functions of floodplain must be preserved to the
extent possible.



      (2)   In an attempt to strike a balance between the legitimate
need for economic development within the city and the need to preserve the
natural functions of floodplains to the extent possible, compensatory
excavation equivalent to the floodplain storage lost shall be required for
all activities within floodplain of streams located in the city where
drainage area of the stream is equal or larger than one square mile. This
requirement shall be considered to be above and beyond the minimum
requirements provided in the applicable flood hazard areas ordinance
currently in effect in the city. The city may alter the compensation ratio,
based on extenuating circumstances, for a specific project.



      (3)   Note that by definition, compensatory storage is the
replacement of the existing floodplain and, in rare exceptions, the floodway
storage lost due to fill. Compensatory storage is required when a portion of
the floodplain is filled, occupied by a structure, or when as a result of a
project a change in the channel hydraulics occurs that reduces the existing
available floodplain storage. The compensatory storage must be located
adjacent or opposite the placement of the fill and maintain an unimpeded
connection to an adjoining floodplain area.



      (4)   Computations must show the provision of compensatory
floodplain storage for 10-year, 50-year, and 100-year storm events. That is,
the post-development 10-year floodplain storage along a stream shall be
equivalent to the 10-year pre-development floodplain storage along the stream
within the property limits, the post-development 50-year floodplain storage
along a stream shall be equivalent to the 50-year pre-development floodplain
storage along the stream within the property limits, and the post-development
100-year floodplain storage along a stream shall be equivalent to the
100-year pre-development floodplain storage along the stream within the
property limits.



      (5)   Calculations for floodplain volume shall be submitted in
tabular form showing calculations by cross-section. The volume of floodplain
storage under the without-project conditions and the with-project conditions
must be determined using the average-end- area method with plotted
cross-sections at a horizontal to vertical ratio of between 5:1 and 10:1,
with 10- through 100-year flood elevations noted on each cross-section. The
scale chosen must be large enough to show the intent of proposed grading.
Cross-sections must reflect both the existing and proposed conditions on the
same plot. The location and extent of the compensatory storage area as well
as the location and orientation of cross-sections must be shown on the
grading plan.



   (F)   Calculations and design standards and specifications.  The
calculation methods as well as the type, sizing, and placement of all
stormwater facilities shall meet the design criteria, standards, and
specifications outlined in the City of Greenfield Stormwater Technical
Standards Manual. The methods and procedures in the Stormwater Technical
Standards Manual are consistent with the policy stated above.



   (G)   Drainage easement requirements. There shall be no trees or
shrubs planted, nor any structures or fences erected, in any drainage
easement, unless otherwise allowed by the city.



      (1)   All new channels, drain tiles equal to or greater than
12 inches in diameter, inlet and outlet structures of detention and retention
ponds, and appurtenances thereto as required by this section, that are
installed in subdivisions requiring a stormwater management permit from the
city shall be contained within a minimum of 20 feet of drainage easement (ten
feet from centerline on each side) and shown on the recorded plat. New drain
tiles refer to all sub-surface stormwater piping, tubing, tiles, manholes,
inlets, catch basins, risers, etc.



      (2)   A minimum of 25 feet from top of the bank on each side
of a new channel shall be designated on the recorded plat as a drainage
easement. If the top of bank is not vegetated according to the development's
landscape plan, a minimum 25-foot width of filter strip shall be installed
within the drainage easement.



      (3)   Rear-yard swales and emergency overflow paths associated
with detention ponds shall be contained within a minimum of 20 feet width
(ten feet from centerline on each side) of drainage easement.



      (4)   A minimum of 20 feet beyond the actual footprint (top of
the bank) of stormwater detention facilities shall be designated as drainage
easement. A minimum of 20-foot width easement shall also be required as
access easement from a public right-of-way to the facility, unless the pond
is immediately next to a public right-of-way.



   (H)   Placement of utilities.  No utility company may disturb
existing storm management facilities without the consent of the city. All
existing drainage facilities shall have senior rights and damage to said
facilities shall result in penalties as prescribed in § 54.73.



   (I)   Inspection, maintenance, record keeping, and reporting.



      (1)   After the approval of the stormwater management permit
by the city and the commencement of construction activities, the city has the
authority to conduct inspections of the work being done to insure full
compliance with the provisions of this section, the Stormwater Technical
Standards Manual, and the terms and conditions of the approved permit.



      (2)   The city also has the authority to perform long-term,
post-construction inspection of all public or privately owned stormwater
quantity facilities. The inspection will cover physical conditions, available
storage capacity, and the operational condition of key facility elements.
Stormwater quantity facilities shall be maintained in good condition, in
accordance with the terms and conditions of the approved stormwater
management permit, and shall not be subsequently altered, revised or replaced
except in accordance with the approved stormwater permit, or in accordance
with approved amendments or revisions to the permit. If deficiencies are
found during the inspection, the owner of the facility will be notified by
the city and will be required to take all necessary measures to correct such
deficiencies. If the owner fails to correct the deficiencies within the
allowed time period, as specified in the notification letter, the city will
undertake the work and collect from the owner using lien rights if necessary.



(Ord. 2006-13, passed 10-26-06)



§ 54.70  STORMWATER POLLUTION PREVENTION FOR CONSTRUCTION SITES.



   (A)   Applicability and exemptions.



      (1)   The city requires that a Stormwater Pollution Prevention
Plan (SWPPP), which includes erosion and sediment control measures and
materials handling procedures, to be submitted as part of the construction
plans and specifications. Once approved, the developer must comply with the
approved plan and abide by all the requirements of the permit. Any project
located within the city that includes clearing, grading, excavation, or other
land-disturbing activities, resulting in the disturbance of or impact on one
acre or more of total land area, is subject to the requirements of this
section. This includes both new development and redevelopment. This section
also applies to disturbances of less than one acre of land that are part of a
larger common plan of development or sale if the larger common plan will
ultimately disturb one or more acres of land, within the MS4 area. For sites
with a total disturbance less than one acre that are not part of a larger
common plan or development, the applicant shall provide an erosion and
sediment control plan as noted in § 54.72. Section 54.70(C) provides
guidelines for calculating land disturbance.



      (2)   The requirements under this section do not apply to the
following activities:



         (a)   Agricultural land-disturbing activities; or



         (b)   Timber harvesting activities.



      (3)   The requirements under this section do not apply to the
following activities, provided other applicable state permits contain
provisions requiring immediate implementation of soil erosion control
measures:



         (a)   Landfills that have been issued a certification of
closure under 329 IAC 10.



         (b)   Coal mining activities permitted under I.C. 14-34.



         (c)   Municipal solid waste landfills that are accepting
waste pursuant to a permit issued by the Indiana Department of Environmental
Management under 329 IAC 10 that contains equivalent stormwater requirements,
including the expansion of landfill boundaries and construction of new cells
either within or outside the original solid waste permit boundary.



      (4)   The owner or operator of each individual lot where land
disturbance is expected to be one acre or more must complete their own notice
of intent letter, apply for an Improvement Location Permit (ILP) from the
city, and ensure that a sufficient construction and stormwater pollution
prevention plan is completed and submitted in accordance with § 54.72,
regardless of whether the individual lot is part of a larger permitted
project site.



      (5)   An individual lot with land disturbance or impact less
than one acre, located within a larger permitted project site, is considered
part of the larger permitted project site and the individual lot operator
must, at a minimum, comply with the terms and conditions of the stormwater
pollution prevention plan approved for the larger project site. The
development plans for the larger project site must include detailed erosion
and sediment control and material handling measures for individual lots. In
addition, the owner or operator of these individual lots are required to
submit as part of their Improvement Location Permit (ILP), a stormwater
pollution prevention plan in the form of an Individual Lot Plot Plan
detailing erosion and sediment control measures and material handling
procedures that will be followed for the duration of construction. Details of
the permitting process are contained in § 54.72.



      (6)   An individual lot with land disturbance or impact of
greater than 10,000 square feet but less than one acre must include, as part
of the Improvement Location Permit (ILP), a stormwater pollution prevention
plan in the form of an individual Lot Plot Plan detailing erosion and
sediment control and material handling procedures.



      (7)   It is the responsibility of the project site owner to
complete an Improvement Location Permit application and ensure that a
sufficient construction plan is completed and submitted to the City of
Greenfield in accordance with § 54.72. It is the responsibility of the
project site owner and permit holder to ensure compliance with this
subchapter during the construction activity and implementation of the
construction plan, and in following and implementing all best management
practices, and to notify the city with a sufficient notice of termination
letter upon completion of the project and stabilization of the site. However,
all persons engaging in construction and land-disturbing activities on a
permitted project site meeting the applicability requirements must comply
with the requirements of this section and this subchapter.



   (B)   Policy on stormwater pollution prevention. Effective
stormwater pollution prevention on construction sites is dependent on a
combination of preventing movement of soil from its original position
(erosion control), intercepting displaced soil prior to entering a waterbody
(sediment control), and proper on-site materials handling. The developer must
submit to the city, a SWPPP with detailed erosion and sediment control plans
as well as a narrative describing materials type and specification, handling
and storage, and construction sequencing. The following principles apply to
all land-disturbing activities and must be considered in the preparation of a
Stormwater Pollution Prevention Plan within the city.



      (1)   Minimize the potential for soil erosion by designing a
development that fits the topography and soils of the site. Deep cuts and
fills in areas with steep slopes must be avoided wherever possible, and
natural contours must be followed as closely as possible.



      (2)   Existing natural vegetation must be retained and
protected wherever possible. Areas immediately adjacent (within 30 feet of
top of bank) to watercourses and lakes also must be left undisturbed wherever
possible. Unvegetated or vegetated areas with less than 70% cover that are
scheduled or likely to be left inactive for 15 days or more must be
temporarily or permanently stabilized with measures appropriate for the
season to reduce erosion potential. Alternative measures to site
stabilization may be acceptable if the project site owner or their
representative can demonstrate they have implemented and maintained erosion
and sediment control measures adequate to prevent sediment discharge from the
inactive area.



      (3)   All activities on a site must be conducted in a logical
sequence so that the smallest practical area of land will be exposed for the
shortest practical period of time during development.



      (4)   The length and steepness of designed slopes must be
minimized to reduce erosion potential. Drainage channels and swales must be
designed and adequately protected so that their final gradients and resultant
velocities will not cause erosion in the receiving channel or at the outlet.
Methods for determining acceptable velocities are included in the Stormwater
Technical Standards Manual.



      (5)   Sediment-laden water which otherwise would flow from the
project site shall be treated by erosion and sediment control measures
appropriate to minimize sedimentation. A stable and erosion resistant
construction site access point (i.e., crushed stone, slag, aggregate, etc.)
shall be provided at all points of construction traffic ingress and egress to
the project site.



      (6)   Appropriate measures shall be implemented to prevent
wastes or unused building materials, including garbage, debris, packaging
material, fuels and petroleum products, hazardous materials or wastes,
cleaning wastes, wastewater, concrete truck washout, and other substances
from being carried from a project site by runoff or wind. Identification of
areas where concrete truck washout is permissible must be clearly posted at
appropriate areas of the site. Wastes and unused building materials shall be
managed and disposed of in accordance with all applicable state statutes and
regulations. Proper storage and handling of materials such as fuels or
hazardous wastes, and spill prevention and cleanup measures shall be
implemented to minimize the potential for pollutants to contaminate surface
or ground water or degrade soil quality.



      (7)   Public or private roadways shall be kept cleared of
accumulated sediment that is a result of runoff or tracking. Bulk clearing of
accumulated sediment shall not include flushing the area with water. Cleared
sediment shall be redistributed or disposed of in a manner that is in
accordance with all applicable statutes and regulations.



      (8)   Collected runoff leaving a project site must be either
discharged directly into a well-defined, stable receiving channel, or
diffused and released to adjacent property without causing an erosion or
pollutant problem to the adjacent property owner.



      (9)   Natural features, including wetlands, shall be protected
from pollutants associated with stormwater runoff.



   (C)   Calculations and design standards and specifications.



      (1)   In calculating the total area of land disturbance, for
the purposes of determining applicability of this section to the project, the
following guidelines must be used:



         (a)   Off-site construction activities that provide
services (for example, road extensions, sewer, water, and other utilities) to
a land-disturbing project site, must be considered as a part of the total
land disturbance calculation for the project site, when the activity is under
the control of the project site owner.



         (b)   Strip developments will be considered as one
project site and must comply with this section unless the total combined
disturbance on all individual lots is less than one acre and is not part of a
larger common plan of development or sale.



         (c)   To determine if multi-lot project sites are
regulated by this rule, the area of land disturbance shall be calculated by
adding the total area of land disturbance for improvements, such as roads,
utilities, or common areas, and the expected total disturbance on each
individual lot, as determined by the following:



            1.   Construction of a single- family residential
project site where the lots are one- half acre or more, one-half acre of land
disturbance must be used as the expected lot disturbance.



            2.   Construction of a single- family residential
project site where the lots are less than one half acre in size, the total
lot must be calculated as being disturbed.



            3.   To calculate lot disturbance on all other
types of projects sites, such as industrial and commercial projects project
sites, a minimum of one acre of land disturbance must be used as the expected
lot disturbance, unless the lots are less than one acre in size, in which
case the total lot must be calculated as being disturbed.



      (2)   The calculation methods as well as the type, sizing, and
placement of all stormwater pollution prevention measures for construction
sites shall meet the design criteria, standards, and specifications outlined
in the latest editions of the Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual and the City
of Greenfield Stormwater Technical Standards Manual. The methods and
procedures included in these two references are in keeping with the above
stated policy and meet the requirements of IDEM's Rule 5. A copy of the
Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual may be obtained through IDEM.



   (D)   Inspection, maintenance, record keeping, and reporting.



      (1)   Following approval of the development plan or
Improvement Location Permit, the city will have the authority to conduct
inspections of the site to ensure full compliance with the provisions of this
section, the latest edition of the Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual, and the
terms and conditions of the approved permit.



      (2)   A self-monitoring program must be implemented by the
project site owner or permit holder to ensure the stormwater pollution
prevention plan is working effectively. A trained individual, acceptable to
the city, shall perform a written evaluation of the project site by the end
of the next business day following each measurable storm event. If there are
no measurable storm events within a given week, the site must be monitored at
least once in that week. Weekly inspections by the trained individual shall
continue until the entire site has been stabilized and a Notice of
Termination has been issued. The trained individual must look at the
maintenance of existing stormwater pollution prevention measures, including
erosion and sediment control measures, drainage structures, and construction
materials storage/containment facilities, to ensure they are functioning
properly and that they are not dismantled or tampered with by others. The
trained individual must also identify additional measures, beyond those
originally identified in the stormwater pollution prevention plan, necessary
to remain in compliance with all applicable statutes and regulations.



      (3)   The resulting evaluation reports must include the name
of the individual performing the evaluation, the date of the evaluation,
problems identified at the project site, and details of maintenance,
additional measures, and corrective actions recommended and completed.



      (4)   The stormwater pollution prevention plan shall serve as
a guideline for stormwater quality, but shall not be interpreted to be the
only basis for implementation of stormwater quality measures for a project
site. The project site owner and permit holder is responsible for
implementing, in accordance with this section, all measures necessary to
adequately prevent polluted stormwater runoff. Recommendations by the trained
individual for modified stormwater quality measures must be implemented.



      (5)   Although self-monitoring reports do not need to be
submitted, the city has the right to request complete records of maintenance
and monitoring activities involving stormwater pollution prevention measures.
All evaluation reports for the project site must be made available to the
city in an organized fashion, within 48 hours upon request.

§ 54.71  STORMWATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT FOR POST- CONSTRUCTION.



   (A)   Applicability and exemptions.



      (1)   In addition to the requirements of § 54.70, the
stormwater pollution prevention plan, which is to be submitted to the city as
part of the stormwater management permit application, must also include
post-construction stormwater quality measures. These measures are
incorporated as a permanent feature into the site plan and are left in place
following completion of construction activities to continuously treat
stormwater runoff from the stabilized site. Any project located within the
city that includes clearing, grading, excavation, or other land-disturbing
activities, resulting in the disturbance of or impact on one acre or more of
total land area, is subject to the requirements of this section. This
includes both new development and redevelopment, and disturbances of less
than one acre of land that are part of a larger common plan of development or
sale if the larger common plan will ultimately disturb one or more acres of
land, within the MS4 area.



      (2)   The requirements under this section do not apply to the
following activities:



         (a)   Agricultural land-disturbing activities; or



         (b)   Timber harvesting activities; or



         (c)   Construction activities associated with a single
family residential dwelling disturbing less than five acres, when the
dwelling is not part of a larger common plan of development or sale; or



         (d)   Single family residential developments consisting
of four or less lots; or



         (e)   A single-family residential strip development
where the developer offers for sale or lease without land improvements and
the project is not part of a larger common plan of development of sale; or



         (f)   Individual building lots within a larger permitted
project.



      (3)   The requirements under this section do not apply to the
following activities, provided other applicable state permits contain
provisions requiring immediate implementation of soil erosion control
measures:



         (a)   Landfills that have been issued a certification of
closure under 329 IAC 10.



         (b)   Coal mining activities permitted under I.C. 14-34.



         (c)   Municipal solid waste landfills that are accepting
waste pursuant to a permit issued by the Indiana Department of Environmental
Management under 329 IAC 10 that contains equivalent stormwater requirements,
including the expansion of landfill boundaries and construction of new cells
either within or outside the original solid waste permit boundary.



      (4)   It will be the responsibility of the project site owner
to complete a stormwater permit application and ensure that a sufficient
construction plan is completed and submitted to the city in accordance with
§ 54.72. It will be the responsibility of the project site owner or permit
holder to ensure proper construction and installation of all stormwater BMPs
in compliance with this subchapter and with the approved stormwater
management permit, and to notify the city with a sufficient notice of
termination letter upon completion of the project and stabilization of the
site. However, all eventual property owners of stormwater quality management
facilities meeting the applicability requirements must comply with the
requirements of this section and this subchapter.



   (B)   Policy on stormwater quality management.



      (1)   It is recognized that developed areas, as compared to
undeveloped areas, generally have increased imperviousness, decreased
infiltration rates, increased runoff rates, and increased concentrations of
pollutants such as fertilizers, herbicides, greases, oil, salts and other
pollutants. As new development and re-development continues in the city,
measures must be taken to intercept and filter pollutants from stormwater
runoff prior to reaching regional creeks, streams, and rivers. It is presumed
that through the use of Best Management Practices (BMP), stormwater runoff
will be filtered and harmful amounts of sediment, nutrients, and contaminants
will be removed. The city has established a minimum standard that the
measurement of the effectiveness of the control of stormwater quality will be
based on the management of total suspended solids (TSS).



      (2)   The project site owner must submit to the city a Storm
Water Pollution Prevention Plan (SWPPP) that will show placement of
appropriate BMP(s) from a pre-approved list of BMPs specified in the City of
Greenfield Stormwater Technical Standards Manual. The noted BMPs must be
designed, constructed, and maintained according to guidelines provided or
referenced in the City of Greenfield Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.
Practices other than those specified in the pre- approved list may be
utilized. However, the burden of proof, as to whether the performance
(minimum 80% TSS removal) and ease of maintenance of such practices will be
according to guidelines provided in the City of Greenfield Stormwater
Technical Standards Manual, would be placed with the applicant. Details
regarding the procedures and criteria for consideration of acceptance of such
BMPs are provided in the City of Greenfield Stormwater Technical Standards
Manual.



      (3)   Gasoline outlets and refueling areas must install
appropriate practices to reduce lead, copper, zinc, and hydrocarbons in
stormwater runoff. These requirements will apply to all new facilities, any
existing facilities that replace storage tanks, or any facility that is
contributing to water quality degradation through tank leakage, sheet
drainage, or any other conveyance that introduces a pollutant to surface or
ground waters.



   (C)   Calculations and design standards and specifications.



      (1)   Calculation of land disturbance must follow the
guidelines discussed in § 54.70(C).



      (2)   The calculation methods as well as the type, sizing, and
placement of all stormwater quality management measures, or BMPs shall meet
the design criteria, standards, and specifications outlined in the latest
editions of the Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual and the City of Greenfield
Stormwater Technical Standards Manual. The methods and procedures included in
these two references are in keeping with the above stated policy and meet the
requirements of IDEM's Rule 13.



   (D)   Easement requirements. All stormwater quality management
systems, including detention or retention basins, filter strips, pocket
wetlands, in-line filters, infiltration systems, conveyance systems,
structures and appurtenances located outside of the right-of-way shall be
designated as common areas or incorporated into permanent drainage easements.
A 20-foot wide access easement from the public right-of-way shall be provided
for each BMP. An adequate easement, as detailed in the City of Greenfield
Stormwater Technical Standards Manual, beyond the actual footprint of the
stormwater quality management facility must also be provided for the purposes
of monitoring, inspection and general maintenance activities.



   (E)   Inspection, maintenance, record keeping, and reporting.



      (1)   After the approval of the stormwater management permit,
the city has the authority to conduct inspections of the work being done to
ensure full compliance with the provisions of this section, the Stormwater
Technical Standards Manual, and the terms and conditions of the approved
permit.



      (2)   Stormwater quality management facilities shall be
maintained in good condition, in accordance with the Operation and
Maintenance procedures and schedules listed in the latest editions of the
Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual and the City of Greenfield Stormwater
Technical Standards Manual, and the terms and conditions of the approved
stormwater permit, and shall not be subsequently altered, revised, or
replaced except in accordance with the approved stormwater permit, or in
accordance with approved amendments or revisions in the permit. Following
construction completion, maintenance of stormwater quality facilities shall
be the long-term responsibility of the facility's owner.



      (3)   The city has the authority to perform long-term,
post-construction inspection of all public or privately owned stormwater
quality facilities. The inspections will follow the Operation and Maintenance
procedures included in the Stormwater Technical Standards Manual or permit
application for each specific BMP. The inspection will cover physical
conditions, available water quality storage capacity and the operational
condition of key facility elements. Noted deficiencies and recommended
corrective action will be included in an inspection report. If deficiencies
are found during the inspection, the owner of the facility will be notified
by the city and will be required to take all necessary measures to correct
such deficiencies. If the owner fails to correct the deficiencies within the
allowed time period, as specified in the notification letter, the city will
undertake the work and collect from the owner using lien rights if necessary.

§ 54.72  PERMIT REQUIREMENTS AND PROCEDURES.



   (A)   Conceptual drainage plan review.  In order to establish that
an adequate drainage outlet(s) exists for a proposed development, a developer
may apply for a conceptual drainage plan review by the city. Note that any
preliminary drainage approval by the city as a result of such a review is
based on preliminary data and shall not be construed as a final drainage
approval or considered binding on either party. The following is a general
listing of minimum data requirements for the review of conceptual drainage
plans:



      (1)   Complete sets of conceptual plans showing general
project layout, including existing and proposed drainage systems and proposed
outlets (plan sheets must be larger than 11" by 17", but not to exceed 24" by
36").



      (2)   General description of the existing and proposed
drainage systems in narrative form.



      (3)   Watershed boundaries on the city's one- foot or two-foot
topographic mapping.



      (4)   Existing watercourse or regulated drains.



      (5)   Letter of Intent for obtaining any needed consents,
off-site easements, right-of-way, or regulatory permits.



   (B)   Permit procedures.



      (1)   This section applies to all development, or
re-development of land, that are subject to this subchapter as specified in
§ 54.61 (Applicability and Exemptions). Individual lots with a land
disturbance of greater than 10,000 square feet and less than one acre must
refer to § 54.72(D) for plan review requirements and procedures.



      (2)   Figure 6-1 is a flowchart summarizing the plan
review/permit approval process and can be found at the end of this section.
The project site owner shall submit an application for a stormwater
management permit to the city. The application will include a Draft Notice of
Intent letter (NOI) that would also act as permit application form,
construction plan sheets, stormwater drainage technical report, a stormwater
pollution prevention plan for construction sites (if the total disturbance is
one acre or more), post-construction pollution prevention plan (if the total
disturbance is one acre or more), and any other necessary support
information. Specific information to be included in the application can be
found in division (C) below. Adequate number of copies of each application
material, as noted in the “Stormwater Permit Application Check-In
Checklist” contained in the City of Greenfield Stormwater Technical
Standards Document, must be submitted to the city. Additionally, a digital
copy of the construction plans is required in a format acceptable to the city.



      (3)   After the city receipt of the application, the applicant
will be notified as to whether the application was complete or insufficient.
The applicant will be asked for additional information if the application is
insufficient. The information provided will be reviewed in detail by the city
or its plan review consultant(s). Once all comments have been received and
the review completed, the city will either approve the project or request
modifications.



      (4)   Once a permit has been issued, the project site owner
must file a Notice of Intent a minimum of 48 hours prior to the commencement
of construction activities. Notification shall be in the form of an updated
NOI form. The submittal of the NOI must be provided to the city and the IDEM.
The IDEM submittal must include a proof of publication, verification that the
jurisdictional entity approved the plan, appropriate fee, and any other
information required by IDEM. The city submittal must include copies of the
final, approved construction plans, stormwater drainage technical report,
stormwater pollution prevention plan for construction sites (if the total
disturbance is one acre or more), post-construction stormwater pollution
prevention plan, the written notification and proof of publication. The
number of required copies varies from case to case and must be determined by
contacting the city. A pre-construction meeting is required to be held with
the participation of the city and other entities involved prior to any
grading activity to ensure that appropriate perimeter control measures have
been implemented on the site and the location of any existing tiles has been
properly marked.



      (5)   Once construction starts, the project owner shall
monitor construction activities and inspect all stormwater pollution
prevention measures in compliance with this subchapter and the terms and
conditions of the approved permit. Upon completion of construction
activities, as-built plans must be submitted to the city. A Notice of
Termination (NOT) shall be sent to the city once the construction site has
been stabilized and all temporary erosion and sediment control measures have
been removed. The city, or a representative, shall inspect the construction
site to verify the requirements for an NOT have been met. Once the applicant
receives a “verified” copy of the NOT, they must forward a copy to IDEM.
Permits issues under this scenario will expire three years from the date of
issuance. If construction is not completed within three years, the NOI must
be resubmitted at least 90 days prior to expiration.



   (C)   Information requirements: development or redevelopment
disturbing or impacting greater than one acre.



      (1)   Specific projects or activities may be exempt from all
or part of the informational requirements listed below. Exemptions are
detailed in the “Applicability and Exemptions” sections of §§ 54.68 -
54.71. If a project or activity is exempt from any or all requirements of
this subchapter, an application must be filed listing the exemption criteria
met, in lieu of the information requirements listed below. This level of
detailed information is not required from individual lots that disturb or
impact less than one acre of land that are developed within a larger
permitted project site. Review and acceptance of such lots is covered under
§ 54.72(D).



      (2)   The different elements of a permit submittal for a
Stormwater Plan approval include a Draft Notice of Intent (NOI), construction
plans, a stormwater drainage technical report, a stormwater pollution
prevention plan for active construction sites, a post-construction stormwater
pollution prevention plan, and any other necessary supporting information. In
addition, an updated NOI along with proof of publication of a public notice
will need to be submitted directly to IDEM, with a copy provided to the city
after the permit is approved. All plans, reports, calculations, and
narratives shall be signed and sealed by a professional engineer or a
licensed land surveyor, registered in the State of Indiana.



         (a)   Draft Notice of Intent.



            1.   The NOI is a standard form developed by the
Indiana Department of Environmental Management which requires general project
information. As part of the City of Greenfield Stormwater Management Permit
application package, the NOI form must be completed in full based on data and
information available at the time of application.



            2.   An updated version of this form, accompanied
by proof of publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the affected
area that notified the public that a construction activity is to commence,
will need to be resubmitted later after the stormwater management permit is
granted and at least 48 hours prior to commencement of construction. The
publication must include the following language:



“(Company name, address) is submitting an NOI letter to notify the City of
Greenfield and the Indiana Department of Environmental Management of our
intent to comply with the requirements of the City of Greenfield Stormwater
Management Ordinance, as well as the requirements of 327 IAC 15-5 and 327 IAC
15-13, to discharge stormwater from construction activities for the following
project: (name of the construction project, address of the location of the
construction project, and Parcel Identification Number). Runoff from the
project site will discharge to (stream(s) receiving the discharge(s)).”



         (b)   Construction plans.  Construction plan sheets (a
minimum of 11" by 17", but not to exceed 24" by 36" in size) with a scale of

      (2)   The project site owner shall inform all general
contractors, construction management firms, grading or excavating
contractors, utility contractors, and the contractors that have primary
oversight on individual building lots of the terms and conditions of the
stormwater management permit and the schedule for proposed implementation.



      (3)   It is the intent of this subchapter to direct the
community's physical growth away from sensitive areas and towards areas that
can support it without compromising water quality. In the event that a
project site is determined to impact or discharge to a sensitive area or is
located in an impact drainage area, the city may require more stringent
stormwater quantity and quality measures than detailed in this subchapter or
in the latest edition of the Indiana Stormwater Quality Manual.



         (a)   Determination of sensitive areas.  Sensitive
areas include highly erodible soils, wetlands, threatened or endangered
species habitat, outstanding waters, impaired waters, recreational waters,
and surface drinking water sources. A listing of highly erodible soils,
outstanding water, impaired water, recreation water, and surface drinking
water sources can be found in the City of Greenfield Storm Water Quality
Management Plan (SWQMP) - Part B, dated October 8, 2004 and its updates. Any
discharge from a stormwater practice that is a Class V injection well shall
meet the Indiana groundwater quality standards. If wetlands are suspected on
a site, wetland delineation shall be completed in accordance with the
methodology established by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (COE) and the
wetland addressed in accordance to the COE requirements. If the presence of
threatened or endangered species habitat is suspected on a site, the site
must be evaluated and inspected by a professional experienced in such and the
results reported to the city. Special terms and conditions for development
determined to impact or discharge to any sensitive area shall be included in
the stormwater management permit.



         (b)   Determination of impact drainage areas.



            1.   The following areas shall be designated as

of any drain tile or enclosed conduit within the Hancock County Regulated
Drainage System.



            2.   The City Board of Public Works and Safety is
authorized, but is not required, to classify certain additional geographical
areas as impact drainage areas. In determining impact drainage areas, the
City Board of Public Works and Safety shall consider such factors as land
use, topography, soil type, capacity of existing drains, and distance from
adequate drainage facility.



            3.   Land that does not have an adequate outlet,
taking into consideration the capacity and depth of the outlet, may be
designated as an impact drainage area by the City Board of Public Works and
Safety. Special terms and conditions for development within any impact
drainage area shall be included in the stormwater management permit.



   (I)   Certification of as-built plans. After completion of
construction of the project and before final project acceptance of the
stormwater management plan (the issuance of a “verified” NOT), a
professionally prepared and certified 'as-built' set of plans (record
drawings) by a professional engineer or licensed land surveyor registered in
the State of Indiana shall be submitted to the city for review. These
as-built plans/record drawings must be prepared and certified by the engineer
of record, i.e., the company/engineer who originally prepared the
construction plans. Additionally, a digital copy of the “as-built” plans
(record drawings) as well as finalized digital versions of all analyses,
models, manuals, and reports that are consistent with the as-built conditions
are required in a format accepted by the city. These plans shall include all
pertinent data relevant to the completed storm drainage system and stormwater
management facilities, and shall include:

the city. (See certificate in Stormwater Technical Standards Manual.)



   (J)   Required maintenance assurances.



      (1)   The property owner, developer, or contractor shall be
required to file a three-year maintenance bond or other acceptable guarantee
with the city, prior to final project acceptance (the issuance of a
“verified” NOT), in an amount not to exceed 20% of the cost of the
stormwater drainage system located outside the public road right-of-ways, and
in a form satisfactory to the City Attorney in order to assure that such
stormwater system installation was done according to standards of good
workmanship, that the materials used in the construction and installation
were of good quality and construction, and that such project was done in
accordance with the accepted plans, and this subchapter. The bond or other
acceptable guarantee shall be in effect for a period of three years after the
date of the final project acceptance by the city.



      (2)   To verify that all enclosed drains are functioning
properly, visual recordings (via closed circuit television) of such tile
drains shall be required, once following the completion of installation
(including the installation of all utility mains) and the second time before
release of maintenance bonds. These visual recordings will be scheduled by
the city, and paid for by the developer. Notices shall be provided to the
city within 72 hours following the completion of installation and again at
least 60 days prior to the expiration date of the maintenance bond so that
the noted recordings may be scheduled. Reports summarizing the results of the
noted visual recordings shall be reviewed and accepted by the city before the
improvement is recommended for recording and again before maintenance bond
would be recommended to be released.

discharge which presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to
the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the stormwater
drainage system or waters of the United States. If the violator fails to
comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the city may take such
steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the stormwater
drainage system or waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to
persons.

has been applied may appeal in writing, not later than 30 days after the
action or decision being appealed from, to the City Board of Public Works and
Safety the action or decision whereby any such provision was so applied. Such
appeal shall identify the matter being appealed, and the basis for the
appeal. The City Board of Public Works and Safety shall consider the appeal
and make a decision whereby it affirms, rejects or modifies the action being
appealed. In considering any such appeal, the City Board of Public Works and
Safety may consider the recommendations of the City Engineer and the comments
of other persons having knowledge of the matter. In considering any such
appeal, the City Board of Public Works and Safety may grant a variance from
the terms of this subchapter to provide relief, in whole or in part, from the
action being appealed, but only upon finding that the following requirements
are satisfied:



      (1)   The application of the subchapter provisions being
appealed will present or cause practical difficulties for a development or
development site; provided, however, that practical difficulties shall not
include the need for the developer to incur additional reasonable expenses in
order to comply with the subchapter; and



      (2)   The granting of the relief requested will not
substantially prevent the goals and purposes of this subchapter, nor result
in less effective management of stormwater runoff.

IN GENERAL



§ 95.01  COMMON LAW AND STATUTORY NUISANCES.



   In addition to what is declared in this chapter and  code  to  be
a  public  nuisance,  those  offenses which are known to the common law
and the statutes of Indiana as public nuisances may, in case any thereof
exist within the city limits, be treated as such and be proceeded against as
is provided in this chapter and code, or in accordance with any other
provisions of law.  Wherever the word NUISANCE is used in this chapter, it
refers to a public nuisance.



('66 Code, § 55.01)



§ 95.02  CERTAIN CONDITIONS DECLARED NUISANCES.



   The following conditions within the city constitute and are declared to
be nuisances:



   (A)   Dangerous trees in public ways.  Any tree, stack, or other
object standing on such premises in such condition that it shall, if the
condition is allowed to continue, endanger life, limb, or property, or cause
hurt, damage, or injury to persons or property on the public streets or
public ways adjacent thereto, by the falling thereof or of parts thereof.



   (B)   Accumulation of rubbish.  An accumulation on any premises of
filth, refuse, trash, garbage, or other waste material which endangers the
public health, welfare, or safety, or materially interferes with the peaceful
enjoyment by owners or occupants of adjacent property because of the danger
of its catching or communicating fire, its attracting and propagating vermin,
rodents, or insects, or blowing into any street, sidewalk, or property of
another.  It shall be the duty of persons owning or being in charge of those
business establishments whose patrons purchase goods or services from their
automobiles, commonly known as “drive-ins,” to furnish sufficient covered
receptacles for the deposit of wastes created in the operation of such
business, and to clean up such wastes as are not deposited in receptacles at
the close of business of each day (or if such business operates continuously,
at least once each day), and at such other times when weather conditions are
such that waste from the operation of such business is being blown to
adjoining premises.



   (C)   Noxious odors or smoke.  Emissions from premises into the
surrounding atmosphere of such odors, dusts, smoke, or other matter as to
render ordinary use or physical occupation of other property in the vicinity
uncomfortable or impossible.



   (D)   Noise.  Noise noxious enough to destroy the enjoyment of
dwelling houses or other uses of property in the vicinity by interfering with
the ordinary comforts of human existence.



   (E)   Storage of explosives or combustible material.  Storage on
the premises of such combustible or explosive material as to create a safety
hazard to other property or persons in the vicinity.



   (F)   Open wells.  The maintenance of any open or uncovered, or
insecurely covered, cistern, cellar, well, pit, excavation, or vault situated
on private premises in any open or unfenced lot or place.



   (G)   Trees and shrubbery obstructing streets and sidewalks.  The
growing and maintenance of trees with less than 14 feet clearance over
streets or less than eight feet over sidewalks, or the growing and
maintenance of shrubbery in excess of three feet in height within a radius of
20 feet from the point where the curb line of any street intersects the curb
line of another street.  No shrub shall be planted between the curb line and
the property line of any street within a radius of 20 feet from the point
where the curb line of any street intersects with the curb line of another
street.



('66 Code, § 55.04)



§ 95.03  TEST FOR NUISANCE.



   Whether or not a particular annoyance of the character listed in §
95.02 constitutes a nuisance shall depend on its effect on persons of
ordinary health and average sensibilities, and not on its effect on persons
who are delicate or supersensitive, or whose habit, tastes, or conditions are
such that they are never sensible of any annoyance.



('66 Code, § 55.05)



§ 95.04  NUISANCE CREATED BY OTHERS.



   For the purpose of this chapter, it shall not be essential that the
nuisance be created or contributed to by the owner, or tenants, or their
agents or representatives, but merely that the nuisance be enacted or
contributed to by licensees, invitees, guests, or other persons for whose
conduct the owner or operator is responsible, or by persons for whose conduct
the owner or operator is not responsible, but, by the exercise of reasonable
care, the owner or operator ought to have become aware of.



('66 Code, § 55.06)



§ 95.05  INSPECTION OF PREMISES.



   For the purpose of carrying the provisions of this chapter into effect,
it is made the duty of all officers and employees of the city to report the
existence of nuisances to the Board of Public Works and Safety.  The City
Engineer, the Street Commissioner, the Board of Health, the Police
Department, the Fire Department, or other employees designated by the Board
of Public Works and Safety shall be permitted to visit or enter into or on
any building, lot, grounds, or premises within the limits of this city to
ascertain and discover any such nuisances.



('66 Code, § 55.03)



§ 95.06  ABATEMENT OF NUISANCES.



   (A)   In any case where any nuisance may be found to exist, it shall
be the duty of the Board of Public Works and Safety to serve notice on the
owner or occupant of the premises where such nuisance exists, or on any other
person so causing such nuisance, to abate such nuisance within a reasonable
time. In determining such reasonable time, the Board shall take into
consideration the degree of threat to the public health, safety, and welfare
and the means required to abate such nuisance.  It shall not be necessary
for the Board to designate in this notice the manner in which any nuisance
shall be abated unless the Board shall deem it advisable to do so.  However,
the Board shall indicate in such notice the date within which the nuisance
must be abated.



   (B)   If the owner, occupant, or other person served with a notice
to abate the nuisance shall refuse or neglect to abate the nuisance within
the designated time  after  such notice is given, such person shall  be
subject to the penalties provided in § 95.99. In addition, the Board may
cause such nuisance to be abated in any manner authorized by law, including
the institution in the name of this city of an action therefor against the
owner, occupant, or other person for the recovery of the amount of expense of
such abatement.



   (C)   The Board shall notify the Clerk-Treasurer of the cost of
abating any nuisance.  The Clerk-Treasurer shall notify the owner, occupant,
or other person against whom the abatement proceedings were brought as to the
cost of abatement; and if said cost is not paid by the owner within 30 days,
the proper officers of the city shall proceed to collect the same either by
causing said costs to be placed on the tax duplicate or by suit.



   (D)   The requirement for service of notice under the provisions of
(A) and (C) above may be complied with by mailing such notice by registered
or certified mail to the last known address of the person sought to be
notified, or by personal service of this notice by any police officer so
directed.



('66 Code, § 55.02)



WEEDS AND TREES



§ 95.10  WEEDS.



   (A)   All owners of real estate located within the city limits shall
cut and remove rank weeds and other rank vegetation growing thereon.



   (B)   The Building Inspector, the City Engineer, or an officer of
the Bureau of Fire Prevention is directed and authorized to issue a five-day
written notice to the owner to remove such rank weeds or other rank
vegetation.  Such notice may be served either personally on the owner or
sent by certified mail return receipt requested, addressed to his last known
address, if he is a nonresident of the city.



   (C)   If the landowner fails to remove such rank vegetation within
the time prescribed, the Building Inspector may cause such rank weeds and
vegetation to be cut and removed.  The Clerk-Treasurer shall make a
certified statement of the actual cost incurred by the city in such removal,
which statement shall be delivered to the owner of the real estate by a
member of the Police Department, or by certified mail with a return
receipt.  The owner shall, within ten days from receipt of such notice, pay
the amount to the Clerk- Treasurer.



   (D)   If the owner fails to pay said sum within the time prescribed,
the Clerk-Treasurer shall file a certified copy of the statement of costs in
the Auditor's office of Hancock County, and the Auditor shall place the
amount so claimed on the tax duplicate against the lands of the landowner
affected by the lien, and the same shall be collected as taxes bursed to the
General Fund of the city.

§ 95.11  POPLAR TREES PROHIBITED.



   Whereas, because of their natural proclivities for injuring sidewalks
and sending out numerous long, fibrous roots which frequently enter and
obstruct sewers, it is declared to be a public nuisance for any person owning
or controlling any real estate within the city to permit any Carolina Poplar,
Lombard Poplar, Volga Poplar, or Silver Poplar tree to grow on his said
premises or on the street or lawn on which his said real estate abuts, and
which trees are within a distance of 150 feet of any improved sidewalk or any
public sewer constructed by the city, either as a sanitary sewer or as a
storm sewer.

JUNKED OR ABANDONED VEHICLES



§ 95.30  JUNKED OR ABANDONED VEHICLES DECLARED NUISANCES; EXCEPTION.



   Because of the detriment to the general and economic welfare of the
public, danger to health from vermin, insects, and rodents, and because of
the danger to the safety of children who are attracted  to them,
disassembled, inoperable, or any junked, wrecked, or abandoned motor vehicles
are declared to be nuisances, except in lawfully operated junkyards of
automotive sales or repair businesses.

estate on which the vehicle is located, and also on the  owner of the
vehicle, if his name and whereabouts be known.  If no occupant of the real
estate or owner of the vehicle can be found, a notice affixed to any building
on the real estate shall constitute notice to the owner and occupant of the
real estate and owner of the vehicle.  If there is no building on the real
estate, the notice may be affixed elsewhere on the real estate.  If the
vehicle is not removed within ten days pursuant to the order and notice, and

§ 110.13  GOVERNMENT ACCESS CHANNEL.



   (A)   Mission Statement.  The mission of the city's government
access channel (Channel 19) is to inform citizens of city programs, services
and functions. This includes, but is not limited to:



      (1)   Information about the activities of the Mayor, City
Council, and other policy making and advisory boards and commissions of the
city;



      (2)   Information regarding the functions performed by the
various divisions, departments and agencies of city government;



      (3)   Information about how citizens can access city agencies
and offices;



      (4)   Educational programming supplied by Greenfield Central
High School (GCHS).



   (B)   Modes of Operation.  The following modes of operations will
be used for programming purposes on Channel 19.



      (1)   Live Cablecast - This may consist of cablecasting City
Council meetings and meetings of other public boards or events of community
interest as determined by the Advisory Board.



      (2)   Tape-delayed Cablecast - Many public meetings will be
videotaped for cablecasting at a later date. Some meetings such as City
Council will be cablecast live then replayed by tape at other times.



      (3)   Live and taped cablecast by Greenfield Central High
School (GCHS).



   (C)   Access Policy.



      (1)   Access to Channel 19 will include, but is not limited to
city departments/agencies and those entities with a direct relationship to
the city.



      (2)   At no time will programming that supports political
candidates, parties or platforms be transmitted via Channel 19. A political
candidate is defined as an individual who has filed a petition for candidacy
in the applicable state or local office by the required deadline.



      (3)   At its discretion the Greenfield Access Advisory Board
will oversee the presentation of debates or public forums for candidates for
local offices.



      (4)   The debate or public forum must be held within 30 days
of the election.



      (5)   Other groups may be given consideration as potential
sponsors of a debate or public forum providing they make application to the
Greenfield Access Advisory Board at least 60 days prior to an election.



      (6)   All debates or public forums will be conducted in
accordance with federal, state and local laws.



      (7)   Channel 19 will not support commercial activities and
will not promote programs other than those operated or sponsored by the city
government.



      (8)   The primary purpose of Channel 19 is to inform citizens
of government services in an efficient and cost-effective manner. Video
project proposals that are labor and equipment intensive may be denied by the
Advisory Board. The Advisory Board will give first priority to projects whose
primary purpose is to inform local citizens and which do not over-extend
staff and equipment time.



      (9)   Channel 19 will support educational programming provided
by Greenfeld Central High School (GCHS).



      (10) Channel 19 is intended primarily to provide citizens with
information concerning the operations of their city government. Citizen
comment regarding city government will be welcomed on call-in shows. In
addition, City Council regularly allows time for citizens to address the
Council or comment on concerns during Council meetings. Public hearings also
afford this opportunity for citizens. Specific programming initiated by
citizens, however, to comment on city policies will not be transmitted on
Channel 19.



   (D)   Limitations. Channel 19, the city, its administration,
officers and employees and the Advisory Board do not warrant the accuracy of
any information cablecast over Channel 19. The city  shall not be liable for
any loss of transmission time or transmission of programming due to equipment
failure or for any other reason.



   (E)   Programming.



      (1)   Programming Priorities.  Any program with the primary
purpose of informing citizens will be given priority. The following list of
general priorities for programming aimed at informing citizens will apply to

the city's elected officials may be cablecast on Channel 19, as long as they
do not support political candidates, parties, or platforms. If news
conferences are called 24 hours or less before the event, the Channel 19
coordinator may refuse to tape a news conference based on prior engagements.
Schedule permitting, news conferences will be taped and replayed at a later
date. News conferences scheduled two weeks in advance may be aired live, at
the discretion of the Advisory Board.



      (3)   Channel 19 programming shall not include:



         (a)   Any advertising that promotes or endorses the sale
of any product or service; although, acknowledgment of sponsors, supporters,
contributors, or underwriters of programming is allowed;



         (b)   Any direct solicitation of funds for any reason;



         (c)   Any material that is obscene, indecent or
defamatory;



         (d)   Any material that would violate any federal or
state statute or law;



         (e)   Any programs of a partisan political nature;



         (f)   Partisan political statements by political
candidates or their representatives;



         (g)   Promotions for any programs not operated by the
city or its departments.



   (F)   Procedural Operations.



      (1)   Tape Retention. It shall be a general policy to retain
video tapes of locally produced events for a minimum of 30 days. Tapes of the
Board of Public Works and Safety shall be retained three  years, Council
meetings three  years, Plan Commission five  years, and the Board of Zoning
Appeals five  years. At the end of the appropriate time, tapes may be
recycled and the original material erased.



      (2)   Requests for Dubs.  Channel 19 will provide dubs to the
public for a fee of $10. Channel 19 staff will have a seven day turnaround
time for making dubs.



      (3)   Producing a Program for Cablecast.  The following steps
will be followed when proposing a program for cablecast on Channel 19:



         (a)   The producer will complete a program proposal form
no later than one month in advance of the program's intended transmission
date.



         (b)   The Channel 19 coordinator will review the
proposal and may grant permission for the program, as long as it is in
keeping with the policies and procedures determined by the Advisory Board.



         (c)   If the proposal is controversial in nature or is
thought to violate these policies and procedures or any other law or
regulation, the Channel 19 coordinator will bring the proposal before the
Advisory Board for review. A majority vote of the Advisory Board will
determine whether the program runs.



         (d)   The Channel 19 coordinator will oversee production
of programming and ensure that only trained individuals have access to
equipment.



   (G)   Scheduling.  The Channel 19 coordinator is responsible for
scheduling programming. Prescheduled programs will take priority over other
possible programming, unless otherwise determined by the Advisory Board. Time
blocks will be left open for programming needs that arise unexpectedly.
Events may be taped and then rerun in these time blocks.

   115.02   Qualifications



   115.03   Rate incentive



   115.04   Terms and conditions



   115.05   Applicable rate schedules



§ 115.01  AVAILABILITY.



   This rider is available to a qualifying customer (as defined herein) to
encourage large power users to expand or create new operations within the
utility's service territory.



(Ord. 2017-7, passed 4-26-17)



§ 115.02  QUALIFICATIONS.



   (A)   A QUALIFYING CUSTOMER is a new or existing non-residential
customer in the utility's service territory that is establishing new
operations or expanding existing operations such that the new or expanded
operations will result in new or additional demand of at least one MW (1000
kW) at one delivery point (the "Qualifying Demand") and the new or expanded
operations has involved a capital investment of at least $1,000,000 within
the utility's service territory.



   (B)   For a qualifying customer that is expanding operations,
qualifying demand is measured from the average monthly peak demand for the 12
months immediately preceding the effective date of the service application.
For a qualifying customer that is establishing new operations, qualifying
demand is measured from zero.



   (C)   (1)   A qualifying customer is not a customer:



         (a)   With "new" demand that results from a change in
ownership of an existing establishment without qualifying new load;



         (b)   Renewing service following interruptions such as
equipment failure, temporary plant shutdown, strike, economic conditions, or
natural disaster; or



         (c)   That has shifted its load from one operation or
customer to another within the utility's service territory.



      (2)   The utility may determine exclusively, without recourse
by the customer, whether an event has occurred that would prevent a customer
from being a qualifying customer.



(Ord. 2017-7, passed 4-26-17)



§ 115.03  RATE INCENTIVE.



   Beginning with the effective date indicated in the service application
submitted by the qualifying customer, utility will receive a credit on its
wholesale bill for the qualifying new load. The incentive amount received by
utility from the Indiana Municipal Power Agency for such load will be passed
in full to qualifying customers. For reference purposes, the discount to the
qualifying customer's wholesale cost for qualifying new load will be
calculated according to the following schedule:



      Months 1-12        20%



      Months 13-24        15%



      Months 25-36        10%



      Months 37-48        10%



      Months 49-60      5%



   The qualifying customer must meet the minimum qualifying demand during
each month of the incentive period (i.e., months one through 60, as
designated above). Failure to meet the minimum qualifying demand in a
particular month will result in 0% reduction for that month.



(Ord. 2017-7, passed 4-26-17)



§ 115.04  TERMS AND CONDITIONS.



   (A)   The qualifying customer must submit a service application to
the utility specifying:



      (1)   A description of the amount and nature of the new load;



      (2)   The basis on which the qualifying customer meets the
requirements of this rider;



      (3)   The qualifying customer's desired effective date; and



      (4)   Other information required by the utility.



   (B)   This rider will terminate on the same date that IMPA's
economic development rider terminates, except that any qualifying customer
receiving the rate incentive at the time of the rider's termination may
continue receiving the incentive for the remainder of the applicable
incentive period (as long it continues to meet the rider's requirements).



(Ord. 2017-7, passed 4-26-17)

prescribed by this chapter or to enforce its provisions in an arbitrary or
discriminatory manner.  Any variances from  adopted building rules are
subject to approval under I.C. 22-13-2-7(b).

§ 152.13  AFTER HEARING FOR PRIMARY APPROVAL.



   (A)   If, after the hearing, the Plan Commission determines that the

(Ord. 1983-2, passed 2-10-83; Am. Ord. 1999-4, passed 3-25-99)



§ 152.15  SECONDARY APPROVAL.



   The Plan Commission may grant secondary approval for all or any part of
a plat of a subdivision which has heretofore been given primary approval by
the Plan Commission, or the Plan Commission may delegate to the Plan
Commission Staff the authority to grant such secondary approvals; provided,
that secondary approvals may be granted after expiration of the time for
appeal under § 152.14, herein and the submission of the subdivision
improvement agreement.



   (A)   Secondary approval may be granted to a plat of a subdivision
in which the public improvements and installations have not been completed as
required by this code, if the applicant provides a bond, or other proof of
financial responsibility as prescribed herein, that meets the following
requirements:



      (1)   110% of an amount determined by the Plan Commission
staff to be sufficient to complete the improvements and installations in
compliance with this code; and



      (2)   Provides surety satisfactory to the Plan Commission
attorney.



   Other proof of financial responsibility may take the following form:



      (1)   An irrevocable letter of credit, or



      (2)   A performance bond, or

   (B)   No notice or hearing is required for secondary approvals.



   (C)   A plat of a subdivision shall not be filed with the Auditor of
Hancock County, and the Recorder  of  Hancock  County  shall not 
record  it, unless it has been granted secondary approval and signed by all
required signatories. If submitted and recorded, the plat shall not be
considered a legal subdivision and building permits for lots within the
illegally recorded subdivision will not be issued.



   (D)   The proof of financial responsibility referred to in division
(A) may be released only upon receipt of a certificate by a registered
professional civil engineer or a registered land surveyor that all
improvements and installations for the plat of the subdivision required for
its approval have been made or installed in accordance with specification and
approved by the City Engineer.



   (E)   Phasing of Subdivisions.  The petitioner may seek secondary
approval of a portion or section of the preliminary plat.  The Commission
may impose such conditions upon filing of applications for secondary approval
of the sections as it deems necessary to assure the orderly development of
the subdivision (e.g., sequential lot numbering.)  The Commission may
require that the performance bond and financial responsibility be in such
amount as will be commensurate with the section or sections of the plat for
which secondary approval is sought and may defer the remaining required
performance bond (or other assurance) principal amount until the remaining
sections of the plat are offered for filing.  Such sections must contain at
least 20 lots or 10% of the total number of lots contained in the approved
preliminary plat, whichever is less.  The approval of all remaining sections
not filed with the Zoning Administrator shall automatically expire four years
from the date of preliminary approval, unless the preliminary approval has
been extended.



   (F)   Within 30 days of secondary approval, the petitioner shall
submit one electronic copy of the secondary plat to the City Engineering
Department for incorporation into the city’s Geographic Information
System.  The digital drawing file shall be in AutoCad format, unless
otherwise specified by the City Engineering Department staff.  For the city
to efficiently manage the geographic information system, petitioners shall
submit their plats in conformance with the requirements below.



      (1)   Information shall be separated and organized on layers
by content as follows:

         RE_LOTL   subdivision lot lines



All leaders, arrows, text boxes, and other annotations shall be on layers
separate from the features to which they pertain.  Text labels must be on
discrete layers according to their purpose.



      (2)   Real estate parcels, rights-of-way, subdivisions
boundaries, and lot lines shall be drafted with precise endpoints snapped
together.  Easements and setback lines should be trimmed to meet the snapped
boundary features.  Lot numbers or parcel identifiers can be either blocks
or text, but each lot should be individually labeled, with the label
insertion point within the lot boundary.  If lot monumentation symbols are
used, they should be inserted at the intersection or endpoint of the snapped
boundary features.

§ 152.16  TIME LIMITS FOR PLAT APPROVAL.



   (A)   Unless extended, primary plat approval shall be effective for
a period of two years (primary plat approval period) after the date of
primary plat approval (including conditional approval), at the end of which
time secondary approval of the subdivision must have been obtained by the
Applicant and certified by the proper officials.  Any plats not receiving
secondary approval within the period of time set forth herein shall be null
and void, and the Applicant shall be required to resubmit a new application
for subdivision approval subject to the zoning restrictions and subdivision
regulations in effect at the time of resubmission.  Upon the request of an
Applicant and upon a finding that the Applicant has been unable to prepare
the proposed development for secondary approval despite due diligence, the
Commission may entend the preliminary approval period for one two-year period
beyond the expiration date of the original preliminary approval period,
without further notice and public hearing, or for a longer period of time
upon notice to interested parties and hearing.



   (B)   Until the secondary plat is recorded, secondary approval shall
be effective for a period of one year (secondary approval period) after the
date of secondary approval, at the end of which time the secondary plat shall
have been recorded.  Any plats not recorded within the period of time set
forth herein shall be required to resubmit a new application for subdivision
approval subject to the zoning restrictions and subdivision regulations in
effect at the time of resubmission.  Upon the request of an Applicant and
upon a finding that the applicant has been unable to satisfy the requirements
to execute the certificate of secondary approval despite due diligence, the
Commission may extend the secondary approval period for one year beyond the
expiration date of the original secondary approval period, without further
notice and public hearing, or for a longer period of time upon notice to
interested parties and hearing.

standards or regulations) upon finding that:



      (1)   Practical difficulties have been demonstrated;



      (2)   The requested modifications would not, in any way,
contravene the purpose and intent of the Comprehensive Plan, the Zoning
Ordinance, the Official Zoning Map of the City, or the Subdivision Control
Ordinance;



      (3)   Granting the modifications would not be detrimental to
the public safety, health, or welfare and would not adversely affect the
delivery of governmental services (e.g., water, sewer, fire protection, etc.);



      (4)   Granting the modifications would neither substantially
alter the essential character of the neighborhood nor result in substantial
injury to other nearby properties;



      (5)   The conditions of the parcel that give rise to the
practical difficulties are unique to the parcel and are not applicable
generally to other nearby properties;



      (6)   The requested modifications represent the minimum
modifications necessary to meet the intent of the regulations;



      (7)   The practical difficulties were not created by the
petitioner, developer, owner, or subdivider; and



      (8)   The practical difficulties cannot be overcome through
reasonable design alternatives.



   (B)   In approving modifications, the Commission may impose such
conditions as will, in its judgment, substantially secure the objectives of
these regulations.



   (C)   With respect to each requested modification and each imposed
condition, the Commission shall prepare and approve written findings of
fact.  Such findings shall address each of the conclusory findings set forth
in Subsection (A) above and shall cite the specific facts that support each
of the conclusory findings and that support each of the imposed conditions.



   (D)   Applications for modifications shall be submitted to the
Commission, in writing, as a part of the preliminary plat application.  On
the application, the petitioner shall describe the requested modifications
and shall submit proposed findings of fact in support of each requested
modification.  The petitioner shall bear the burden of establishing a
sufficient factual basis for each requested modification.



   (E)   The Commission’s decision to grant or deny a modification or
to impose a condition is discretionary.

§ 153.01  THOROUGHFARE PLAN MAP.



   The Thoroughfare Plan of the city entitled:  “Thoroughfare Plan Map,
A Part of the Comprehensive Plan of Greenfield, Indiana,” dated June 8,
1987, as amended, is the official Thoroughfare Plan Map of Greenfield, and is
a composite of two maps previously adopted by resolutions of the Common
Council, and entitled:  “Thoroughfare Plan, Northwest Quadrant” dated
October 13, 1986, passed by Res. No. 1986-6, dated December 11, 1986, and
“Thoroughfare Plan, All of Greenfield Except the Northwest Quadrant,”
dated April 13, 1987, passed by Res. No. 1987-2, dated May 1987, as
amended.  The Thoroughfare Plan map shows the locations of existing and
proposed thoroughfares within the city and its environs.



(Res. 1988-8, passed 8-11-88)



§ 153.02  DESIGNATION OF THOROUGHFARES.



   The thoroughfares are classified as to width and type in accordance
with their function as a part of the thoroughfare system, and are designated
as arterial, feeder, and residential streets as shown on the Thoroughfare
Plan Map. Such streets are to be provided  with the right-of-way widths
shown on  the Thoroughfare Plan Map and in accordance with the provisions of
this chapter, and are to be improved as required by the provisions of Chapter
152.



(Res. 1988-8, passed 8-11-88)



§ 153.03  POLICIES AND DIRECTIVES.



   (A)   Opening or Widening of Streets. Whenever a street designated
on the Thoroughfare Plan Map is to be platted as a part of a subdivision of
land, the right-of-way shall conform to the policies and specified
designations and indications in the Thoroughfare Plan, provided that where a
street borders a tract of land to be subdivided, the owner of such land shall
be required to plat only one-half of the right-of-way width designated for
the street, measured at 90° to the center line.



   (B)   Location of Streets.  Whenever the locations of streets are
indicated on the Thoroughfare Plan Map as following existing roads or
streets, or section, half-section, or quarter-section lines, or other
established property lines, they shall conform to such locations. However,
streets lying wholly within a subdivision, and not designated as following an
existing road or section line, may be varied in their alignment when the
variance promotes the plan of a neighborhood development and provides for the
continuity of traffic movement.  Streets which following irregular
alignment, or indicate revised alignments, or are not references to
established lines shall follow in a general manner the alignment shown on the
Thoroughfare Plan Map.  Their alignment shall be subject to detailed surveys.



   (C)   Consideration of Government Officials.  After adoption of the
Thoroughfare Plan of the city, the city shall be guided by and give
consideration to the general policy and pattern of development set out in the
Thoroughfare Plan in the authorization, construction, alteration, or
abandonment of public ways and structures.



   (D)   Issuance of Permits.  In the cases of premises authorized by
the city for the erection or alteration of structures or other improvements,
the permit shall be issued only of the proposed street and thoroughfare
right-of-way as set forth by the Thoroughfare Plan of the city will be
protected from encroachment and, for planning and zoning purposes, the
proposed street and thoroughfare right-of-way lines will be considered as the
front line of lots and tracts bordering such streets and thoroughfares,
unless specific exceptions are made in the Zoning Code.



(Res. 1988-8, passed 8-11-88)



§ 153.04  NORTH BROADWAY DESIGNED LIMITED ACCESS.



   North Broadway, between McKenzie Road and 200 North Road is hereby
designated as a limited access thoroughfare with access points to be only at
public road approaches.  See § 152.02 Definitions of the code for
definition of Arterial Street.



(Res. 1988-8, passed 8-11-88)



§ 153.05  CONTINUING AUTHORITY OF THE ADVISORY PLAN COMMISSION.



   Subsequent to the adoption of the Thoroughfare Plan of the city, the
Advisory Plan Commission may:



   (A)   Determine lines for new, extended, widened, or narrowed
thoroughfares in any portion of the city.



   (B)   Certify to the Common Council the amended or additional plan 
under the same procedure as established for the certification and approval of
the Thoroughfare plan of the city.



(Res. 1988-8, passed 8-11-88)



§ 153.06  AMENDMENTS.



   Each amendment to the Thoroughfare Plan of the city must be approved
according to the procedure set forth in the 500 series of I.C. 36-7-4.  If
the Common Council wants an amendment, it may direct the Plan Commission to
prepare the amendment and submit it in the same manner as any other amendment
to the Comprehensive Plan of Greenfield. The Plan Commission shall prepare
and submit the amendment within 60 days after formal written request by the
City Council. However, the Common Council may grant an extension of time, of
specified duration, in which to prepare and submit the amendment.



(Res. 1988-8, passed 8-11-88)



§ 153.07  CERTIFICATION OF THE PLAN.



   The Advisory Plan Commission has subjected this amendment of the
Comprehensive Plan to public hearings and now certifies the Thoroughfare Plan
of the city for approval, with the additional request that the Hancock County
Area Plan Commission consider adopting and incorporating into their
Comprehensive Plan those parts of the Thoroughfare Plan of the city and the
policies and directives of this chapter for the territory beyond the
corporate limits of the city.

part of this Code as if they were fully described herein.



(Am. Ord. 2001-5, passed 3-22-01)



155.011  ZONE MAP



A.   A part of the Code



The boundaries of the districts are established on a map entitled, Zone Map,
Greenfield, Indiana, dated 1998, as amended, hereinafter referred to as the
“Official Zone Map” which accompanies and is incorporated  in  and 
made a  part  of  this  chapter. Notations, references, indications, and
other matters shown on the zone map are as much a part of this chapter as if
they were fully described herein.



B.   Verification



The official zone map shall be identified by the signature of the Mayor
attested by the Clerk-Treasurer, and bearing the seal of the city under the
following words: “This is to certify that this is the official zone map
referred to in Section 155.011 of the Code of Ordinances of the City of
Greenfield, Indiana.”



C.   Future map entries



If, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, changes are made in
district boundaries or other matter portrayed on the official zone map, such
changes shall be entered on the map promptly after the amendment has been
approved by the Council, with an entry on the official zone map as follows:
"On (date) by official action of the Council, the following changes were made
in the official zone map; (brief description of the nature of the changes),
which entry shall be signed by the Mayor and attested by the Clerk-Treasurer.



D.   Changes



No changes of any nature shall be made in the official zone map or matter
shown thereon except in conformity with the procedures set forth in this
chapter.  Any unauthorized change of whatever kind by any person or persons
shall be considered a violation of this chapter and punishable as provided
under Section 155.999.



E.   Location of zone map



Regardless of the existence of purported copies of the official zone map
which may from time to time be made or published, the official zone map which
shall be located in the office of the City Engineer shall be the final
authority as to the current zoning status of land and water areas, building,
and other structures in the city.



F.   Damaged, lost, or destroyed map



In the event the official zone map becomes damaged, destroyed, lost, or
difficult to interpret because of the nature or number of changes and
additions, the Council may direct the Plan Commission to prepare a new
official zone map which shall supersede the prior map on approval by the
Council.  The new official zone map may correct drafting or other errors or
omissions in the prior map, but no such correction shall have the effect of
amending the original official zone map or any subsequent amendment.  The
new official zone map shall be identified by the signature of the Mayor
attested by the Clerk-Treasurer and bearing the seal of the city under the
following words:  “This is to certify that this official zone map
supersedes and replaces on this day (date) the official zone map adopted
(date of adoption of map being replaced) as part of Ordinance Number of the
City of Greenfield, Indiana.”



G.   Map to be preserved



Unless the prior official zone map has been lost or has been totally
destroyed, the prior map or any significant parts thereof remaining shall be
preserved, together with all available records pertaining to its adoption or
amendment.



H.  Interpretation of district boundaries



Where uncertainty exists as to the boundaries of districts as shown on the
official zoning map, the following rules shall apply:



1.   Center lines of streets and boundaries.  Unless otherwise indicated,
the district boundary lines are the center lines of streets, parkways,
alleys, or railroad right-of-way, or such lines extended.



2.   Approximations. Boundaries indicated as approximately following
section lines, half section and quarter section lines, city corporate limit
lines, or platted lot lines shall be construed as following such lines.



3.   Railroad lines.  Boundaries indicated as following railroad lines
shall be construed to be midway between the main tracks.



4.   Shore lines and waterways.  Boundaries indicated as following shore
lines shall be construed to follow the shore lines, and in the event of
change in the shore lines shall be construed as moving with the actual shore
lines.  Boundaries indicated as approximately following the center lines of
streams, creeks, lakes, or other bodies of water shall be construed to follow
such center lines.



5.   Use of scale on zone map. Boundaries indicated as parallel to or
extensions of features indicated in divisions (A) through (D) above shall be
so construed.  Distances not specifically indicated on the official zone map
shall be determined by the scale of the map.



6.   Commission may determine.  Where physical or cultural features
existing on the ground are at variance with those shown on the official zone
map, or in other circumstances not covered by divisions (1) through (6) of
this section, the Planning Commission shall interpret the district boundaries.



7.   Vacations and relocations.  The vacation or relocation of
rights-of-way and lot lines shall not affect the location of district
boundaries.  However, whenever any right-of-way is vacated by proper
authority, the districts adjoining each side of such vacation shall be
extended automatically to the center of such vacation.



8.   Lines splitting lots.  Where a district boundary line divides a lot
which was in single ownership at the time of passage of this ordinance
(1998), the Board of Zoning Appeals, on appeal, shall interpret the
applicable regulations for either portion of the lot not to exceed 50 feet
beyond the district boundary line into the remaining portion of the lot.

155.016  NONCONFORMING BUILDINGS AND USES



The lawful use of a building or premise, existing at the time of the passage
of this chapter may be continued although such use does not conform to all
the provisions of this chapter, subject to the following conditions:



A.   Nonconforming structures



   1.   A nonconforming commercial or industrial building or structure
may be enlarged or extended along a legally established nonconforming side or
rear setback line provided that the lineal footage of such enlargement or
extension:



      a.   Does not exceed 50% of the lineal footage of the primary
building along that side or rear setback line; or



      b.   Be a one time only expansion along the legally
established setback line.



   2.   A nonconforming single or two-family dwelling may be enlarged
or extended along a legally established nonconforming side or rear setback
line provided that the lineal footage of such enlargement or extension:



      a.   Does not exceed 50% of the lineal footage of the primary
building along that side or rear setback line, or



      b.   Be a one time only expansion along the legally
established setback line.



   3.   A nonconforming accessory building associated with a single or
two-family dwelling may be enlarged or extended along a legally established
nonconforming side or rear setback line provided that the lineal footage of
such enlargement or extension:



      a.   Does not exceed 50% of the lineal footage of the primary
building along that side or rear setback line,



      b.   Be a one time only expansion along the legally
established setback line, and



      c.   Such an enlargement or extension shall not encroach into
any required yard other than the existing nonconforming side or rear yard
along which the expansion is occurring.



   4.   Damage to non-conforming use structure.  Any non-conforming
building, other than single family and two family dwellings, and related
accessory structures, damaged more than 50% of its then fair market value
above the foundations at the time of the damage by fire, wind, flood,
explosion, earthquake, war, riot, act-of-God or man shall not be
reconstructed and used as before such calamity.  However, if the building is
less than 50% damaged it may be reconstructed or used provided that such
reconstruction or use be accomplished within 12 months of such calamity.



   5.   Non-conforming single family and two family dwellings and
detached accessory garages may be rebuilt on an existing foundation, if the
existing foundation is capable of being reused.



B.   Nonconforming uses of structure or structures and land in combination



   1.   Use cannot be changed to non-conforming use.  Whenever a
non-conforming use has been changed to a conforming use or to a use permitted
in a district of greater restrictions, it shall not thereafter be changed to
a non-conforming use.



   2.   No building erected in non-conforming use premises.  No
building shall be erected on any premises devoted to a non-conforming use,
except in conformance with the provisions of this chapter.



   3.   Temporary non-conforming use.  The Board may authorize, by
written permit, in a district permitting residential use, for a period of not
more than one year from the date of such permit, a temporary building for
business or industrial use incidental to the residential construction and
development of the district.



   4.   May be changed.  A non-conforming use may be changed to
another non-conforming use of the same or greater restrictions, provided the
size of the structure is not increased;  and providing that the use is
equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing
nonconforming use.



   5.   May be extended.  A non-conforming use may be extended
throughout a building which was manifestly arranged or designed for such use
at the time of adoption or amendment to this Chapter, provided the size of
the structure is not increased and the use is not extended to occupy any land
outside such building.



   6.   Discontinuance of non-conforming use.  In the event that a
non-conforming use of any building or premises is discontinued for a period
of one year, except when government action impedes access to the premises,
the use of the same shall thereafter conform to the uses permitted in the 
district in which it is located,  and  any non-conforming dwelling which is
deficient in ground floor area, and which may be removed from the lot.



   7.   Honoring previous permits. Nothing herein contained shall
require any change in the plans for the construction or designated use of a
building for which a building permit has been heretofore issued, and the
actual construction of which has been diligently prosecuted within 90 days of
the date of the permit, and which entire building shall be completed
according to such plans filed on or before the completion date of this Code.
Actual construction is defined to include the erection of construction
materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner.



   8.   Non-conforming use resulting from amendment.  The provisions
apply in the same manner to a use which may become a non-conforming use as a
result of an amendment to this chapter.



C.  Repairs and maintenance



   1.   On any nonconforming structure or portion of a structure
containing a nonconforming use, work may be done on ordinary repairs or on
repair or replacement of walls fixtures, heating, wiring or plumbing;
provided that the cubic content existing when it became nonconforming shall
not be increased.



   2.   If a nonconforming structure or portion of a structure
containing a nonconforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to
the lack of repairs and maintenance, and is declared by any duly authorized
official to be unsafe or unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall
not thereafter be restored, repaired or rebuilt after six months of such
declaration except in conformity with the regulations of the district in
which it is located.



   3.   Buildings may be made safe.  Nothing in this chapter shall
prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any part of any
building declared unsafe by proper authority.

155.017 NONCONFORMING LOT AREA AND WIDTHS



A single-family dwelling may be located on any lot in any district in which
single-family dwellings are permitted if the lot was a single parcel in
single ownership, or a single parcel included in a subdivision of record at
the time of passage of this chapter even though the lot does not have the
minimum lot width or the minimum lot area specified for the district  in
which such lot is located.  Variance of setback requirements shall be
obtained only through action of the Board of Zoning Appeals.



155.018  CONDITIONAL USES AND CONFORMING USES



An existing use which is listed as a conditional use, and which is located in
a district in which such conditional use may be permitted, is a conforming
use, provided the use meets the minimum lot area requirement set forth in
this chapter.  Any expansion of the conditional use involving the
enlargement of buildings, structures, and land area devoted to the use, shall
be subject to the approval of the Board of Zoning Appeals.  No division of
land shall be made after the effective date of this ordinance which creates a
lot with width or area below the requirements stated in this Chapter.

The I-3 District was essentially the same as the I-2 District, except that it
allowed residential. Residential use is not compatible in an industrial
district. If that residential use is eliminated, there is no need for the I-3
District, and it can be eliminated. Existing I-3 property can be reclassified
to I-2. The BP District is proposed as a new district for a growing market.

155.030  "PUD" PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT



The Planned Unit Development District is intended to provide more development
flexibility than is possible through the application of customary zoning
regulations.  In recognition of both the rapid changes in design and
technology in the building industry and new demands in the business and
housing markets, it is deemed necessary to meet those changes in a manner
that will be consistent with the best interests of the entire City.



A.   Statement of purpose



The purpose of the Planned Unit Development District shall be the following:



   1.   To encourage a more creative approach in land and building site
planning.



   2.   To encourage an efficient, aesthetic, and desirable use of open
space



   3.   To promote variety in the physical development pattern of the
community; including mixed use development.



   4.   To achieve flexibility and incentives for residential
development which will produce a wider range of choice in satisfying the
changing urban needs; including cluster development.



   5.   To encourage renewal of older areas where new development and
restoration are needed to revitalize the areas.



   6.   To permit special consideration of property with unique
features, such as historical significance, unusual topography, landscape
amenities, and size and shape.



   7.   To recapture by-passed land so poorly planned and developed as
to be a public liability.



   8.   To simplify processing of development proposals for developers
and the Plan Commission by providing for concurrent review of land use,
subdivisions, public improvements, and siting considerations.



B.   Applicability



   1.   The provisions of this section shall apply to a tract of land
of at least five acres in area within the corporate limits of the city. These
provisions may apply to a proposed development in which the primary or entire
use is business or enclosed industrial use when the proposal is deemed to be
in the best interests of the entire City.



   2.   The provisions of this section shall apply only to proposed new
developments and shall not apply to any planned unit development plan which
is now fully or partially developed, nor to any such development for which a
final authorization has been granted pursuant to a previous ordinance. 
However, a petitioner may, upon application and approval of the Plan
Commission, become subject to all the benefits and burdens of this section,
subject to such rights as shall have been vested in the owners of the area
affected by development under such ordinance.



   3.   Any single use or combination of uses may be permitted in a
planned unit development, provided that the proposed planned unit development
does not conflict with the comprehensive plan.



   4.   The basic land unit of a planned unit development is the block,
parcel, tract, combination of lots, or acreage, and not the lot. However,
divisible geographic sections of the entire planned unit development may be
designated.



      a.   A proposed planned unit development shall be designed to
produce an environment of stable and desirable character in keeping with the
principles of good neighborhood design, and shall provide standards of open
space, efficiency in street patterns, and areas for parking adequate for the
occupancy proposed, or equal to the requirements of this Code.



      b.   Before approval of a preliminary planned unit
development, a detailed determination of land use intensity shall be
declared, and the Plan Commission shall make a finding that the intensity is
consistent with the comprehensive development plan of current adoption and in
the best interest of the entire City.



C.   Procedure



The authorization of a planned unit development shall be subject to the
procedures expressed as follows:



   1.   Upon a petition of the owners of property of 50% or more of the
area involved in the petition, or upon a petition initiated by the Plan
Commission, a preliminary plan for any area proposed for development as a
planned unit development shall be first presented to the Plan Commission's
designated staff.  At this presentation, three copies of a preliminary plan
of the proposed development, containing the following information, shall be
submitted for advice:



      a.   Boundaries of the tract to be developed as part of the
planned unit development.



      b.   Base mapping of the property showing the physical
features, general topography, drainageways, water bodies, tree cover, and
existing land uses.



      c.   Highways and streets in the vicinity of the tract, and
the ingress and egress to the tract.



      d.   Location of different general land use areas proposed to
be developed.



      e.   Proposed density levels of each residential area.



      f.   Proposed square footage of commercial or industrial areas.



      g.   An enumeration of commitments, in general terms, proposed
to be made a part of the unit development plan.



      h.   A statement expressing the order and estimated time of
development, if the planned unit development is to be developed in stages, or
if construction is to extend beyond a one-year time frame.



      i.   Proposed treatment of existing topography, drainageways
and tree cover.



      j.   Proposed general location of major vehicular circulation,
showing how this circulation pattern relates to the official Thoroughfare
Plan of the City.



      k.   Location of schools, parks and other community facility
sites, if any.



   2.   Within 15 days after the presentation, the Technical Advisory
Committee of the Plan Commission shall consult with the petitioner regarding
the preliminary plan.  After the consultation, the petitioner may make
modifications to the petition which are deemed appropriate.



   3.   Application for approval of the planned development shall then
be submitted to the Plan Commission with a recommendation from the Technical
Advisory Committee of the Plan Commission, accompanied by six copies of the
preliminary plan (with modifications, if any) and any other desired
supporting documents at a regular meeting of the Plan Commission, as a
petition for amendment of the Zoning Code and subject to the procedures
applicable thereto.  The Plan Commission may approve the plan submitted,
amend and approve the plan as amended, or disapprove the plan.  The Plan
Commission may impose any reasonable conditions upon its approval, including
the recording of covenants.  If approved, the preliminary plan with
amendments, if any, shall be stamped "approved preliminary “planned unit
development” and be signed by the president and secretary of the Plan
Commission and one copy shall be permanently retained in the office of the
Plan Commission.  The approved preliminary unit development plan shall then
be certified to the Common Council for adoption as an "PUD" Planned Unit
Development District pursuant to the laws governing amendments of the Zoning
Code.



   4.   Upon adoption by the Common Council, the planned development
shall be returned to the Plan Commission, which shall thereafter exercise
continuing jurisdiction.  Before any development takes place, the Commission
shall approve a detailed site plan specifying the exact location,
composition, and general engineering features of all lots, drainage, sewage,
water supply facilities, recreational facilities, site perimeter treatment,
and other pertinent site development features, including general locations
and features of proposed buildings. The approval shall be conditional upon
finding by the Plan Commission that the detailed site plan is consistent 
with  the  approved  preliminary unit development plan.  The approved
detailed site plan shall be stamped "Approved detailed planned unit
development plan" and be signed by the president and secretary of the Plan
Commission, and one copy shall be permanently retained in the office of the
Plan Commission.



      a.   The approval of the preliminary PUD shall be for two (2)
years after its adoption by the Common Council.  Within this two (2) year
period the planned unit development shall receive approval of the final
detailed site plan for the first section or the entire development. Should
the planned development not receive approval of the detailed site plan for
one (1) section or the entire development within the two (2) years, the Plan
Commission may initiate a rezoning of the property or extend the approval
period. The approval of the detailed site plan for each section of the
preliminary PUD shall extend the approval length of the preliminary PUD for
two (2) years.



      b.   In the exercise of its continual jurisdiction, the Plan
Commission may from time to time modify the approved preliminary Planned Unit
Development in a manner consistent with the originally approved preliminary
Planned Unit Development to allow for changed circumstances and conditions
unforeseen at the time of original approval. The Planning Commission is
authorized to approve minor modifications such as:



         1.)   Base mapping of the property showing the physical
features, general topography, drainageways, water bodies, tree cover, and
existing land uses.



         2.)   The ingress and egress to the tract.



         3.)   Location of different general land use areas
proposed to be developed.



         4.)   Proposed density levels of each residential area,
provided that such proposed change in density level is not increased by more
than fifteen percent (15%).



         5.)   Proposed square footage of commercial or
industrial areas, provided such proposed change in square footage is not
increased by more than fifteen percent (15%).



         6.)   A statement expressing the order and estimated
time of development, if the planned unit development is to be developed in
stages, or if construction is to extend beyond a one-year time frame.



         7.)   Proposed treatment of existing topography,
drainageways and tree cover.



         8.)   Proposed general location of major internal
vehicular circulation, showing how this circulation pattern relates to the
official Thoroughfare Plan of the City.



         9.)   Location of schools, parks and other community
facilities sites, if any, provided such proposed change in location does not
result in a reduction in the square footage of schools, parks or other
community facilities.



      c.   An "Approved Detailed Planned Unit Development" may mean
and be designated the same as a final plat and approval of the final plat
shall in all instances precede final plat approval for record in accordance
with the subdivision control chapter of this Code.



      d.   A refusal by the Plan Commission to approve a detailed
site plan shall not be construed as a denial, and any such refusal shall not
operate as a limitation on the right of the petitioner to continue to seek
approval, nor shall it impair the right of the petitioner to obtain an
extension of time for approval.  In the event that approval of a detailed
site plan is not obtained within the one year period or an approved 
extension of time,  the  Plan Commission shall initiate an amendment of the
Zoning Code so that the land will be zoned into the category or categories it
held before being reclassified as an “UD” District.



   5.   The Plan Commission may allow the petitioner to develop the
property involved in phases.  If the phasing is permitted, the Commission
may allow the petitioner to submit partial detailed site plans which
correspond to the phases involved.  The partial detailed site plans, when
approved, shall be treated in the same manner as approved detailed site plans
for an entire Planned Unit Development.



   6.   Where a platting, replatting or vacation of streets within all
or a portion of the land involved is contemplated, the Commission shall
handle such matters in accordance with its regular procedures in accordance
with law.



   7.   No construction or installation work shall be done on any
public improvement until satisfactory plans and specifications therefor have
been submitted to the Plan Commission in accordance with the subdivision
control chapter of this Code and the petitioner has, at least twenty-four
(24) hours in advance, notified the Plan Commission of his intention to begin
such work in order that inspections may be made as the work progresses.



   8.   In the exercise of its continual jurisdiction, the Plan
Commission may from time to time modify the approved detailed Planned Unit
Development in a manner consistent with the approved preliminary Planned Unit
Development to allow for changed circumstances and conditions unforeseen at
the time of original approval.  The zoning administrator is authorized to
approve minor modifications that do not:



      a.   Alter the basic relationship of the proposed development
to adjacent property;



      b.   Change the uses permitted;



      c.   Increase the maximum density floor area or height by more
than 15%;



      d.   Decrease the amount of off-street parking;



      e.   Reduce the minimum yards or setbacks by more than 15%;



      f.   Alter site ingress or egress in any way or create a
substantial change to on-site circulation, as determined by the city engineer;



      g.   Upon submission of a request for a minor modification,
the director shall have ten (10) working days to respond to the petitioner,
by either approving or rejecting the request.  An applicant may appeal the
decision of the director to the Plan Commission.



All development shall be in conformity with the approved detailed Planned
Unit Development in the exercise of its continuing jurisdiction, the Plan
Commission shall take cognizance of any material deviations from the approved
Detailed Planned Unit Development and take appropriate enforcement action.



   9.   Approval by the Plan Commission shall expire after a period of
five (5) years from the approval of a Detailed Planned Unit Development
unless the development is fifty percent (50%) completed in term of public
improvements, including parks, walkways and utility installations in which
instance an extension of time may be granted by the Plan Commission not to
exceed five (5) successive periods of two (2) years each.



   10.   All proceedings brought under this Article shall be subject to
the rules of procedure of the Plan Commission, where not inconsistent with
the procedure otherwise stated herein, except that notice by publication
shall be sufficient notice for proceedings related solely to approval and
modification of Detailed Planned Unit Developments.



D.   Abandonment or Expiration



Upon the abandonment of a development authorized under this Article
(abandonment shall be deemed to have occurred when no improvements have been
made pursuant to the approved Detailed Planned Unit Development for
twenty-four (24) consecutive months, or upon the expiration of five (5) years
from the approval by the Plan Commission of a Detailed Planned Unit
Development for a development which has not been completed or the expiration
of an extension granted by the Plan Commission), the Plan Commission may
initiate an amendment to this Chapter so that the land will be zoned into a
category or categories which most nearly approximates its then existing use
or such other zoning category which it deems appropriate.



E.   Recording



An approved Detailed Planned Unit Development and modifications thereof shall
be recorded in the appropriate books in the offices of the County Recorder
within six (6) months after approval by the Plan Commission or the Zoning
Administrator.



F.   Permit



No improvement location permit shall be issued for a PUD District by the Plan
Commission unless all recording required by division E  has been effected,
and no certificate of zoning compliance shall be issued for a PUD District
unless the approved Detailed Planned Unit Development plan with
modifications, if any, is adhered to, all be in compliance with the purposes
of this Chapter and the Subdivision Control Chapter of this Code.



G.   Covenants and Maintenance; Financial Guarantees



   1.   Covenants shall be required by the Plan Commission as an
ingredient for stability and longevity of the Planned Unit Development, and
shall set forth in detail provisions for the ownership and maintenance of
facilities held in common so as to reasonably insure their continuity and
conservation. The covenant provisions shall include specific remedies in the
event facilities held in common are permitted to deteriorate or are not
maintained in a condition consistent with the best interests of the City, in
which event the City shall take those remedial steps provided for in the
provisions.



   2.   The Plan Commission may require the recording of covenants for
any reasonable public or semipublic purpose, including but not limited to the
allocation of land by the petitioner for public thoroughfares, parks,
schools, recreational facilities and other public and semipublic purposes
wherever necessary in conformity with the land use plan of current adoption.
Such covenants shall provide that if a governmental unit or agency thereof
does not proceed with acquisition of the allocated land within the specified
period of time, the covenants shall automatically terminate.  If such
termination occurs, the petitioner shall then submit for approval by the Plan
Commission a modified detailed site plan for such land consistent with the
approved Preliminary Planned Unit Development.  Such modified detailed site
plans, when approved, shall be treated in the same manner as approved
detailed site plans for an entire Planned Unit Development.



   3.   The Commission may require the recording of covenants for any
other reasonable purpose, including but not limited to imposing standards for
development of property in a Planned Unit Development. The development
standards may include, but are not limited to, requirements as to the
following:



      a.   Lot area;



      b.   Floor area;



      c.   Ratios of floor space to land area;



      d.   Area in which structures may be built (buildable area),
including areas for cluster type residential development without lot lines;



      e.   Open space;



      f.   Setback lines and minimum yards;



      g.   Building separations;



      h.   Height of structures;



      i.   Signs;



      j.   Off-street parking and loading and unloading areas.



      k.   Design standards.



      l.   Phasing of development



   4.   The petitioner shall provide financial assurance for the
satisfactory installation of all public facilities in the form of bonds or
such other assurances as are required in the normal procedures of platting
pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 152, Subdivision Code.



   5.   Adequate provision shall be made for a private organization
with data responsibility to and control by the property owners involved to
provide for the operation and maintenance of all common facilities, including
private streets  jointly shared by such property owners if the facilities
are a part of the Planned Unit Development and in which instance, legal
assurance shall be provided which shows that the private organization is
self-perpetuating and adequately funded to accomplish its purposes.



   6.   Common facilities which are not dedicated to the public shall
be maintained to standards assuring continuous and  adequate maintenance at
a reasonable and nondiscriminatory rate of charge to the beneficiaries
thereof.  Common facilities not dedicated to the public shall be operated
and maintained at no expense to any governmental unit.



   7.   All private streets shall be maintained by the aforesaid
private organization in such a manner that adequate access is provided at all
time to vehicular traffic, so that fire, police, health, sanitation, and
public utility vehicles can serve the properties contiguous or adjacent
thereto, and so that the vehicles will have adequate turning area.  Private
streets shall be developed in accordance with the standards set forth in
Chapter 152, subdivision Code.



H.   Limitation on rezoning



The City Plan Commission shall not initiate any amendments to the zoning Code
concerning the property involved in the planned unit development before
completion of the development, as long as development is in conformity with
the approved detailed unit development plan and proceeding in accordance with
the time requirements imposed in division (D) above.

155.031 FLOODPLAIN REGULATIONS OVERLAY DISTRICT



A.   Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact. Purpose, and Objectives.



   1.   Statutory authorization. The Indiana Legislature has in I.C.
36-7-4 granted the power to local government units to control land use within
their jurisdictions. Therefore, the Common Council of the City of Greenfield
does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations.



   2.   Findings of fact.



      a.   The flood hazard areas of the City of Greenfield are
subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property,
health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services,
extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and
impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health,
safety, and general welfare.



      b.   These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of
obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and
velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to
floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated,
inadequately flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.



   3.   Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this district to
promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public
and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions
designed to:



      a.   Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health,
safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in
damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities.



      b.   Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including
facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the
time of initial construction.



      c.   Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream
channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the
accommodation of flood waters.



      d.   Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development
which may increase erosion or flood damage.



      e.   Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers
which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards
to other lands.



      f.   Make federally subsidized flood insurance available for
structures and their contents in the city by fulfilling the requirements of
the National Flood Insurance Program.



   4.   Objectives. The objectives of this district are:



      a.   To protect human life and health.



      b.   To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood
control projects.



      c.   To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts
associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the
general public.



      d.   To minimize prolonged business interruptions.



      e.   To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities
such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets,
and bridges located in floodplains.



      f.   To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the
sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to
minimize flood blight areas.



B.   Definitions.



   Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this
section shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in
common usage and to give this section its most reasonable application.



   A ZONE Portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding
is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A ZONES,
floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a
significant threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE,
Zones A1-A30, Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone A99 on a FIRM. The
definitions are presented below:



      ZONE A: Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance flood
event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base
flood elevation or depths are shown.



      ZONE AE AND A1-A30: Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual
chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are
shown within these zones. (ZONE AE is on new and revised maps in place of
Zones A1-A30.)



      ZONE AO: Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are
between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed
hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone.



      ZONE AH: Areas subject to inundation by 1% annual chance shallow
flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between one and
three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are
shown within this zone.



      ZONE AR: Areas that result from the decertification of a
previously accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the
process of being restored to provide base flood protection.



      ZONE A99: Areas subject to inundation by the 1% annual chance
flood event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an
under-construction federal flood protection system. These are areas of
special flood hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction
of a protection system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it
complete for insurance rating purposes. Zone A99 may only be used when the
flood protection system has reached specified statutory progress toward
completion. No base flood elevations or depths are shown.



   ACCESSORY STRUCTURE (APPURTENANT STRUCTURE)A structure with a floor
area 400 square feet or less that is located on the same parcel of property
as the principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of
the principal structure. ACCESSORY STRUCTURES should constitute a minimal
initial investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be designed to
have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of ACCESSORY STRUCTURES are
detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds



   ADDITION (TO AN EXISTING STRUCTURE) Any walled and roofed expansion to
the perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common
load-bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition,
which is connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter
load-bearing walls, is new construction.



   APPEAL A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator's
interpretation of any provision of this section.



   AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING A designated AO or AH Zone on the community's
Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet
where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is
unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such
flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.



   BASE FLOOD The flood having a 1% chance of being equaled or exceeded in
any given year.



   BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE) The elevation of the 1% annual chance flood.



   BASEMENT That portion of a structure having its floor sub-grade (below
ground level) on all sides.



   BOUNDARY RIVER The part of the Ohio River that forms the boundary
between the Kentucky and Indiana.



   BOUNDARY RIVER FLOODWAY The floodway of a boundary river.



   BUILDING See STRUCTURE.



   COMMUNITY A political entity that has the authority to adopt and
enforce floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.



   COMMUNITY RATING SYSTEM (CRS) A program developed by the Federal
Insurance Administration to provide incentives for those communities in the
Regular Program that have gone beyond the minimum floodplain management
requirements to develop extra measures to provide protection from flooding.



   CRITICAL FACILITY A facility for which even a slight chance of flooding
might be too great. Critical facilities include, but are not limited to,
schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire, and emergency response
installations, installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials
or hazardous waste.



   DEVELOPMENT Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate
including but not limited to:



      1.   Construction, reconstruction, or placement of a structure
or any addition to a structure;



      2.   Installing a manufactured home on a site, preparing a
site for a manufactured home or installing a recreational vehicle on a site
for more than 180 days;



      3.   Installing utilities, erection of walls and fences,
construction of roads, or similar projects;



      4.   Construction of flood control structures such as levees,

      DEVELOPMENT does not include activities such as the maintenance
of existing structures and facilities such as painting, re-roofing;
resurfacing roads; or gardening, plowing, and similar agricultural practices
that do not involve filling, grading, excavation, or the construction of
permanent structures.



   ELEVATED STRUCTURE A non-basement structure built to have the lowest
floor elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation
perimeter walls, filled stem wall foundations (also called chain walls),
pilings, or columns (posts and piers).



   ELEVATION CERTIFICATE A certified statement that verifies a structure's
elevation information.



   EMERGENCY PROGRAM The first phase under which a community participates
in the NFIP. It is intended to provide a first layer amount of insurance at
subsidized rates on all insurable structures in that community before the
effective date of the initial FIRM.



   EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISIONA manufactured home park
or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the
lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a
minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and
either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed
before the effective date of the community's first floodplain ordinance.



   EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION The
preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for
servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed
(including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and
either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads).



   FEMA The Federal Emergency Management Agency.



   FLOOD A general and temporary condition of partial or complete
inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow, the unusual and
rapid accumulation, or the runoff of surface waters from any source.



   FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM) An official map on which the
Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance
Administration (FIA) has delineated the areas of flood hazards and regulatory
floodway.



   FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM) An official map of a community, on
which FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk
premium zones applicable to the community.



   FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY (FIS) The official hydraulic and hydrologic
report provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the
FIRM, FBFM (where applicable), and the water surface elevation of the base
flood.



   FLOOD PRONE AREA Any land area acknowledged by a community as being
susceptible to inundation by water from any source. (See FLOOD.)



   FLOOD PROTECTION GRADE (FPG) The elevation of the regulatory flood plus
two feet at any given location in the SFHA. (See FREEBOARD.)



   FLOODPLAIN The channel proper and the areas adjoining any wetland,
lake, or watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the
regulatory flood. The floodplain includes both the floodway and the fringe
districts.



   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT The operation of an overall program of corrective
and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and
enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but
not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain
management regulations, and open space plans.



   FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS This section and other zoning
ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations,
special purpose ordinances, and other applications of police power which
control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state,
or local regulations in any combination thereof, which provide standards for
preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT
REGULATIONS are also referred to as FLOODPLAIN REGULATIONS, FLOODPLAIN
ORDINANCE, FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION ORDINANCE, and FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT
REQUIREMENTS.



   FLOODPROOFING (DRY FLOODPROOFING) A method of protecting a structure
that ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and
sanitary facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with
walls that are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All
structural components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and
hydrodynamic flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated
debris impact forces.



   FLOODPROOFING CERTIFICATE A form used to certify compliance for
non-residential structures as an alternative to elevating structures to or
above the FPG. This certification must be by a Registered Professional
Engineer or Architect.



   FLOODWAY The channel of a river or stream and those portions of the
floodplains adjoining the channel which are reasonably required to
efficiently carry and discharge the peak flood flow of the regulatory flood
of any river or stream.



   FREEBOARD A factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE,
which is applied for the purposes of floodplain management. It is used to
compensate for the many unknown factors that could contribute to flood
heights greater than those calculated for the base flood.



   FRINGE Those portions of the floodplain lying outside the floodway.



   HARDSHIP (AS RELATED TO VARIANCES OF THIS SECTION) The exceptional
hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance.
The Board of Zoning Appeals requires that the variance is exceptional,
unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial
hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations,
physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's
neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All
of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a
variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property
owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally
intended.



   HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE The highest natural elevation of the ground
surface, prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a
structure.

Register of Historic Places or the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites
and Structures.



   INCREASED COST OF COMPLIANCE (ICC) The cost to repair a substantially
damaged structure that exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required
to bring a substantially damaged structure into compliance with the local
flood damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are
elevation, relocation, demolition, or any combination thereof. All renewal
and new business flood insurance policies with effective dates on or after
June 1, 1997, will include ICC coverage.



   LETTER OF FINAL DETERMINATION (LFD) A letter issued by FEMA during the
mapping update process which establishes final elevations and provides the
new flood map and flood study to the community. The LFD initiates the
six-month adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain
management regulations during this six-month period unless the community has
previously incorporated an automatic adoption clause.



   LETTER OF MAP CHANGE (LOMC) A general term used to refer to the several
types of revisions and amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by
letter. They include Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA), Letter of Map Revision
(LOMR), and Letter of Map Revision based on Fill (LOMR-F). The definitions
are presented below:



      LETTER OF MAP AMENDMENT (LOMA) An amendment by letter to the
currently effective FEMA map that establishes that a property is not located
in a SFHA through the submittal of property specific elevation data. A LOMA

   SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA) Those lands within the jurisdiction of
the city subject to inundation by the regulatory flood. The SFHAs of the City
of Greenfield are generally identified as such on the Hancock County, Indiana
and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map dated December 4, 2007 as
well as any future updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency with the most recent date. (These areas are shown
on a FIRM as Zone A, AE, A1- A30, AH, AR, A99, or AO).



   START OF CONSTRUCTION Includes substantial improvement, and means the
date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of
construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of
the permit date. The ACTUAL START means either the first placement of
permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of a
slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or
any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured
home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land
preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the
installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a
basement, footings, piers, foundations, or the erection of temporary forms;
nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings,
such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the
main structure. For a substantial improvement, the ACTUAL START OF
CONSTRUCTION means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other
structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the
external dimensions of the building.



   STRUCTURE A structure that is principally above ground and is enclosed
by walls and a roof. The term includes a gas or liquid storage tank, a
manufactured home, or a prefabricated building. The term also includes
recreational vehicles to be installed on a site for more than 180 days.



   SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE Damage of any origin sustained by a structure
whereby the cost of restoring the structure to it's before damaged condition
would equal or exceed 50% of the market value of the structure before the
damage occurred.



   SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition,
or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50%
of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of
the improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred "repetitive
loss" or "substantial damage" regardless of the actual repair work performed.
The term does not include improvements of structures to correct existing
violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code requirements or
any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will
not preclude the structures continued designation as a "historic structure".



   SUSPENSION The removal of a participating community from the NFIP
because the community has not enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain
management regulations required for participation in the NFIP.



   VARIANCE A grant of relief from the requirements of this section, which
permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this section where
specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.



   VIOLATION The failure of a structure or other development to be fully
compliant with this section. A structure or other development without the
elevation, other certification, or other evidence of compliance required in
this section is presumed to be in violation until such time as that
documentation is provided.

topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically.
Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood
damage may occur.



   X ZONE The area where the flood hazard is less than that in the SFHA.
Shaded X zones shown on recent FIRMs (B zones on older FIRMs) designate areas
subject to inundation by the flood with a 0.2% chance of being equaled or
exceeded (the 500-year flood). Unshaded X zones (C zones on older FIRMs)
designate areas where the annual exceedance probability of flooding is less
than 0.2%.



   ZONE A geographical area shown on a FIRM that reflects the severity or
type of flooding in the area.



   ZONE A See definition for A zone.



   ZONE B, C, AND X Areas identified in the community as areas of moderate
or minimal hazard from the principal source of flood in the area. However,
buildings in these zones could be flooded by severe, concentrated rainfall
coupled with inadequate local drainage systems. Flood insurance is available
in participating communities but is not required by regulation in these
zones. (Zone X is used on new and revised maps in place of Zones B and C.)



C.   General Provisions.



   1.   Lands to which this district applies. The Floodplain
Regulations Overlay District shall apply to all SFHAs and known flood prone
areas within the jurisdiction of the City of Greenfield.



   2.   Basis for establishing regulatory flood data. This section's
protection standard is the regulatory flood. The best available regulatory
flood data is listed below.



      a.   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe
limits for the studied SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the City of
Greenfield shall be as delineated on the 1% annual chance flood profiles in
the Flood Insurance Study of Hancock County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas
and the corresponding Flood Insurance Rate Map dated December 4, 2007 as well
as any future updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency with the most recent date.



      b.   The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe
limits for each of the SFHAs within the jurisdiction of the City of
Greenfield, delineated as an "A Zone" on the Hancock County, Indiana and
Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map dated December 4, 2007 as well as
any future updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal
Emergency Management Agency with the most recent date, shall be according to
the best data available as provided by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources; provided the upstream drainage area from the subject site is
greater than one square mile. Whenever a party disagrees with the best
available data, the party needs to replace existing data with better data
that meets current engineering standards. To be considered, this data must be
submitted to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for review,
subsequently approved.



      c.   In the absence of a published FEMA map, or absence of
identification on a FEMA map, the regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and
fringe limits of any watercourse in the community's known flood prone areas
shall be according to the best data available as provided by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources; provided the upstream drainage area from the
subject site is greater than one square mile.



      d.   Upon issuance of a Letter of Final Determination (LFD),
any more restrictive data in the new (not yet effective) mapping/study shall
be utilized for permitting and construction (development) purposes, replacing
all previously effective less restrictive flood hazard data provided by FEMA.



   3.   Establishment of floodplain development permit. A floodplain
development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of
this section prior to the commencement of any development activities in areas
of special flood hazard.



   4.   Compliance. No structure shall hereafter be located, extended,
converted or structurally altered within the SFHA without full compliance
with the terms of this section and other applicable regulations. No land or
stream within the SFHA shall hereafter be altered without full compliance
with the terms of this section and other applicable regulations.



   5.   Abrogation and greater restrictions. This section is not
intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or
deed restrictions. However, where this section and another conflict or
overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.



   6.   Discrepancy between mapped floodplain and actual ground
elevations.



      a.   In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped
floodplain (SFHA) on the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation
provided on the profiles shall govern.



      b.   If the elevation of the site in question is below the
base flood elevation, that site shall be included in the SFHA and regulated
accordingly.



      c.   If the elevation (natural grade) of the site in question
is above the base flood elevation and not located within the floodway, that
site shall be considered outside the SFHA and the floodplain regulations will
not be applied. The property owner shall be advised to apply for a LOMA.



   7.   Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this
section all provisions shall be:



      a.   Considered as minimum requirements.



      b.   Liberally construed in favor of the governing body.



      c.   Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers
granted under state statutes.



   8.   Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood
protection required by this section is considered reasonable for regulatory
purposes and is based on available information derived from engineering and
scientific methods of study. Larger floods can and will occur on rare
occasions. Therefore, this section does not create any liability on the part
of the City of Greenfield, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, or
the State of Indiana, for any flood damage that results from reliance on this
section or any administrative decision made lawfully thereunder.



   9.   Penalties for violation. Failure to obtain a floodplain
development permit in the SFHA or failure to comply with the requirements of
a floodplain development permit or conditions of a variance shall be deemed
to be a violation of this section. All violations shall be considered a
common nuisance and be treated as such in accordance with the provisions of
the Zoning Code for the City of Greenfield.



      a.   A separate offense shall be deemed to occur for each day
the violation continues to exist.



      b.   The Floodplain Administrator shall inform the owner that
any such violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and
therefore may cause coverage by a Standard Flood Insurance Policy to be
suspended.



      c.   Nothing herein shall prevent the City of Greenfield from
taking such other lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All
costs connected therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible.



D.   Administration.



   1.   Designation of Administrator. The Mayor of the City of
Greenfield hereby appoints the Zoning Administrator to administer and

certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a
registered land surveyor or professional engineer and certified by the same.
(The Floodplain Administrator shall review the lowest floor elevation survey
data submitted.) The applicant shall correct deficiencies detected by such
review before any further work is allowed to proceed. Failure to submit the
survey or failure to make said corrections required hereby shall be cause to
issue a stop-work order for the project. Any work undertaken prior to
submission of the elevation certification shall be at the applicant's risk.
The Floodplain Administrator shall review the lowest floor elevation survey
data submitted. The applicant shall correct any deficiencies detected by such
review. Failure to submit the elevation certification or failure to make
correction required shall be cause to issue a stop-work order for the project.



         2.   Upon establishment of the floodproofed elevation of
a floodproofed structure, it shall be the duty of the applicant to submit to
the Floodplain Administrator a floodproofing certificate. Certification shall
be prepared by or under the direction supervision of a registered
professional engineer and certified by same. (The Floodplain Administrator
shall review the floodproofing certification submitted.) The applicant shall
correct any deficiencies detected by such review before any further work is
allowed to proceed. Failure to submit the floodproofing certification or
failure to make correction required shall be cause to issue a stop-work order
for the project.

flooding.



      i.   Any alteration, repair, reconstruction or improvements to
a structure that is in compliance with the provisions of this section shall
meet the requirements of "new construction" as contained in this section.



   2.   Specific standards. In all SFHAs, the following provisions are
required:



      a.   In addition to the requirements of division E.1., all
structures to be located in the SFHA shall be protected from flood damage
below the FPG. This building protection requirement applies to the following
situations:



         1.   Construction or placement of any structure having a
floor area greater than 400 square feet.



         2.   Addition or improvement made to any existing
structure where the cost of the addition or improvement equals or exceeds 50%
of the value of the existing structure (excluding the value of the land).



         3.    Reconstruction or repairs made to a damaged
structure where the costs of restoring the structure to it's before damaged
condition equals or exceeds 50% of the market value of the structure
(excluding the value of the land) before damage occurred.



         4.   Installing a travel trailer or recreational vehicle
on a site for more than 180 days.



         5.   Installing a manufactured home on a new site or a
new manufactured home on an existing site. This section does not apply to
returning the existing manufactured home to the same site it lawfully
occupied before it was removed to avoid flood damage.



         6.    Reconstruction or repairs made to a repetitive
loss structure.



         7.   Addition or improvement made to any existing

      b.   Residential structures. New construction or substantial
improvement of any residential structure (or manufactured home) shall have
the lowest floor; including basement, at or above the FPG (two feet above the
base flood elevation). Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to
elevate a structure, openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded
movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accordance with the standards
of division E.2.d.



      c.   Non-residential structures. New construction or
substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial, or non-residential
structure (or manufactured home) shall either have the lowest floor,
including basement, elevated to or above the FPG (two feet above the base
flood elevation) or be floodproofed to or above the FPG. Should solid
foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a structure, openings
sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be
provided in accordance with the standards of division E.2.d. Structures
located in all "A Zones" may be floodproofed in lieu of being elevated if
done in accordance with the following:



         1.   A registered professional engineer or architect
shall certify that the structure has been designed so that below the FPG, the
structure and attendant utility facilities are watertight and capable of
resisting the effects of the regulatory flood. The structure design shall
take into account flood velocities, duration, rate of rise, hydrostatic
pressures, and impacts from debris or ice. Such certification shall be
provided to the official as set forth in division D.3.l.



         2.   Floodproofing measures shall be operable without
human intervention and without an outside source of electricity.



      d.   Elevated structures. New construction or substantial
improvements of elevated structures shall have the lowest floor at or above
the FPG. Elevated structures with fully enclosed areas formed by foundation
and other exterior walls below the flood protection grade shall be designed
to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and
exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on
exterior walls. Designs must meet the following minimum criteria:



         1.   Provide a minimum of two openings located in a
minimum of two exterior walls (having a total net area of not less than one
square inch for every one square foot of enclosed area).



         2.   The bottom of all openings shall be no more than
one foot above the exterior grade or the interior grade immediately beneath
each opening, whichever is higher.



         3.   Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers,
valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow
of floodwaters in both directions.



         4.   Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum
necessary to allow for parking for vehicles (garage door) or limited storage
of maintenance equipment used in connection with the premises (standard
exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator).



         5.   The interior portion of such enclosed area shall
not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms.



         6.   The interior grade of such enclosed area shall be
at an elevation at or higher than the exterior grade.



      e.   Structures constructed on fill. A residential or
nonresidential structure may be constructed on a permanent land fill in
accordance with the following:



         1.   The fill shall be placed in layers no greater than
one foot deep before compacting to 95% of the maximum density obtainable with
either the Standard or Modified Proctor Test method. The results of the test
showing compliance shall be retained in permit file.



         2.   The fill shall extend ten feet beyond the
foundation of the structure before sloping below the BFE.



         3.   The fill shall be protected against erosion and
scour during flooding by vegetative cover, riprap, or bulkheading. If
vegetative cover is used, the slopes shall be no steeper than three
horizontal to one vertical.



         4.   The fill shall not adversely affect the flow of
surface drainage from or onto neighboring properties.



         5.   The top of the lowest floor including basements
shall be at or above the FPG.



      f.   Standards for manufactured homes and recreational
vehicles. Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles to be installed or
substantially improved on a site for more than 180 days must meet one of the
following requirements:



         1.   These requirements apply to all manufactured homes
to be placed on a site outside a manufactured home park or subdivision; in a
new manufactured home park or subdivision; in an expansion to an existing
manufactured home park or subdivision; or in an existing manufactured home
park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial
damage" as a result of a flood:



            a.   The manufactured home shall be elevated on a
permanent foundation such that the lowest floor shall be at or above the FPG
and securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist
flotation, collapse, and lateral movement.



            b.   Fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and
other exterior walls below the FPG shall be designed to preclude finished
living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls as required
for elevated structures in division E.2.d.



            c.   Flexible skirting and rigid skirting not
attached to the frame or foundation of a manufactured home are not required
to have openings.



         2.   These requirements apply to all manufactured homes
to be placed on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision
that has not been substantially damaged by a flood:



            a.   The manufactured home shall be elevated so
that the lowest floor of the manufactured home chassis is supported by
reinforced piers or other foundation elevations that are no less than 36
inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately
anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral
movement.



            b.   Fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and
other exterior walls below the FPG shall be designed to preclude finished
living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls as required
for elevated structures in division E.2.d.



            c.   Flexible skirting and rigid skirting not
attached to the frame or foundation of a manufactured home are not required
to have openings.



         3.   Recreational vehicles placed on a site shall either:



            a.   Be on site for less than 180 days;



            b.   Be fully licensed and ready for highway use
(defined as being on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site
only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no
permanently attached additions); or



            c.   Meet the requirements for "manufactured
homes" as stated earlier in this section.



      g.   Accessory structures. Relief to the elevation or dry
floodproofing standards may be granted for accessory structures. Such
structures must meet the following standards:



         1.   Shall not be used for human habitation.



         2.   Shall be constructed of flood resistant materials.



         3.   Shall be constructed and placed on the lot to offer

of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior
walls as required for elevated structures in division E.2.d.



      h.   Above ground gas or liquid storage tanks. All above
ground gas or liquid storage tanks shall be anchored to prevent flotation or
lateral movement.



   3.   Standards for subdivision proposals.



      a.   All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the
need to minimize flood damage.



      b.   All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and
facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and
constructed to minimize flood damage.



      c.   All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage
provided to reduce exposure to flood hazards.



      d.   Base flood elevation data shall be provided for
subdivision proposals and other proposed development (including manufactured
home parks and subdivisions), which is greater than the lesser of 50 lots or
five acres.



      e.   All subdivision proposals shall minimize development in
the SFHA and/or limit density of development permitted in the SFHA.



      f.   All subdivision proposals shall ensure safe access
into/out of SFHA for pedestrians and vehicles (especially emergency
responders).



   4.   Critical facility. Construction of new critical facilities
shall be, to the extent possible, located outside the limits of the SFHA.
Construction of new critical facilities shall be permissible within the SFHA
if no feasible alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed
within the SFHA shall have the lowest floor elevated to or above the FPG at
the site. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that
toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters.
Access routes elevated to or above the FPG shall be provided to all critical
facilities to the extent possible.



   5.   Standards for identified floodways.



      a.   Located within SFHAs, established in division C.2., are
areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area
due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris, potential
projectiles, and has erosion potential. If the site is in an identified
floodway, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to forward
the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for
construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of I.C. 14-28-1 a permit for
construction in a floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources
is required prior to the issuance of a local building permit for any
excavation, deposit, construction, or obstruction activity located in the
floodway. This includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading,
clearing and paving etc. undertaken before the actual start of construction
of the structure. However, it does exclude non-substantial
additions/improvements to existing (lawful) residences in a non-boundary
river floodway. (I.C. 14-28-1-26 allows construction of a non-substantial
addition/improvement to a residence in a non-boundary river floodway without
obtaining a permit for construction in the floodway from the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources. Please note that if fill is needed to
elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior approval for the fill is
required from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.)



      b.   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator
until a permit or letter of authorization (when applicable) has been issued
by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources granting approval for
construction in the floodway. Once a permit for construction in a floodway or
letter of authorization has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local Floodplain
development permit, provided the provisions contained in division E. of this
section have been met. The floodplain development permit cannot be less
restrictive than the permit for construction in a floodway issued by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources. However, a community's more
restrictive regulations (if any) shall take precedence.



      c.   No development shall be allowed, which acting alone or in
combination with existing or future development, that will adversely affect
the efficiency of, or unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This
adverse affect is defined as an increase in the elevation of the regulatory
flood of at least fifteen-hundredths (0.15) of a foot as determined by
comparing the regulatory flood elevation under the project condition to that
under the natural or pre-floodway condition as proven with hydraulic analyses.



      d.   For all projects involving channel modifications or fill
(including levees) the Floodplain Administrator shall submit the data and
request that the Federal Emergency Management Agency revise the regulatory
flood data per mapping standard regulations found at 44 CFR § 65.12.



   6.   Standards for identified fringe. If the site is located in an
identified fringe, then the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
floodplain development permit provided the provisions contained in division
E. of this section have been met. The key provision is that the top of the
lowest floor of any new or substantially improved structure shall be at or
above the FPG.



   7.   Standards for SFHAs without established base flood elevation
and/or flood ways/fringes.



      a.   Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one
square mile:



         1.   If the site is in an identified floodplain where
the limits of the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the
drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the
Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the
application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources for review and comment.



         2.   No action shall be taken by the Floodplain
Administrator until either a permit for construction in a floodway (including
letters of authorization) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment
citing the 1% annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood
protection grade has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources.



         3.   Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the
proper permit for construction in a floodway (including letters of
authorization) or floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment approving the
proposed development, a floodplain development permit may be issued provided
the conditions of the floodplain development permit are not less restrictive
than the conditions received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources
and the provisions contained in division E. of this section have been met.



      b.   Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one
square mile:



         1.   If the site is in an identified floodplain where
the limits of the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the
drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile, the
Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to provide an
engineering analysis showing the limits of the floodplain and 1% annual
chance flood elevation for the site.



         2.   Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may
issue the local floodplain development permit, provided the provisions
contained in division E. of this section have been met.



      c.   The total cumulative effect of the proposed development,
when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, will not
increase the regulatory flood more than 0.14 of one foot and will not
increase flood damages or potential flood damages.



   8.   Standards for flood prone areas. All development in known flood
prone areas not identified on FEMA maps, or where no FEMA published map is
available, shall meet applicable standards as required per division E.



F.   Variance Procedures.



   1.   Designation of Variance and Appeals Board. The Board of Zoning
Appeals shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from
requirements of this section.



   2.   Duties of Variance and Appeals Board. The board shall hear and
decide appeals when it is alleged an error in any requirement, decision, or
determination is made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or
administration of this section. Any person aggrieved by the decision of the
Board may appeal such decision to the Hancock County Circuit Court.



   3.   Variance procedures. In passing upon such applications, the
Board shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, all
standards specified in this section, and:



      a.   The danger of life and property due to flooding or
erosion damage.



      b.   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its
contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual
owner.



      c.   The importance of the services provided by the proposed
facility to the community.



      d.   The necessity to the facility of a waterfront location,
where applicable.



      e.   The availability of alternative locations for the
proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage.



      f.   The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and
anticipated development.



      g.   The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive
plan and floodplain management program for that area.



      h.   The safety of access to the property in times of flood
for ordinary and emergency vehicles.



      i.   The expected height, velocity, duration, rate of rise,
and sediment of transport of the floodwaters at the site.



      j.   The costs of providing governmental services during and
after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities
and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets
and bridges.



   4.   Conditions for variances.



      a.    Variances shall only be issued when there is:



         1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause.



         2.   A determination that failure to grant the variance
would result in exceptional hardship.



         3.   A determination that the granting of a variance
will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public
safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud or
victimization of the public, or conflict with existing laws or ordinances.



      b.   No variance for a residential use within a floodway
subject to division E.5. or E.7.a of this section may be granted.



      c.   Any variance granted in a floodway subject to division
E.5. or E.7.a. of this section will require a permit from the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources.



      d.   Variances to the provisions for flood hazard reduction of
division E.2. may be granted only when a new structure is to be located on a
lot of one-half acre or less in size, contiguous to and surrounded by lots
with existing structures constructed below the flood protection grade.



      e.   Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that
the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to
afford relief.



      f.   Variances may be granted for the reconstruction or
restoration of any structure individually listed on the National Register of
Historic Places or the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites and
Structures.



      g.   Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be
given written notice specifying the difference between the flood protection
grade and the elevation to which the lowest floor is to be built and stating
that the cost of the flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased
risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation (See division F.5.).



      h.   The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records
of appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency
Management Agency or the Indiana Department of Natural Resources upon request
(See division F.5.).



   5.   Variance notification. Any applicant to whom a variance is
granted that allows the lowest floor of a structure to be built below the
flood protection grade shall be given written notice over the signature of a
community official that:



      a.   The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below
the flood protection grade will result in increased premium rates for flood
insurance up to amounts as high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage; and



      b.   Such construction below the flood protection grade
increases risks to life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded
by the Floodplain Administrator in the Office of the County Recorder and
shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the
affected parcel of land. The Floodplain Administrator will maintain a record
of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance.



   6.   Historic structure. Variances may be issued for the repair or
rehabilitation of "historic structures" upon a determination that the
proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued
designation as an "historic structure" and the variance is the minimum to
preserve the historic character and design of the structure.



   7.   Special conditions. Upon the consideration of the factors
listed in division F., and the purposes of this section, the Board of Zoning
Appeals may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems
necessary to further the purposes of this section.

155.034 BUILDING SETBACK LINES



Building setback lines shall be required along all public streets as required
in this section.  Any yard abutting a street shall be deemed a front yard
for the purpose of determining front building setback lines.  In no case may
a structure encroach into the right-of-way established by the Thoroughfare
Plan without prior approval from the Board of Works. Front setback:



   1.   For improved blocks where 25% or more of the lots in the block
frontage are occupied by buildings, the average setback of those buildings
determines the dimension of the front setback for any new building, provided
that such structure does not encroach into the right-of-way as established by
the Thoroughfare Plan.



      For the purpose of this Section an improved block shall be
defined as any block which contains at least three lots or parcels, each
containing a legally established building.  For the purposes of this
section, a block consists of one (1) side of the street, not interrupted by
any streets, alleys, or other rights-of-way.  In any case where a proposed
building site has no buildings within 300 feet in either direction on the
same side of the street, the property shall be considered to be in an
unimproved block.



   2.   For unimproved blocks, setback lines shall be in accordance
with the street type designated on the Thoroughfare Plan of current
adoption.  If the actual right-of-way is greater than the minimum required
by the Thoroughfare Plan, the minimum setback shall be increased by one-half
the width of the additional right-of-way. Minimum setback distances are as
follows:



      a.   Beltway or primary arterial.  No part of any structure
may be built closer than eighty (80)) feet from the right-of-way line of a
beltway or primary arterial.



      b.   Secondary arterial.  No part of any structure shall be
built closer than) sixty (60) feet from the right-of-way line of a secondary
arterial or one-way arterial.



      c.   Collector street.  No part of any structure shall be
built closer than forty (40) feet from the right-of-way line of a collector
street.



      d.   Local street, marginal access street or cul-de-sac. No
part of any structure shall be built closer than twenty-five (25) feet from
the right-of-way line of a local street, with the following exceptions:



         1.   The minimum setback line shall be twenty-five (25)
feet to the centerline of a marginal access street or the vehicular turn
around of any local cul-de-sac;



         2.   The minimum setback line for a primary residential
structure with an attached garage that protrudes from the main structure at
an angle greater than 30 degrees, with a horizontal dimension greater than
fifteen (15) feet, shall be thirty (30) feet.



      e.   Access road or commercial drive.  No part of any
structure may be built closer than twenty five (25) feet from the
right-of-way line of an access road or commercial drive.



   3.   Building lines or building setback lines established in a
recorded subdivision shall establish the dimension of front yards in those
subdivisions.



   4.   On through lots a front yard is required on each street.



      Any street not designated on the thoroughfare plan of current
adoption shall be assumed to be a local street designation for the purpose of
determining the building setback line, unless the city engineer determines
that a higher classification applies.  Private streets shall be considered
to be local streets for the purposes of this section.



   5.   All corner lots shall have a front yard for each street
abutting the lot.



   6.   Such setback lines shall be as required in this Section with
the following exceptions:



      a.   As provided in Sections 155.034 for customary front yard
exceptions.



      b.   In case of conflict with the front setback requirements
of the zoning districts, and transitional setback lines, conditional uses or
other applicable provisions of this Chapter, the higher or most restrictive
requirement shall govern.



   7.   The setback exceptions set forth in this section apply to the
requirement of the Thoroughfare Plan Resolution of the City that establishes
the proposed right-of-way line as the front line of lots that front upon a
street.

be deemed a conditional use and placed before the Board of Zoning Appeals, in
accordance with Section 155.060.



   2.   In applicable residential zone districts, existing one (1) or
two (2) family dwellings may be converted into additional dwelling or rooming
units only when such existing building, by reason of its size and the
character of the neighborhood in which it is located makes such dwelling
unsuitable or uneconomic for its intended use.



      a.   It is the purpose of this chapter to discourage the
conversion of existing dwellings originally designed for occupancy by two
families or less to occupancy by more than two families when the conversion
is likely to lead to overcrowding, lack of privacy, lack of sufficient light
and air, unsafe or unsanitary living conditions, or inadequate provisions for
off-street parking and open space.



      b.   Such conversions shall be consistent with the purposes of
other applicable provision of this Code, including housing and building Codes
and fire safety and utility programs.



      c.   In connection with such conversion, there shall be no
evidence of change in the building to indicate the extra dwelling units,
except as may be required by the aforementioned ordinances and programs. 
All fire escapes or stairways leading to a second or higher floor shall be
completely enclosed within the converted building, and no dwelling shall be
so converted unless in connection therewith it is placed in a reasonable
state of repair.



      d.   In cases of question as to the applicability of these
standards, such proposed conversion shall be deemed a conditional use and
placed before the Board of Zoning Appeals in accordance with Section 155.060.



155.042  BUILDINGS RELOCATED



No building or structures shall be moved from one lot or premises to another
unless such building shall thereupon conform to all the regulations of the
zone district to which the building shall be moved.



155.043  MANUFACTURED HOMES PERMITTED



Manufactured homes may be permitted in all residential Districts provided
their use as a single-family dwelling unit incorporates a permanent

do not apply to chimneys, cooling towers, elevator bulkheads, fire towers,
penthouses, stacks, tanks, water towers, transmission towers, spires,
belfries, cupolas, parapet, silos and farm structures, antennas, essential
mechanical appurtenances, or other appurtenances usually required to be
placed above the roof line provided that:



         1.   Such appurtenances are not intended for human
occupancy.



         2.   Such appurtenances as towers of mechanical or
structural necessity with a roof area equal to or in excess of fifty percent
(50%) of the average floor area of the building shall be considered a part of
the height of the building.



         3.   Such height is not prohibited by other laws or the
provisions of this chapter.



      b.   Above-ground storage tanks containing gasoline, diesel or
other flammable or combustible liquids shall not be permitted by service
station uses or any other use which dispenses gasoline and other flammable or
combustible liquids for public consumption. The setback for above-ground
storage of flammable or combustible liquids and gases in industrial or
commercial districts shall be governed by the more restrictive of the
following:



         1.   Such storage shall be located at least 100 feet
from the property line adjoining a residential district and 100 feet from a
lot containing a public building or existing residential dwelling, or



         2.   As regulated by the current Indiana Flammable &
Combustible Liquids and Gases Code (675 IAC 22-1) or the current Indiana Fire
Prevention Code (675 IAC 22-2).



   2.   Such aggregate storage shall be limited to 50,000 gallons
(water capacity) in the range from 100 to 200 feet from a residential
district line or any lot containing a public building or residential dwelling.



      a.   All other above-ground storage of flammable or
combustible liquids, gases, and other materials which are not included in the
definitions of “bulk storage” and “storage” or that are not included
elsewhere in the regulations of this Section shall be regulated in accordance
with the current Indiana Flammable & Combustible Liquids and Gases Code (675
IAC 22-1), the current Indiana Fire Prevention Code (675 IAC 22-2) and all
other local, state, and federal laws.



      b.   Any variance from these standards will require approval
by the Board of Zoning Appeals. This variance may be granted only if the
Board finds that the general welfare and safety of the community will not be
affected by the granting of this variance (extra protection measures are
provided, etc.), that this variance is the minimum necessary, and that all
other federal, state and local standards are adequately met

   2.   Purposes



      In order to protect the public health, safety and general welfare
of the community, while accommodating the communication needs of residents
and business these regulations are necessary in order to:



      a.   Facilitate the provision of wireless telecommunication
services to the residents and businesses of the City of Greenfield;



      b.   Minimize adverse visual effects of towers through careful
design and siting standards;



      c.   Encourage the location of towers in non-residential areas
through performance standards and incentives;

failure through structural standards and setback requirements; and,



      e.   Provide mechanisms for the mitigation of tower
proliferation through tower sharing requirements for all new tower applicants
and those existing towers that are physically capable of sharing.



   3.   Authority



      The Board of Zoning Appeals of the City of Greenfield
(hereinafter “Board”) is vested with the authority to review, approve,
conditionally approve, and disapprove applications for wireless communication
facilities, including sketch, preliminary and final plans.



   4.   Jurisdiction



      a.   These regulations apply to all wireless communications
facilities, as defined in Section 155.052(B)(2), located within the corporate
limits of the City of Greenfield or outside the corporate limits as provided
by law.



      b.   No wireless communications facility may be constructed
without an approved and signed site plan from the Planning Commission.



   5.   Enactment



      In order that wireless communications facilities may be
constructed in accordance with these purposes and policies, these regulations
are hereby adopted and made effective as of June 11, 1998. All applications
for wireless communication facility sitings pending on the effective date of
these regulations shall be reviewed under these regulations or thereafter
filed.



   6.   Interpretation, Conflict, and Separability



      a.   Interpretation.  In their interpretation and
application, the provisions of these regulations shall be held to be the
minimum requirements for the protection of public health, safety, and
general  welfare.  These  regulations shall be construed broadly to
promote the purposes for which they are adopted.



      b.   Conflict.  These regulations are not intended to
interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation,
statute or other provision of law except as provided in these regulations. 
Where any provision of these regulations imposes restrictions different from
any other ordinance, rule or regulation, statute, or other provision of law,
the provision which is more restrictive or imposes higher standards shall
control



      c.   Separability.  If any part or provision of these
regulations or the application of these regulations to any service provider
or circumstances is adjudged invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction,

155.054  “CO” CORRIDOR OVERLAY DISTRICT



   The purpose of this section is to establish an overlay district to
address the unique characteristics of properties adjacent to the main
corridors within the City of Greenfield. These corridors have unique traffic
management needs, development pressures, and aesthetic characteristics that
require the establishment of additional development standards to meet the
goals of the Comprehensive Plan and further the welfare of the city.



   The intent of the Corridor Overlay District (“CO”) is to require
development, and redevelopment, along the city’s primary thoroughfares that
is aesthetically consistent, responsive to development pressures, and
proportional to the area’s traffic management issues.



A.   General Provisions



   1.   The boundaries of the CO district are as follows:



      a.   Any commercial, industrial, or PUD-zoned property located
within an area 500 feet deep east and west from the right-of-way lines of
State Street, extending from McKenzie Road to Interstate 70. The area does
not include the entirety of any parcels that may partially lie within the
500-foot depth at the time of passage of this ordinance. The Plan Commission
may consider a modification or waiver of the CO requirements on such
partially affected properties that do not directly affect State Street or
further the intent of this code. This area shall be designated “CO-1".



      b.   Any property located within an area 1,320 feet deep west
from the right-of-way line of State Street, extending from Interstate 70 to
County Road 300 North. The area also includes the entirety of any parcels
that may partially lie within the 1,320-foot depth at the time of passage of
this ordinance. This area shall be designated “CO-2".



      c.   Any additional territory designated by the Official Zone
Map.



   2.   For any parcel that is developed within the CO District, these
regulations shall apply. For any parcel that is redeveloped or any structure
that is remodeled, only those regulations applicable to the redevelopment or
remodeling shall apply.



   3.   Development plans shall be required to be approved by the Plan
Commission for all development. The development requirements of this section
may be modified or waived by the Plan Commission upon the approval of a
development plan, if the applicant can demonstrate that the proposed
development plan and the community is better served by the proposed standards.



   4.   Outdoor storage of merchandise or other materials is prohibited
within view of the primary arterial. Otherwise, the underlying regulations

Conditional uses may be permitted by the Board of Zoning Appeals in the
districts indicated, in accordance with the procedure set forth and the
requirements listed herein.



A.   Definition and basis of approval



Conditional uses are those of such an unusual nature that their operation may
give rise to unique problems with respect to their impact on neighboring
property and public facilities.



   1.   A conditional use or any use not otherwise set forth in this
Code that fits the definition set forth herein, may be approved in zones as
specified in this section. The use approved shall be subject to any
regulations or requirements imposed as a part of the conditional use, in
addition or in place of the other regulations and requirements of this
Code.  The provisions of a conditional use shall replace and supersede the
provisions of the base district, effective upon either construction of any
facilities approved as a part of the conditional use or  upon beginning of
operation of the use or uses specified, whichever occurs first.  The
provisions shall remain in effect until such time as the conditional use
ceases to operate for a period in excess of two years.  Immediately prior to
reuse of the structures or facilities used for the conditional use, the
provisions of the conditional use shall become invalid and the regulations
and requirements of the base district shall again be in effect.



   2.   Any significant changes (as determined by the Board) including
change of ownership, in the use of a conditional use or any construction of
new facilities or structures, or major additions to existing facilities or
structures (as determined by the Board) shall be subject to approval by the
Board of Zoning Appeals using the same process as was used for the original
approval.



   3.   Specific to adult entertainment/sexually oriented businesses;
no such operation shall be enlarged, reconstructed, resumed or structurally
altered, unless the site or proposed site is located in the PB District, and
has obtained a conditional use approval.



B.   Procedure for approval



   1.   In no case may a conditional use be granted by the Board unless
and until the following occur:

indicating the section of the chapter under which it is sought and stating
the grounds on which it is requested.



      b.   Notice is given to parties in interest and a public
hearing is held in accordance with this Chapter.



      c.   The Board of Zoning Appeals shall make findings, and
state the facts of these findings, that the granting of the conditional use
will substantially serve the public convenience and welfare and will not
substantially or permanently injure the appropriate use of the neighboring
property.



      d.   Staff may send the application to the Technical Review
Committee for comment.

when the requirement for an adequate number of spaces is unclear, the number
of parking spaces shall be determined by the City Engineer, on the basis of
similar requirements, the number of persons served or employed, and the
capability  of adequately serving the visiting public.  The determination
may be reviewed by the Plan Commission or the Board of Zoning Appeals as part
of their review of a development plan, PUD, conditional use or variance
request.  In all other cases, the Staff’s decision may be appealed to the
Board of Zoning Appeals.

hereinafter.  The Board of Zoning  Appeals  is authorized to  grant  an
off-site parking facility as a conditional use in accordance with the
following conditions.



   2.   A plan for such off-site parking facility shall  be  filed 
with the  Board  of  Zoning Appeals as a required exhibit accompanying the
conditional use application and shall be made part of the conditions of any
approval therefore.  The plan shall demonstrate compliance with all
applicable standards of this chapter, shall be amended and re-approved to
indicate any change or other modification of uses served or number of parking
spaces provided therefore, and shall indicate:



      a.   Adjacent streets, alleys, and lots.



      b.   All individual primary uses to  be served, including the
location, use, and number of parking spaces for each such use.



      c.   A layout drawn to scale of aisles and driveways,
entrances, exits and turn-off lanes, parking spaces, setbacks, drainage
facilities, and landscaping and buffer screening.



      d.   Type of lighting and pavement proposed, and
identification signs including location, size, and design thereof, showing
intensity levels and characteristics.



   3.   Valet parking arrangements shall be considered a conditional
use.



   4.   In the Historical Overlay District all or any part of an
off-street parking requirement  may be provided in an off street parking
reservoir which collects and combines such parking obligations into a common
facility in order to further the objectives of the downtown.



      a.   Such off site parking facilities may be located in an
adjoining zone district within nine hundred (900) feet of the site served,
such distance to be measured along the nearest pedestrian walkway from the
nearest point of the site served to the nearest point of the separated 
off  street  parking  spaces; provided, that such off site parking
facilities shall not be located in a residential zone district.



      b.   In order to encourage the development of off street
parking reservoirs in accordance with the objectives of this Chapter, the
number of required spaces per use utilizing such facility may be reduced to
the extent of ten (10) percent below such off-street parking requirement. 
Such reduction shall be indicated on the approved site plan.



      c.   Off site parking facilities shall be provided with
setback distances equivalent to the requirements of the zone district, and
ingress and egress points shall be limited to protect the function of
adjoining streets.



      d.   Each use utilizing off site parking facilities to comply
with off street parking requirements of this Chapter shall be encumbered by
proper notations on certificates of zoning compliance and placed of public
record in the office of the County Recorder, which subject such accessory
off-street parking facilities to parking uses in connection with the primary
uses served.

of such site, such distance to be measured along the nearest pedestrian
walkway  from the nearest point of the site served to the nearest point of
the separated off street parking spaces; provided, that off site parking
facilities shall be located in the same zone district as the use served.

setback  distances  equivalent to the requirements of the zone district,
and ingress and egress points shall be limited to protect the function of
adjoining streets



      g.   Off site parking facilities shall be encumbered by an
instrument duly executed and acknowledged, which shall  subject such
accessory off street parking facilities to parking uses in connection with
the primary use served.  Such instrument shall specify and bind the time
period to the anticipated life of the building or use to which the parking
facilities are accessory.  Such instrument shall be recorded in the
applicable zoning compliance permit files of the Commission, and placed of
public record in the office of the County Recorder.



   5.   Off-site parking facilities shall be developed in accordance
with the provisions of division “F” below.  Further, the facilities
shall be developed under such conditions imposed by the Board of Zoning

incidental to entering or leaving a parking space shall be on any public
right-of-way or walkway.



   3.   Off-street parking spaces may be open to the sky or enclosed in

be used permanently in association with industries that handle liquids or
chemicals which create a potential hazard if containment should be lost and
where absorption into the ground through a loose surface material would
eliminate or alleviate such hazard.



   6.   Driveway entrances or exits shall be no closer  than 
twenty  five  (25)  feet  to  an adjoining residential property line or
ten (10) feet to an adjoining nonresidential property line or designed in
such a manner as to least interfere with traffic movement.  No driveway
across public property at the right of way line shall exceed a width of
thirty (30) feet; provided, that two (2) driveways not exceeding thirty (30)
feet in width each may constitute a single entrance-exit divider designed
driveway; provided further, that such driveways shall conform to the
requirements of engineering departments having jurisdiction thereof. No
driveway shall be closer than forty (40) feet to the curbline of an
intersecting street.



   7.   In any zone district, each use which is located so that it
fronts upon and provides access to an arterial thoroughfare shall provide a
frontage lane paralleling and adjoining the improved part of the right of way
at least eleven (11) feet in width for turning  traffic entering the lot.
Such frontage lane shall be at least one hundred (100) feet in length,
exclusive of the entrance way and taper area; provided, that if the lot
frontage is too small to meet such requirement, the frontage lane shall
extend the entire width of the lot.



   8.   Any lighting facilities used to illuminate off street parking
areas shall be so located, shielded and directed upon the parking area in
such a manner that they do not reflect or cause glare onto adjacent
properties, or  interfere with street traffic.  In no instance shall bare
unshaded bulbs be used for such illumination.



   9.   Such parking areas shall be graded and properly drained in such
a manner that there will be no free flow of water onto either adjacent
property or public sidewalks.  Further, any additional run off generated 
by such improved areas shall  be disposed of in appropriate drainage
facilities, as approved by the City Engineer.



   10.   Such parking areas shall be so lined or designated as to
insure the most efficient use of the parking spaces and shall be provided
with bumper guards or wheel guards so located that no part of the parked

(Ord. 1979-24, passed 12-13-79)



Greenfield does not currently have local parking standards for accessible
parking for disabled citizens.  The practice has been to encourage
compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).  This proposed
ordinance follows ADA standards.  It is recommended that the Greenfield
Police Department be empowered to enforce this section of the zoning
ordinance.



H.   Accessible Parking.



All private or public facilities which provide parking spaces for
self-parking by employees or visitors, or both, shall provide accessible
spaces complying with this section in each such parking area.  Provided
however, that accessible spaces need not be provided in the particular lot if
the Board of Zoning Appeals finds that there is equivalent or greater
accessibility (in terms of distance from accessible entrance, cost, and
convenience), and is assured that the alternative location is available on a
permanent, continual basis.



   1.   Schedule of required accessible parking spaces.  Accessible
parking spaces shall be provided in the following number:

passenger loading zone with an access aisle of at least 5 feet wide and 20
feet long, adjacent and parallel to the vehicle pull-up space.  If there is
a curb between the access aisle and the vehicle pull-up space, then a curb
ramp shall be provided which complies with the City Engineers' standards.



   3.   Location of Accessible Spaces.  Accessible parking spaces
shall be located on the shortest possible route of travel from adjacent
parking to an accessible entrance to the building or facility they serve. 
The route of travel should not cross an aisle carrying vehicular traffic.

directly in front of the accessible parking space and unobstructed. 
Additionally, such spaces shall be designated by blue lines, including the
symbol of accessibility, in accordance with IC-5-16-9-4.

   1.   Automotive vehicles or trailers of any type without current
license plates or in an inoperable condition, so as to be deemed dead
storage, shall be prohibited in residential zone districts other than in
completely enclosed buildings, and shall not be parked or stored in any zone
district unless specifically authorized under the terms of this Chapter.



   2.   The parking of a commercial, self-propelled vehicle in
residential zone districts shall be prohibited; except, that:



      a.   Commercial vehicle of not more than three (3) tons
capacity may be parked on any lot on which there is located a principal
building; provided further;



      b.   Such vehicle is parked in an enclosed garage, accessory
building or rear yard and is used by a resident of the premises. This
regulation shall not be interpreted to prohibit commercial vehicles from
temporary loading and unloading in any residential zone district.

A.   Purpose and intent



In accordance with the provisions of I.C. 36-7-4-601, this section contains
requirements which are intended to further the goals of the Comprehensive
Plan.  Specifically, the purposes of these sign regulations are to implement
the following city policies:



   1.   To provide minimum standards to safeguard life, health,
property, and public welfare, and to promote traffic safety by controlling
the design, quality of materials, construction, illumination, size, location
and maintenance of signs and sign structures.



   2.   To enhance local economic development and growth and to protect
public and private investment.



   3.   To avoid the excessive proliferation of signs that may impede
the flow of information from safety and traffic signs and signals to
pedestrians and motorists; and may actually impede the flow of information
from businesses to consumers;



   4.   To preserve and enhance the character and visual appearance of
the city;



   5.   To encourage signs to be compatible with the design of
buildings and with the surrounding area;



   6.   To encourage simplicity and readability of signs;



   7.   To encourage employment of the principles of good design; and



Further, it is the intent of this section to encourage signs which are all of
the following:



   1.   Safe, legible and effective for communication in the
circumstances in which they are seen;



   2.   Appropriate to the activity that displays them;



   3.   Expressive of both the individual activity and the community as
a whole; and

      f.   See additional limitations set forth for illuminated
changeable copy signs under division G.2. of this section.



   2.   Changeable copy signs (permanent).



      a.   Types: Changeable copy signs consist of two distinct
types of signs: manual signs and electronic variable message signs (EVMS). 
Exterior manual signs or sections that are fixed in place, and designated to
be used with removable graphics to allow changing of copy, shall be computed
as part of the total sign area allowed. Size, height, location, and other
restrictions are applicable under the appropriate subsection, depending upon
the type of sign utilized. Changeable electronic variable message signs
(EVMS) shall comply with the requirements of this division in addition to all
other provisions of this section.



      b.   Districts: Manual signs are allowed in all districts. 
EVMS shall be permitted in commercial and industrial zoning districts. EVMS
shall also be permitted for schools and churches in residential, commercial
or industrial zones subject to the regulations established in this section. 
EVMS shall be prohibited in the Traditional Neighborhood or Historic District.

a sign dedicated for an EVMS shall not exceed 40% of the sign size.



      e.   Duration:  Changeable copy must have a minimum duration
of one minute and must be a static display. No portion of the image may
flash, scroll, twirl, change color, or in any manner imitate movement, except
that time and temperature signs may adjust according to the time of day and
the current temperature.



      f.   Transition: In all districts where a sign changes by
EVMS, the change sequence must be accomplished instantaneously and without
special effects such as spinning, scrolling or traveling, and must be
completed in no less than one second but no more than two seconds.



      g.   Brightness and ambient dimmer control: Electronic graphic
display signs must have an automatic dimmer control (or photo electric cell)
that maintains the minimum amount of light intensity necessary for clear and
adequate visibility based on the surrounding ambient light at all times. For
residential areas, the illumination must not exceed a maximum brightness of
three-tenths (0.3) foot-candles above the ambient light. For commercial and
industrial areas, the illumination must not exceed a maximum brightness of
eight-tenths (0.8) foot-candles above the ambient light.     



      h.   Brightness: Illumination shall be measured from the
nearest edge of the nearest street pavement at a height of four to five feet
above grade.  The brightness of an EVMS sign located perpendicular to the
street shall be measured at a 45 degree angle.  The brightness of an EVMS
sign located parallel to the street shall be measured at a 90 degree angle.



See Appendix A Reference G.2.d., g. & h. Brightness Measurement

shall be prohibited. No portion of any sign may fluctuate in light intensity
or use intermittent, strobe or moving light or light that changes in
intensity in sudden transitory bursts, streams, zooms, twinkles, sparkles or
in any manner that creates the illusion of movement. No portion of any sign
may change its message or background in a manner or by a method of display
characterized by motion or pictorial imagery, or depict action or a special
effect to imitate movement, or the presentation of pictorials or graphics
displayed in a progression of frames that give the illusion of motion or the
illusion of moving objects, moving patterns or bands of light or expanding or
contracting shapes, and the like. 



      j.   Color display: Electronic message boards shall exhibit a
static color background consistent with the one minute duration of the
changeable copy.



      k.   Malfunction: In the event of a malfunction, the EVMS
shall freeze in one position or shall be shut down.



      l.   Off-premise use prohibited: Commercial messages displayed
on a changeable copy module shall not direct attention to a business or
product conducted, sold or offered off the premise that is not also
conducted, sold or offered on the premise on which the sign is located.



      m.   Public service announcements: EVMS may be used to display
public emergency service announcements such as weather alerts, national and
local security events, or amber alerts and the like. In the event of a public
emergency only, announcements may scroll continuously, until the message is
no longer necessary.

H.   Signs allowed by permit and certificate of appropriateness in the
Historic District.



All provisions regarding signage within this section are incorporated by
reference herein and in addition thereto, for any sign requested within the
Historic District (HD), these additional requirements shall apply. 
Generally, signs may be permitted by the Historic Board in those parts of the
Historic District which are classified as business or industrial, except for
home occupation uses or certain special exceptions. To the extent that any of
the additional requirements set forth below are in conflict with any other
provision of this section, the additional requirements below shall control.



   1.   Certificate of appropriateness. As in the case of structural
alteration, new construction, and demolition, all new signage or alterations
to signage shall be required to receive a Certificate of Appropriateness from
the Historic Board of Review.  The resulting high quality in both sign
design and construction will strengthen the integrity of the historic
district. To afford control, the Historic Board of Review will review and
approve all proposed signs and changes to signs as to their appropriateness
within the historic district, prior to receiving a permit.



   2.   Design guidelines. Please review the “Design Guide for the
Historic District of Greenfield Indiana”.  Each sign application shall be
reviewed as a unique case by the Historic Board of Review, subject to the
following criteria which shall include but not be limited to the following.



      a.   Materials:  Materials such as wood, wrought iron, steel,
metal, grill-work, and so forth, or replicas thereof, are encouraged. 
Various new synthetic products are acceptable, but should mimic the desired
look of handcrafted traditional signs. Materials such as extruded aluminum
and plastics, while not prohibited, may not be appropriate.  Simplicity and
restraint in material selection, its method of application, or its detail
construction, should be consistent with the other criteria. Materials shall
be complimentary to the particular historic character of the building.



      b.   Method of attachment: The signs attachment should respect
the architectural integrity of the structure and relate to or become an
extension of the architecture.  For example, a sign utilizing an archway
should reflect the archway in its configuration.



      c.   Illumination: Signs may appear without illumination or
may be illuminated.  Lighting source, design, and placement must be as
unobtrusive as possible, and the proposed method of lighting is also subject
to review by the Historic Board. Generally, signs which flash, blink,
revolve, or are otherwise in motion, vary in intensity, or appear to be in
motion, will not be permitted within the Historic District.  Electronic
variable message signs shall not be allowed.  Certain types of illumination,
or methods, or movements may be accepted by the Historic Board if they are
deemed appropriate in a particular circumstance. For example, the traditional
rotating barber pole would be acceptable.



   3.   On-building signs.



      a.   On-building signs definition.  On-building signs in the
Historic District shall include:



         1.   Wall signs:  These signs always exist parallel to
the building facade. They shall not be painted directly on the building
surface, but shall be painted on a separate background material and applied
to the facade as a unit.  Murals that have received a Certificate of
Appropriateness from the Historic Board of Review may be painted directly
onto a building surface.



         2.   Projecting signs:  Projecting signs, except those
on a corner, are those which exist 90 degrees to the building surface.  In
many instances, the sign shape could be the most effective way to express a
particular service or activity. For example, the familiar shoe shape may be
used to denote a shoe repair business.  These signs need not be thought of
as strictly flat, but may have dimension.  A creative approach to the
hanging hardware for such signs is also encouraged, but it must be designed
for maximum strength.  Signs must connect to sturdy wall bracket units with
an adequate gauge of steel or iron strap or chain.



         3.   Awning signs. Awnings can act as an effective and
decorative way to display a sign.  Sign messages should be limited to the
front face or the front drop flat of the awning, and might be achieved as
sewn appliqué or inset, or by painting or silk-screening. In no instance
shall the sign square footage exceed 50% of the square footage of the awning
face.  Awning fabrics must be carefully chosen to coordinate well with the
character of the building, and with adjoining buildings and awnings.  The
bottom of any awning shall be at least seven feet above the sidewalk.



      b.   On-building signs development standard exceptions.



         1.   Size: The total maximum sign surface area of all
wall signs located on a particular tenant space or building shall not exceed
two square feet of sign area for each lineal foot of tenant occupancy width
or building frontage width. In no instance shall more than 100 square feet of
wall sign be allowed per establishment.



            Projecting signs shall be no larger than nine square
feet and shall not protrude more than 54 inches from the building. 
Dimensional wall signs shall not protrude more than 12 inches from the
building.



         2.   Location: Signs may face onto a residential area. 
No signs should occur above the second-story window; however, an exception
may be made by allowing window signs for those professionals occupying the
third story of a building. Projecting signs may not extend below a point
eight feet from the sidewalk or grade surface.



      c.   Additional on-building signs include name plate and
business directory signs.



         1.   Size: When placed on a building individual name
plate signs not exceeding one square foot in sign area for any one business
so identified shall not require a permit. When combined with other business
nameplates to form a directory sign, the total area of combined business
directory sign shall be limited to ten square feet in area, shall not require
a permit, and shall not count towards the allowed square footage. Name plates
and business directory signs larger than those outlined herein shall require
a permit and shall count towards the allowed square footage of each
establishment.



         2.   Location: Nameplate and business directory signs
shall be located in close proximity to the entry door or the location shall
be approved by the Historic Board of Review.



      See Appendix A Reference H.3.b. & c. Historic District Signs



   4.   Freestanding signs



      In the instances where free standing signs can be located in a
front yard in the Historic District, these signs shall meet the requirements
of division G.5. except that they may be located not less than one foot
inside the property line.



      Sidewalk signs: These signs are moveable signs which are intended
to convey information to pedestrian traffic, such as an A-frame sign or
sandwich board containing menus or specials. 



      a.   Size: Signs shall be no more than two and one quarter
feet in width, and two and one half feet in depth (depth is measured
perpendicular to the face of the sign and parallel with the curb).



      b.   Height: Shall be a minimum height of two feet and a
maximum height of four and one half feet.



      c.   Location: The use of portable free standing signs shall
be restricted to one per front door to be used during business hours. A
minimum separation between signs on the same street shall be ten feet. Signs
shall be located in front of the establishment and within four feet of the
curb.  Placement of the signs shall not restrict pedestrian traffic.  Signs
shall not be located in a handicap ramp.  A five-foot clear lineal
pedestrian path shall be maintained on the sidewalk measured from the
building façade toward the curb.  A request for any path less than five
feet must be brought to the Zoning Administrator for review.  In no event
shall the clear lineal pedestrian path be less than the 41-inch clear zone
adopted by the American Disabilities Act.



      d.   Other restrictions: One sidewalk sign shall be allowed
per establishment. Sidewalk signs shall be inspected for sufficient weight to
ensure wind stability in inclement weather conditions and are subject to
permit revocation if the Zoning Administrator determines that a sign is
unsafe. Sidewalk signs shall be removed after business hours.



      e.   Annual permit required: Sidewalk signs shall be renewed
annually and must be accompanied by a scaled drawing of the sign and the
sidewalk, indicating any entrances into the building, the location of the
sign and the width of the sidewalk from the building to the curb.  In
addition the application must be accompanied by a notarized consent from the
building owner and proof of insurance for general liability that states the
City of Greenfield, Indiana is an additional co-insured. 



      See Appendix A Reference H.4.a., b. & c. Historic District

illuminate only the face of the sign. Lighting source, design, and placement
must be as unobtrusive as possible.  Generally, signs which flash, blink,
revolve, or are otherwise in motion, vary in intensity, or appear to be in
motion, will not be permitted within the Traditional Neighborhood district.

of this section, may continue provided:



      a.   Conditions of lawful status: Legal nonconforming status
shall be conferred only on signs authorized by a sign permit or variance of a
preceding ordinance, title, code, or law: or if no sign permit was required
under the applicable preceding ordinance, code or law; and



      b.   Nothing in this section shall relieve the owner or
beneficial user of a legal non-conforming sign, sign structure or the owner
of the property on which the legal nonconforming sign is located, from the
provisions of the section regarding safety, maintenance, and repair.  Normal
maintenance, including repainting, cleaning, or routine repair of a legal
nonconforming sign or sign structure shall not be deemed to be a condition

shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoration to a safe
condition of a legal nonconforming sign, or sign structure as ordered by any
public official charged with protecting public safety, and who declares such

such restoration is not otherwise in violation of the various provisions of
this section prohibiting the repair or restoration of partially damaged or
destroyed signs.

      a.   Legal nonconforming status of signs and/or sign
structures may terminate under the following conditions:



         1.   If the use of a sign is discontinued for a period
of 90 days or the business which the sign identifies closes it shall be
deemed abandoned and shall not thereafter be reestablished, unless an
extension is granted by the Zoning Administrator; or



         2.   If a sign is structurally altered such that its
nonconforming aspects increase; or



         3.   If a sign is relocated, replaced, or moved in any
way; or the sign is damaged and the cost of repair is 50% of its replacement
value.  For the purposes of this section, the changing of copy shall not be
considered the replacement of an existing legal nonconforming sign.



      b.   Upon the occurrence of any of the aforementioned events,
the property owner shall immediately bring the sign into compliance with this
section in conjunction with a new sign permit or the sign shall be removed. 



L.   Permit procedures



All signs identified by this section as requiring the issuance of a permit
shall be governed by the criteria for permit applications established by the
Plan Commission.



   1.   Criteria for all signs requiring a permit.  A permit
application for a sign otherwise in compliance with this section shall be
approved if the sign complies with the following criteria:



      a.   The sign should serve primarily to identify the business,
the establishment, or the type of activity conducted on the same premises, of
the project, service or interest being offered for sale, lease or rent
thereon, except as otherwise specifically provided above.



      b.   Illumination of signs, where not specifically prohibited
by this chapter should be at a level consistent with adequate identification
and readability.



      c.   Signs proposed to be located in the Historic District
require a certificate of appropriateness.



      d.   Signs requiring approval of the Board of Zoning Appeals
for conditional use in § 155.060 or temporary use in § 155.062 shall first
receive the Board’s approval.



      e.   Appropriate fees have been paid.



   2.   Permit application procedure.



      a.   Applicants are required to apply for permits prior to
undertaking any construction.



      b.   Only one sign permit shall be required for each sign
plan.  Applicants shall provide a sign plan as opposed to obtaining single
permits for commercial centers, groups of businesses, professional offices,
or industrial complexes.



      c.   Application shall be made on an application form provided
by the Zoning Administrator.  Applicant shall provide clear and legible
drawings with descriptions and location of the sign and all other signs whose
construction requires permits or counts towards the allowable sign area of
signs on the premises.  Drawings shall show dimensions of all signs, wall
elevations, and street frontages, supports, sizes, wiring components,
materials, method of attachment, and character of structural members to which
attachment is made.



   3.   Sign permit approval and fees. Before a sign permit application
is approved,  the applicant shall submit information to the Zoning
Administrator, as specified in the permit procedures required under division
I.1. and 2. and post required fees as determined by the Common Council.



   4.   All permits are good in perpetuity unless the sign is abandoned
or left unused for more than 90 days or the sign is legal non-conforming and
it loses its lawful status.  Permits for those signs which are expressly
specified as temporary signs pursuant to this section are temporary permits.



   5.   A sign permit shall become null and void if the sign or sign
program for which the permit was issued has not been installed within 12
months of issuance of the permit.



   6.   For any sign permit issued, the sign and sign structure must
conform to the requirements of this code, unless the sign and/or sign
structure is legally established non-conforming as defined in § 155.065K.



M.   Revocation of Permit



After notice and public hearing, any sign permit granted in accordance with
the provisions of this section may be revoked upon a finding by the Board of
Zoning Appeals, that the sign, or sign program, for which the permit was
granted advertises the availability or sale of goods, property, or services
no longer available, or is constructed, installed, or maintained in a manner
that is not in accordance with the approved application.



O.   Determination by Zoning Administrator



The Zoning Administrator may determine that a substantial change has been
made to an existing sign or sign structure, except as otherwise provided for
“Changeable Copy Signs,” herein.  Such substantial change shall be
considered a violation of this section, if a new permit is not obtained.

of  any illegal work being done; or shall take any other action authorized
by law to insure compliance with or to prevent violations of the provisions
of this Code.

application, and proof that all conditions of approval have been fulfilled,
including public improvements.



J.   Certificate of occupancy



No land shall be occupied or used and no building hereafter erected,
reconstructed, or structurally altered shall be occupied or used, in whole or
in part, for any purpose whatsoever, until a certificate of occupancy has

this Code applicable to the building or premises of the use in the district
in which it is to be located.



K.   Completion of improvements



On completion  of the improvement covered by the improvement location
permit, the Zoning Administrator shall cause an inspection of the  premises.
If this inspection reveals conformity with the development plan, the
requirements of Chapter 150, and all other applicable requirements of this
Code, then a certificate of occupancy may be issued.



L.   Temporary certificate



A temporary certificate of occupancy may be issued by the Zoning
administrator after application has been made for completed portions of a
plan which has been approved as a conditional use, provided that a
certificate of occupancy is required upon completion of the total plan (see
division (L) above).



M.   Change of use



No change shall be made in the use of land or in the use of any building or
part thereof, now or hereafter erected, reconstructed, or structurally
altered, without an improvement location permit having been issued. No such
permit shall be issued to make a use change unless it is in conformity with
the provisions of this Code.



N.   Improvement location permits filed for record



A record of all improvement location permits and certificates of occupancy
shall be kept on file in the office of the Zoning Administrator and copies
shall be furnished, upon written request.



O.   State plan approval

its successor.



P.   Time limit



Work shall be commenced within six months of the date of issuance of such

extension of time.



Q.   Compliance with erosion control



The Zoning Administrator shall require that, for those sites meeting the
standards established by the state, the applicant shall follow erosion
control requirements from the Department of Natural Resources.



R.   Temporary improvement location permit



A temporary improvement location permit may be issued by the Zoning
Administrator after application has been made for a temporary use authorized
by this Code (see Section 155.062)



S.   Issuance of permits



Any permits authorized by the City, including but not limited to improvement
location permits, permitting the erection, alteration or relocation of
structures and other improvements within the City, shall be issued only if,
in addition to satisfying the requirements of this Code the proposed street
right-of-way as set forth in the thoroughfare plan will be protected from
encroachment. In this instance, the proposed street right-of-way lines will
be considered as the front lines of lots and tracts bordering each  street,
subject to building setback lines as set forth in Section 155.034.



T.   Erroneously issued permits



The issuance of an improvement location permit and/or a certificate of
occupancy in no way validates such a permit or certificate in the event that
same is erroneously issued or does not comply with applicable law and this
Code of ordinances.



U.   Technical Review Committee



The Zoning Administrator shall request advice and a report to the Plan
Commission from the Technical Review Committee on development plans,

uses that he/she may determine necessary for their review.

Written commitments may be requested by the Plan Commission, or interested
parties that were entitled to receive notice per Section 155.078 of the
Zoning Code.  By permitting or requiring written commitments, the Plan
Commission does not obligate itself to approve or deny may request.  The
acceptance or approval of written commitments does not affect the validity of
any covenant, easement, equitable servitude, or other land use restrictions
created in accordance with law.



A.  Procedures



   1.   Written commitments are required by the Plan Commission, for
recommendation to the Council, as related to annexation requests.

to the Administrator a minimum of 10 days prior to the date of the Plan
Commission hearing.  Written commitments are required to be submitted in the
form supplied by the Administrator.



   3.   Written commitments shall be recorded in the office of the
county recorder and take effect upon approval of the proposal.  An
unrecorded commitment is binding on the owner of the parcel.  An unrecorded
commitment is binding on a subsequent owner of the parcel or a person
acquiring an interest in the parcel only if the subsequent owner or person
acquiring the interest has actual notice of the commitment.



B.  Enforcement



   1.   Written commitments shall be binding on the owner, subsequent
owners of the real estate and other persons acquiring an interest therein.

to a depth of two (2) ownerships, but not exceeding six hundred sixty (660)
feet from the perimeter of the real estate within the area included in the
petition who were not petitioners for the rezoning or approval.  Owners of
real estate entirely located outside Hancock County are not included,
however.  The identity of owners shall be determined from the records in the
offices of the Township Assessors of Hancock County which list the current
owners of record.  (This paragraph defines the category of persons entitled
to receive personal notice of the rezoning or approval under the rules in
force at the time the commitment was made); and



      c.   Any person, party, neighborhood association, or entity
who demonstrates to the Plan Commission an interest in being a party to the
written commitments.



C.  Modification or termination



   1.   Written commitments may be modified or terminated by a decision
of the Plan Commission made at a public hearing after proper notice has been
given.  A request to modify or terminate commitments made during a land use
hearing must be made in writing to the Administrator, to be submitted for
hearing on the next available agenda, after proper notice has been given.



   2.   The Plan Commission may consider a modification of written
commitments under the following circumstances:



      a.   Circumstances have substantially changed related to the
proposed use of land subject to the previous written commitments, or the
Comprehensive Plan recommendations for the area have changed.



      b.   The majority ownership of the project, parcel, or area
has changed.



   3.   A written commitment automatically terminates if after the
adoption of the proposal, if:



      a.   The zone map applicable to the parcel is changed, or



      b.   The parcel is designated as a planned unit development
district.

155.093  VARIANCES; CONDITIONAL USES; APPEALS TO BOARD; HEARINGS; AND
FINDINGS OF FACT



A.   Variances of use from term of Zoning Code



The Board shall approve or deny variances of use from the terms of the Zoning
Code.  In approving variances, the Board of Zoning Appeals may attach such
conditions to the variances as it deems necessary to assure compliance with
the purpose of the Zoning Ordinance.  If the conditions of the variance are
not completely and continuously adhered to after the granting of the
variance, the variance shall automatically become null and void upon notice
to the property owner from the Board of Zoning Appeals. A variance may be
approved under this section only upon a determination in writing that:



   1.   The approval will not be injurious to the public health,
safety, morals, and general welfare of the community;



   2.   The use and value of the area adjacent to the property included
in the variance will not be affected in a substantially adverse manner;



   3.   The need for the variance arises from some condition peculiar
to the property involved;



   4.   The strict application of the term of the Zoning Code will
constitute an unnecessary hardship if applied to the property for which the
variance is sought; and



   5.   The approval does not interfere substantially with the
comprehensive plan adopted under the I.C. 36-7-4-500 et seq.



B.   Variances from development standards of Zoning Code



The Board of Zoning Appeals shall approve or deny variances  from  the
development standards  (such as height, bulk, or area) of the Zoning Code,
unless already heard by the Plan Commission during the platting process. In
approving variances, the Board of Zoning Appeals may attach such conditions
to the variances as it deems necessary to assure compliance with the purpose
of the Zoning Ordinance.  If the conditions of the variance are not
completely and continuously adhered to after the granting of the variance,
the variance shall automatically become null and void upon notice to the
property owner from the Board of Zoning Appeals.  A variance may be approved
under this section only upon a determination in writing that:



   1.   The approval will not be injurious to the public health,
safety, morals, and general welfare of the community;



   2.   The use and value of the area adjacent to the property included
in the variance will not be affected in a substantially adverse manner;



   3.   The strict application of the terms of the Zoning Code will
result in practical difficulties in the use of the property;



   4.   There are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or
conditions applicable to the property or to the intended use that do not
apply generally to the other property or class of use in the same vicinity
and district.



C.   Conditional Uses



The Board shall approve or deny all conditional uses, in accordance with
Section 155.060, but only in the class of cases specified in the Zoning
Code.  In approving Conditional Uses, the Board of Zoning Appeals may attach
such conditions as it deems necessary to assure compliance with the purpose
of this ordinance.  If the conditions of the Conditional Use are not
completely and continuously adhered to after the granting of the Conditional
Use, the Conditional Use shall become null and void upon notice to the
property owner from the Board of Zoning Appeals.



D.   Appeals to board; grounds; transmission of record; disposition



   1.   An appeal filed with the Board shall specify the grounds of the
appeal and shall be filed within such time and on such form as may be
prescribed by the Board by rule.



   2.   The Zoning Administrator, administrative board, or other body
from whom the appeal is taken shall, on the request of the Board of Zoning
Appeals, transmit to it all documents, plans, and papers constituting the
record of the action from which an appeal was taken.



   3.   Certified copies of the documents, plans, and papers
constituting the record may be transmitted for purposes of division (2).



   4.   Upon appeal the Board may reverse, affirm or modify the order,
requirement, decision, or determination appealed from.  For this purpose,
the Board has all the powers of the official, officer, board, or body from
which the appeal is taken.



   5.   The Board shall make a decision on any matter that it is
required to hear under I.C. 36-7-4-900 et. seq. either:



      a.   At the meeting at which that matter is first presented; or



      b.   At the conclusion of the hearing on that matter, if it is
continued.



   6.   Within five days after making any decision under the I.C.
37-7-4-900 et. seq., the Board of Zoning Appeals shall file in the office of
the Board a copy of its decision.



E.   Hearing of appeals, exceptions, uses, temporary uses, and variances
notice; costs appearances.

administrative appeals, conditional uses, and variances.



   2.   Public notice in accordance with I.C. 5-3-1-2 and I.C. 5-3-1-4
and due notice to interested parties shall be given by the applicant at least
15 days before the date set for the hearing.



   3.   The party taking the appeal, or applying for the conditional
use, temporary use, or variance shall be required to assume the cost of
public notice and due notice to interested parties.  At the hearing, each
party may appear in person, or by representative.



   4.   The Board shall, by rule, determine who are interested parties,
how notice is to be given and who is required to give that notice.



   5.   Persons may appear before the Board at the hearing and present
evidence in support of or in opposition to the granting of a variance or the
determination of any other matter.



   6.   A person may not communicate with any member of the Board
before the hearing with intent to influence the member's action on a matter
pending before the Board.  Not less than five days before the hearing,
however, the Plan Commission staff, may file with the Board a written report
setting forth any facts or opinions relating to the matter.



   7.   The Board may require any party adverse to any pending Petition
to enter a written appearance specifying the party name and address. If the
written appearance is entered more than four days before the hearing, the
Board may also require the petitioner to furnish each adverse party with a
copy of the petition and a plot plan of the property involved.



F.   Findings of fact



Where a request for a variance from this zoning Code is sought, not only
shall the written determinations be set out as required, but findings of fact
which support these determinations shall be set out also.  The Board shall
specify by factual findings or by a statement of reason, the basis for denial
of a variance requested by a petitioner.

violations shall be paid to the Zoning Administrator, who shall render to the
person making the payment a receipt stating the amount and purpose for which
the fine has been paid, a duplicate of which shall be made a part of the
records of the Commission.  All fines thus received shall be deposited with
the City of Greenfield Clerk Treasurer.



E.   Citation for civil zoning violations



   1.   The Zoning Administrator or his duly authorized designees may

the legal owner, the contract vendee, or any person or entity with a
possessory interest in the real estate upon which the violation occurs.  The
citation may be served by personal service, by certified mail, by First Class
U.S. Mail, or by placement in a conspicuous place on the property where the
violation occurs and shall serve as notice to a person that he has committed
a civil zoning violation.



   2.   No citation shall be issued unless the person who commits a
civil zoning violation or the legal owner, the contract vendee, or any person
or entity with a possessory interest in the real estate upon which the
violation occurs has been issued a warning ticket not less than fourteen (14)
days before the issuance of the citation to allow said person to correct the

violation is liable for the court costs and fees, including attorney’s
fees.  No cost shall be assessed against the designated enforcement entity
in any such action.

to perform any duty, is a violation; any person held liable by a court of
competent jurisdiction for such violation shall be fined not more than Two
Thousand Five Hundred Dollars ($2,500) for each such violation, act, or
omission.

lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations.  All costs and attorney's
fees connected therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible.

§ 156.01  HISTORIC BOARD OF REVIEW.



   (A)   There is established the Historic Board of Review of the city,
hereinafter referred to as the Historic Board.  The Historic Board shall
consist of five voting members.  The voting members shall be appointed by
the Mayor of the city, subject to the approval of the Common Council of the
city.



   Voting members shall be residents of the city who are interested in the
preservation and development of historic areas or districts.  In addition,
at least one member shall be a property owner or shareholder of a property
owner of real estate located within the Historic District.  Voting members
shall serve for a term of three years; however, the initial terms of members
shall be one member for one year; two members for two years; and two members
for three years in order for the terms to be staggered.  After the initial
appointment, no member shall serve more than two consecutive terms without a
three-year layout.  In the event any member shall no longer qualify because
of residency or other requirements, that member shall resign when the
disqualification occurs.  Vacancies shall be filled in the same manner as
the appointment and only for the unexpired term of the vacant member.



   (B)   The Mayor may, with the approval of the Common Council,
appoint advisory members to the Historic Board as the Mayor considers
appropriate.



   (C)   Members of the Historic Board shall serve without compensation
but may be paid for reasonable expenses incurred in the performance of their
duties.



   (D)   The Historic Board shall elect from its membership a Chairman
and a Vice-Chairman, who shall serve for one year and who may be reelected. 
The Chairman shall preside over the Historic Board and shall have the right
to vote.  In the absence or disability of the Chairman, the Vice-Chairman
shall perform the duties of the Chairman. The Building Inspector shall serve
as Secretary of the Historic Board.  The Historic Board shall adopt rules
for the transaction of its business not inconsistent with this code.  The
rules must include the time and place of regular meetings and a procedure for
the calling of special meetings.  All meetings of the Historic Board must be
open to the public and a public record shall be kept of the Historic Board's
resolutions, proceedings, and actions.



   (E)   The Historic Board shall hold regular meetings, at least
monthly, except when it has no business pending.



(Ord. 1984-19, passed 10-25-84)



§ 156.02  HISTORIC PRESERVATION OFFICER.



   The Building Inspector, who shall be the administrator, and his staff
shall provide such technical, administrative, and clerical assistance as
required by the Historic Board of Review.



(Ord. 1984-19, passed 10-25-84)



§ 156.03  POWERS AND DUTIES OF HISTORIC BOARD.



   (A)   The Historic Board shall be concerned with those elements of
development, redevelopment, rehabilitation, and preservation that affect
visual quality in an historic district, and with controlling signage. 
However, the Historic Board may not consider details of design, interior
arrangements, or building features, if those details, arrangements, or
features are not subject to public view, and may not make any requirement
except for the purpose of preventing development, alteration, or demolition
in the historic district obviously incongruous with the historic district.



   (B)   The Historic Board shall conduct a survey to identify historic
buildings, structures, and places located within the city.  However, neither
the survey nor any other action of the Historic Board shall affect any
property not located within the city limits.



   (C)   Based on its survey, the Historic Board shall submit to the
Common Council of the city a map describing the boundaries of an historic
district or historic districts. A district may be limited to the boundaries
of a property containing a single building, structure, or site.  The map may
divide a district into primary and secondary areas.  All of any district
created by the provisions of this code shall be considered a primary area if
the map makes no contrary designation.



   (D)   The Historic Board shall also classify and designate on the
map all buildings and structures within each historic district described on
the map.  Buildings and structures shall be classified as historic or
nonhistoric, in the following manner:



      (1)   Historic buildings and structures must possess
identified historic or architectural merit of a degree warranting their
preservation.  They may be further classified as:



         (a)   Outstanding;



         (b)   Notable;



         (c)   Contributing; or



         (d)   Noncontributing.



   In lieu of the further classifications set forth in divisions (a)
through (d) above, the Historic Board may devise its own system of further
classification of historic buildings and structures.



      (2)   Nonhistoric:  those buildings and structures not
classified on the map as historic.



(Ord. 1984-19, passed 10-25-84; Am. Ord. 1985-31, passed 12-12-85)



§ 156.04  APPROVAL BY COMMON COUNCIL REQUIRED.



   The map setting forth the historic district boundaries and building
classifications must be submitted to, and approved in an ordinance by the
Common Council before the historic district is established and the building
classifications take effect.



(Ord. 1984-19, passed 10-25-84)



§ 156.05  COURTHOUSE SQUARE HISTORIC DISTRICT.



   (A)   The Courthouse Square Historic District is established. 
Generally, this district encompasses Main Street from Pennsylvania to East
Streets and State  and  East  Streets from South  Street  to  North
Street; specifically, this district is delineated on a map, identified as Map
1, which is made a part of this chapter by reference.  The historic
resources in the Courthouse Square Historical District have been recorded in
the “Hancock County Interim Report” as part of the Indiana Sites and
Structures Inventory, June, 1983.  Another report, “Revitalization Plan
for Greenfield, Indiana,” November, 1983, prepared by Howard Needles Tammen

§ 156.07  RELATIONSHIP TO ZONING DISTRICTS.



   The historic district regulations provided in this chapter are intended
to preserve and protect the historic, architecturally worthy buildings,
structures, sites, monuments, streetscapes, squares, and neighborhoods of the
historic districts. Zoning districts lying within the boundaries of the
historic district are subject to the regulations for both the zoning district

§ 156.09  APPLICATION FOR CERTIFICATE OF APPROPRIATENESS.



   Application for a Certificate of Appropriateness may be made in the
office of the Building Inspector on forms provided by the Historic Board of
Review as provided for in § 156.19.  Detailed drawings, plans, or
specifications are not required.  However, to the extent reasonably required
for the Historic Board to make a decision, each application must be
accompanied by sketches, drawings, photographs, descriptions, or other
information showing the proposed exterior alterations, additions, changes, or
new construction.



(Ord. 1984-19, passed 10-25-84)



§ 156.10  ACTION ON APPLICATIONS FOR CERTIFICATES OF APPROPRIATENESS.



   (A)   The Historic Board of Review may advise and make
recommendations to the applicant before acting on an application for a
Certificate of Appropriateness.



   (B)   If an application for a Certificate of Appropriateness:



      (1)   Is approved by the Board; or



      (2)   Is not acted on by the Board within 30 days after it is
filed, a Certificate of Appropriateness shall be issued by the Building
Inspector.  If the Certificate is issued, the application shall be processed
in the same manner as applications for building or demolition permits
required by the city, if any, are processed.  If no building or demolition
permits are required by the city, the applicant may proceed with the work
authorized by the Certificate.



   (C)   If the Historic Board denies an application for a Certificate
of Appropriateness within 30 days after it is filed, the Certificate may not
be issued. The Historic Board must state its reasons for the denial, in
writing, and must advise the applicant.  An application that has been denied
may not be processed as an application for a building or demolition permit
and does not authorize any work by the applicant.



   (D)   The Historic Board may grant an extension of the 30-day limit
prescribed by divisions (B) and (C) above if the applicant agrees to it.



   (E)   A Certificate of Appropriateness permit shall be deemed to
authorize the particular changes reflected on the permit. The permit will
expire if, for any reason, the change has not commenced within one year, and
the construction or alteration completed within 12 months after commencement
of the work.



   (F)   Certificates of Appropriateness shall be granted if the
Historic Board determines that the proposed action is not obviously
incongruous with the historic district and shall not be granted if the
proposed action is obviously incongruous with the historic district. In
determining whether a particular proposal is obviously incongruous with the
historic district, the Historic Board shall take into account the purposes of
this chapter, the visual compatibility standards contained in this chapter,
the historic and architectural significance of the structure and the effect
of the proposed change in diminishing or enhancing the significance, the
effect of the proposed change on the streetscape, the effect of the proposed
change on surrounding structures, and the effect of the proposed change on
the district as a whole.  The Historic Board shall act in a manner which
preserves the visual aspects of the architectural and historic character of
the district by assuring that obviously incongruous changes are not allowed.

   (A)   An historic building or structure, or any part of or
appurtenance to such a building or structure, including stone walls, fences,
light fixtures, steps, paving, and signs, may be moved, reconstructed,
altered, or maintained only in a manner that will preserve the historical and
architectural character of the building, structure, or appurtenance.

preservation of these buildings.



   (B)   If a property owner shows that an historic building is
incapable of earning an economic return on its value, as appraised by a
qualified real estate appraiser, and the Historic Board of Review fails to
approve the issuance of a Certificate of Appropriateness, the building may be
demolished.  However, before a demolition permit is issued or demolition
proceeds, notice of proposed demolition must be given for a period fixed by
the Historic Board, based on the Board's classification on the approved map,
but not less than 60 days nor more than one year. Notice must be posted on
the premises of the building proposed for demolition in a location clearly
visible from the street.  In addition, notice must be published in
accordance with I.C. 36-7-11-14.



   (C)   The Historic Board may approve a Certificate of
Appropriateness at any time during the notice period under division (B)
above.  If the Certificate is approved, a permit for demolition shall be
issued without further delay and demolition may proceed.

buildings.



   (G)   Whenever any portion thereof has wrecked, warped, buckled, or
settled to such an extent that walls or other structural portions have
materially less resistance to winds or earthquakes than is required in the
case of similar new construction.



   (H)   Whenever the building or structure, or any portion thereof,
because of dilapidation, deterioration, or decay; faulty construction; the
removal, movement, or instability of any portion of the ground necessary for

portion thereof, is manifestly unsafe for the purpose for which it is being
used.

foundation, shows 33% or more damage or deterioration of its supporting
member or members, or 50% damage or deterioration of its non-supporting
members, enclosing or outside walls or coverings.

erected in accordance with all applicable laws and ordinances has in any
non-supporting part, member, or portion less than 66% of the strength,
fire-resisting qualities or characteristics, or weather-resisting qualities
or characteristics required by law in the case of a newly constructed
building of like area, height, and occupancy in the same location.



   (O)   Whenever a building or structure, used or intended to be used
for dwelling purposes, because of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation,
decay, damage, faulty construction or arrangement, inadequate light, air or
sanitation facilities, or otherwise, is determined by the Building
Commissioner to be unsanitary, unfit for human habitation, or in such a
condition that is likely to cause sickness or disease.



   (P)   Whenever any building or structure, because of obsolescence,
dilapidated condition, deterioration, damage, inadequate exits, lack of
sufficient fire-resistive construction is determined by the Fire Chief to be

site after the demolition or destruction of the building or structure or
whenever any building or structure is abandoned for a period in excess of six
