§ 10.10  ERRORS AND OMISSIONS.



   If a manifest error is discovered, consisting of the misspelling of any
words; the omission of any word or words necessary to express the intention
of the provisions affected; the use of a word or words to which no meaning
can be attached; or the use of a word or words when another word or words was
clearly intended to express such intent, such spelling shall be corrected and

provided.



§ 10.17  ORDINANCES WHICH AMEND OR SUPPLEMENT CODE.

CAPITAL ASSET POLICY



§ 40.20  GENERAL INFORMATION.



   (A)   The purpose of this policy is to establish a procedure for the
classification of capital assets, including fixed assets and infrastructure,
for accuracy in financial reporting through the state Board of Accounts and
to fix the minimum value of capital assets to be reported on the city's
financial reports. This issuance of a policy document is related to the
implementation of a new reporting model, Governmental Accounting Standards
Board Statement 34. The capital asset threshold is $5,000. An asset with a
value under $5,000 shall be expenced in the year of purchase. The
infrastructure portion of this policy is effective January 1, 2006.



   (B)   The city has established a Capital Asset Policy in order to
provide a higher degree of control over its considerable investment in
capital assets, and to be able to demonstrate accountability to its various
constituencies.



   (C)   The purpose of establishing a Capital Policy is fivefold:



      (1)   To safeguard the investments of the citizens of Union
City;



      (2)   To fix responsibility for the custody of equipment;

acquisition, maintenance and retirement policies;



      (4)   To provide data for financial reporting; and



      (5)   To demonstrate appropriate stewardship responsibility
for public assets.



   (D)   This policy is intended to classify capital assets, including
fixed assets and infrastructure, for accuracy in financial reporting through
the Indiana State Board of Accounts. For purposes of this subchapter, capital
assets do not include data processing programs, software programming, or
computer operations procedures.

   (B)   Assets that are not required to be capitalized (i.e. items

construction of a larger building or equipment unit which may be put together
to form larger units costing more than the prescribed limits will be charged
to capital assets even though the cost of individual items is less than such
units.



      (3)   Cabinets, shelving, bookcases, and similar items, added
subsequent to original construction, which are custom made for a specific
place and adaptable elsewhere, will be capitalized.

NEPOTISM AND CONTRACTING WITH A UNIT BY A RELATIVE



§ 40.45  FINDINGS.



   (A)   The city finds that it is necessary and desirous to adopt a
policy of conduct with regard to nepotism in the employment with the city,
and in contracting with the city, in order to continue to be able to provide
local government services to its residents and to comply with the new laws
effective July 1, 2012, known as IC 36-1-20.2 and IC 36-1-21, respectively.

specifically allow a unit to adopt requirements that are “more stringent or

   (C)   The city further finds that a single member of the legislative
body cannot act for the body to make work assignments, compensation,
grievances, advancement or a performance evaluation without prior authority
of a majority of the body, and therefore, without such authority by the

evaluation without prior authority of a majority of the body, when a statute
provides that a majority is needed to act, and therefore, without such
authority by the majority, the single member will not be in the direct line
of supervision (see IC 36-4-9).

October 16, 1973 (38 CFR 20758) and any subsequent revisions subject to
approval by the city.  In the event that no special manhole has been
required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest
downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building
sewer is connected.  Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted
methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to
determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and property.  (The
particular analyses involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of
all outfalls of a premise is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples
should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solids analyses
are obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls where pH's are

      (1)   The city, by its elected or appointed officials,
including the code enforcement officer and/or any Utility Department 
employee duly appointed by Resolution of Council, may undertake such
inspection or tests as it deems necessary and appropriate to determine the
condition of any sewer lateral. Any such inspection or test that requires a
worker enter onto a user’s property may only take place after notice has
been given, in writing, hand delivered or mailed to the address of the
property in question, at least ten business days in advance. Tests or
inspections shall be permitted only on weekdays, between the hours of 8:00
a.m. and 3:00 p.m., or by appointment.



      (2)   The owner of the affected property shall make all areas
to be tested or inspected available to the designated inspectors.



      (3)   (a)   If, in the sole opinion of the inspector, any
illegal storm water inflow connections are found, or the sewer lateral is
determined to be in unsatisfactory condition, the sewer lateral shall be
repaired or replaced by the owner of the property, at the owner's expense.
Such repairs or replacement must be commenced within 90 days of the date the
city notifies the owner of the deficiency, in writing.



         (b)   1.   A sewer lateral cleanout is required for
any inspection. Cleanouts shall be of such condition that allow the free and
unobstructed entry of an inspection camera into the sanitary lateral in
either direction. If the property has no existing usable cleanout, one must
be installed prior to the inspection.



            2.   Cleanout specifications:



               a.   Must use Schedule 40 pipe and fittings;



               b.   Must be a two-way cleanout within 30
inches of the structure, with additional cleanouts for every 100 feet of
lateral;



               c.   Fernco or other equivalent rubber boot
couplings;



               d.   #11 or #8 gravel bedding around tap,
repair areas, and anywhere the pipe extends above the bottom of the trench;



               e.   Minimum fall on pipe shall be ¼ inch
per foot;



               f.   Taps into manholes must be grouted
inside and out around laterals; and



               g.   All contractors must observe OSHA
standards.



      (4)   The city shall re-inspect the property upon notice from
the property owner that the deficiency has been repaired, or 120 days after
the notice of the deficiency was first sent, whichever first occurs.



      (5)   If the owner of the property fails to make such repairs
or replacement, within the times specified in this chapter, the city shall be
authorized and permitted to make such repairs or replacements and to assess
the owner of the property for the cost thereof, plus 10% for administrative
costs. Such assessment shall be made in accordance with the Indiana Code, and
shall constitute a lien against the property until paid.



   (D)   Mandatory inspection prior to sale or change in water billing.



      (1)   A sanitary lateral clearance certificate shall be
required upon the sale or transfer of ownership or change in water billing.



      (2)   The city shall as a mandatory condition prior to the
issuance of a sanitary lateral clearance certificate by the city, require a
sanitary lateral inspection. The city Wastewater Department will perform the
inspection at no cost to the property owner for the camera work.
Alternatively, the applicant may contract a plumber or other qualified
contractor to inspect and appropriately test for any illegal storm water
inflow connections into the sewer lateral on the affected property and
provide the results of the inspection and tests to the city on DVD or flash
drive. All sewer laterals shall be televised over their entire length, unless
the lateral was previously televised within the last five years and found to
be in satisfactory condition. The plumber or other contractor performing such
tests shall notify the city at least three business days in advance of
performing the test, to give the city the opportunity to have a
representative present during testing. The city representative/inspector is
empowered to approve the test as performed, or to require additional testing.



      (3)   The plumber or other qualified contractor performing the
tests shall certify the results in writing to the city. If the test results
indicate any illegal storm water inflow connection to the sewer lateral,
and/or if the sewer lateral is found to be in such condition that the
inspector, in his or her sole discretion, deems it to be unsatisfactory, then
the applicant shall not be given a certificate until such illegal connection
is removed and/or the unsatisfactory condition has been remedied to the
satisfaction of city officials.



      (4)   In the event a sewer lateral is found to be in an
unsatisfactory condition, and/or improper connections are found, the owner
will be sent a notice to repair the lateral or remedy the conditions within
90 days. In the event the applicant fails to remedy such unsatisfactory
condition within 90 days, the city may, in its sole discretion:



         (a)   Disconnect the water supply; and



         (b)   Undertake such repairs or replacement of the sewer
lateral as may be necessary to remedy the unsatisfactory situation or remove
improper connections. The cost of such repairs to become a lein upon the
property.

RATES AND CHARGES



§ 51.50  CHARGES ESTABLISHED FOR USER CLASSES.



   Every person whose premises are served by said sewage works shall be
charged for the services provided.  These charges are established for each
user class, as defined, in order that the sewage works shall recover, from
each user and user class, revenue which is proportional to its use of the
treatment works in terms of volume and load.  User charges are levied to
defray the cost of operation and maintenance (including replacement) of the
treatment works.  User charges shall be uniform in magnitude within a user
class.



   (A)   User charges are subject to the rules and regulations adopted
by the United States Environmental Protection Agency, published in the
Federal Register September 27, 1978 (43 CFR 44022).  Replacement costs,
which are recovered through the system of user charges, shall be based upon
the expected useful life of the sewage works equipment.



   (B)   The various classes of users of the treatment works for the
purposes of this chapter shall be as follows:



      Class I    Residential



            Commercial



            Governmental



            Institutional

§ 51.51  SCHEDULE OF RATES AND CHARGES.



   For the use of and the services rendered by sewage works, rates and
charges shall be collected from the owners of each and every lot, parcel of
real estate, or building that is connected with the city sanitary system or
otherwise discharges sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water, or other
liquids, either directly or indirectly, into the sanitary sewage system of
the city, which rates and charges are payable as hereinafter provided and
shall be in an amount determinable as follows:



   (A)   The sewage rates and charges shall be based on the quantity of
water used on or in the property or premises subject to such rates and
charges, as the same may be measured by the water meter there in use, plus a
base charge based on the size of the water meter installed, except as herein
otherwise provided.  For the purpose of billing and collecting the charges
for sewage service, the water meters shall be read monthly and the users
shall be billed each month (or period equaling a month).  The rates and
charges shall be determined by the following usage schedule:




All Users




      (1)   Treatment rate per 100 cubic feet of usage per month is
$5.16.

water users, the monthly charge shall be as follows:



                  Rate Per Month



   Single-family residence/unit      $84.08



   (C)   For residential users of the sewage works for whom accurate
readings are not available, the monthly charge shall be as set out in
division (B) of this section; however, the user may be charged an additional
amount for usage when accurate meter readings become available and the charge
that would have been imposed under § 51.53 for the relevant period is
greater than that which was charged under this section. This additional
charge shall be in an amount that is equal to the difference between the
amount established by the basic rate schedule set out in division (B) of this
section and the amount that the user would have paid had the meter reading
been available on a timely basis.



   (D)   Non-residential unmetered users shall be charged a rate based
upon estimated monthly usage to be determined by the Board of Public Works
and Safety on a case by case basis.



   (E)   In order to recover the cost of monitoring industrial wastes,
the city shall charge the user the actual cost per sample.  This charge
shall be reviewed on the same basis as all other rates and charges in this
chapter.

§ 51.52  ALLOWANCES FOR WATER NOT ENTERING SEWER SYSTEM AND OTHER SPECIAL
SITUATIONS.



   The quantity of water discharged into the sanitary sewer system and
obtained from sources other than the utility that serves the city shall be
determined by the city in such manner as the city shall reasonably elect, and
the sewage service shall be billed at the above appropriate rates; except, as
is hereinafter provided in this section, the city may make proper allowances
in determining the sewage bill for quantities of water shown on the records
to be consumed, but which are also shown to the satisfaction of the city that
such quantities do not enter the sanitary sewer system.



   (A)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate, or building
discharging sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water, or other liquids into
the city's sanitary sewer system, either directly or indirectly, is not a
user of water supplied by the water utility serving the city and the water
used thereon or therein is not measured by a water meter, or is measured by a
water meter not acceptable to the city, then the amount of water used shall
be otherwise measured or determined by the city.  In order to ascertain the
rate of charge provided in this chapter, the owner or other interested party
shall, at his expense, install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric
measuring devices or any adequate and approved method of measurement
acceptable to the city for the determination of sewage discharge.



   (B)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate, or building
discharging sanitary sewage, industrial wastes, water, or other liquids into
the city's sanitary sewer system, either directly or indirectly, is a user of
water supplied by the water utility serving the city, and in addition, is a
user of water from another source which is not measured by a water meter or
is measured by a meter not acceptable to the city, then the amount of water
used shall be otherwise measured or determined by the city.  In order to
ascertain the rates or charges, the owner or other interested parties shall,
at his expense, install and maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring
devices or any adequate and approved method of measurement acceptable to the
city for the determination of sewage discharge.



   (C)   In the event two or more residential lots, parcels of real
estate, or buildings discharging sanitary sewage, water or other liquids into
the city's sanitary sewer system, either directly or indirectly, are users of
water and the quantity of water is measured by a single water meter, then in
each such case, for billing purposes, the quantity of water used shall be
averaged for each user and the base charge and the flow rates and charges
shall apply to each of the number of residential lots, parcels of real
estate, or buildings served through the single water meter.



   (D)   In the event two or more dwelling units such as mobile homes,
apartments, or housekeeping rooms discharging sanitary sewage, water, or
other liquids into the city's sanitary sewer system, either directly or
indirectly, are users of water and the quantity of water is measured by a
single water meter, then in such case, billing shall be for a single service
in the manner set out elsewhere herein, except that the minimum bill shall
not be less than the number of such dwelling units times the base rate per
month of $12.55.  In the case of mobile home courts, the number of dwelling
units shall be computed and interpreted as the total number of mobile home
spaces available for rent plus any other dwelling units served through the
meter.  A dwelling unit shall be interpreted as a room or rooms or any other
space or spaces in which cooking facilities are provided.



   (E)   In the event a lot, parcel of real estate, or building
discharges sanitary sewage, industrial waste, water, or other liquids into
the city's sanitary sewer system, either directly or indirectly, and uses
water in excess of 25,000 gallons per month, and it can be shown to the
satisfaction of the city that a portion of water as measured by the water
meter or meters does not and cannot enter the sanitary sewage system, then
the owner or other interested party shall, at his expense, install and
maintain meters, weirs, volumetric measuring devices, or any adequate and
approved method of measurement acceptable to the city for the determination
of sewage discharge.

§ 51.53  DETERMINATION OF SURCHARGES.



   In order that the rates and charges may be justly and equitably
adjusted to the service rendered to users, the city shall base its charges
not only on the volume, but also on strength and character of the
stronger-than-normal domestic sewage and shall require the user to determine
the strength and content of all sewage and wastes discharge, either directly
or indirectly into the sanitary sewage system, in such manner and by such
method as the city may deem practicable in the light of the conditions and
attending circumstances of the case, in order to determine the proper
charge.  The user shall furnish a central sampling point available to the
city at all times.



   (A)   Normal sewage domestic waste strength should not exceed a
biochemical oxygen demand of 300 milligrams per liter of fluid or suspended
solids in excess of 300 milligrams per liter of fluid.  Additional charges
for treating stronger-than-normal domestic waste shall be made on the
following basis:



      (1)   Rate surcharge based upon suspended solids.  There
shall be an additional charge per pound of suspended solids received in
excess of 300 milligrams per liter of fluid:



   Rate per pound in excess



   $0.30



      (2)   Rate surcharge based upon BOD.  There shall be an
additional charge per pound of biochemical oxygen demand for BOD received in
excess of 300 milligrams per liter of fluid.



   Rate per pound in excess



   $0.30



   (B)   The determination of suspended solids and five-day biochemical
oxygen demand contained in the waste shall be in accordance with the latest
copy of "Standards Methods for the Examination of Water, Sewage and
Industrial Wastes", as written by the American Public Health Association, the
American Water Works Association and the Water Pollution Control Federation,
and in conformance with "Guidelines Establishing Test Procedures for Analysis
of Pollutants", Regulation CFR Part 136, published in the Federal Register on
October 16, 1973.

§ 51.54  BILLING PROCEDURES.



   Such rates and charges shall be prepared, billed, and collected by the
city in the manner provided by law and ordinance.



   (A)   The rates and charges for all users shall be prepared and
billed monthly.  At the end of each year, each user shall be given a notice
of the rates charged for operation, maintenance, and replacement for that
user for the next preceding year.



   (B)   The rates and charges may be billed to the tenant or tenants
occupying the properties served, unless otherwise requested in writing by the
owner, but such billing shall in no way relieve the owner from the liability
in the event payment is not made as herein required.  The owners of
properties served, which are occupied by a tenant or tenants, shall have the
right to examine the collection records of the city for the purpose of
determining whether bills have been paid by such tenant or tenants, provided
that such examination shall be made at the office at which said records are
kept and during the hours that such office is open for business.



   (C)   As is provided by statute, all rates and charges not paid when
due are hereby declared to be delinquent and a penalty of 10% of the amount
of the rates or charges shall thereupon attach thereto.  The time at which
such rates or charges shall be paid is now fixed at 15 days after the date of
mailing of the bill.

§ 51.55  REVIEW OF RATES.



   (A)   In order that the rates and charges for sewage services may
remain fair and equitable and be in proportion to the cost of providing
services to the various uses of user classes, the city shall cause study to
be made within a reasonable period of time following the first two years of
operation, following the date on which this section goes into effect.  Such
study shall include, but not be limited to, an analysis of the costs
associated with the treatment of excessive strength effluents from industrial
users, volume and delivery flow rate characteristics attributed to the
various users or user classes, the financial position of the sewage works,
and the adequacy of its revenue to provide reasonable funds for the operation
and maintenance, replacements, debt service requirements, and capital
improvements to the waste treatment systems.



   (B)   Thereafter, on a biennial basis, within a reasonable period of
time following the normal accounting period, the city shall cause a study to
be made for the purpose of reviewing the sufficiency of the revenues to
properly operate the wastewater treatment facility and all appurtenances
attached thereto; and maintaining proportionality among the user classes of
the rates and charges for sewer services.  Said studies shall be conducted
by officers or employees of the city, or by a firm of certified public
accountants, or a firm of consulting engineers which firms shall have
experience in such studies, or by such combination of officers, employees,
certified public accountants, or engineers as the city shall determine to be
best under the circumstances.

of the city’s sewer system, pumping stations, and sewage treatment works,
for the construction and use of house sewers and connections to the sewer
treatment works, for the construction and use of house sewers and connection
to the sewer system, and for the regulation, collection, rebating and
refunding of such rates and charges.  No free service shall be provided to
any user of the wastewater treatment facility. Any residence, commercial
building, or other structure which is vacant for more than four months shall
be charged a minimum sewer charge. Exemptions may be granted by the Board of
Public Works and Safety for sites being remodeled, improved or with special
circumstances. Property owners may apply to the Board of Public Works for an
exemption hearing by contacting the City Clerk. The decision of the Board of
Public Works shall be final.



   (B)   The city is hereby authorized to prohibit dumping of wastes
into the city’s sewer system which, in its discretion, are deemed harmful
to the operation of the sewage treatment works of the city, or to require
methods affecting pretreatment of said wastes to comply with the pretreatment
standards included in the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System
(NPDES) permit issued to the sewage works.



   (C)   The rules and regulations promulgated by the city, after
approval by the Board of Public Works shall, among other things, provide for
an appeal procedure whereby a user shall have the right to appeal a decision
of the administrator of the user charge to the Board of Public Works and that
any decision concerning user charges of the Board of Public Works may be
appealed to the circuit court of the county under the appeal procedures
provided for in the Indiana Administrative Adjudication Act.

§ 52.001  PURPOSE; OBJECTIVES.



   (A)   This chapter sets forth uniform requirements for direct and
indirect contributors into the wastewater collection and treatment system of
the city and enables the city to comply with all applicable state and federal
laws required by the Clean Water Act of 1977 and the General Pretreatment
Regulations (40 CFR, Part 403).



   (B)   The objectives of this chapter are:



      (1)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the
municipal wastewater system which will interfere with the operation of the
system or contaminate the resulting sludge;



      (2)   To prevent the introduction of pollutants into the
municipal wastewater system which will pass through the system, inadequately
treated, into receiving waters or the atmosphere or otherwise be incompatible
with the system;



      (3)   To improve the opportunity to recycle and reclaim
wastewaters and sludges from the system; and



      (4)   To provide for equitable distribution of the cost of the
municipal wastewater system.

usage for a specific term or other terms and conditions that would be
reasonable under the circumstances.

meter location. The curb stop and meter will be placed in a location to be
determined by the City Waterworks.



   (B)   The City Waterworks shall maintain water service lines from
the main to and including the curb stop.

leak in a private service line or fixture, the owner of such service pipe
shall be notified of the leak.  If the necessary repairs are not begun
promptly following notice and completed within a reasonable period of time,
the fixture attaching such service line with the main may be removed or water
service terminated at the option of the City Waterworks. In the alternative,
the City Waterworks may elect to make the necessary repairs and then charge
the owner with the reasonable and necessary cost of those repairs.



   (D)   When the property to be served is not adjacent to a water main
and it is necessary to cross public or private property to provide service,
the property owner requesting service shall be responsible for the
maintenance of the required line unless the City Waterworks agrees, in
writing, to accept the responsibility for the maintenance of the line.

protection of the meter and other equipment when a service line is connected
directly to hot water fixtures which may cause back pressure.

the City Waterworks, the water supplied shall be measured by a meter or
meters of standard manufacture, furnished and installed on the premises by
the City Waterworks in accordance with applicable standards of the City
Waterworks and any appropriate regulating agency having jurisdiction over the
City Waterworks.

months of June, July and August shall be based on the average water usage for
the previous months of January, February and March.



      (2)   In the event the water usage for said previous months of
January, February and March is greater than the water usage for said months

commercial or industrial purposes, the owner shall have the privilege of
separating the water service so that the residential portion of the premises
is served through a separate meter and, in such case, the water usage as
registered by the water meter serving such portion of the premises used for
residential purposes would quality under the sprinkling rate.



      (4)   In the event a domestic or residential user did not
reside at the present address in order to establish an average usage for
January, February and March, the domestic or residential user would not be
given the sprinkling rate as described above.

   (A)   (1)   Bills for water use will be rendered monthly and must
be paid in the office of the City Clerk-Treasurer. If a bill is not paid when
due, the user shall be considered delinquent in the payment of this bill. The
City Water Works may, at any time thereafter, terminate water service to the
premises occupied by the delinquent user within five days from the due date
stated on the bill. A $50 service fee will be charged at the close of the
business day stated on the bill as the delinquent disconnect date. If a user,
who is not the land owner, is considering entering into a payment agreement
with the City Water Works that would avoid the termination of service, the
land owner of the premises served shall be made a party to the agreement
before it is finalized.



      (2)   A penalty equal to  10% of the delinquent amount shall
be charged on any account that is 15 days delinquent.



   (B)   The rates and charges fixed in this chapter, as well as its
other provisions, shall be extended to and cover any premises that obtain
water service from the city following the enactment of this chapter, without
the necessity of any hearing or notice.



   (C)   If any service rate or charge established by this chapter is
not paid within 60 days after the notice of intent to disconnect, a statement
for the charge may be placed in the hands of the City Attorney, who shall
institute a civil action in the name of the City Waterworks to recover the
amount of the unpaid charges, reasonable and necessary attorney fees and
court costs, when the City Attorney, in the exercise of his or her
discretion, deems such an action likely to result in the payment of the
unpaid bill and charges.



   (D)   The city shall have no liability or responsibility to provide
water or sewage service to any residence or business within the city, where
there exists an outstanding water or sewage bill.



   (E)   Any over payment or under payment of water or sewage bills up
to and including $3 shall not be refunded or billed to the utility user at
the time of termination of service.

§ 53.25  APARTMENT BUILDINGS.



   The owner of any building with two or more apartments shall make the
meter deposit and be responsible for the payment of all water bills within
that building. If there is only one meter that serves two or more apartments,
the cost for the water provided to these apartments may be divided equally
between the apartments; however, dividing the water service between
apartments shall not be interpreted to shift the ultimate liability for the
water service from the owner of the building to the tenants.

bill, whether that water bill is incurred in the name of the owner or a
tenant occupying the property.



   (B)   Upon the written request of the landlord, the City Waterworks
shall mail the water bill to the tenant or tenants occupying the property
served; however, the billing of the water service to the tenant does not
relieve the owner of the liability for the water bill, if the tenant fails to
make the payment. The owners of property receiving water service shall have
the right to examine the collection records of the City Waterworks for the
purpose of determining whether the rates and charges made for water service
have been paid by the tenants occupying their property. The examination of
the records may be made in the office of the Clerk- Treasurer during business
hours.

   55.09    Procedure



§ 55.01  POLICY.



   It is the basic position of the city that public works facilities and
improvements, hereinafter defined as streets, curbs, alleys, walks, street
lights, storm sewers, sanitary sewers and water lines, shall be constructed
for the convenience, safety and benefit of the properties that said public
works facilities serve.  Further, the cost of constructing said public works
facilities shall be the primary responsibility of those property owners
receiving the benefit from such facilities.  These facilities shall be
constructed in accordance to city specifications.  It is not the policy of
the city to provide these public works facilities for any property or at any
location at no cost to the property owners receiving benefits from said
facilities.



(Res. 97-R4, passed 6-9-97)



§ 55.02  STREETS, CURBS AND ALLEYS.



   It is expected that each property owner and/or property developer
receiving the service and use of streets, curbs and alleys shall pay on a
prorate basis for the initial improvement or construction of these public
works facilities.  Once constructed and dedicated to the city, the city
shall be responsible for routine and periodic maintenance.  The city will
use Motor Vehicle Highway (MVH) revenue, Local Road and Street (LR&S)
revenue, or other funds or taxes for the maintenance and reconstruction of
streets, curbs and alleys, as available and allocated in an approved annual
budget.  The city may also elect to seek state or federal assistance for the
maintenance and/or reconstruction of such facilities when such funding
assistance may be available.



(Res. 97-R4, passed 6-9-97)



§ 55.03  SIDEWALKS.



   Construction of sidewalks shall be the responsibility of the abutting
property owners.  Furthermore, all property owners must be responsible for
the maintenance of the walks.  For new development projects, the developer
shall be responsible for cost and installation of sidewalks as may be
required.  The city, at its discretion, may elect to participate in the
reconstruction of sidewalks in residential areas where funds for such purpose
are available and such improvements are deemed by the city to be of benefit
to the city in general.



(Res. 97-R4, passed 6-9-97)



§ 55.04  STREET LIGHTS.



   The city will provide street lighting in a standard street lighting
style, as funds may be available and allocated in an approved annual
budget.  The city shall provide labor for the installation of street
lighting at no expense to the owner, provided that the owner pays the cost of
the fixtures and poles.  These shall be installed in the city's standard
poles with overhead wiring.  If any property owners desire to have
ornamental lighting in lieu of the standard lighting, they shall petition for
such improvement to the Board of Public Works and Safety, and if such
petition is granted, the property owners shall be required to pay the
increased cost of materials.



(Res. 97-R4, passed 6-9-97)



§ 55.05  STORM SEWERS.



   Storm sewers shall be designed and constructed to serve the watershed
area.  The cost of storm sewers shall be prorated over the benefitting
property owners in a manner consistent with Barrett Law or other assessment
procedures provided by state statute to the city.  The city may elect to
seek state or federal funding, when possible, to assist with these costs. 
For new development projects, the developer shall be responsible for the cost
and installation of storm drainage facilities as may be required.



(Res. 97-R4, passed 6-9-97)



§ 55.06  SANITARY SEWERS.



   Sanitary sewers shall be constructed or extended to serve
development.  The cost of sanitary sewers shall be prorated over the

§ 90.02  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR ANIMAL CARE AND TREATMENT.



   (A)   Every owner or keeper of an animal kept in the city shall see
that such animal:



      (1)   Is kept in a clean, sanitary and healthy manner and is
not confined so as to be forced to stand, sit or lie in its own excrement;
the person(s) responsible for animal(s) shall regularly and as often as
necessary to prevent odor or health and sanitation problems, maintain all
animal areas or areas of animal contact;

      (3)   Is protected against abuse, cruelty, neglect, torment,
overload, overwork, or any other mistreatment;



      (4)   Shall provide the reasonably necessary medical care
according to commonly accepted veterinary standards, in addition to the
required rabies vaccination which shall include recommended vaccinations as
required by accepted veterinary standards, and if diseased or injured, or
exhibiting symptoms of disease, receives proper care and is segregated from
other animals so as to prevent transmittal of the disease; and



      (5)   Is maintained in compliance with all applicable federal,
state and local laws and all regulations respecting animal care and control
as are adopted by the city Department of Public Safety and in effect from
time to time.



   (B)   It shall be unlawful for a person to beat, starve or otherwise
mistreat any animal in the city, or to fail to comply with any requirement of
division (A) of this section.



   (C)   It shall be unlawful to tether any animal by use of a choke
collar, or on any collar too small for the size and age of the animal, or by
any rope, chain, or cord directly attached to the animal's neck, or by a
leash less than 12 feet in length, or by any tether or leash without swivels
on both ends, or of such unreasonable weight as to prevent the animal from
moving about freely.



   (D)   It shall be unlawful for any animal to be tethered between the
hours of 11:00 p.m. and 6:00 a.m.; or to tether any un-sterilized dog for any
period of time unless the dog is in visual range of a competent adult who is
outside with the dog; or to tether or confine an animal at a vacant structure
or premises for any purpose or time when it is not monitored by a competent
adult who is present at the property for the duration of such tethering or
confinement.



   (E)   In addition to the general requirements for animal care and
treatment in this section, every owner or keeper of a dog kept in the city
shall see that such dog when confined outside:



      (1)   Has access to a shelter constructed of solid wood or
other weather resistant material, consisting of a structure with solid walls
on all sides, a dry floor raised above the ground, and a solid roof sloped
away from the entrance to protect the dog from weather and extreme cold.
During winter and any day when the temperature is at or below 40°F, the
shelter must be just large enough for the dog to stand up and turn around,
the entrance covered by a flexible wind-proofing material or self-closing
door, and must contain clean, dry bedding, which must consist of an
insulating material that does not retain moisture, such as straw, of
sufficient depth for the dog to burrow. On any day when the temperature is at
or above 80°F, the shelter must be shaded by trees, a tarp, or a tarp-like
device.



      (2)   Must be brought into a temperature controlled facility
when the temperature is at or below 20°F or at or above 90°F, or when a
heat advisory, wind chill warning, or tornado warning has been issued by
local, state, or national authority, except when the dog is in visual range
of a competent adult who is outside with the dog.



      (3)   Has adequate space for exercise when confined in an
enclosure or pen, which shall consist of no less than 100 square feet. A dog
over 80 pounds must be provided with an additional 50 square feet. For each
additional dog inside the enclosure, 50 square feet of space for exercise
must be added per dog.

such as an automobile, truck, or motorcycle;



         (b)   The dog is at least six months of age and is not
sick or injured;



         (c)   The tethered dog has access to water, shelter, and
dry ground. If there are multiple tethered dogs, each dog must be tethered
separately in a manner that prevents the tethers from becoming entangled with
each other or any other object, and each dog must have separate water and
shelter;



         (d)   The tether is attached to the dog by a properly
fitting buckle-type collar, or a collar that will not break under pressure,
with a rotating toggle or attachment. Pinch, prong, or choke collars shall
not be used. The tether shall not wrap directly around the dog's neck; and



         (e)   The tether is not of such unreasonable weight as
to prevent the dog from moving about freely, is free of tangles, cannot be
entangled with another animal or object, and is at least 12 feet in length.



         (f)   If the dog is attached to a trolley system, the
running line must be at least 12 feet in length and the tether length must be
greater than the height of the running line.



         (g)   The tether is located so as not to allow the dog
to trespass on public or private property nor in such a manner as to cause
harm or danger to persons or other animals.



   (F)   In the discretion of the enforcement authority, a person who
violates any provision of this section for the first time may be given
written notice of the practices or conditions which constitute the violation,
and the enforcement authority shall in such instance direct remedies to such
person where appropriate and provide a time period of no longer than five
days within which to correct the violation(s). Failure of the person to
correct the violations within the specified time period shall constitute
prima facie evidence of this section.



   (G)   If, in the opinion of the enforcement authority an animal is
endangered; the enforcement authority may take immediate action, up to and
including confiscation of the endangered animal for immediate medical care.



   (H)   A person who violates any provision of this section shall be
punishable as provided in § 90.99; provided, however, the fines imposed for
any such violation shall be as follows:



      (1)   For the first violation, not less than $25; and



      (2)   For the second or subsequent violations, not less than
$200, and the court upon request shall order forfeiture or other disposition
of the animal involved. A judgment by the court which orders forfeiture or
other disposition of the animal by the city or any third party shall include
as a part of such judgment adequate provisions for the collection of costs of
forfeiture or impoundment from the person found in violation.

   (E)   The owner of an impounded animal shall pay an initial charge
of $25 for impounding the animal as well as a charge of $10 a day for keeping

sign on his or her premises warning that there is a dangerous animal on the

   In addition to any other penalty imposed by this chapter for the

   (D)   No owner of real estate located in the city shall knowingly
allow that real estate to be used in such a manner so as to constitute a
civil nuisance as defined herein. An owner of such real estate is deemed to
have knowledge of such activity upon receipt of notice as provided in
division(F) herein. For purposes of this section, an owner of real estate is
defined as any person or entity that, alone or with others, has legal or
equitable title to any real property. When any real property is owned by more

different persons or entities, all such persons or entities shall be jointly
and severally liable for any violations of this section.



   (E)   Upon receipt of any report or complaint of suspected activity
constituting a civil nuisance as defined herein, the Police Department shall
conduct such investigation, as it deems necessary. At any time prior to or
during said investigation, the Department shall, when deemed appropriate
under the circumstances, send an initial warning letter to the owner and/or
occupant of the property that it suspects such activity may be occurring and
that an investigation is about to commence or is ongoing. The initial warning
letter shall inform the recipient that:



      (1)   If it is determined that a civil nuisance is occurring,
it is a violation of both state and local law;



      (2)   If it is determined that a civil nuisance is occurring,
it may result in fines being assessed pursuant to this city code;



      (3)   If it is determined that a civil nuisance is occurring,
the owner must abate the suspected nuisance to avoid any fines being assessed
under this section by evicting those responsible;



      (4)   If it is determined that a civil nuisance is occurring,
the Police Department will, at the owner's request, deliver an eviction
notice to the responsible tenant;



      (5)   If the investigation reveals that a civil nuisance is in
fact taking place, the city and the Police Department intend to take further
legal action; and



      (6)   If it is determined that a civil nuisance is occurring,
the property owner will be notified and given the opportunity to abate the
nuisance before any fines are assessed.



   (F)   Whenever the Police Department determines that a civil
nuisance as defined in division (A) herein exists, which determination must
be made by the Chief of Police or a designated officer and approved by the
City Attorney, the police shall, when deemed appropriate under the
circumstances, cause written notice to be served on the owner and occupant
that a present occupant or tenant of that property has been using the
property so as to constitute a civil nuisance as defined herein or has been
allowing the property to be so used. Said notice shall contain a copy of this
section of this city code and shall warn the recipient of the following:



      (1)   That a civil nuisance exists on the property;



      (2)   The date and time the civil nuisance was first
discovered;



      (3)   The location on the property where the civil nuisance is
allegedly occurring;



      (4)   That such activity is a violation of both state and
local law;



      (5)   That such activity may result in fines being assessed
pursuant to city code;



      (6)   That the owner must abate the civil nuisance by evicting
those responsible to avoid any fines being assessed under this section;



      (7)   That, if the owner chooses to abate the civil nuisance
by evicting those responsible, he or she must so inform the Police Department
in writing and commence said eviction within 30 days of receipt of this
notice;



      (8)   That the Police Department will, at the owner's request,
deliver an eviction notice to the property; and



      (9)   That if the owner fails to abate the civil nuisance, the
city and the Police Department may take further legal action, including but
not limited to, filing suit pursuant to I.C. 32-30-8.



   (G)   After receiving an initial warning letter or second
notification under this section, if a property owner so requests, an eviction
notice signed by the property owner shall be delivered to the responsible
tenant by the Police Department. (The Police Department shall inform the
property owner that, if the tenant or occupant refuses to leave, it will be
necessary to file an eviction proceeding through the proper court).



   (H)   (1)   The notice required pursuant to division (F) shall be
given by:

certified mail to the residence or place of business or employment of the
person to be notified, the return receipt requested;



         (b)   Delivering a copy of the order or statement
personally to the person to be notified; or

      (3)   Notice is deemed given to the owner, upon receipt of
notice as indicated above, by the owner of record pursuant to the records and
files of the Randolph County Assessor's Office.



   (I)   Within 30 days of receipt of notice in accordance with
division (F), the owner must initiate such legal action as is necessary to
evict all persons responsible for or permitting the civil nuisance which
shall include, at a minimum, a notice of eviction delivered by the Police
Department or the property owner by serving notice pursuant to I.C.
32-30-8-5, and must diligently prosecute such legal action to a conclusion.



   (J)   In the case of a multiple unit dwelling, the only person
necessary to name in an eviction proceeding is the tenant/occupant occupying
the actual unit involved with the nuisance as defined herein.



   (K)   Charging an owner of real estate with a violation of this
section shall be adjunct to and not a substitution for, any criminal charges
filed against occupants or tenants of that owner's real estate for any
illegal activity.



   (L)   The Chief of Police shall use reasonable efforts to train,
educate, and assist owners of real estate in evicting, and avoiding the
placement of, tenants or occupants in their real estate who are known
violators of illegal activities under I.C. 35-48-4.



   (M)   Any owner of real estate violating this section, which
violation causes the city to begin its own eviction process pursuant to I.C.
32-30-8, shall be fined $50 to assist with costs associated in utilizing
state law. No fines shall be assessed until at least 30 days after receipt of
notice required by division (F). Each day such violation continues shall be
deemed a separate violation, beginning with the 31st day following receipt of
notice as required by division (F).



   (N)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to encourage or
authorize the discrimination by lessors against any persons based upon race,
creed, religion, sex, age or national origin. Rather, it is the intent of
this section to hold persons accountable for acquiescing in or participating
in the continued use of his/her property as the location of illegal drug
activity.

decision is rendered against the owner determining that the owner is
responsible for an unsafe sidewalk, and the owner does not repair or replace
the sidewalk within the time established in the notice or any extension of

able to pay one-half of the cost of upgrading the sidewalk.



   (C)   Upon determination that the owner is responsible for an unsafe
sidewalk and has complied with the application process, the City Clerk may
issue a notice to the owner-applicant that the city has accepted the
responsibility to pay one-half of the cost of repair. If there are no funds
remaining in the sidewalk fund for the necessary repair or replacement of a
sidewalk that has been deemed unsafe, an application for matching funds shall
be given preference over other applications made by persons who have not been
cited for maintaining an unsafe sidewalk.



   (D)   Work should commence to complete the sidewalk repair or
replacement within 60 days of the notice, unless prohibited by weather or
other unexpected events.



   (E)   Upon completion of the sidewalk repair or replacement, the
City Manager or his designee shall inspect the work and, if it complies with
the standards imposed by the Board of Public Works, shall issue written

the work. Upon written instruction to disburse funds, the City Clerk shall
disburse monies from the sidewalk fund to the contractor completing the work.

matching fund program described above by a date set by the Board of Works,
may be used for the following purposes:



      (1)   To repair or replace sidewalks that have been deemed to
be unsafe but have not been repaired by the property owner;



      (2)   To repair or replace sidewalks on property owned by the
city;



      (3)   To upgrade existing sidewalks;



      (4)   To install new sidewalks; or



      (5)   To provide funds to repair or replace walks that will be
repaid by property owners as set out in division (F) of this section.



   (G)   In the event a property owner fails to comply with an order to
repair or replace a sidewalk issued under this subchapter, that property
owner shall not be permitted to apply for monies under the sidewalk fund and
shall be responsible for the entire cost of repair or replacement.



   (H)   Because defects in sidewalks are often caused by tree roots,
the cost of removal of trees or the offending roots may be included and paid
from matching funds, with the owner and the city bearing equal responsibility
for that cost.

   (A)   The real estate described in Res. 89-R3 is located within the
jurisdiction of the Common Council for the purposes set forth in IC
6-1.1-12.1-2; and



   (B)   The property designated as an economic revitalization area has
become undesirable for or impossible for normal development and occupancy
because of a lack of development, cessation of growth, deterioration of
improvements or character of occupancy, age obsolescence, substandard
buildings, or other factors which have impaired values or which prevent a
normal development of property or use of property or any area where a
facility or a group of facilities that are technologically, economically or
energy obsolete are located and where the obsolescence may lead to a decline
in employment and tax revenue.



   (C)   It would be of benefit to the citizens of the city to provide
a tax abatement as authorized by IC 6-1.1-12.1 in order to encourage and

GENERAL PROVISIONS



§ 157.01  TITLE.



   This chapter will be known and may be cited and referred to as the
"Storm Drainage Control Ordinance of Union City, Indiana" and will hereafter
be referred to as "this ordinance” or “this chapter.”



(Ord. 00-22, passed 12-28-00)



§ 157.02  PURPOSE.



   (A)   It is recognized that smaller streams and drainage channels
serving Randolph County may not have sufficient capacity to receive and
convey storm water runoff, resulting when land use changes from open or
agricultural use to a more urbanized use. It is further recognized that
deposits of sediment from developments during and after construction can
reduce capacities of storm sewers and drainage systems and result in damages
to receiving lakes and streams.



   (B)   Therefore, it shall be the policy of the Drainage Board that
the storage and controlled release of storm water runoff shall be required of
all new major subdivision residential development, commercial, industrial,
and institutional development, and any commercial, industrial or
institutional redevelopment in or within two miles of the corporate limits of
the city and within the county. The release rate of storm water from
developed lands shall not exceed the release rate from the land area in its
present land use.



   (C)   If it is determined that the standard release rate of storm
water has contributed to or caused flooding in the existing state, the
allowable release rate may be reduced to a lower limit. Conversely, there are
some circumstances where detention is not justified and may be waived by the
Board.



   (D)   Because topography and the availability and adequacy of
outlets for storm runoff vary with almost every site, the requirements for
storm drainage tend to be an individual matter for any project. It is
recommended that each proposed project be discussed with the city's Engineer
or Street Commissioner at the earliest practical time in the planning stage.



(Ord. 00-22, passed 12-28-00; Am. Ord. 2001-17, passed 1-14-02)



§ 157.03  APPLICABILITY.



   This chapter shall become effective after its final passage, approval
and publication as required by law. The affected land shall be the applicable
land area within the city, contiguous to the city, or within a two-mile
radius of the existing corporation limits of the city and within Indiana. Any
residential major subdivision, or commercial, industrial or institutional
development or construction project thereon, which has had its drainage plan
approved by the Board and has initiated construction activities consistent
with the approved plan prior to the effective date of this chapter shall be
exempt from all of the requirements of this chapter.



(Ord. 00-22, passed 12-28-00)



§ 157.04  CONFLICTING ORDINANCES.



   The provisions of this chapter shall be deemed as additional
requirements to minimum standards required by other ordinances of the city.
In the case of conflicting requirements, the most restrictive shall apply.



(Ord. 00-22, passed 12-28-00)



§ 157.05  COMPLIANCE WITH OTHER ORDINANCES.



   In addition to the requirements of this chapter, compliance with the
requirements set forth in other applicable ordinances with respect to
submission and approval of preliminary and final subdivision plats,
improvement plans, building and zoning permits, construction inspections,
appeals, and similar matters, and compliance with applicable state statutes
and regulations shall be required.



   (A)   Permits for construction in a floodway.



      (1)   The 1945 Flood Control Act, IC 14-28-1, of Indiana,
prohibits the construction of abodes or residences in or on a floodway. Flood
Hazard Management Ordinance says that prior approval of the Department of
Natural Resources is required for any type of construction, excavation, or
filling in or on a floodway. All projects proposed to be located in a
floodway must also comply with the requirements of this chapter.



      (2)   All applications made to and granted approval by the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) do not in any way relieve a
property owner of the necessity of securing easements or other property
rights, permits or approvals from affected property owners and/or local,
state and federal agencies.



   (B)   Compliance with 327 IAC 15-5.  All land disturbing
activities, including subdivision development and individual, commercial,
industrial and institutional site development that disturb five  acres or
more in total must comply with 327 IAC 15-5 (Rule 5) "Storm Water Runoff
Associated With Construction Activity". It shall be the responsibility of the
landowners or developers to determine if this rule applies to their project.
The Board will make no determination of the applicability of this rule to
individual projects. Copies of the Notice of Intent (NOI) letters shall also
be filed with the Area Plan Commission prior to the start of land disturbing
activity.



(Ord. 00-22, passed 12-28-00)



§ 157.06  CONSTRUCTION OF LANGUAGE.



   The language of this chapter shall be interpreted in accordance with
the following regulations:



   (A)   The particular shall control the general.



   (B)   In the case of any difference of meaning or implication

STORM SEWERS AND DRAINAGE CONTROL



§ 157.20  STORM WATER CONTROL POLICY.



   (A)   It is recognized that (with the possible exception of the
White River and Mississinewa River) the smaller streams and drainage channels
serving the county may not have sufficient capacity to receive and convey
storm water runoff resulting from continued urbanization. Accordingly, the
storage and controlled release rate of excess storm water runoff shall be
required for any new major subdivision residential development, commercial,
industrial or institutional development, and any commercial, industrial or
institutional redevelopment in the county.



   (B)   Exceptions to the requirement are minor subdivisions as
described in the county Subdivision Control Ordinance. In addition, the
Board, after thorough investigation and evaluation, may waive the requirement
of controlled runoff set out in this chapter.



   (C)   The release rate of storm water from development,
redevelopments, and new construction requiring controlled release may not
exceed the storm water runoff from the land area in its present state of
development. The developer must submit to the Board detailed computations of
runoff before and after development, redevelopment or new construction, which
demonstrate that runoff will not be increased. These computations must show
that the peak runoff rate after development for the 100-year return period
storm of critical duration must not exceed the 10-year return period
pre-development peak runoff rate.

§ 157.22  DETERMINATION OF RUNOFF QUANTITIES.



   Runoff quantities shall be computed for the area of the parcel under
development plus the area of the watershed flowing into the parcel under
development. The quantity of runoff which is generated as the result of a
given rainfall intensity may be calculated as follows:



   (A)   Area less than or equal to 200 acres.



      (1)   For areas up to and including 200 acres, the rational
method may be used. Typical runoff coefficients are listed herein. In the
rational method, the peak rate of runoff, Q, in cubic feet per second is
computed as:




Q=CIA




where C equals runoff coefficient, representing the characteristics of the
drainage area and defined as the ratio of runoff to rainfall; I equals
average intensity of rainfall in inches per hour for a duration equal to the
time of concentration (tc) for a selected rainfall frequency; A equals
tributary drainage area in acres. Guidance to selection of the runoff
coefficient "C" is provided in Appendix B, Tables 1 and 2, which show values
for different types of surface and local soil characteristics. The composite
"C" value used for a given drainage area with various surface types shall be
the weighted average value for the total area calculated from a breakdown of
individual areas having different surface types.



      (2)   Table 3 of Appendix B provides runoff coefficients and
inlet times for different land use classifications. In the instance of
undeveloped land situated in an upstream area, a coefficient or coefficients
shall be used for this area in its present or existing state of development.



      (3)   Rainfall intensity shall be determined from the data
shown in Appendix B, Table 6. The time of concentration (tc) to be used shall
be the sum of the inlet time and flow time in the drainage facility from the
most remote part of the drainage area to the point under consideration. The
flow time in the storm sewers may be estimated by the distance in feet
divided by velocity of flow in feet per second. The velocity shall be
determined by the Manning Formula.



      (4)   Time of concentration (tc) is the combined time required
for the runoff to reach the inlet of the storm sewer. It includes overland
flow time and flow time through established surface drainage channels such as
swales, ditches and sheet flow across such areas as lawns, fields, and other
graded surfaces, it may be computed by using the Time of Concentration
Worksheet, in Appendix A.



   (B)   For areas larger than 200 acres, hydrograph techniques and/or
computer modeling methods may be used. Hydrograph techniques and computer
modeling methods used to determine storm water runoff shall be proven
methods, subject to approval of the Board.(see also § 157.27(F)

§ 157.23  AMOUNT OF RUNOFF TO BE ACCOMMODATED BY VARIOUS PARTS OF THE
DRAINAGE FACILITY.



   Various parts of a drainage facility must accommodate runoff water as
follows:



   (A)   Minor drainage systems.



      (1)   The minor drainage systems such as inlets, catch basins,
street gutters, swales, sewers and small channels that collect storm water
must accommodate peak runoff from a 10-year return period storm. Rainfall
duration shall be equal to the time of concentration or one hour if the time
of concentration is less than one hour. A first quartile storm distribution
shall be used for computer modeling. The allowable spread of water on
arterial and collector streets is limited to maintaining two clear 10-foot
moving lanes of traffic. One lane is to be maintained on local streets, while
marginal access streets can have a water spread equal to one-half of their
width.



      (2)   Open channels carrying peak flows greater than 30 cubic
feet per second shall be capable of accommodating peak runoff for a 50-year
return period storm within the drainage easement.



      (3)   Culverts shall be capable of accommodating peak runoff
from a 50-year return period storm when crossing under a road which is part
of the Indiana Department of Transportation rural functional classification
system and are classified as principal or minor arterial, major or minor
collector roads.



   (B)   Major drainage systems.  Major drainage systems are defined
in § 157.07 and shall be designed in accordance with Indiana Department of
Natural Resources Standards.



(Ord. 2000-22, passed 12-28-00)



§ 157.24  STORM SEWER DESIGN STANDARDS.



   All storm sewers, whether private or public, and whether constructed on
private or public property, shall conform to the design standards and other
requirements contained herein.



   (A)   Hydraulic capacity:



      (1)   The hydraulic capacity of storm sewers shall be
determined using Manning's Equations:




V=1.486 R2/3 S1/2





   n





V = mean velocity of flow in feet per second





R = the hydraulic radius in feet





S = the slope of the energy grade line in feet per foot





n = roughness coefficient




      (2)   The hydraulic radius, R, is defined as the cross-
sectional area of flow divided by the wetted flow surface or wetted
perimeter. Typical "n" values and maximum permissible velocities for storm
sewer materials are listed in Appendix B, Table 4. Roughness coefficient (n)
values for other sewer materials can be found in standard hydraulics texts
and references.



   (B)   Minimum size.  The minimum size of all storm sewers shall be
12 inches. Rate of release for detention storage shall be controlled by an
orifice plate or other devices, subject to approval of the Board, where the
12-inch pipe will not limit rate of release as required.



   (C)   Grade.  Sewer grade shall be such that, in general, a minimum
of two feet of cover is maintained over the top of the pipe. Pipe cover less
than the minimum may be used only upon approval of the Board. Uniform slopes
shall be maintained between inlets, manholes and inlets to manholes. Final
grade shall be set with full consideration of the capacity required,
sedimentation problems and other design parameters. Minimum and maximum
allowable slopes shall be those capable of producing velocities of 2½ and 15
feet per second, respectively, when the sewer is flowing full.



   (D)   Alignment.  Storm sewers shall be straight between manholes
insofar as possible. Where long radius curves are necessary to conform to
street layout, the minimum radius of curvature shall be no less than 100 feet
for sewers 42 inches and larger in diameter. Deflection of pipe sections
shall not exceed the maximum deflection recommended by the pipe manufacturer.
The deflection shall be uniform and finished installation shall follow a
smooth curve.



   (E)   Backfill requirements.  Any storm sewer constructed within a
street dedicated to the city must be approved by the Street Commissioner,
City Engineer, or designee, prior to construction. Storm sewers constructed
within a county highway must be approved by the County Highway Supervisor, or
designee, prior to construction. Any sewer constructed within five feet of an
existing or proposed street, alley, driveway, or sidewalk shall be backfilled
with granular material. Granular backfill shall be crushed or washed stone
compacted to 95% maximum density. Granular backfill shall extend from the
bottom of the trench excavation to the restoration materials. Pavement
restoration shall be a minimum four  inches thick, consisting of three
inches of bituminous intermediate binder and one inch of bituminous surface,
or match existing pavement section, whichever is thicker.



   (F)   Allowable outlet location.



      (1)   It shall be illegal to outlet the discharge pipe,
emergency spillway, tile underdrain, or any other water discharge structure
from a wet or dry retention/detention basin, or any storm sewers, sump pump
drains, downspout drains, perimeter septic system tile drains, farm tile
drains, foundation or floor drains into the right-of-way of any roadway
including all county roads, state highways, federal highways, private
streets, regulated open or tile drains, onto adjacent property, and so on,
without the written approval of the agency having jurisdiction over the
roadway, regulated drain, or the owner of the property upon which the water
will flow. Outletting of subsurface tile drains into a 6 or 8-inch outlet
tile or open channel of a legal drain located within a county road
right-of-way and which has been designed to serve such a purpose shall be
permitted subject to plan approval of the County Surveyor or the County
Highway Supervisor.



      (2)   The excavation, filling, paving, and/or any other type
of construction of roadside drainage ditches located within county highway
right-of-ways is prohibited. Exceptions may be granted by the Drainage Board
or the County Highway Superintendent and must be in writing prior to
beginning construction. Extension and paving of existing driveways within the
road right-of-way shall be required to extend existing culverts and must seek
and receive driveway construction approval from the County Highway Department.



   (G)   Manholes.



      (1)   Manholes shall be installed to provide access to
continuous underground storm sewers for the purpose of inspection and
maintenance. Manholes shall be provided at the following locations:



         (a)   Where two or more storm sewers converge.



         (b)   At the point of beginning or at the end of a
curve, and at the point of reverse curvature (PC, PT, PRC).



         (c)   Where pipe size changes.

   48 and larger               600




   (H)   Inlets.  Inlets or drainage structures shall be utilized to
collect surface water through grated openings and convey it to storm sewers,
channels or culverts. Inlet design and spacing shall be in accordance with
Section 36-2.08 of the Indiana Department of Transportation's Design Manual
Part IV - Volume 2, or other approved design procedure. The inlet grate
opening provided must be adequate to pass the design 10-year flow with 50% of
the sag inlet areas clogged. An overload channel from sag inlets to the
overflow channel or basin shall be provided at sag inlets, so that the
maximum depth of water that might be ponded in the street sag shall not
exceed seven inches.



   (I)   Workmanship and materials.



      (1)   Workmanship.  The specifications for the construction
of storm sewers shall not be less stringent than those set forth in the
latest edition of the Indiana Department of Transportation's "Standard
Specifications"; additionally, ductile iron pipe shall be laid in accordance
with American Water Works Association (AWWA) C-600, and clay pipe shall be

§ 157.25  OPEN CHANNEL DESIGN STANDARDS.



   All open channels, whether private or public, and whether constructed
on private or public land, shall conform to the design standards and other
design requirements contained herein.



(A)Hydraulic capacity.  The waterway for channels shall be determined using
Manning's Equation.




Q = AV = A 1.486  R2/3 S1/2





   n





   Where:   A = Waterway area of channel in square feet





      Q = Discharge in cubic feet per second (cfs)





      V, R, S and n are explained in § 157.24(A)




   (B)   Channel cross-section and grade.  The required channel cross-
section and grade are determined by the design capacity, the material in
which the channel is to be constructed, and the requirements for maintenance.
A minimum depth may be required to provide adequate outlets for subsurface
drains, tributary ditches, or streams. The channel grade shall be such that
the velocity in the channel is high enough to prevent siltation but low
enough to prevent erosion. Velocities less than 1½ feet per second should be
avoided because siltation will take place and ultimately reduce the channel
cross- section. The maximum permissible velocities in vegetal-lined channels
are shown in Appendix B, Table 7. Developments through which the channel is
to be constructed must be considered in design of the channel section.



   (C)   Side slopes.  Earthen channel side slopes shall be no steeper
than 3 to 1. Flatter slopes may be required to prevent erosion and for ease
of maintenance. Where channels will be lined, side slopes shall be no steeper
than 1½ to 1 with adequate provisions made for weep holes. Silo slopes
steeper than 1½ to 1 may be used for lined channels, provided that the side
lining and structural retaining wall are designed and constructed with
provisions for live and dead load surcharge.



   (D)   Channel stability.



      (1)   Definition.  Characteristics of a stable channel are:



         (a)   It neither aggrades nor degrades beyond tolerable
limits.



         (b)   The channel banks do no erode to the extent that
the channel cross-section is changed appreciably.



         (c)   Excessive sediment bars do not develop.



         (d)   Excessive erosion does not occur around culverts,
bridges or elsewhere.



         (e)   Gullies do not form or enlarge due to the entry of
uncontrolled surface flow to the channel.



      (2)   Aged conditions.  Channel stability shall be determined
for an aged condition and the velocity shall be based on the design flow or
the bank full flow, whichever is greater, using "n" values for various
channel linings as shown in Appendix B, Table 4. In no case is it necessary
to check channel stability for discharges greater than that from a 100-year
return period storm.



      (3)   Post construction.  Channel stability must be checked
for conditions immediately after construction. For this stability analysis,
the velocity shall be calculated for the expected flow from a 10-year return
period storm on the watershed, or the bank full flow, whichever is smaller.
The "n" value for newly constructed channels in fine- grained soils and sands
may be determined in accordance with the National Engineering Handbook 5,
Supplement B, Soil Conservation Service, and shall not exceed 0.025. The
allowable velocity in the newly constructed channel may be increased by a
maximum of 20% to reflect the effects of vegetation to be established under
the following conditions:



         (a)   The soil and site in which the channel is to be
constructed are suitable for rapid establishment and support erosion
controlling vegetation.



         (b)   Species of erosion controlling vegetation adapted
to the area, and proven methods of establishment are shown.



         (c)   The channel design includes detailed plans for
establishment of vegetation on the channel side slopes.



   (E)   Drainage of waterways.  Vegetated waterways and dry-detention
basins with a gradient of less than 1% that are subject to low flows of long
duration, or where wet conditions prevail, shall be provided with a
subsurface tile drain to keep the channel bottom relatively dry and to
prevent the establishment of weed or cattail growth. Subsurface tile drain
lines may be outlet through a drop structure at the end of the waterway,
through a standard tile outlet pipe or outlet into the storm sewer system.
Subsurface drainage tiles shall be installed with two feet of cover over the
top of the tile and shall be offset from the centerline of the channel.



   (F)   Appurtenant structures. 



      (1)   The design of channels will provide all structures
required for the proper functioning of the channel and the laterals thereto
and travelways for operation and maintenance. Recessed inlets and structures
needed for entry of surface and subsurface flow into channels without
significant erosion or degradation shall be included in the design of channel
improvements. The design is also to provide the necessary flood gates, water
level control devices, and any other appurtenance affecting the functioning
of the channels and the attainment of the purpose for which they are built.



      (2)   The effect of channel improvements on existing culverts,
bridges, buried cables, pipelines and inlet structures for surface and
subsurface drainage on the channel being improved and laterals thereto shall
be evaluated to determine the need for modification or replacement. Culverts
and bridges which are modified or added as part of channel improvement
projects shall meet reasonable standards for the type of structure, and shall
have a minimum capacity equal to the design discharge or governmental agency
design requirements, whichever is greater.



   (G)   Disposition of spoil.  Spoil material resulting from
clearing, grubbing and channel excavation shall be disposed in such a manner
which will:



      (1)   Minimize overbank wash.



      (2)   Provide for the free flow of water between the channel
and floodplain unless the valley routing and water surface profile are based
on continuous dikes being installed.



      (3)   Not hinder the development of travelways for maintenance.



      (4)   Leave the right-of-way in the best condition feasible,
consistent with the project purposes, for productive use by the owner.



      (5)   Improve the aesthetic appearance of the site to the
extent feasible.



      (6)   Be approved by the IDNR or U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
(whichever is applicable) if deposited in the floodway.



   (H)   Construction and materials.



      (1)   Construction.  Specifications shall be in keeping with
the current standards of engineering practice and shall describe the
requirements for proper installation of the project to achieve its intended
purpose.



      (2)   Materials.



         (a)   Materials acceptable for use as channel lining are:



            1.   Grass



            2.   Revetment riprap



            3.   Concrete



            4.   Hand-laid riprap



            5.   Precast cement concrete riprap



            6.   Grouted riprap



            7.   Gabions



         (b)   Other lining materials shall receive specific
approval of the Board. Materials shall comply with the latest edition of the
Indiana Department of Transportation's "Standard Specifications".

§ 157.26  ACCESSORY DRAINS.



   (A)   Sump pumps.  Sump pumps installed to receive and discharge
ground waters or other storm waters shall be connected to the storm sewer
where possible or discharged into a designated storm drainage channel. Sump
pumps installed to receive and discharge floor drain flow or other sanitary
sewage shall be connected to the sanitary sewers. A sump pump shall be used
for one function only, either the discharge of storm waters or the discharge
of sanitary sewage.



   (B)   Down spouts.  All down spouts or roof drains shall discharge
onto the ground or be connected to the storm sewer. No down spouts or roof
drains shall be connected to the sanitary sewers.



   (C)   Footing and foundation drains.  Footing drains shall be
connected to storm sewers where possible or designated storm drainage
channels. No footing drains or drainage tile shall be connected to the
sanitary sewer.



   (D)   Basement floor drains.  Basement floor drains shall be
connected to the sanitary sewers.



(Ord. 2000-22, passed 12-28-00)  Penalty, see § 157.99



§ 157.27  STORM WATER DETENTION. 



   The following shall govern the design of any improvement with respect
to the detention of storm water runoff:



   (A)   Acceptable detention methods.  The increased storm water
runoff resulting from a proposed residential major subdivision, commercial,
industrial, or institutional development should be detained on-site by the
provisions of appropriate wet or dry-bottom reservoirs, by storage on parking
lots, streets, lawns, or other acceptable techniques. Measures which retard
the rate of overland flow and the velocity in runoff channels shall also be
used to control the runoff rate partially. Detention basins shall be sized to
store excess flows from storms with a 100-year return period. Control devices
shall limit the discharge to a rate no greater than that prescribed by this
chapter (see divisions (E) and (F) of this section).



   (B)   Design storm.  Design of storm water detention facilities
shall be based on a return period of once in 100 years. The storage volume
and outflow rate shall be sufficient to handle storm water runoff from a
critical duration storm, as defined in divisions (E) and (F) of this section.
Rainfall depth-duration-frequency relationships and intensity-
duration-frequency relationships shall be those given in Appendix B, Tables 5
and 6.



   (C)   Allowable release rate.



      (1)   The allowable release rate of storm water originating
from a proposed residential major subdivision, commercial, industrial, or
institutional development shall not exceed the amount specified in § 157.20,
Storm Water Control Policy, and as described in divisions (E) and (F) of this
section.



      (2)   In the event the natural downstream channel or storm
sewer system is inadequate to accommodate the release rate provided above,
then the allowable release rate shall be reduced to that rate permitted by
the capacity of the receiving downstream channel or storm sewer system and
additional detention shall be required to store that portion of the runoff
exceeding the capacity of the receiving sewers or waterways.



      (3)   If more than one detention basin is involved in the
development of the area upstream of the limiting restriction, the allowable
release rate from any one detention basin shall be in direct proportion to
the ratio of its drainage area to the drainage area of the entire watershed
upstream of the restriction.



   (D)   Drainage system overflow design.  Drainage systems shall have
adequate capacity to convey the storm water runoff from all upstream
tributary areas through the development under consideration for a storm of
100-year design return period calculated on the basis of the upstream land in
its present state of development. An allowance, equivalent to the reduction
in flow rate provided, shall be made for upstream detention when such
upstream detention and release rate have previously been approved by the
Board and evidence of its construction can be shown.



   (E)   Determination of storage volume - rational method.  For areas
of 200 acres or less, the rational method may be used to determine the
required volume of storm water storage. The following 11-step procedure may
be used to determine the required volume of storage. Other design methods may
also be used, subject to approval of the Board, and as described in division
(F) of this section.



      Step   Procedure



      (1)   Determine total drainage area in acres "A".



      (2)   Determine composite runoff coefficient "CU" based on
existing land use (undeveloped).



      (3)   Determine time of concentration "tC" in minutes based on
existing conditions.



      (4)   Determine rainfall intensity "IU" in inches per hour,
based on time of concentration from data given in Appendix B, Table 6 for the
10-year return period.



      (5)   Compute runoff based on existing land use (undeveloped),
and 10-year return period:




QU=CUIUA




      (6)   Determine composite runoff coefficient "Cd" based on
developed conditions and a 100-year return period.



      (7)   Determine the 100-year return period rainfall intensity
"Id" for various storm durations "td" up through the time of concentration
for the developed area using Appendix B, Table 6.



      (8)   Determine developed inflow rates "Qd" for various storm
durations “td" measured in hours.




Qd=CdIdA




      (9)   Compute a storage rate "Std" for various storm durations
"td" up through the time of concentration of the developed area.




Std=Qd–Qu




      (10)   Compute required storage volume "SR" in acre-feet for
each storm duration "td". This assumes a triangular hydrograph of duration
(2*td) hours with the peak flow of Std at td hours.




SR=Std (td/12)




      (11)   Select the largest storage volume computed in step 10
for detention basin design.



   (F)   Determination of storage volume - other methods.  Methods
other than the rational method for determining runoff and routing of storm
water may be used to determine the storage volume required to control storm
water runoff. The procedures or methods used must receive the prior approval
of the Board. The ILLUDAS, TN-20 and TR-55 models are approved by the Board
for appropriate use in analysis of the runoff and routing of storm water. The
use of these models or other approved procedures can be defined in a
seven-step procedure to determine the required storage volume of the
detention basin.



      Step   Procedure



      (1)   Calibrate the hydrologic/hydraulic model that is to be
used for prediction of runoff and routing of storm water.



      (2)   For each storm duration listed in Appendix B, Table 5,
perform, steps three through six.



      (3)   Determine the 10-year, undeveloped peak flow. Denote
this flow by Q10U



      (4)   Determine the 100-year runoff hydrograph (H100d) for
developed conditions.



      (5)   Determine the hydrograph that must be stored (H100S) by
subtracting a flow up to Q10U from the hydrograph (H100d) found in step 4.



      (6)   Determine the volume of water (VS) to be stored by
calculating the area under the hydrograph (H100S).



      (7)   The detention basin must be designed to store the
largest volume (VS) found for any storm duration analyzed in step 6.



   (G)   General detention basin design requirements. 



      (1)   Basins shall be constructed to detain temporarily the
storm water runoff which exceeds the maximum peak flow rate authorized by
this chapter. The volume of storage provided in these basins, together with
such storage as may be authorized in other on-site facilities, shall be
sufficient to control excess runoff from the 100-year storm.



      (2)   The following design principles shall be observed:



         (a)   The maximum volume of water stored and
subsequently released at the design release rate shall not result in a
storage duration in excess of 48 hours unless additional storms occur within
the period.



         (b)   The maximum planned depth of storm water stored
(without a permanent pool) shall not exceed four feet.



         (c)   All storm water detention facilities shall be
separated by not less than 50 feet from any building or structure to be
occupied.



         (d)   All excavated excess spoil may be spread so as to
provide for aesthetic and recreational features such as sliding hills, sports
fields, and the like. Slopes no steeper than 4 horizontal to 1 vertical for
safety, erosion control, stability and ease of maintenance shall be permitted.



         (e)   Safety screens having a maximum opening of four
inches shall be provided for any pipe or opening to prevent children or large
animals from crawling into the structures.



         (f)   Danger signs shall be mounted at appropriate
locations to warn of deep water, possible flooding conditions during storm
periods and other dangers that exist. Fencing shall be provided if deemed
necessary by the Board.



         (g)   Outlet control structures shall be designed to
operate as simply as possible and shall require little or no maintenance
and/or attention for proper operation. They shall limit discharges into
existing or planned downstream channels or conduits so as not to exceed the
predetermined maximum authorized peak flow rate.



         (h)   Emergency overflow facilities such as a weir or
spillway shall be provided for the release of exceptional storm runoffs or in
emergency conditions, should the normal discharge devices become totally or
partially inoperative. The overflow facility shall be of such design that its
operation is automatic and does not require manual attention.



         (i)   Grass or other suitable vegetative cover shall be
provided throughout the entire basin area. Grass should be cut regularly at
approximately monthly intervals during the growing season or as required.



         (j)   Debris and trash removal and other necessary
maintenance shall be performed on a regular basis to assure continued
operation in conformance to design.



         (k)   A report shall be submitted to the Board
describing (a) the proposed development; (b) the current land use conditions;
(c) the method of hydraulic and hydrologic analysis used, including any
assumptions or special conditions; (d) the results of the analysis; and (e)
the recommended drainage control facilities. Hydraulic and hydrologic
calculations, including input and output files, shall be included as
appendices to the report.



   (H)   Dry-bottom basin design requirements.  Detention basins which
will not contain a permanent pool of water shall comply with the following
requirements:



      (1)   Provisions shall be incorporated to facilitate complete
interior drainage of dry-bottom basins, to include the provisions of natural
grades to outlet structures, longitudinal and transverse grades to perimeter
drainage facilities, paved gutters, or the installation of subsurface drains.



      (2)   The detention basin shall, whenever possible, be
designed to serve a secondary or multi-purpose function. Recreational
facilities, aesthetic qualities (open spaces) or other types of use shall be
considered in planning the detention facility.



   (I)   Wet-bottom basin design requirements.  Where part of a
detention basin will contain a permanent pool of water, all the items
required for detention storage shall apply except that the system of drains
with a positive gravity outlet required to maintain a dry-bottom basin will
not be required. A controlled positive outlet will be required to maintain
the design water level in the wet-bottom basin and provide required detention
storage above the design water level. However, the following additional
conditions shall apply:



      (1)   Basins designed with permanent pools or containing
permanent ponds shall have a water area of at least one-half acre. If fish
are to be maintained in the pond, a minimum depth of approximately ten feet
shall be maintained over at least 25% of the pond area. The remaining pond
area shall have no extensive shallow areas, except as required by division
(I)(3) below.



      (2)   In excavated ponds, the underwater side slopes in the
pond shall be stable. In the case of valley storage, natural slopes may be
considered to be stable.



      (3)   A safety ledge four to six feet in width is required and
must be installed in all ponds approximately 30 to 36 inches below the
permanent water level. In addition, a similar maintenance ledge 12 to 18
inches above the permanent water line shall be provided. The slope between
the two ledges shall be stable and of a material such as stone or riprap
which will prevent erosion due to wave action.



      (4)   A safety ramp exit from the pond is required in all
cases and shall have a minimum width of 20 feet and exit slope of 6
horizontal to 1 vertical. The ramp shall be of a material that will prevent
its deterioration due to vehicle use and/or wave action



      (5)   Periodic maintenance is required in ponds to control
weed and larval growth. The pond shall also be designed to provide for the
easy removal of sediment which will accumulate during periods of pond
operation. A means of maintaining the designed water level of the pond during
prolonged periods of dry weather is also required.



      (6)   For emergency use, basin cleaning or shoreline
maintenance, facilities shall be provided or plans prepared for auxiliary
equipment to permit emptying and drainage.



      (7)   Facilities to enhance and maintain pond water quality
shall be provided, if required to meet applicable water quality standards.
Design calculations to substantiate the effectiveness of these aeration
facilities shall be submitted with final engineering plans. Agreements for
the perpetual operation and maintenance of aeration facilities shall be
prepared to the satisfaction of the Board.



   (J)   Parking lot storage.  Paved parking lots may be designed to
provide temporary detention storage of storm waters on all or a portion of
their surfaces. Outlets will be designed so as to empty the stored waters
slowly. Depths of storage must be limited to a maximum depth of seven inches,
so as to prevent damage to parked vehicles, and so that access to parked
vehicles is not impaired. Ponding should, in general, be confined to those
positions of the parking lots farthest from the area served.



   (K)   Facility financial responsibilities.  The construction cost
of storm water control systems and facilities as required by this chapter
shall be accepted as part of the cost of land development. If general public
use of the facility can be demonstrated, negotiations for public
participation in the cost of such development may be considered.



   (L)   Facility maintenance responsibility.



      (1)   See § 157.28(C) concerning detention basins within
residential major subdivisions.



      (2)   On commercial, industrial and institutional
developments, maintenance of detention facilities during construction and
thereafter shall be the responsibility of the land developer/owner.



   (M)   Inspections.  All public and privately-owned detention
storage facilities shall be inspected not less often than once every five
years. For commercial, industrial and institutional sites, the property owner
shall provide a certified inspection report by a licensed professional
engineer or land surveyor covering physical conditions, available storage
capacity and operational condition of key facility elements to the Board. For
inspections within major subdivisions, see § 157.28(C)(3).



   (N)   Corrective measures.  If deficiencies are found by the
inspector, the owner of the detention/retention facility will be required to
take the necessary measures to correct such deficiencies. If the owner fails
to do so, the city will undertake the work and collect from the owner using
lien rights, if necessary.



   (O)   Joint development of control systems.  Storm water control
systems may be planned and constructed jointly by two or more developers as
long as compliance with this chapter is maintained.



   (P)   Installation of control systems.  Runoff and erosion control
systems shall be installed as soon as possible during the course of site
development. Detention/retention basins shall be designed with an additional
10% of available capacity to allow for sediment accumulation resulting from
development and to permit the pond to function for reasonable periods between
cleanings. Basins should be designed to collect sediment and debris in
specific locations so that removal costs are kept to a minimum.



   (Q)   Detention facilities in floodplains.  If detention storage is
provided within a floodplain, only the net increase in storage volume above
that which naturally existed on the floodplain shall be credited to the
development. No credit will be granted for volumes below the elevation of the
regulatory flood at the location unless compensatory storage is also provided.



   (R)   Off-site drainage provisions.  When the allowable runoff is
released in an area that is susceptible to flooding, the developer may be
required to construct appropriate storm drains through such area to avert
increased flood hazard caused by the concentration of allowable runoff at one
point instead of the natural overland distribution. The requirement of
off-site drains shall be at the discretion of the Board.

§ 157.28  EXISTING REGULATED DRAINS AND ESTABLISHMENT OF URBAN REGULATED
DRAINS.



   The County Drainage Board has established a system of regulated rural
and urban drains as shown on official maps located in the office of the
County Surveyor. Maintenance and administrative jurisdiction over these
drains is empowered to the Drainage Board by IC 36-9-27-15.



   (A)   Drainage easements.  When an existing regulated drain is
within the property to be developed, easements must be provided to cover all
elements of the drainage system and must be designed as follows:



      (1)   To be adequate to install, access, and maintain the
drainage facilities.



      (2)   To minimize conflicts with utility easements.



      (3)   To maintain a sufficient buildable area on each lot or
parcel.



      (4)   No trees, shrubs, or other vegetative obstructions shall
be allowed within drainage easements per IC 36-9-27-33.



      (5)   No driveways shall be allowed in drainage easements
except for the purpose of crossing a front yard drainage easement to provide
access to the property.



      (6)   Minimum drainage easements are as per IC 36-9-27-33.



   (B)   Existing regulated drains.



      (1)   No individual may dredge, reconstruct, fill, or outlet
any drainage tile or storm sewer pipe into a county regulated drain without
the prior written approval of the Drainage Board. The County Surveyor, or
designated representative, shall supervise any work done to a regulated drain
by any individual granted such written authorization from the Drainage Board.



      (2)   The Drainage Board may levy assessments to property
owners within a regulated drain's watershed in order to maintain the drain in
accordance with IC 36-9-27-44 and to reconstruct a regulated drain in
accordance with IC 36-9-27-50.



      (3)   As per IC 36-9-27-66, whenever land has been assessed as
benefitted by the construction, reconstruction, or maintenance of a regulated
drain and there is not an open or tiled drain connecting the land with the
regulated drain or the waters from the land flow over or through land owned
by others to reach the regulated drain, the owner of the land assessed may
petition the Drainage Board to construct through the land of the other owners
a new drain that will connect the petitioner's lands with the regulated drain.



      (4)   A private crossing, control dam, or other permanent
structure or obstruction may not be placed over or through a regulated drain
unless the plans for the structure have been reviewed by the County Surveyor
and approved in writing by the Drainage Board.



   (C)   Establishment of urban regulated drains.  The Drainage Board
shall require that developers of major residential subdivisions create an
urban regulated drain as part of the major subdivision plat. The urban
regulated drain shall include all storm sewers, subsurface drains, inlets,
manholes, and detention basins within the subdivision.



      (1)   Urban regulated drainage easements shall maintain a
minimum width of 20 feet centered over all closed conduits or 20 feet each
side of an open urban regulated drain or detention basin.



      (2)   A minimum 15-foot wide access easement shall be platted
between the detention basin and the nearest public street right-of-way.



      (3)   The County Surveyor shall establish a schedule for the
assessment of each lot in the subdivision in an amount not to exceed $100 per
lot per year to provide an accumulating maintenance and repair fund. These
funds can be used to inspect repair and maintain storm sewers, curb inlets,
manholes, subsurface tile drains, outlet pipes, and detention basins in the
subdivision. Within the context of this chapter, moving shall not be defined
as a maintenance activity covered by an assessment. Individual property
owners shall maintain responsibility for mowing portions of the urban
regulated drain within and adjacent to each individual lot.



(Ord. 2000-22, passed 12-28-00)  Penalty, see § 157.99



§ 157.29  DRAINAGE REQUIREMENTS FOR MINOR SUBDIVISIONS AND OTHER LAND
DISTURBING ACTIVITIES.



   (A)   Driveway requirements.  Any site that derives access from a
city street shall be required to obtain approval from the Street
Commissioner, or designee, prior to installation of a new access to the
street. Any site that derives access from a county highway shall be required
to obtain approval from the County Highway Supervisor, or designee, prior to
installation of a new access to the highway. A drainage culvert for the
purpose of conveying water from the roadside ditch underneath the driveway
shall be required to be placed under all driveways entering onto a county
road, unless a culvert is deemed unnecessary by the County Highway
Supervisor. The minimum size for such a culvert shall be 12 inches in
diameter and 30 feet in length. The size of the drainage culvert shall
provide capacity for the flow from a 25-year design return period storm.



   (B)   Allowable drainage outlet.  It shall be illegal to outlet any
storm sewers, sump pump drains, downspout drains, perimeter septic system
tile drains, farm tile drains, foundation or floor drains into the
right-of-way of any roadway including all county roads, state highways,
federal highways, private streets, regulated open or tile drains, onto
adjacent property, and so on, without the written approval of the agency
having jurisdiction over the roadway, regulated drain, or the owner of the
property upon which the water will flow. Outletting of subsurface tile drains
into a 6 or 8-inch outlet tile or open channel of a legal drain located
within a county road right-of-way and which has been designed to serve such a
purpose shall be permitted subject to plan approval of the County Surveyor or
the County Highway Supervisor.



   (C)   Maintenance of existing roadside ditches.  The excavation,
filling, paving, and/or any other type of construction of roadside drainage
ditches located within county highway right-of-ways is prohibited. Exceptions
may be granted by the Drainage Board or the County Highway Superintendent and
must be in writing prior to beginning construction. Extension and paving of
existing driveways within the road right-of-way shall be required to extend
existing culverts and must seek and receive driveway construction approval
from the County Highway Department.



   (D)   Road cuts and restoration.  Any excavation within a city
street must be approved by the Street Commissioner, or designee, prior to
construction. Any excavation within a county highway must be approved by the
County Highway Supervisor, or designee, prior to construction. All excavation
and spoil removal is the responsibility of the development owner. On county
roadways, the County Highway Department will provide and install backfill and
pavement restoration materials, given 48 hours notice prior to construction.

notice as provided in division(A)(2) above. There shall be no charge for the
additional inspection.



   (E)   Access. Every occupant of a rental unit shall give the owner

A legally established nonconforming use of any lot, building or structure may be
substituted with another similar nonconforming use provided such substituted similar nonconforming use is not more objectionable, is operated within the same confines, and does not increase parking and traffic. An existing nonconforming use may be extended consistent with the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance and Indiana law.

Such screening may be accomplished with one or a combination of landscaping, fencing and earth mounding.
Signs in industrial zoning districts may be lighted but shall not be animated, flashing or moving in any manner. However, an electronic message sign may be a component of any sign provided such sign is located no closer to a residential zoning district or use than one hundred feet and compromises no more than forty percent of the total sign area of the structure of which it is a component.
59
Only one free-standing identification sign shall be permitted for each public street frontage of the lot or use served. Properties with five-hundred feet or more of public street frontage on the same street shall be permitted one additional free-standing identification sign along such frontage for each multiple of five hundred feet provided a minimum distance of three hundred feet is maintained between such additional signs. Where more than one free-standing sign is permitted, such signs may be combined into one four-sided structure in lieu of multiple sign structures, provided the total sign area of all faces of the combined structure does not exceed the area which would be permitted for the multiple structures.
Temporary signs shall be removed within twelve months of their erection. The Board of Zoning Appeals may approve, by resolution, extensions not exceeding twelve months each provided such request is made prior to the expiration of the temporary period thereof. Temporary signs shall be removed immediately upon the cessation of the activity served, regardless of the time remaining on the temporary period or extensions thereof.
Lighted signs, awnings and canopies, etc., and lighting components or devices therefore shall be constructed and installed in accordance with and have affixed thereto tags issued by Underwriters Laboratories or other such certifying agency or organization.

ARTICLE VII
Planned Development District
7.01 Intent
(A) PD zoning may be used to foster innovative and diverse design in land development that is still consistent with both the adopted Comprehensive Plan and the intent of the Unified Zoning and Subdivision Ordinances. To achieve this, the Plan Commission does not apply any other provisions of this Chapter. Instead, the Plan Commission negotiates a specific development plan with the petitioner for PD zoning and representatives of the checkpoint agencies. The combined elements of this negotiated plan, rather than the zoning regulations, then become the subject of the rezoning process. All restrictions and regulations for a specific Planned Development are thus contained within the approved and recorded plan itself, having been arrived at prior to rezoning. PD zoning may be applied to existing development or to open land, on small or larger tracts.
(B) The Plan Commission’s goal is to provide a widening variety of environmentally appropriate residential, nonresidential and mixed use developments to meet the needs of the community. To help create attractive, healthful, efficient and stable places to live, shop and work, the Plan Commission encourages use of PD zoning within the following contexts:
(1) to accommodate compatible development in environmentally sensitive locations;
(2) to enhance compatibility with surrounding land uses;
(3) to permit a harmonious variety of uses within a single development;
(4) to promote efficiency and thus economy by clustering structures and/or by using shared facilities or services;
(5) to foster new site treatments not contemplated in other kinds of zones.
7.02 Origination of Proposals
(A) A request to rezone from any other zoning classification to PD zoning may be initiated by:
(1) all owners of the property in question; or
(2) any group of owners united in interest, acting jointly in pursuance to an agreement to carry out the proposal in separate ownership.
(B) Because of the unified design of a planned development and because the combined elements of the negotiated plan are the substance of the zone itself, this ordinance requires that a request to reclassify from PD to PD shall include amongst the petitioners either:
(1) all owners of the property within the current planned development; or
(2) the owner’s association acting on behalf of a majority of the property owners in the current planned development, as constituted in the recorded bylaws.
(C) Also, in keeping with the provisions contained herein, PD zoning is mandatory for any new condominium or condominium conversion.
61
7.03 Classification of Planned Development
(A) To identify the nature of planned development on zoning maps, they shall be classified as one of these four zones:
(1) PDRS, in which all buildings and land are developed for residential use and those activities customarily accessory to residential use;
(2) PDNR, in which no buildings and land are developed for residential use, but rather for commercial and/or industrial and/or recreational and/or some other nonresidential use;
(3) PDMX, in which buildings and land are developed as a mix of both residential and nonresidential uses;
(4) PDCC, in which the only change proposed involves either:
(a) the conversion to condominium ownership of a development which has received occupancy permits for all parts no less than three years prior; or
(b) the conversion to condominium ownership of an existing building in any zone; where there is no further division of land involved.
7.04 Pre-Submission Conference
(A) No pre-submission conference is required before submitting a rezoning request to PDCC.
(B) Before submitting any of the materials required for a rezoning request to either PDRS, PDNR or PDMX, the petitioner shall arrange a meeting with staff and the appropriate Administrative Officer.
(C) The petitioner shall bring to this meeting a drawing or sketch of the proposed planned development that :
(1) is at least approximately scaled;
(2) includes the entire tract;
(3) shows, in at least schematic detail, location of proposed uses and major buildings, layout and classification of roads, all entrances and exists, any environmentally sensitive areas;
(4) proposes treatment of environmentally sensitive areas;
(5) indicates phasing and a time frame for development.
(D) Discussion at this meeting shall include:
(1) the intent and requirements of PD zoning;
(2) the petitioner’s intentions and objectives regarding land use, street improvements, utilities and similar matters;
(3) the petitioner’s intentions assuring compatibility between uses proposed for the perimeter of the PD and surrounding land uses and zoning classifications;
(4) general availability of utilities to the site;
(5) the area’s current zoning pattern and all elements of the Comprehensive Plan;
(6) specific materials and documents required herein to be included with the submission, and a list of checkpoint agencies to be involved;
(7) classification of the proposed rezoning as either PDRS, PDNR, or PDMX; and
(8) a proposed schedule for the rezoning process.
62
7.05 Filing Requirements for a PD Rezoning Request With Draft Plan
(A) After a pre-submission meeting, or to initiate a PDCC action, the petitioner may file a rezoning request to one of the PD classifications. The last working day of each month is the deadline for a petitioner to make a complete submission intended to be heard as a rezoning request no sooner than the Plan Commission’s public meeting about 1 ½ months later.
(B) This submission shall contain the following:
(1) a non-refundable processing fee as set by the Plan Commission;
(2) a signed and notarized Petition to Rezone with metes and bounds legal description, indicating the PD classification being sought, signed by the owner or owners of all property involved, or with a notarized Affidavit of Consent of all owners attached;
(3) a list of names, addresses and auditor’s key numbers of all property owners located adjacent to and directly across the street, alley or rail-road right-of-way from the property involved;
(4) two Notices of Public Hearing, each with a metes and bounds or other proper legal description and the common address or location of the property;
(5) a typed original and three copies of the proposed ordinance to rezone the property, using the sample format provided by staff;
(6) three sets of drawings, labeled Draft Plan, using the format prescribed by the Plan Commission, to include a published and recorded boundary survey meeting the requirements of IAC Title 865 Article 1 Rule 12 or its successor, plus a full and detailed site analysis and proposed site plan, utilities plan and landscape plan;
(7) if dividing land, three copies of the preliminary plan, prepared by a Registered Land Surveyor or Engineer;
(8) three copies of any proposed covenants and horizontal property ownership and owner’s association documents, each of which shall include a Table of Contents and be written in plain language easily understood by most readers; and
(9) signatures of all required checkpoint agencies, or post office receipts of certified mailing, indicating receipt of one set of each of the items listed as (7) through (9)
(c) Checkpoint agencies to be provided with sets of plans and other documents will have been determined at the pre-submission meeting.

(B) If the petitioner fails to meet the Preliminary Plan submission requirements within six months of the date of the Required Review Meeting, the rezoning petition shall be void. If the petitioner wishes to continue with the project, he shall schedule a new pre-submission meeting.
7.08 Preliminary Plan Hearing and Disposition
(A) The petition and Preliminary Plan shall then be heard by the Plan Commission as a Petition for Zoning Ordinance Amendment, subject to the procedures that apply to such an amendment. Upon hearing the request, the Plan Commission may recommend either approval, amendment, or disapproval of the Preliminary Plan, or may vote no recommendation pursuant to APC bylaws.
(B) The Plan Commission may impose reasonable conditions with its recommendation. These conditions shall only involve the inclusion of additional items unrelated to the project’s design. Such items include being granted additional approval by another governmental agency such as the Drainage Board, or obtaining permission to attach to an existing utility.
(C) If the Plan Commission requires changes in design, regarding the proposed site, utilities or landscape plans, then the Plan Commission shall vote to recommend amendment. Should this happen, the petitioner may resubmit a second Preliminary Plan for a later rehearing by the Plan Commission.
(D) If the Plan Commission recommends approval, disapproval or no recommendation, the eight sets of Preliminary Plans (including drawings, plats and covenants) shall be stamped
65

The number of sets shall be determined by staff;
(3) a minimum of eight signed copies of any covenants and horizontal ownership and owners’ association documents. These shall include a Table of Contents and be written in plain language easily understood by most readers. The number of copies shall be determined by staff.
(C) The staff shall review these Final Detailed Plans within five working days of the petitioner’s submission. If the staff finds they comply with the above, the staff shall approve them by attaching a Certificate of Approval, signed and dated by the Executive Director, stating its finding of compliance. If the staff finds them incomplete, the staff shall notify the petitioner of the deficiencies. After this Certificate of Approval is attached, the petitioner shall not submit an alternate or revised set of Final Detailed Plans for the same legal description, except under circumstances described herein.
7.10 Approval of Final Detailed Plans for PDRS, PDNR and PDMX Zones
(A) Following rezoning to PDRS, PRNR or PDMX, the petitioner may file Final Detailed Plans. The petitioner can neither seek Improvement Location Permits nor begin any development activity until the Plan Commission approves these Final Detailed Plans and the petitioner records them. To be complete, the Final Detailed Plans shall have already been approved and signed by the appropriate Administrative Officer, any applicable sanitary sewer and water provider, public or private; and if outside the Cities of Winchester and Union City, the County Highway Department and the County Surveyor on behalf of the Drainage Board.

(4) a release from the mortgage company, if any, covering the necessary right-of-way, where right-of-way is to be dedicated.
(5) if one or more lots are being created, the petitioner shall provide ten copies and a reproducible mylar of the signed final plat, prepared by a registered land surveyor or engineer, with a Planned Development Dedication Certificate appended. The petitioner may either submit this final plat along with items (1) through (4) above or at a later time. In either event, the final plat is a part of the Final Detailed Plans, and as such, no Improvement Location Permit shall be issued until the plat is approved and recorded.
(C) If public improvements or improvements for common usage are to be installed by the petitioner, he or she shall either:
(1) complete the improvement upon approval of the construction plans portion of the Final Detailed Plans; or
(2) ask the Plan Commission’s approval at the time the plat is approved (whether submitted with construction plans or at a later time), to post bond for these improvements, or submit a certified check, or irrevocable letter of credit or certificate of deposit. No Improvement Location Permit for a dwelling unit shall be issued until surety has been provided.
(D) If the Plan Commission finds the submission of the Final Detailed Plans (with final plat, or final plat alone after previous portions of Final Detailed Plans have been approved) to conform to the Approved Preliminary Plan as adopted by the legislative body at the time of rezoning, the Plan Commission shall adopt a resolution. After this resolution is adopted, the petitioner shall not submit an alternative or revised set of Final Detailed Plans for the same legal description, except under circumstances described herein.
(E) The adopted resolution shall be signed and dated by the President and Secretary of the Plan Commission, and a copy shall be attached to the front of each set of approved Final Detailed Plans.
(F) Adoption of a resolution shall neither constitute nor imply a participating jurisdiction’s acceptance of any street, easement or park shown in Final Detailed Plans. Acceptance is only that of real property itself. The Plan Commission may require notes to this effect.
67
7.11 Recording Approved Detailed Plans
(A) Before performing any development, construction or earth moving activity, or applying for Improvement Location Permits, or filing any required condominium documents, the petitioner shall record the Approved Final Detailed Plans in the Office of the Recorder of Randolph County.
(B) The staff shall accompany the petitioner in the recording process. Final Detailed Plans shall first be stamped and dated in the County Auditor’s Office, with one set of plans given the County Auditor. The remaining sets of Final Detailed Plans shall then be stamped, numbered and recorded at the County Recorder’s Office, and then distributed by the petitioner. The staff shall provide the petitioner a list of agencies to which the petitioner shall distribute sets of approved and recorded plans. The petitioner shall keep at least one set.
(C) If the petitioner fails to record the Final Detailed Plans for all or any part of the entire project within thirty days of the date of their approval, that approval expires. In order to continue, the petitioner shall resubmit Final Detailed Plans for approval.
(D) Any construction that does not fully comply with recorded Final Detailed Plans will be subject to appropriate enforcement action.
7.12 Amending Recorded Final Detailed Plans
(A) A property owner may wish to make changes to a PDRS, PDNR or PDMX project after Final Detailed Plans have been recorded. If these changes are determined to conform to the Approved Preliminary Planned Development as adopted by the legislative body, and to constitute a minor modification only, then changes shall be recorded as an Amended Final Detailed Plans.
(1) this written determination of conformance and minor modification shall be made and signed by the appropriate Administrative Officer and attached to each copy of the Amended Final Detailed Plans before recording;
(2) a minor modification cannot included: any increase in residential density; any change in building dimension or location unless all other development standards set forth are met; any change in lot lines; any change in landscaping other than substitution of species or redesign with the same materials; any alteration in the size and/or location of signs; any change in type of land use; any change in the alignment or intersection of streets unless requested or required by the appropriate governmental agency; or any change in restrictive covenants, or horizontal ownership and owners’ association documents regarding these items;
(3) submission requirements and a timetable for seeking a determination of conformance and minor modification shall be set by each Administrative Officer;
(4) changes beyond the scope of minor modification require rezoning.
(B) For any newly constructed condominium project or attached zero-lot-line project, the property owners shall provide exact measurements locating buildings and common lot
68
lines after foundations have been put in place. The revised plat reflecting exact locations needs to be approved and signed by the appropriate Administrative Officer as Amended Final Detailed Plans and recorded.
7.13 Lapsed and Abandoned Planned Developments
(A) An intended condominium conversion has lapsed if two years have passed since the date on which rezoning to PDCC was granted, and no Final Detailed Plans have been approved and recorded. Following such lapse, the Plan Commission shall initiate a petition to rezone the property to its previous classification(s).
(B) A planned development has been abandoned if two years have passed since the date on which rezoning to PDRS, PDNR or PDMX was granted, and no Final Detailed Plans have been approved and recorded for the project or any part or phase of it; or
(C) Parts or phases of a planned development have been abandoned if ten years have passed since the date on which rezoning to PDRS, PDNR or PDMX was granted, and only Final Detailed Plans for other parts or phases have been approved and recorded.
(D) An Administrative Officer cannot issue an Improvement Location Permit for an abandoned planned development or an abandoned part or phase of a planned development. An abandoned planned or abandoned part or phase shall be rezoned (and if to a PD classification, comply with the provisions contained herein) before the property’s owner once more becomes eligible to receive an Improvement Location Permit at that location.
(E) Neither the Plan Commission nor any legislative body shall initiate a petition to rezone any PD-zoned property unless it has either lapsed or been abandoned.
7.14 Covenants and Maintenance
(A) To assure property owners that all aspects of a planned development remain in conformance with plans adopted by the legislative body at the time of rezoning, restrictive covenants and any horizontal property ownership and owners’ association documents can only be changed through the procedures contained herein.
(B) These changes may be initiated only by a majority of property owners within the planned development. Multiple owners of a single property shall be considered a single owner. The developer shall be considered a single owner until all property is sold.
(C) The Administrative Officer may determine that these changes constitute a minor modification if they meet the requirements contained herein. Changes to these documents which would alter design aspects of the project, or which are determined by the Administrative Officer to be beyond the scope of minor modification require rezoning. Covenants and any horizontal property ownership and owners’ association documents shall reflect the provisions of this section.
(D) A planned development containing common facilities shall be provided with an owners’ association or other private organization responsible to and controlled by the property owners. This organization’s purpose is to ensure adequate operation and maintenance of these common facilities, which may include but are not limited to private streets, common
69
areas, landscaping, and amenities such as a clubhouse, pool or tennis courts. Recorded legal assurances shall be provided which show this organization to be self-perpetuating.
(E) All streets and roadways not dedicated to nor accepted by a public agency, and all other common facilities not dedicated to the public, shall be operated and maintained at no expense to any governmental unit.

The Executive Director shall make an appropriate investigation and determine if the complaint is meritorious, and if so, refer the same to the BZA for determination as to whether or not the BZA seek remedies available to it including, but not limited to, fines and/or injunctive relief, temporary or permanent, which may result in an order requiring the offending WECS to be enjoined from operating. The BZA shall have no jurisdiction with regard to a complainant regarding interference with private telecommunications system and the WECS owner and/or operator, however, nothing in the Zoning Ordinance shall preclude such a complainant from seeking any remedy available to a complainant either at law or in equity, and as there is no administrative remedy for such a complainant, there is no prerequisite administrative action i.e. no exhaustion of an administrative remedy, to preempt or prevent direct action at law or equity by the complainant against the WECS owner and/or operator.
(ii) In order for a complainant to have a valid complaint, the interference with the broadcast and/or reception of residential television, telecommunication, and/or a microwave transmission which is the subject matter of the complaint, such residential television, telecommunication, or microwave transmission shall have been “in service” on or before the date on which the WECS or any part of the WECS causing such interference is issued an Improvement Location Permit. For
155
purposes of this provision, residential television, telecommunication or microwave transmission, the same shall be considered continuous i.e. “in service” if the preceding owner(s) or possessor(s) of the affected real estate had residential television, telecommunication, and/or microwave transmission on or before the date of issuance of the Improvement Location Permit; notwithstanding a reasonable break not to exceed ninety (90) days of “in service” in order to provide a new owner(s) or possessor(s) the opportunity to obtain such services. The break of “in service” either all or part may occur prior to, or subsequent to, the date of issuance of the Improvement Location Permit, however, the same shall not exceed ninety (90) days. Provided, further, the complainant must have comparable service to that of the preceding owner(s) or possessor(s). The Executive Director shall make this provision part of the investigation of the complaint.
16.8.3 Declaration of public nuisance
Any WECS declared unsafe by the Randolph County Building Commissioner by being in breach of, or, out of compliance with its WECS permit(s) may seek to be rehabilitated and declared safe by appropriate repair(s) and other essential steps necessary to eliminate the breach(es) so as to be in compliance with such WECS permit(s). A WECS declared by the Randolph County Building Commissioner by reason of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, obsolescence, fire hazard, damage, abandonment or as provided herein to be determined unsafe, is hereby declared to be a public nuisance. In the absence of such repair and rehabilitation in the time determined reasonable by the Randolph County Building Commissioner which time shall not exceed one hundred eighty (180) days, such WECS shall be demolished and removed in accordance with the approved Decommissioning Plan and Decommissioning Agreement.

ARTICLE XVIII
VARIANCES
A variance is a variation in the development standards and the variations set forth in paragraph 7. of this Article which the Board may grant in certain circumstances according to the provisions set forth from the requirements of the Unified Zoning Ordinance of Randolph County, Indiana, which variation would be in conflict with a literal application Ordinance. A variance shall not include authorizing a use not among the permitted uses specified in this Ordinance for the district in which the property is located.
1. In order that the spirit of this Ordinance may be observed and substantial justice done, the Board of Zoning Appeals may, upon application or appeal, grant the variations set forth in paragraph 7, hereof.
2. The Board shall grant or deny an application for a variance properly filed and which otherwise complies with this Ordinance and the Board’s Rules of Procedure.
3. A variance may be approved only upon a determination in writing that:
a. The approval will not be injurious to the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the community.
b. The use and value of the area adjacent to the property included in the variance will not be affected in a substantially adverse manner; and,
c. That strict applications of the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance will result in practical difficulties in the use of the property.
4. In making its determination as to whether there are “practical difficulties in the use of the property”, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall take into consideration the extent to which the following conditions, all favorable to the applicant or appellant, have been established by the evidence:
a. That the particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical conditions of the specific property involved would result in a particular difficulty upon the owner, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of the regulations were carried out;
b. That the conditions upon which the requested variation is based would not be applicable, generally, to other property within the same zoning classification; and,
c. That the alleged difficulty has not been created by any person presently having an interest in the property.
5. In authorizing a variance the Board may attach thereto such conditions regarding the
location, character and other features of the proposed structure or use, as it may deem
necessary in the interest of the furtherance of the purposes of the Zoning Ordinance
and in the public interest. In authorizing a variance with attached conditions, the
Board shall require such evidence and guarantee of bond, as it may deem necessary,
that the conditions attached are and will be complied with.
171
6. In exercising its power, Board of Zoning Appeals may, in conformity with the
the provisions of the rules, laws of the State of Indiana and of the Zoning Ordinance, reverse or affirm wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination made, and to that end shall have all powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken.
7. Variations from the regulations of the Zoning Ordinance shall be granted by the
Board of Zoning Appeals only in accordance with the standards set forth above and may be granted in the following instances only, and in no others:
(a) to permit the extension and/or substitution of a nonconforming use as provided in Article II of the Zoning Ordinance.
(b) to permit the temporary use of a structure or premises in any district for a purpose or use that does not conform to the regulations prescribed elsewhere in the Zoning Ordinance for the district in which it is located, provided that such use be of a temporary nature and not involve the erection of a substantial structure, and further provided that an Improvement Location Permit for such use shall be granted in the form of a temporary and revocable permit, for not more than a twelve (12) month period. Further, the Board may include any and all conditions to provide conformity to this Article;
(c) to permit extension of any district where the boundary line of a district divides a zoning lot provided that the zoning lot is in single ownership on the effective date of this ordinance;
(d) to permit any yard of less dimension than required by the applicable regulations;
(e) to permit any building or structure to exceed the height limitations imposed by the applicable regulations;
(f) to permit the use of a lot for a use otherwise prohibited because of insufficient lot dimensions or area, but in no event shall the area of the lot be less than ninety (90%) percent of the required lot area;
(g) to permit the use of a lot of record which is less than the prescribed zoning lot in lineal and area dimensions but whose frontage is greater than fifty (50%) percent in width of every improved zoning lot on the same block on the same side of the street at the time of construction provided that if such lot or record is in the same ownership on or after the effective date of the Zoning Ordinance as an adjoining unimproved lot on the same street, it shall not be improved with a residential use unless both lots are combined in a single zoning lot for this purpose or unless further subdivision produces the requisite minimum lot width;
(h) to permit such other variance, not heretofore provided for, required to expand, alter or renovate institutions of public service, religious, philanthropic or eleemosynary use existing on the date of this amendment; and,
(i) any such other duties as may be required by the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance.

1.04 Lot Divided - Extension of District
Except as provided in Article III-I, Agricultural Intensive District, where Zoning District boundary lines divide a lot which was a single ownership at the time of the adoption of this Ordinance, the use authorized thereon and the requirements applying to the least restricted portion of said lot shall be considered as extending to the entire lot and the use so extended shall be deemed to be conforming

Except as hereinafter specified, no land, building, structure or premises shall be hereafter used and no building or part thereof or structure shall be located, erected, moved, reconstructed, extended, enlarged or altered except in conformity with the regulations herein specified for the district in which it is located.
2.02 Permit Required
Unless otherwise specifically provided, no land, building, structure, swimming pool, lake or pond, premises or use shall be hereafter located, erected, moved, reconstructed, extended, enlarged or altered unless and until an Improvement Location Permit has been approved and issued by the Area Planning Commission. Provided, however, and notwithstanding the regulations contained herein, an Improvement Location Permit shall not be required for the construction or erection of a fence or to change the use of land, buildings or structures to another use which is permitted in that zoning district and similar in character and intensity as the previous use. An Improvement Location Permit shall be required in the event of a dispute as to the applicability of this section.
2.03 Nonconforming Structures
Where a legally established structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance that could not be built under the terms of the ordinance by reason of restrictions on area, lot width, height, setbacks or other requirements concerning the structure, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions:
a. No such legally established nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increased its nonconformity but any structure or portions thereof may be altered to decrease its nonconformity. A single-family dwelling may be enlarged and an Improvement Location Permit shall be issued without a variance hearing provided that setbacks and requirements other than those applying to area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such a lot is located.
b. Legally established nonconforming structures may be restored to their original dimensions and conditions if damaged or partially destroyed by fire or other disaster provided the damage or destruction does not exceed sixty percent (60%) of the gross floor area of the building, structure or facilities affected.
c. Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the district in which it is located after it is moved.
2.04 Nonconforming Lot Size
No yard or lot existing at the effective date of adoption or amendment of the ordinance shall be reduced in a dimension or area below the minimum requirements set forth herein. Yards or lots created after the effective date of this ordinance shall meet at least the minimum requirements established by this ordinance.
2
2.05 Nonconformity and Discontinuation
The legally established nonconforming use or occupancy of any lot, building or structure existing at the time of the effective date of this Ordinance may be continued as a legally established nonconforming use as such use, building or structure existed before the effective date of this ordinance. Provided, however, if such legally established nonconforming use is discontinued for one year, any future use or occupancy of said land shall be in conformity with the provisions of this Ordinance. As provided by IC 36-7-4-616, any legally established nonconforming agricultural use of land may continue as long as the land is used for agricultural purposes for any three year period in a five year period.
2.06 Substitution and Extension of Nonconforming Uses
A legally established nonconforming use of any lot, building or structure may be
substituted with another similar nonconforming use provided such substituted similar nonconforming use is not more objectionable, is operated within the same confines, and does not increase parking and traffic. An existing nonconforming use may be extended consistent with the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance and Indiana law. In all cases involving the substitution of a nonconforming use or the extension of a nonconforming use, the person seeking to substitute or extend the nonconforming use shall file a petition with the Board of Zoning Appeals which shall hold a hearing upon such petition after proper notice of such hearing has been given.
2.07 Nonconforming Use Changed to Conforming Use
Any nonconforming use of a lot, building or structure which changes to a conforming use, the use of such lot, building or structure shall not thereafter be changed to a nonconforming use.

2.09 Nonconforming Use Repair and Alteration
The maintenance and repair of any legally established nonconforming building or building occupied by a legally established nonconforming use may be completed provided no structural alterations or additions may be made except as required by law.
2.10 Nonconforming Lots of Record
In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of record, which was conforming prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this ordinance, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this ordinance. Such lot must be in separate ownership and not of continuous frontage with other lots in the same ownership or under control of the same owner. These provisions shall apply even though such lots fail to meet the requirements of area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district, provided that setbacks and requirements other than those applying to area or width, or both, of
3
the lot shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. Variance of setbacks shall be obtained only through action of the Board of Zoning Appeals. If two or more lots or combination of lots and portions of lots with continuous frontage in single ownership or under the control of single ownership are of record at the time of passage or amendment of this ordinance and if all or part of the lots do not meet the requirements established for lot width and area, the lands involved shall be considered to be an undivided parcel for the purposes of this ordinance, and no portion of said parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which diminishes compliance with lot width and area requirements established by this ordinance, nor shall any division of any parcel be made which creates a lot with width or area below the requirements stated in this ordinance.
2.11 Additional Permitted Uses
Uses other than those specifically mentioned in this Ordinance as permitted uses in each of the Zoning Districts may also be allowed therein, except for uses prohibited in a less restrictive district and provided that, if such other uses are of similar character to those mentioned and will have no adverse influence or no more adverse influence on adjacent properties or the neighborhood or community than permitted uses specifically mentioned for the district.

ARTICLE VII
Planned Development District
7.01 Intent
(A) PD zoning may be used to foster innovative and diverse design in land development that is still consistent with both the adopted Comprehensive Plan and the intent of the Unified Zoning and Subdivision Ordinances. To achieve this, the Plan Commission does not apply any other provisions of this Chapter. Instead, the Plan Commission negotiates a specific development plan with the petitioner for PD zoning and representatives of the checkpoint agencies. The combined elements of this negotiated plan, rather than the zoning regulations, then become the subject of the rezoning process. All restrictions and regulations for a specific Planned Development are thus contained within the approved and recorded plan itself, having been arrived at prior to rezoning. PD zoning may be applied to existing development or to open land, on small or larger tracts.
(B) The Plan Commission’s goal is to provide a widening variety of environmentally appropriate residential, nonresidential and mixed use developments to meet the needs of the community. To help create attractive, healthful, efficient and stable places to live, shop and work, the Plan Commission encourages use of PD zoning within the following contexts:
(1) to accommodate compatible development in environmentally sensitive locations;
(2) to enhance compatibility with surrounding land uses;
(3) to permit a harmonious variety of uses within a single development;
(4) to promote efficiency and thus economy by clustering structures and/or by using shared facilities or services;
(5) to foster new site treatments not contemplated in other kinds of zones.
7.02 Origination of Proposals
(A) A request to rezone from any other zoning classification to PD zoning may be initiated by:
(1) all owners of the property in question; or
(2) any group of owners united in interest, acting jointly in pursuance to an agreement to carry out the proposal in separate ownership.
(B) Because of the unified design of a planned development and because the combined elements of the negotiated plan are the substance of the zone itself, this ordinance requires that a request to reclassify from PD to PD shall include amongst the petitioners either:
(1) all owners of the property within the current planned development; or
(2) the owner’s association acting on behalf of a majority of the property owners in the current planned development, as constituted in the recorded bylaws.
(C) Also, in keeping with the provisions contained herein, PD zoning is mandatory for any new condominium or condominium conversion.
2
7.03 Classification of Planned Development
(A) To identify the nature of planned development on zoning maps, they shall be classified as one of these four zones:
(1) PDRS, in which all buildings and land are developed for residential use and those activities customarily accessory to residential use;
(2) PDNR, in which no buildings and land are developed for residential use, but rather for commercial and/or industrial and/or recreational and/or some other nonresidential use;
(3) PDMX, in which buildings and land are developed as a mix of both residential and nonresidential uses;
(4) PDCC, in which the only change proposed involves either:
(a) the conversion to condominium ownership of a development which has received occupancy permits for all parts no less than three years prior; or
(b) the conversion to condominium ownership of an existing building in any zone; where there is no further division of land involved.
7.04 Pre-Submission Conference
(A) No pre-submission conference is required before submitting a rezoning request to PDCC.
(B) Before submitting any of the materials required for a rezoning request to either PDRS, PDNR or PDMX, the petitioner shall arrange a meeting with staff and the appropriate Administrative Officer.
(C) The petitioner shall bring to this meeting a drawing or sketch of the proposed planned development that :
(1) is at least approximately scaled;
(2) includes the entire tract;
(3) shows, in at least schematic detail, location of proposed uses and major buildings, layout and classification of roads, all entrances and exits, any environmentally sensitive areas;
(4) proposes treatment of environmentally sensitive areas;
(5) indicates phasing and a time frame for development.
(D) Discussion at this meeting shall include:
(1) the intent and requirements of PD zoning;
(2) the petitioner’s intentions and objectives regarding land use, street improvements, utilities and similar matters;
(3) the petitioner’s intentions assuring compatibility between uses proposed for the perimeter of the PD and surrounding land uses and zoning classifications;
(4) general availability of utilities to the site;
(5) the area’s current zoning pattern and all elements of the Comprehensive Plan;
(6) specific materials and documents required herein to be included with the submission, and a list of checkpoint agencies to be involved;
(7) classification of the proposed rezoning as either PDRS, PDNR, or PDMX; and
(8) a proposed schedule for the rezoning process.
3
7.05 Filing Requirements for a PD Rezoning Request With Draft Plan
(A) After a pre-submission meeting, or to initiate a PDCC action, the petitioner may file a rezoning request to one of the PD classifications.

(4) two Notices of Public Hearing, each with a metes and bounds or other proper legal description and the common address or location of the property;
(5) a typed original and three copies of the proposed ordinance to rezone the property, using the sample format provided by staff;
(6) three sets of drawings, labeled Draft Plan, using the format prescribed by the Plan Commission, to include a published and recorded boundary survey meeting the requirements of IAC Title 865 Article 1 Rule 12 or its successor, plus a full and detailed site analysis and proposed site plan, utilities plan and landscape plan;
(7) if dividing land, three copies of the preliminary plan, prepared by a Registered Land Surveyor or Engineer;
(8) three copies of any proposed covenants and horizontal property ownership and owner’s association documents, each of which shall include a Table of Contents and be written in plain language easily understood by most readers; and

(B) A complete PDRS, PDNR or PDMX Final Detailed Plans submission shall contain the following:
(1) evidence that any conditions imposed by the Plan Commission at the time of its hearing have been met. If Final Detailed Plans for only part of the project are being submitted, only those conditions bearing on that part need be met;
(2) ten sets of drawings, labeled Final Detailed Plans, consisting of all the elements of the Approved Preliminary Plan, plus full construction plans for all public improvements to be installed by the developer.
(3) ten signed copies of any covenants and horizontal property ownership and owners’ association documents. These shall include a Table of Contents and be written in plain language easily understood by most readers. The number of copies shall be determined by staff.
(4) a release from the mortgage company, if any, covering the necessary right-of-way, where right-of-way is to be dedicated.
(5) if one or more lots are being created, the petitioner shall provide ten copies and a reproducible Mylar of the signed final plat, prepared by a registered land surveyor or engineer, with a Planned Development Dedication Certificate appended. The petitioner may either submit this final plat along with items (1) through (4) above or at a later time. In either event, the final plat is a part of the Final Detailed Plans, and as such, no Improvement Location Permit shall be issued until the plat is approved and recorded.
(C) If public improvements or improvements for common usage are to be installed by the petitioner, he or she shall either:
(1) complete the improvement upon approval of the construction plans portion of the Final Detailed Plans; or

No Improvement Location Permit for a dwelling unit shall be issued until surety has been provided.
(D) If the Plan Commission finds the submission of the Final Detailed Plans (with final plat, or final plat alone after previous portions of Final Detailed Plans have been approved) to conform to the Approved Preliminary Plan as adopted by the legislative body at the time of rezoning, the Plan Commission shall adopt a resolution. After this resolution is adopted, the petitioner shall not submit an alternative or revised set of Final Detailed Plans for the same legal description, except under circumstances described herein.
(E) The adopted resolution shall be signed and dated by the President and Secretary of the Plan Commission, and a copy shall be attached to the front of each set of approved Final Detailed Plans.
(F) Adoption of a resolution shall neither constitute nor imply a participating jurisdiction’s acceptance of any street, easement or park shown in Final Detailed Plans. Acceptance is only that of real property itself. The Plan Commission may require notes to this effect.
8
7.11 Recording Approved Detailed Plans
(A) Before performing any development, construction or earth moving activity, or applying for Improvement Location Permits, or filing any required condominium documents, the petitioner shall record the Approved Final Detailed Plans in the Office of the Recorder of Randolph County.
(B) The staff shall accompany the petitioner in the recording process. Final Detailed Plans shall first be stamped and dated in the County Auditor’s Office, with one set of plans given the County Auditor. The remaining sets of Final Detailed Plans shall then be stamped, numbered and recorded at the County Recorder’s Office, and then distributed by the petitioner. The staff shall provide the petitioner a list of agencies to which the petitioner shall distribute sets of approved and recorded plans. The petitioner shall keep at least one set.
(C) If the petitioner fails to record the Final Detailed Plans for all or any part of the entire project within thirty days of the date of their approval, that approval expires. In order to continue, the petitioner shall resubmit Final Detailed Plans for approval.
(D) Any construction that does not fully comply with recorded Final Detailed Plans will be subject to appropriate enforcement action.
7.12 Amending Recorded Final Detailed Plans
(A) A property owner may wish to make changes to a PDRS, PDNR or PDMX project after Final Detailed Plans have been recorded. If these changes are determined to conform to the Approved Preliminary Planned Development as adopted by the legislative body, and to constitute a minor modification only, then changes shall be recorded as an Amended Final Detailed Plans.
(1) this written determination of conformance and minor modification shall be made and signed by the appropriate Administrative Officer and attached to each copy of the Amended Final Detailed Plans before recording
(2) a minor modification cannot include: any increase in residential density; any change in building dimension or location unless all other development standards set forth are met; any change in lot lines; any change in landscaping other than substitution of species or redesign with the same materials; any alteration in the size and/or location of signs; any change in type of land use; any change in the alignment or intersection of streets unless requested or required by the appropriate governmental agency; or any change in restrictive covenants, or horizontal ownership and owners’ association documents regarding these items;
(3) submission requirements and a timetable for seeking a determination of conformance and minor modification shall be set by each Administrative Officer;
(4) changes beyond the scope of minor modification require rezoning.
(B) For any newly constructed condominium project or attached zero-lot-line project, the property owners shall provide exact measurements locating buildings and common lot lines after foundations have been put in place. The revised plat reflecting exact locations needs to be approved and signed by the appropriate Administrative Officer as Amended Final Detailed Plans and recorded.
9
7.13 Lapsed and Abandoned Planned Developments
(A) An intended condominium conversion has lapsed if two years have passed since the date on which rezoning to PDCC was granted, and no Final Detailed Plans have been approved and recorded. Following such lapse, the Plan Commission shall initiate a petition to rezone the property to its previous classification(s).
(B) A planned development has been abandoned if two years have passed since the date on which rezoning to PDRS, PDNR or PDMX was granted, and no Final Detailed Plans have been approved and recorded for the project or any part or phase of it; or
(C) Parts or phases of a planned development have been abandoned if ten years have passed since the date on which rezoning to PDRS, PDNR or PDMX was granted, and only Final Detailed Plans for other parts or phases have been approved and recorded.
(D) An Administrative Officer cannot issue an Improvement Location Permit for an abandoned planned development or an abandoned part or phase of a planned development. An abandoned planned or abandoned part or phase shall be rezoned (and if to a PD classification, comply with the provisions contained herein) before the property’s owner once more becomes eligible to receive an Improvement Location Permit at that location.
(E) Neither the Plan Commission nor any legislative body shall initiate a petition to rezone any PD-zoned property unless it has either lapsed or been abandoned.
7.14 Covenants and Maintenance
(A) To assure property owners that all aspects of a planned development remain in conformance with plans adopted by the legislative body at the time of rezoning, restrictive covenants and any horizontal property ownership and owners’ association documents can only be changed through the procedures contained herein.
(B) These changes may be initiated only by a majority of property owners within the planned development. Multiple owners of a single property shall be considered a single owner. The developer shall be considered a single owner until all property is sold.
(C) The Administrative Officer may determine that these changes constitute a minor modification if they meet the requirements contained herein. Changes to these documents which would alter design aspects of the project, or which are determined by the Administrative Officer to be beyond the scope of minor modification require rezoning. Covenants and any horizontal property ownership and owners’ association documents shall reflect the provisions of this section.
(D) A planned development containing common facilities shall be provided with an owners’ association or other private organization responsible to and controlled by the property owners. This organization’s purpose is to ensure adequate operation and maintenance of these common facilities, which may include but are not limited to private streets, common areas, landscaping, and amenities such as a clubhouse, pool or tennis courts. Recorded legal assurances shall be provided which show this organization to be self-perpetuating.
(E) All streets and roadways not dedicated to nor accepted by a public agency, and all other common facilities not dedicated to the public, shall be operated and maintained at no expense to any governmental unit.

ARTICLE VIII
FLOOD HAZARD AREAS
8.01 Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact, Purpose, and Objectives
8.01.1 Statutory Authorization
The Indiana Legislature has in IC 36-7-4 and IC 14-28-4 granted the power to local government units to control land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the Randolph County Commissioners do hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations.
8.01.2 Findings of Fact
1) The flood hazard areas of Randolph County, the City of Winchester, the Town of Farmland, the Town of Ridgeville, the City of Union City and the Town of Parker City are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
2) These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
8.01.3 Statement of Purpose
It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
1) Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities.
2) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction.
3) Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters.
4) Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage.
5) Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
6) Make federally subsidized flood insurance available for structures and their contents in the County by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program.
8.01.4 Objectives
The objectives of this ordinance are:
1) To protect human life and health.
2) To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects.
2
3) To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public.
4) To minimize prolonged business interruptions.
5) To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in floodplains.
6) To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas.
7) To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood area.
8.02 Definitions
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this ordinance shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this ordinance it’s most reasonable application. The following definitions will be given precedence in the interpretation of Article VIII over any duplicate definitions in Article XIII.
A zone Portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A zones, floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE, Zones A1-A30, Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone A99 on a FIRM or FHBM. The definitions are presented below:
Zone A Areas subject to inundation by the one-percent annual chance flood event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base flood elevation or depths are shown. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply.
Zone AE and A1-A30
Areas subject to inundation by the one-percent annual chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are shown within these zones. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply. (Zone AE is on new and revised maps in place of Zones A1-A30.)
Zone AO Areas subject to inundation by one-percent annual chance shallow flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply.
Zone AH Areas subject to inundation by one-percent annual chance shallow flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply.
Zone AR Areas that result from the decertification of a previously accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the process of being restored to
3
provide base flood protection. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply.
Zone A99 Areas subject to inundation by the one-percent annual chance flood event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an under-construction Federal flood protection system. These are areas of special flood hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a protection system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it complete for insurance rating purposes. Zone A99 may only be used when the flood protection system has reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base flood elevations or depths are shown. Mandatory flood insurance purchase requirements apply.
Accessory structure (appurtenant structure)
A structure that is located on the same parcel of property as the principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure. Accessory structures should constitute a minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of accessory structures are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds.
Addition (to an existing structure)
Any walled and roofed expansion to the perimeter of a structure in which the addition is connected by a common load-bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and roofed addition, which is connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing walls, is new construction.
Appeal A request for a review of the floodplain administrator’s interpretation of any provision of this ordinance or a request for a variance.
Area of shallow flooding
A designated AO or AH Zone on the community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
Base Flood Elevation (BFE)
The elevation of the one-percent annual chance flood.
Basement That portion of a structure having its floor sub-grade (below ground level) on all sides.
Building see "Structure."
Community A political entity that has the authority to adopt and enforce floodplain ordinances for the area under its jurisdiction.

Critical facility A facility for which even a slight chance of flooding might be too great. Critical facilities include, but are not limited to, schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire, and emergency response installations, installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials or hazardous waste.
Development Any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate including but not limited to:
1) construction, reconstruction, or placement of a structure or any addition to a structure;
2) installing a manufactured home on a site, preparing a site for a manufactured home or installing a recreational vehicle on a site for more than 180 days;
3) installing utilities, erection of walls and fences, construction of roads, or similar projects;
4) construction of flood control structures such as levees, dikes, dams, channel improvements, etc.;
5) mining, dredging, filling, grading, excavation, or drilling operations;
6) construction and/or reconstruction of bridges or culverts;
7) storage of materials; or
8) any other activity that might change the direction, height, or velocity of flood or surface waters.
"Development" does not include activities such as the maintenance of existing structures and facilities such as painting, re-roofing; resurfacing roads; or gardening, plowing, and similar agricultural practices that do not involve filling, grading, excavation, or the construction of permanent structures.
Elevated structure A non-basement structure built to have the lowest floor elevated above the ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter walls, filled stem wall foundations (also called chain walls), pilings, or columns (posts and piers).
Elevation Certificate

The official hydraulic and hydrologic report provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the FIRM, FBFM (where applicable), and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
Flood Prone Area Any land area acknowledged by a community as being susceptible to inundation by water from any source. (See “Flood”)
6
Flood Protection Grade (FPG)
The elevation of the regulatory flood plus two feet at any given location in the SFHA. (see “Freeboard”)
Floodplain The channel proper and the areas adjoining any wetland, lake, or watercourse which have been or hereafter may be covered by the regulatory flood. The floodplain includes both the floodway and the fringe districts.
Floodplain Management
The operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans.
Floodplain Management Regulations
This ordinance and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances, and other applications of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state, or local regulations in any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. Floodplain management regulations are also referred to as floodplain regulations, floodplain ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, and floodplain management requirements.
Floodproofing (Dry Floodproofing)
A method of protecting a structure that ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural components of these walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy, and anticipated debris impact forces.

The term does not include long-term storage, manufacture, sales, or service facilities.
Hardship (as related to variances of this ordinance)
The exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The Randolph County Board of Zoning Appeals requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is NOT exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one’s neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.
Highest Adjacent Grade
The highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to the start of construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
Historic Structure Any structure individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites and Structures.
Increased Cost of Compliance (ICC)

Map Panel Number The four-digit number followed by a letter suffix assigned by FEMA on a flood map. The first four digits represent the map panel, and the letter suffix
9
represents the number of times the map panel has been revised. (The letter “A” is not used by FEMA, the letter “B” is the first revision.)
Market Value The building value, excluding the land (as agreed to between a willing buyer and seller), as established by what the local real estate market will bear. Market value can be established by independent certified appraisal, replacement cost depreciated by age of building (actual cash value), or adjusted assessed values.
Mitigation Sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to people and property from hazards and their effects. The purpose of mitigation is two fold: to protect people and structures, and to minimize the cost of disaster response and recovery.

Regulatory flood The flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year, as calculated by a method and procedure that is acceptable to and approved by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The regulatory flood elevation at any location is as defined in Article 3 (B) of this ordinance. The "Regulatory Flood" is also known by the term "Base Flood”, “One-Percent Annual Chance Flood”, and “100-Year Flood”.
Repetitive loss Flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a 10-year period ending on the date of the event for which the second claim is made, in which the cost of repairing the flood damage, on the average, equaled or exceeded 25% of the market value of the structure at the time of each such flood event.
Section 1316 That section of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, which states that no new flood insurance coverage shall be provided for any property that the Administrator finds has been declared by a duly constituted state or local zoning authority or other authorized public body to be in violation of state or local laws, regulations, or ordinances that intended to discourage or otherwise restrict land development or occupancy in flood-prone areas.
Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA)
Those lands within the jurisdictions of the Randolph County subject to inundation by the regulatory flood. The SFHAs of Randolph County, the City of Winchester, the Town of Farmland, the Town of Ridgeville, the City of Union City and the Town of Parker City are generally identified as such on the Randolph County, Indiana and Incorporated Ares Flood Insurance Rate Map prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, dated March 4, 2013. The SFHAs of those parts of unincorporated Randolph County that are within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the City of Winchester, the Town of Farmland, the Town of Ridgeville, the City of Union City and the Town of Parker City or that may be annexed into the City of Winchester, the Town of Farmland, the Town of Ridgeville, the City of Union City and the Town of Parker City are generally identified as such on the Randolph County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map prepared by the Federal
12
Emergency Management Agency and dated March 4, 2013. (These areas are shown on a FHBM or FIRM as Zone A, AE, A1- A30, AH, AR, A99, or AO).
Start of construction
Includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
Structure A structure that is principally above ground and is enclosed by walls and a roof. The term includes a gas or liquid storage tank, a manufactured home, or a prefabricated building. The term also includes recreational vehicles to be installed on a site for more than 180 days.
Substantial damage Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to it’s before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
Substantial improvement
Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred “repetitive loss” or “substantial damage" regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not include improvements of structures to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code requirements or any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structures continued designation as a "historic structure".
Suspension The removal of a participating community from the NFIP because the community has not enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain management regulations required for participation in the NFIP.
13
Variance A grant of relief from the requirements of this ordinance, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this ordinance where specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
Violation The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this ordinance. A structure or other development without the elevation, other certification, or other evidence of compliance required in this ordinance is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
Watercourse A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may occur.
Water surface elevation
The height, in relation to the North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88) or National Geodetic Vertical Datum of 1929 (NGVD) (other datum where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of riverine areas.
X zone The area where the flood hazard is less than that in the SFHA. Shaded X zones shown on recent FIRMs (B zones on older FIRMs) designate areas subject to inundation by the flood with a 0.2 percent chance of being equaled or exceeded (the 500-year flood). Unshaded X zones (C zones on older FIRMs) designate areas where the annual exceedance probability of flooding is less than 0.2 percent.
Zone A geographical area shown on a FHBM or FIRM that reflects the severity or type of flooding in the area.
Zone A (see definition for A zone)
Zone B, C, and X Areas identified in the community as areas of moderate or minimal hazard from the principal source of flood in the area. However, buildings in these zones could be flooded by severe, concentrated rainfall coupled with inadequate local drainage systems. Flood insurance is available in participating communities but is not required by regulation in these zones. (Zone X is used on new and revised maps in place of Zones B and C.)
8.03 General Provisions

8.03.2 Basis for Establishing Regulatory Flood Data
14
This ordinance’s protection standard is the regulatory flood. The best available regulatory flood data is listed below. Whenever a party disagrees with the best available data, the party submitting the detailed engineering study needs to replace existing data with better data and submit it to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for review and approval.
1) The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for each of the SFHAs within the jurisdiction of Randolph County, the City of Winchester, the Town of Farmland, the Town of Ridgeville, the City of Union City and the Town of Parker City delineated as an "A Zone" on the Randolph County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and dated March 4, 2013, shall be according to the best data available as provided by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources; provided the upstream drainage area from the subject site is greater than one square mile.
2) If the SFHA within the jurisdiction of the Randolph County, the City of Winchester, the Town of Farmland, the Town of Ridgeville, the City of Union City and the Town of Parker City is delineated as "Zone A" on the Randolph County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency and dated March 4, 2013, the regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits shall be according to the best data available as provided by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources; provided the upstream drainage area from the subject site is greater than one square mile.
3) In the absence of a published FEMA map, or absence of identification on a FEMA map, the regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits of any watercourse in the community’s known flood prone areas shall be according to the best data available as provided by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources; provided the upstream drainage area from the subject site is greater than one square mile.
8.03.3 Establishment of Floodplain Development Permit
A Floodplain Development Permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this ordinance prior to the commencement of any development activities in areas of special flood hazard.
8.03.4 Compliance
No structure shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or structurally altered within the SFHA without full compliance with the terms of this ordinance and other applicable regulations. No land or stream within the SFHA shall hereafter be altered without full compliance with the terms of this ordinance and other applicable regulations.
8.03.5 Abrogation and Greater Restrictions
This ordinance is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this ordinance and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.
8.03.6 Discrepancy between Mapped Floodplain and Actual Ground Elevations
1) In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped floodplain (SFHA) on the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation provided on the profiles shall govern.
15
2) If the elevation of the site in question is below the base flood elevation, that site shall be included in the SFHA and regulated accordingly.
3) If the elevation (natural grade) of the site in question is above the base flood elevation, that site shall be considered outside the SFHA and the floodplain regulations will not be applied. The property owner should be advised to apply for a LOMA.
8.03.7 Interpretation
In the interpretation and application of this ordinance all provisions shall be:
1) Considered as minimum requirements.
2) Liberally construed in favor of the governing body.
3) Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes.
8.03.8 Warning and Disclaimer of Liability
The degree of flood protection required by this ordinance is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Therefore, this ordinance does not create any liability on the part of Randolph County, the City of Winchester, the Town of Farmland, the Town of Ridgeville, the City of Union City and the Town of Parker City, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, or the State of Indiana, for any flood damage that results from reliance on this ordinance or any administrative decision made lawfully thereunder.
8.03.9 Penalties for Violation
Failure to obtain a Floodplain Development Permit in the SFHA or failure to comply with the requirements of a Floodplain Development Permit or conditions of a variance shall be deemed to be a violation of this ordinance. All violations shall be considered a common nuisance and be treated as such in accordance with the provisions of the Zoning Code for Randolph County. All violations shall be punishable by a fine not exceeding $300.00.
1) A separate offense shall be deemed to occur for each day the violation continues to exist.
2) The Randolph County Area Planning Commission shall inform the owner that any such violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and therefore may cause coverage by a Standard Flood Insurance Policy to be suspended.
3) Nothing herein shall prevent the County from taking such other lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible.
8.03.10 Increased Cost of Compliance (ICC)
In order for buildings to qualify for a claim payment under ICC coverage as a “repetitive loss structure”, the National Reform Act of 1994 requires that the building be covered by a contract for flood insurance and incur flood-related damages on two occasions during a 10-year period ending on the date of the event for which the second claim is made, in which the cost of repairing the flood damage, on the average, equaled or exceeded 25 percent of the market value of the building at the time of each such flood event.

e) Access to the enclosed area shall be the minimum necessary to allow for parking for vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance
21
equipment used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or entry to the living area (stairway or elevator).
f) The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate rooms.
g) The interior grade of such enclosed area shall be at an elevation at or higher than the exterior grade.
h) Where elevation requirements exceed 6 feet above the highest adjacent grade, a copy of the legally recorded deed restriction prohibiting the conversion of the area below the lowest floor to a use or dimension contrary to the structure’s originally approved design, shall be presented as a condition of issuance of the final Certificate of Occupancy.
5) Structures Constructed on Fill. A residential or nonresidential structure may be constructed on a permanent land fill in accordance with the following:
a) The fill shall be placed in layers no greater than 1 foot deep before compacting to 95% of the maximum density obtainable with either the Standard or Modified Proctor Test method.
b). The fill should extend at least ten feet beyond the foundation of the structure before sloping below the FPG.
c). The fill shall be protected against erosion and scour during flooding by vegetative cover, riprap, or bulkheading. If vegetative cover is used, the slopes shall be no steeper than 3 horizontal to 1 vertical.
d). The fill shall not adversely affect the flow of surface drainage from or onto neighboring properties.
e). The top of the lowest floor including basements shall be at or above the FPG.
6) Standards for Manufactured Homes and Recreational Vehicles. Manufactured homes and recreational vehicles to be installed or substantially improved on a site for more than 180 days must meet one of the following requirements:
a) The manufactured home shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor shall be at or above the FPG and securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. This requirement applies to all manufactured homes to be placed on a site;
(i) outside a manufactured home park or subdivision;
(ii) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision;
(iii)in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or
(iv)in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a manufactured home has incurred “substantial damage” as a result of a flood.
b) The manufactured home shall be elevated so that the lowest floor of the manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elevations that are no less than 36 inches in height above grade and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. This requirement applies to
22
all manufactured homes to be placed on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision that has not been substantially damaged by a flood.
c) Manufactured homes with fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls below the flood protection grade shall be designed to preclude finished living space and designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls as required for elevated structures in Article 5, Section B. 4.
d) Flexible skirting and rigid skirting not attached to the frame or foundation of a manufactured home are not required to have openings.
e) Recreational vehicles placed on a site shall either:
(i) be on site for less than 180 days; and,
(ii) be fully licensed and ready for highway use (defined as being on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions); or
(iii)meet the requirements for “manufactured homes” as stated earlier in this section.
8.05.3 Standards for Subdivision Proposals
1) All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
2) All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage.

5) All subdivision proposals shall minimize development in the SFHA and/or limit density of development permitted in the SFHA.
6) All subdivision proposals shall ensure safe access into/out of SFHA for pedestrians and vehicles (especially emergency responders).
8.05.4 Critical Facility
Construction of new critical facilities shall be, to the extent possible, located outside the limits of the SFHA. Construction of new critical facilities shall be permissible within the SFHA if no feasible alternative site is available. Critical facilities constructed within the SFHA shall have the lowest floor elevated to or above the FPG at the site. Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above the FPG shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible.
23
8.05.5 Standards for Identified Floodways
Located within SFHAs, established in Section 8.03.2, are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris, potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. If the site is in an identified floodway, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of IC 14-28-1 a permit for construction in a floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is required prior to the issuance of a local building permit for any excavation, deposit, construction, or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing and paving etc. undertaken before the actual start of construction of the structure. However, it does exclude non-substantial additions/improvements to existing (lawful) residences in a non-boundary river floodway. (IC 14-28-1-26 allows construction of non-substantial additions/improvements to residences in a non-boundary river floodway without obtaining a permit for construction in the floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Please note that if fill is needed to elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior approval (construction in a floodway permit) for the fill is required from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.)
No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until a permit (when applicable) has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources granting approval for construction in the floodway. Once a permit for construction in a floodway has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local Floodplain Development Permit, provided the provisions contained in Article 5 of this ordinance have been met. The Floodplain Development Permit cannot be less restrictive than the permit for construction in a floodway issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. However, a community’s more restrictive regulations (if any) shall take precedence.
No development shall be allowed which acting alone or in combination with existing or future development, will increase the regulatory flood more than 0.14 of one foot.
For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including levees) the County shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data.
8.05.6 Standards for Identified Fringe
If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local Floodplain Development Permit provided the provisions contained in Section 8.05 of this ordinance have been met. The key provision is that the top of the lowest floor of any new or substantially improved structure shall be at or above the FPG.
24
8.05.7 Standards for SFHAs Without Established Base Flood Elevation and/or Floodways/Fringes
1) Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile:
If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for review and comment.
No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until either a permit for construction in a floodway or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing the one-percent annual chance flood elevation and the recommended Flood Protection Grade has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.

16.8.2 Interference
Prior to the commencement of construction of a commercial WECS, a communications study shall be conducted by the applicant, owner and/or operator to determine whether or not the operation of the WECS may produce interference with public or public serving utility microwave transmissions and if so, to determine the most effective method to mitigate interference with public or public serving utility microwave transmissions. If necessary, as outlined hereinafter, the applicant, owner and/or operator shall as part of the commercial WECS application process and the commercial WECS construction implement or incorporate the means determined to be the most effective method to mitigate interference with electromagnetic communications including, but not limited to, radio, telephone, microwaves, or television signals caused by the commercial WECS. Applicant, owner and/or operator shall comply with the following:
(A) Preconstruction Requirements
(i) The applicant, owner, and/or operator shall complete a communications study to, among other things, determine the most effective method to mitigate interference with any public or public serving utility microwave transmissions.
(B) Construction
(i) The applicant, owner, and/or operator, as part of a commercial WECS construction, shall implement the method or methods determined by the communications study to be the most effective method to minimize interference with public or public serving utility microwave transmissions.
(C) Post Construction
(i) If, after construction of a commercial WECS, the owner and/or operator receives a written complaint related to interference with the broadcast and/or reception of residential television, telecommunication or microwave transmissions, the WECS owner and WECS operator shall take all additional reasonable steps to mitigate such interference. Interference with private telecommunications system including, but not limited to, Global Positioning System, shall be between the WECS owner and/or WECS operator and the complainant.

ARTICLE XVIII
Variances
A variance is a variation in the development standards and the variations set forth in paragraph 7. of this Article which the Board may grant in certain circumstances according to the provisions set forth from the requirements of the Unified Zoning Ordinance of Randolph County, Indiana, which variation would be in conflict with a literal application Ordinance. A variance shall not include authorizing a use not among the permitted uses specified in this Ordinance for the district in which the property is located.
1. In order that the spirit of this Ordinance may be observed and substantial justice done, the Board of Zoning Appeals may, upon application or appeal, grant the variations set forth in paragraph 7, hereof.
2. The Board shall grant or deny an application for a variance properly filed and which otherwise complies with this Ordinance and the Board’s Rules of Procedure.

a. The approval will not be injurious to the public health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the community.
b. The use and value of the area adjacent to the property included in the variance will not be affected in a substantially adverse manner; and,
c. That strict application of the provisions of the Zoning Ordinance will result in practical difficulties in the use of the property.
4. In making its determination as to whether there are “practical difficulties in the use of the property”, the Board of Zoning Appeals shall take into consideration the extent to which the following conditions, all favorable to the applicant or appellant, have been established by the evidence:
a. That the particular physical surroundings, shape or topographical conditions of the specific property involved would result in a particular difficulty upon the owner, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of the regulations were carried out;
b. That the conditions upon which the requested variation is based would not be applicable, generally, to other property within the same zoning classification; and,
c. That the alleged difficulty has not been created by any person presently having an interest in the property.
5. In authorizing a variance the Board may attach thereto such conditions regarding the location, character and other features of the proposed structure or use, as it may deem necessary in the interest of the furtherance of the purposes of the Zoning Ordinance and in the public interest. In authorizing a variance with attached conditions, the Board shall require such evidence and guarantee of bond, as it may deem necessary, that the conditions attached are and will be complied with.
6. In exercising its power, Board of Zoning Appeals may, in conformity with the provisions of the rules, laws of the State of Indiana and of the Zoning Ordinance, reverse or affirm wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or determination made, and to that end shall have all powers of the officer from whom the appeal is taken.

Further, the Board may include any and all conditions to provide conformity to this Article;
(c) to permit extension of any district where the boundary line of a district divides a zoning lot provided that the zoning lot is in single ownership on the effective date of this ordinance;
(d) to permit any yard of less dimension than required by the applicable regulations;
(e) to permit any building or structure to exceed the height limitations imposed by the applicable regulations;
(f) to permit the use of a lot for a use otherwise prohibited because of insufficient lot dimensions or area, but in no event shall the area of the lot be less than ninety (90%) percent of the required lot area;
(g) to permit the use of a lot of record which is less than the prescribed zoning lot in lineal and area dimensions but whose frontage is greater than fifty (50%) percent in width of every improved zoning lot on the same block on the same side of the street at the time of construction provided that if such lot or record is in the same ownership on or after the effective date of the Zoning Ordinance as an adjoining unimproved lot on the same street, it shall not be improved with a residential use unless both lots are combined in a single zoning lot for this purpose or unless further subdivision produces the requisite minimum lot width;
(h) to permit such other variance, not heretofore provided for, required to expand, alter or renovate institutions of public service, religious, philanthropic or eleemosynary use existing on the date of this amendment; and,
