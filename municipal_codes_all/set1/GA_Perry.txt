State Law reference- Ad valorem taxation of property, O.C.G.A. § 48-5-1 et seq.; municipal taxation generally, O.C.G.A. § 48-5-350 et seq.

    The city council, by ordinance, shall have the power to levy such occupation or business taxes as are not denied by general state law.

Section 6.14. - Franchises.

If unpaid, such charges shall be collected as provided in Section 6.18. 
Section 6.17. - Construction; other taxes. 
    This city shall be empowered to levy any other tax allowed now or hereafter by state law and the specific mention of any right, power, or authority in this article shall not be construed as limiting in any way the general powers of this city to govern its local affairs. 
Section 6.18. - Collection of delinquent taxes and fees. 
    The city council, by ordinance, may provide generally for the collection of delinquent taxes, fees, or other revenue due the city by whatever reasonable means as are not precluded by general state law.

Section 6.22. - Fiscal year. 
    Unless otherwise provided by ordinance, the fiscal year of the city shall begin on July 1 and end on June 30. The city council may by ordinance prescribe a different fiscal year. The fiscal year shall constitute the budget year and the year for financial reporting and accounting of each and every office, department, agency, and activity of the city government, unless otherwise provided by general state or federal law. (Ga. Laws 1985, Act No. 20, § 8) 
Section 6.23. - Action by city council on budget. 
(a)  The city council shall adopt and may thereafter amend an annual budget, except that the budget as finally adopted and amended must provide for all expenditures required by state law or by other provisions of this charter and for all debt service requirements for the ensuing fiscal year and the total appropriations from any fund shall not exceed the estimated fund balance, reserves, and revenues. 
(b)  The city council, by ordinance, shall adopt the final budget for the ensuing fiscal year not later than the first day of the fiscal year. If the city council fails to adopt the budget by this date, the amounts appropriated for operation for the current fiscal year shall be deemed adopted for the ensuing fiscal year on a month-to-month basis, with all items prorated accordingly until such time as the city council adopts a budget for the ensuing fiscal year. Such adoption shall take the form of an appropriations ordinance seeking out the estimated revenues in detail by sources and making appropriations according to fund and by organizational unit, purpose, or activity. 
(c)  The amount set out in the adopted budget for each organizational unit shall constitute the annual appropriation for such; and no expenditure shall be made or encumbrance created in excess of the otherwise unencumbered balance of the appropriations or allotment thereof to which it is chargeable unless by a majority vote of the city council. 
Section 6.24. - Tax levies. 
    As the next order of business following adoption of the budget, the city council shall levy, by ordinance, such taxes as are necessary. The taxes and tax rates set by such ordinance shall be such that reasonable estimates of revenues from such levy shall at least be sufficient, together with other anticipated revenues, fund balances, and applicable reserves, to equal the total amount appropriated for each of the several funds set forth in the annual operating budget for defraying the expenses of the general government of this city. 
Section 6.25. - Changes in appropriations. 
    The city council, by majority vote, may make changes in the appropriations contained in the current operating budget at any regular meeting or special or emergency meeting called for such purpose. 
Section 6.26. - Independent audit. 
    There shall be an annual independent audit of all city accounts, funds, and financial transactions by a certified public accountant selected by the city council. The audit shall be conducted according to generally accepted accounting principles. Any audit of any funds by the state or federal governments may be accepted as satisfying the requirements of this charter. Copies of all audit reports shall be available at printing cost to the public. 
Section 6.27. - Contracting procedures. 
    No contract with the city shall be binding on the city unless: 
(1)  It is in writing; 
(2)  It is drawn by or submitted to and reviewed by the city attorney; and 
(3)  It is made or authorized by the city council and such approval is entered in the city council minutes. 
Section 6.28. - Centralized purchasing. 
    The city council may prescribe procedures for a system of centralized purchasing for the city. 
Section 6.29. - Sale of city property. 
(a)  The city council may sell and convey any real or personal property owned or held by the city for governmental or other purposes as provided by general state law. 
(b)  The city council may quitclaim any rights it may have in property not needed for public purposes upon report by the mayor and adoption of a resolution, both finding that the property is not needed for public or other purposes and that the interest of the city is of no readily ascertainable monetary value. 
(c)  Whenever in opening, extending, or widening any street, avenue, alley, or public place of the city, a small parcel or tract of land is cut off or separated by such work from a larger tract or boundary of land owned by the city, the city council may authorize the mayor to execute and deliver in the name of the city a deed conveying said cut-off or separated parcel or tract of land to an abutting or adjoining property owner or owners in exchange for rights of way of said street, avenue, alley, or public place or in settlement of any alleged damages sustained by said abutting or adjoining property owner. All deeds and conveyances heretofore and hereafter so executed and delivered shall convey all title and interest the city has in such property, notwithstanding the fact that no public sale after advertisement was or is hereafter made.

ARTICLE IV(a). - ALCOHOL AND CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE POLICY 

Sec. 2-150. - Policy statement. 
    It is the position of the city that alcohol and controlled substance abuse is the number one health problem in the United States today. The costs involved with this problem include lost jobs, morale problems, injuries, illnesses, and deaths, as well as economic costs such as property damage, tardiness, absenteeism, lost productivity, increased health insurance costs, and the costs involved in replacing and retraining new employees. 
    The use of alcohol and controlled substances by the city employees while on the job constitutes a direct threat to property and the safety of others. The work involved in many positions is inherently dangerous, and the safety of citizens and fellow employees depends upon the ability of employees to think clearly with unimpaired faculties. 
    It is the objective of the city to provide safe and effective public service. To meet this objective, the problem of alcohol and controlled substance abuse must be identified, confronted and defeated. In order to achieve this, the city has developed a comprehensive alcohol and controlled substance policy. This policy consists of three (3) interrelated programs: (1) An employee education/supervisor training program; (2) an employee assistance program (EAP); and (3) an alcohol and controlled substance testing program. Although these programs cost money to implement, they should prove to be cost effective if they eradicate alcohol and controlled substance abuse among all employees. The city considers its employees to be its most valuable resource, and sincerely wishes to assist its employees with any alcohol or controlled substance related problems they might have. As used in this policy, the term "controlled substance" shall have the meaning and include the substances defined as "controlled substances" in the Georgia Controlled Substance Act, O.C.G.A. § 16-13-20, et seq., and especially O.C.G.A. § 16-12-21(4) as said section and said Act shall appear from time to time.

(See attachment D.) 
5.  Upon return to work after participating in a rehabilitation program, random testing will be conducted, at least quarterly, for a twelve-month period. (See attachment E.) 
(Ord. No. 2004-18, § 2, 3-16-04) 
Sec. 2-152. - A procedural guide to the city alcohol and controlled substance policy. 
A.  Introduction. The problem of alcohol and controlled substance abuse has reached epidemic proportions in the United States. Although controlled substance abuse continues to receive a large amount of attention from the news media, alcohol remains the biggest substance abuse problem in the American workplace. 
It is likely that some of these individuals are employed by the city. Although it would be pleasant to assume that all employees never break the law, or report to work under the influence of alcohol or a controlled substance, such an "ostrich-like" approach ignores the fact that substance abuse is a major public health problem. This problem must be squarely dealt with. Employees abusing alcohol and controlled substances are more apt to be involved in accidents, and have a higher absentee rate than non-abusers. To combat this problem the city has developed a comprehensive alcohol and controlled substance policy that shall apply to all employees. 
B.  Overview of the alcohol and controlled substance policy. The alcohol and controlled substance policy of the city is made up of three (3) separate but interrelated programs: 
1.  An employee awareness/supervisor training program; 
2.  An employee assistance program (EAP); 
3.  An alcohol and controlled substance screening test program. 
The overall responsibility for the alcohol and controlled substance policy lies with the program manager. (See attachment F.) Drug tests and any other expenditures for program costs will be cleared through and approved by the personnel director and the city manager. Although it was already prohibited for an employee of the city to be "under the influence of alcohol and/or nonprescribed drugs on the job," this alcohol and controlled substance policy was developed to prevent illicit use of alcohol or controlled substances by city employees without violating the legal rights of those employees. In order to do this, it is necessary that supervisors at every level within the city understand the policy, follow the policy, and give the policy their full support. This will lead to greater acceptance and understanding of the policy more easily attained. 
The policy has five (5) primary goals. These are: 
(A)  Prevention. To prevent the abuse of alcohol and controlled substances by the city employees. 
It is universally accepted that alcohol and controlled substance abuse is destructive. Yet many individuals start or continue these habits because they lack reliable information about devastating effects of alcohol and controlled substance abuse. The policy seeks to educate the employees about the facts behind substance abuse so that they can see the potential effects of this behavior. This should help prevent employees from developing alcohol or controlled substance-related problems. The policy also seeks to educate and motivate the "nonusing" coworkers so that they will encourage employees to seek help. Peer group pressure can be an extremely powerful force. 
The policy also seeks to communicate to the employees the fact that the city is concerned about alcohol and controlled substance abuse among its employees, and that the city will do everything within its power to prevent such abuse. 
(B)  Cost effectiveness. To combat the abuse of alcohol and controlled substance in a way that is cost effective. 
Although alcohol and controlled substance abuse is recognized primarily for its "human" costs, the economic costs associated with the problem are also unacceptable. Properly instituted, the policy will increase worker productivity, and decrease absenteeism, accidents, and health care costs. 
As a good many of the workers affected by the policy are in safety-sensitive positions, the policy will also help decrease the changes of the city being held legally liable for acts committed by an impaired employee. 
Finally, the policy should improve employee retention rates, thereby lowering employee "turn-over" costs such as hiring and training new employees to replace those who have quit or have been terminated due to alcohol and controlled substance abuse. 
(C)  Clear communication of city's policy. To clearly communicate the position of the city regarding the abuse of alcohol and controlled substances. 
The policy seeks to effectively communicate to each employee and the general public the position that alcohol and controlled substance abuse will not be tolerated among employees of the city. Employee awareness of this position and of the mechanisms to enforce this position should act as a deterrent to substance abuse. Additionally, awareness on the part of employees may encourage those who believe they might have a problem to seek assistance. Awareness of the provisions of the policy should lead to greater compliance with the policy by all employees. 
Furthermore, publicity about the policy should act to increase public respect for the employees of the city. Implementing such a policy reassures the citizens that city employees are not entitled to a double standard, that they do in fact obey the law, and that they will continue to serve as role models for citizens of all ages. The policy will also reassure the public that city services paid for by tax dollars are the safest and most effective services available. 
(D)  Provide assistance to alcohol/controlled substance dependent employees. To provide assistance to employees who need it. 
A chemically dependent individual is not able to control his/her alcohol or controlled substance intake. The policy recognizes this fact by providing for discretionary department director referral to the employee assistance program. (See attachment F.) This in not a device for the employee to use to "get around the rules". Rather, the decision to terminate or to refer to the EAP is to be made in accordance with this policy. 
The decision to terminate an employee is a drastic one, with personal, economic, and possible legal consequences. 
It is not a decision to be made lightly. If an employee has exhibited substance dependence, it may be more beneficial to the city and the employee to present that employee with a "firm choice" between rehabilitation or termination. Most experts agree that a substance abuser must face a "firm choice" before a rehabilitation program can succeed. This is not to say that all employees violating the alcohol and controlled substance policy will be given a "firm choice". If an employees' policy violation does not involve evidence of alcohol/controlled substance dependence, there would be no reason to refer the employee to EAP. 
(E)  Legal method of control. To provide a legal means to employee control. 
One of the challenges facing the city is to devise a way to test employees for alcohol or controlled substance use that would withstand legal challenge. It is necessary for the city to control its employees as it may be held liable for injuries to coworkers or the public caused by impaired employees. At the same time, the city employees have rights that need to be protected. The policy balances these two interests, by stating precisely what is expected of the employees, as well as explaining what will happen should a violation occur. 
C.  Specific guidelines on policy administration. The preceding section of this guide discussed some of the general considerations behind the alcohol and controlled substance policy. The next section of the guide will provide practical assistance in implementing the three (3) programs within the policy. 
1.  Implementing the alcohol/controlled substance awareness program. The basic idea behind this program is that employee alcohol/controlled substance abuse can be prevented by supplying the employees with information about the problems alcohol/controlled substance abuse can create. The awareness program is subdivided into two (2) sections, an employee education section to include all city employees and a supervisor training section. 
The city will work with local resources to provide instruction and materials for training programs. Awareness services are provided by various hospitals, clinics, and organizations such as Alcoholics Anonymous. 
The employee education section will provide: 
a.  Educational seminars; 
b.  Questionnaires at both the start and the completion of the program (to chart belief/knowledge changes); 
c.  Audiovisual programs; 
d.  Group discussions; 
e.  A presentation of what a treatment program is, what it does, and how to take advantage of one; and 
f.  A description and discussion of the city alcohol and controlled substance policy. 
The supervisor training section will focus on the important role supervisors have in preventing alcohol/controlled substance abuse. This program will include: 
a.  Instruction in identifying warning signs of alcohol/controlled substance abuse by employees; 
b.  Role-playing scenarios; 
c.  Group discussions; 
d.  First-line supervisors and upper-level supervisors, during which first-line supervisors should be assured of the support they will receive should they intervene with a problem employee; and 
e.  A thorough presentation of the alcohol and controlled substance policy, with particular emphasis placed upon the procedural requirements involved with disciplining employees. 
2.  Implementing the employee assistance program. 
a.  The employee assistance program. The reference point and clearing house of the EAP will be the Houston Health Care Complex. The EAP will be provided with proper resources to interview employees and refer them to appropriate rehabilitation/treatment programs. The EAP office will not be located in the department of personnel. Employees will be hesitant to avail themselves of the EAP if it appears adverse employment action will be taken against them, in spite of the employer assurance to the contrary. 
The confidentiality of the records of the coordinator will be assured to further promote employee trust and confidence in the EAP. For purposes of statistical reporting, names and dates will not be released. However, the coordinator will have the authority to sideline an employee who has informed the coordinator that he/she is presently impaired. The notion of confidentiality does not give an impaired employee the right to continue working simply because he/she accessed the EAP. In such a situation, the coordinator will seek a "disability leave" or some other type of action that will not label the employee as an alcoholic or drug user. 
b.  Employee's completion of EAP. If an employee must take time off to take part in a rehabilitation program, the absence will be treated as sick leave, annual or leave without pay for seniority purposes. 
If the employee was referred to the EAP by his department director or his designee, upon returning to work, the employee will be subject to unannounced alcohol/controlled substance screening tests for a period of twelve (12) months. These tests will be administered approximately every three (3) months, with an emphasis on post-weekend (Monday) testing. However, an element of surprise must be retained, so a fixed schedule will not be established. Management should refrain from directing the administration of more than one (1) screening test per month, unless the circumstances clearly require more frequent testing. 
c.  Financing the EAP. An outside EAP professional will be utilized as the EAP coordinator at no charge. The cost of the rehabilitation programs themselves will be covered as any other medical problem by the employee's health insurance. 
3.  Implementing the alcohol and controlled substances screening test program. 
a.  Establishing necessary test procedure. The first step in implementing the screening test program will be to provide employees proper notice. Copies of the alcohol and controlled substance policy will be distributed to each affected employee through in-house orientation programs within each department and bulletin board postings. 
After policy distribution has occurred, the city will establish a professional relationship with a quality laboratory certified through NIDA-DHHS. 
The city will establish the procedure involved with the collection of samples. Samples will be collected at the alcohol testing laboratory/agent or drug testing collection agency (see attachment F); samples will not be collected at the workplace. The samples will be carefully checked and marked with the name of the employee, the date the sample was collected, and the location where the sample was collected. A chain of custody/control will be established so that samples are properly handled before testing occurs. Every effort must be made to assure that the sample being tested is the sample actually collected from the employee/applicant in question. 
When testing for alcohol, the standard Breathalyser used for DUI suspects is sufficient. The city policy is that, any alcohol content (BAC) level indicates policy violation. The employee has the right to request a blood test if he/she so desires. This test will be conducted at the employee's expense. 
Although some laboratories have their own policies, the city will establish which chemical tests are to be performed on the urine samples. For controlled substance testing, urine samples will be used, and the presence of foreign metabolites in urine will indicate a violation of this policy. 
However, alternatives such as blood tests and hair analysis may be interpreted as more intrusive, and may be used if necessary. 
There are a variety of chemical tests that can be performed on urine samples to detect controlled substance abuse. The most widely used technique is called immuno-assay technique. The immuno-assay technique has a high degree of reliability under "optional" conditions, but can produce, in certain cases, false positive rates. The manufacturers of the leading immuno-assay counsel that every positive immuno-assay test should be confirmed by another more elaborate and expensive test method. 
The confirmatory methods include thin layer chromatography, gas chromatography, and gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Ideally, all samples that test positive should be confirmed with one of the three (3) confirmatory techniques. 
Finally, in establishing necessary test procedures, the city will decide which substances are to be tested for. The Official Georgia Code Annotated lists over one hundred ninety-three (193) controlled substances, the possession or use of which is illegal. The cost of individual tests for each substance would probably be prohibitive. Additionally, urinalysis tests are directed at drug use and do not detect alcohol in the bloodstream. Thus, the city will establish testing for alcohol by use of the Breathalyser, and the use of urinalysis to detect controlled substances such as marijuana (THC), cocaine, amphetamines, barbiturates, etc. 
b.  Issues and procedures involved with testing. Testing will begin upon implementation of this policy. The alcohol and controlled substance policy provides for testing in five (5) different situations: 
(1)  Pre-employment for employees in safety-sensitive positions of sworn police personnel, trained firefighter, police reserve officers, utility employees handling gas service, city drivers and operators of heavy equipment. 
(2)  The "reasonable suspicion" test; 
(3)  Following accidents of any employees involving property damage or personal injury; 
(4)  Random testing when employed in safety-sensitive positions which include sworn police personnel, trained firefighters, police reserve officers, utility employees handling gas service, city drivers and operators of heavy equipment. 
(5)  Random testing upon return to work after participating in a rehabilitation program. 
(A)  The pre-employment test. 
(1)  During the final interview process the job applicant for safety-sensitive positions will be provided with a copy of the "pre-employment consent and notice" form. 
(2)  At that time, the alcohol and controlled substance policy will be explained to the applicant and the pre-employment consent and notice" form will be signed by the applicant. 
(3)  Should the applicant refuse to sign the consent form, the application process will continue. On the application it will be noted only that the applicant "refused test". It will not mention suspected alcohol or drug use by the applicant. The applicant has the right to refuse to consent to the test, but the city has the parallel right to refuse to hire the applicant. 
(4)  Should an inquiry as to that specific application be made by the applicant or a third party at a later date, the city must be sure to protect the confidentiality of the application process. For instance, if another employer contacts the city in the context of the reference check, the only information that will be supplied is that the applicant did apply and that the applicant "failed to meet the qualifications necessary for employment". It will never be revealed that the applicant refused to consent to an alcohol/controlled substances test. 
(5)  If the applicant being considered for a position consents to the test and the test results are negative, the applicant will continue with the hiring process. 
(6)  Should the test results be positive, the test must be confirmed. If the confirmatory test also indicates the presence of alcohol or controlled substances, the applicant will be assumed to be in violation of this policy and will no longer be considered for employment. Inquiries to a specific application will be advised the applicant "failed to meet the qualifications necessary for employment". 
(B)  The test upon "reasonable suspicion". 
(1)  The test upon "reasonable suspicion" involves a great deal of discretion on the part of the supervisory personnel. 
(2)  The supervisor training program will provide precise guidelines as to what is involved with identifying a potential alcohol or controlled substance abuser. The task of identifying potential abusers does not include diagnosing a worker. The fact that a problem exists is all that is to be discussed when dealing with an employee. 
(3)  When it is suspected that an employee has violated the alcohol and controlled substance policy, the employee will only be told that job-related problems have developed and that it is suspected that these job-related problems are the result of alcohol or controlled substance abuse. The underlying cause of such abuse should not be a concern of the supervisor. 
(4)  The phrase "reasonable suspicion" means just that-a screening test should be administered if it is reasonable to suspect that an employee has violated the policy. A "suspicion" must be based upon objective indications of substance abuse, or other policy violations. 
(5)  There are a few considerations to keep in mind before a test upon reasonable suspicion is administered. Thorough documentation of all steps of the investigation is a must. This will include such items as (1) memos to the personnel file of the employee, stating why a reasonable suspicion exists; (2) notes placed in the file stating the date and time of any discussions with the employee regarding substance abuse, and the employee's reaction; and (3) documentation of any evidence suggesting alcohol or controlled substance abuse. 
(6)  In documenting the investigation, every effort will be made to assure the confidentiality of the case. 
(7)  After it has been determined that a "reasonable suspicion" exists, the next step is to actually test the employee for the presence of alcohol and/or controlled substances. 
(8)  The employee will be called into a private office, informed of the allegations of policy violation, and be requested to sign the "employee consent and notice" form. 
(9)  If the employee refuses to consent to the testing, he/she will be allowed to leave the office. 
(10)  If an employee consents to testing, he/she always has the option of taking a blood test at his/her own expense. This test must be under such circumstances to insure validity of the test. 
(11)  The supervisor should not touch the employee at any time or attempt to coerce the employee into consenting to the screening test. 
(12)  Upon the employee's refusal to consent, he/she may be disciplined. The employee may be terminated for insubordination pursuant to the procedure outlined in the personnel rules and regulations and the alcohol and controlled substance abuse policy. 
(13)  If the employee consents to the screening test, and the confirmed results indicate the presence of alcohol or controlled substances in the employee's system, the employee will be assumed to be in violation of this policy and will be suspended without pay in accordance with this policy and the personnel rules and regulations. 
(14)  If it is determined that a violation of the policy has occurred (the reasonable suspicion has been backed up by a positive confirmed screening test plus any other corroborating evidence of a violation), the employee may be terminated or referred to the EAP. 
(15)  As a practical matter, the fact that the employee's alcohol and/or controlled substance abuse bad affected the employee's work performance to the degree that a reasonable suspicion was developed in the first place should be considered when deciding whether to terminate the employee or refer him/her to the EAP, in addition to the factors discussed earlier in this guide. 
(16)  If the investigation reveals that the employee has not violated the policy, or if the evidence is ambiguous, the employee will be reinstated with back pay. 
(C)  The testing following an accident of any employee which involves property damage or personal injury. 
(1)  At the time a person is employed by the city, the alcohol and controlled substance policy will be explained to them along with city policies regarding accidents and the employee will sign the "employee consent and notice" form. 
(2)  At the time an employee is involved in an accident, the employee will undergo a screen test. 
(3)  The department head or his designee will contact the department of personnel to arrange for the employee to be taken to a city designated physician, medical facility, or police department for testing. 
(4)  Should the employee be injured, the testing will be handled by medical personnel other than those treating the employee for injuries. 
(5)  Should the test results be negative, normal city policy and procedure in dealing with accidents will be followed. 
(6)  Should the confirmed test results indicate the presence of alcohol or controlled substance, the employee will be assumed to be in violation of this policy and may be disciplined, in accordance with the alcohol and controlled substance policy and personnel rules and regulations. 
(7)  If there is sufficient cause to believe that a policy violation has occurred, the employee may be either (a) terminated, pursuant to the procedure set forth in the personnel rules and regulations; or (b) referred to the EAP by his/her department director. 
(8)  If after the investigation has been completed, it is determined that a policy violation has not occurred, the employee will be reinstated with back pay to his/her former position and standard city policy in regard to accidents will be followed. 
(9)  The individual's refusal to sign the consent form at the time of employment, may be grounds for nonhire. (Attachment A) 
(D)  The random testing of safety-sensitive positions of certified law enforcement officers, firefighters, life guards, water/waste water plant operators, utility personnel handling gas service, all city employees assigned or expected to operate a city owned vehicle on public routes and all operators of heavy equipment. 
(1)  The random testing of employees involves periodic testing of all persons authorized by the city to carry firearms or who are otherwise employed in safety-sensitive positions. The names of such employees will be drawn at random throughout the year. A minimum of fifty (50) percent of the workforce will be tested annually. 
(2)  Upon adoption of this policy, all employees holding these safety-sensitive positions will be requested to sign an "employee consent and notice" form. 
(3)  Should the employee refuse to sign the consent form, the employee will be disciplined following the procedure set forth in the city personnel policy. 
(4)  The employee may be terminated for "insubordination", pursuant to the procedure set forth in the personnel policy manual. The stated reasons for terminating an employee will never be "refusal to submit to urinalysis", but rather "insubordination" or "failure to follow the legitimate instructions of the supervisors" or a reason of similar language. 
(5)  If the employee consents to the test and the test results are negative, the employee can return to work. 
(6)  Should the test results indicate the presence of alcohol or controlled substances, that test result must and will be confirmed. 
(7)  If the confirmatory test also indicates the presence of alcohol/controlled substances, the employee will be assumed to be in violation of this policy, and will be disciplined in accordance with the alcohol and controlled substance policy and personnel rules and regulations. 
(8)  An intensive investigation into the employee's background and the circumstances behind the alleged policy violations will take place. After investigation is completed, and there is sufficient cause to believe that a policy violation has occurred, the employee will be either: (a) terminated, pursuant to the procedures set forth in the personnel rules and regulations; or (b) referred to the EAP by his/her department head or his designee. 
(9)  If after the investigation has been completed and it is determined that a policy violation has not occurred (for example, if the employee successfully rebuts the assumption of policy violations by requesting additional testing of the same urine samples or submitting to a blood test, the results of which are negative), the employee will be reinstated with back pay to his/her former position. 
(E)  Testing following return to work after rehabilitation. 
(1)  This random testing of employees follows their return to work after voluntary or department head referral for rehabilitation services. 
(2)  At the time the employee enters into a rehabilitation program, the department head or the department of personnel is notified immediately by the employee or their representative. 
(3)  Upon release from a rehabilitation program the employee will be subject to random alcohol and controlled substance screening tests for a twelve-month period. 
(4)  Prior to returning to work, the employee will be requested to sign an "Employee Consent and Notice" form. Should the employee refuse to sign the consent form, the employee will be disciplined following the procedures set forth in the city personnel policy manual. 
(5)  An investigation into the matter will be made. Following investigation, he/she may be terminated for "insubordination" pursuant to the procedure set forth in the personnel policy manual. The stated reasons for terminating an employee will never be "refusal to submit to urinalysis", but rather "insubordination" or "failure to follow the legitimate instructions of the supervisors" or a reason of similar language. 
(6)  If the employee consents to the test and the test results are negative, the employee can return to work. However, should the test results indicate the presence of alcohol or controlled substances, that test result must and will be confirmed. 
(7)  If the confirmatory test also indicates the presence of alcohol/controlled substances, the employee will be assumed to be in violation of this policy, and will be disciplined, in accordance with the alcohol and controlled substance policy and personnel rules and regulations. 
(8)  An intensive investigation into the employee's background and the circumstances behind the alleged policy violations will take place. After investigation is completed, and there is sufficient cause to believe that a policy violation has occurred, the employee will be terminated pursuant to the procedures set forth in the personnel rules and regulations. 
(9)  If after the investigation has been completed and it is determined that a policy violation has not occurred (for example, if the employee successfully rebuts the assumption of policy violations by requesting additional testing of the same urine samples or submitting to a blood test, the results of which are negative), the employee will be reinstated with back pay to his/her former position. 
D.  Other issues involving the policy. 
1.  The duty to protect other employees and the public from impaired individuals. If it is discovered that an employee is impaired while working, the employee will not be allowed to drive home. After the necessary disciplinary procedures have taken place, the impaired employee should either be driven home, or a taxi should be called for the employee. If the employee is allowed to leave on his own in an obviously intoxicated state, it is possible the city or the employee's supervisors may be held legally liable for the actions of the employee. 
2.  Discipline generally. The suspension or termination of an employee will never be justified on the basis that the employee is an alcoholic or substance abuser. The employee's physical/psychological state of being will not be mentioned when disciplining that employee. Instead, discipline will center around the employee's failure to meet objective, job-related criteria. "Substandard performance", "insubordination", "violation of policy", or "failure to follow orders" are examples of proper reasons for discipline. Supervisors are to remember-don't diagnose it, describe it. 
3.  Employees' right to privacy. All meetings involving a violation of the alcohol and controlled substance policy should be on a "closed-door" basis, with admission restricted to those who have a legitimate interest in the proceedings. Under no circumstances will the proceedings be discussed outside of these closed-door meetings, nor will it ever be publicly stated that an employee is an alcoholic or controlled substance abuser. After disciplinary proceedings have taken place, inquires as to the reason for termination/suspension will be answered with an "objective" cause only ("insubordination", for example). The use of alcohol or controlled substances shall not be publicly attributed to an employee. 
(Ord. No. 2004-18, § 3, 3-16-04) 
Sec. 2-153. - Alcohol and drug misuse prevention policy for pipeline employees 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of this policy is to prevent accidents that result from the misuse of alcohol and drugs, thereby reducing fatalities, injuries and property damage; and to comply with the alcohol and drug testing standards promulgated by the United States Department of Transportation and set forth in 49 CFR part 199. In the event that there is a conflict between the provisions of this policy and the alcohol and drug testing standards promulgated by the United States Department of Transportation or the requirements of 49 CFR part 199, the standards of the United States Department of Transportation and the terms and conditions of 49 CFR part 199 shall prevail. 
B.  Scope of policy. This policy applies to every city employee who performs any function on a pipeline including operation, maintenance and emergency response. This policy also applies to any pipeline employees who are contractors or employed by contractors and compliance with each and every provision of this policy shall be required of each contractor. Any questions concerning this policy should be directed to the program manager listed in attachment F. 
C.  Required testing. 
1.  Pre-employment testing. A pre-employment drug test shall be conducted when an individual applies for a position which is covered by this policy. Any job applicant who refuses to submit to a pre-employment drug test or who has a confirmed positive test shall not be hired. An employee who transfers from one position covered by this policy to another position covered by this policy does not require pre-employment testing. 
2.  Postaccident testing. Following an accident, the city will promptly test each surviving employee for alcohol and drugs if that employee's performance either contributed to the accident or cannot be completely discounted as a contributing factor to the accident. An accident for purposes of this policy means an incident reportable under 49 CFR part 191 involving gas pipeline facilities or LNG facilities, or an accident reportable under 49 CFR part 195 involving hazardous liquid pipeline facilities. 
Any employee who is involved in an accident must remain available for alcohol and drug testing. Each employee who is requested to submit to testing shall do so within two (2) hours of the accident. Employees who have been involved in an accident may not consume alcohol for eight (8) hours following the accident or until an alcohol test has been conducted. 
An employee who is subject to postaccident testing and who fails to remain readily available for such testing may be deemed to have refused to submit to testing. An employee who leaves the scene of the accident prior to submission to an alcohol and drug test without first notifying the public gas system via his or her supervisor shall be deemed to have refused to submit to testing unless the employee left the scene to seek emergency medical attention or assistance in responding to the accident. If an employee who is subject to postaccident testing is hospitalized, the hospital or medical facility shall be asked to obtain samples for alcohol and drug testing. 
If an alcohol test is required pursuant to this section and is not administered within two (2) hours following the accident, the supervisor for the employee shall prepare a written report explaining why the test was not promptly administered and shall forward that report to the designated risk management official for the city. If an alcohol test is required pursuant to this section and is not administered within eight (8) hours following an accident, the city shall discontinue efforts to administer an alcohol test and the supervisor for that employee shall prepare a written report explaining why the alcohol test was not conducted. The written report shall be sent to the designated risk management official for the city. 
If a drug test is required pursuant to this section and is not administered within thirty-two (32) hours following an accident, the city shall discontinue efforts to administer a drug test and the supervisor for that employee shall prepare a written report explaining why the drug test was not conducted. The written report shall be sent to the designated risk management official for the city. 
3.  Reasonable suspicion testing. Reasonable suspicion testing is designed to identify alcohol or drug affected employees who may pose a danger to themselves or to others in their job performance. 
The decision to test an employee for alcohol or drugs pursuant to this section must be based on a reasonable and articulable suspicion of alcohol or drug use by the employee on the basis of specific contemporaneous physical, behavioral, or performance indicators. The observations which underlie the decision to test on the basis of reasonable suspicion for alcohol must be made during, just before, or just after the performance of covered functions by the employee. Only supervisors who have received at least sixty (60) minutes of training in detecting the symptoms of alcohol misuse may make a determination that reasonable suspicion of alcohol use exists. One (1) supervisor who has received the required training may make the decision to test an employee for alcohol under this provision. At least two (2) of the employee's supervisors, one (1) of whom is trained in detection of the possible symptoms of drug use, shall substantiate and concur in the decision to test an employee for drugs. The concurrence between two (2) supervisors may be by telephone. 
If a reasonable suspicion test is not administered within two (2) hours following the determination that testing is appropriate, the supervisor shall prepare a written report explaining why the test was not promptly administered and forward the report to the designated risk management official for the city. If the test is not performed within eight hours of the determination, then the city will discontinue efforts to administer a test and the supervisor shall prepare a written report explaining why the test was not administered and forward the report to a designated risk management official for the city. 
The city will not permit a covered employee to report for duty or to remain on duty requiring the performance of covered functions while the employee is under the influence of or impaired by alcohol or drugs, as shown by the behavioral, speech, or performance indicators of alcohol or drug misuse. 
4.  Return to duty testing. Before an employee may return to duty to perform covered functions after engaging in prohibited conduct, the city shall require the employee to successfully complete a substance abuse evaluation and any recommended course of treatment. Employees who have violated the policy with respect to the use of alcohol must also take a return to duty alcohol test with a result indicating an alcohol concentration of less than two one-hundredths (0.02) before the employee may resume his or her duties. Employees who have violated the policy with respect to the use of drugs must also take a return to duty drug test with a confirmed negative result and must also have been recommended for a return to duty by the medical review officer. 
5.  Follow-up testing. Following the return to duty of an employee who has violated the terms of this policy, the employee will be subject to unannounced follow-up alcohol or drug testing as directed by a substance abuse professional (SAP) for up to sixty (60) months after his or her return to duty. The employee will be subject to at least six (6) unannounced alcohol or drug follow-up test during the first twelve (12) months following his or her return to duty in addition to any other testing conducted pursuant to the provisions of this policy. The SAP may terminate the requirement for follow-up testing at any time after the initial six (6) tests have been completed if the SAP makes the determination that continued testing is not warranted. Follow-up testing shall be conducted just before, during or immediately following the performance of a covered function. 
6.  Random testing. All employees who work in a position which is covered by this policy shall be subject to unannounced drug testing based on a random selection process. To insure that the selections are random, employees shall be placed in a common pool via their Social Security numbers and the selections shall be computer generated. Employees shall be tested at a rate of fifty (50) percent every twelve (12) months. Test dates shall also be randomly selected and there shall be a minimum of four (4) test dates per year or one (1) per quarter. A person may be selected for drug testing more than once or not at all during the annual period. 
D.  Prohibited conduct. 
1.  General prohibitions. The use or possession of alcoholic beverages or prohibited drugs while on city property, or in any city vehicle, or during working hours, including breaks or lunch, paid or unpaid, on any shift, is strictly prohibited. The use or possession of prohibited drugs by employees covered under this policy at any time is strictly forbidden. 
2.  Alcohol concentration of two one-hundredths (0.02) or greater. Covered employees are prohibited from reporting to work or remaining at work while having an alcohol concentration of two one-hundredths (0.02) or greater (which means two one-hundredths (0.02) grams or more of alcohol per two hundred ten (210) liters of breath). 
3.  Preduty use within four (4) hours. Covered employees may not use alcohol within four (4) hours prior to reporting to work. If an employee is called to work to respond to an emergency, the employee may not use alcohol after the employee has been notified to report for work. 
4.  On-duty use. Employees may not use or possess alcohol or prohibited drugs while at work. 
E.  Penalty for failure to submit to an alcohol or drug test. Any employee who refuses to submit to any test required pursuant to this policy shall not be permitted to perform covered functions and may be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination of employment at the sole discretion of the city. 
F.  Consequences of engaging in prohibited conduct. 
1.  Evaluation and treatment. Any covered employee who has an alcohol test administered and who is found to have an alcohol concentration of two one-hundredths (0.02) or greater will be sent for an evaluation by a substance abuse professional. Any covered employee who has a confirmed positive drug test result will be sent for an evaluation by a substance abuse professional. Any refusal to submit to an alcohol or drug test shall be considered, for purpose of this policy, as a confirmed positive test result. Following a violation of this policy and prior to any return to duty, the employee must: 
a.  Complete the evaluation process with a substance abuse professional to determine whether the employee is in need of treatment; 
b.  Complete any treatment recommended by the substance abuse professional; 
c.  Be re-evaluated by the substance abuse professional to ensure that the employee has properly followed the treatment program; 
d.  Provide documentation to a designated risk management official of both evaluations and the successful completion of all recommended treatment; 
e.  Successfully take a return-to-duty alcohol test with resulting alcohol concentration of less than two one-hundredths (0.02) or a drug test with a confirmed negative test result. 
f.  Be recommended for a return to duty by the medical review officer in accordance with 49 CFR part 199.15(c) if the offense involved drugs. 
2.  Suspension from duty. Any covered employee who has an alcohol test administered and who is found to have an alcohol concentration of two one-hundredths (0.02) or greater, or who has a confirmed positive test result in a drug test, or who refuses to submit to an alcohol or drug test shall be suspended from duty without pay until all conditions set forth in the preceding section have been met. 
3.  Disciplinary actions. 
a.  The following violations of this policy may result in immediate termination from employment; refusals to submit to an alcohol or drug test without a valid medical explanation, or engaging in conduct that clearly obstructs the testing procedure; refusals to report for assessment, evaluation, and/or referral for treatment with a substance abuse professional; refusals to enter or successfully complete a rehabilitation program which has been recommended by a substance abuse professional; on-duty use or possession of alcohol or drugs; any second test result for alcohol in a concentration of two one-hundredths (0.02) or greater or a second confirmed positive test result for drugs. 
b.  The following violations of this policy shall result in suspension from duty without pay until such time as the employee completes all required evaluations and treatment; any test result for alcohol in a concentration of two one-hundredths (0.02) or greater; any confirmed positive test result for drugs; any refusal to submit to alcohol or drug testing. 
c.  The following violations of this policy may result in permanent removal from any job which involves covered functions; any test result which indicates an alcohol concentration of four one-hundredths (0.04) or greater; any confirmed positive test result for drugs; any refusal to submit to alcohol or drug testing. 
G.  Testing site. All alcohol testing for the city will be conducted by Houston Medical Center, is a qualified and approved laboratory and shall take all necessary steps to comply with the regulatory requirements of the department of transportation. 
All drug testing for the city will be conducted by SmithKline Beecham Lab, NIDA Testing. SmithKline Beecham Lab is certified by the department of health and human services under the United States Department of Transportation procedures and shall take all necessary steps to comply with the regulatory requirements of the department of transportation. 
H.  Records and confidentiality. 
1.  Types of records regarding alcohol testing which shall be maintained by the city. The following types of records regarding alcohol testing shall be maintained by the city: 
a.  Records relating to the collection process including calibration documentation for EBT devices, documentation of BAT/STT training, documents prepared in connection with decisions to administer postaccident alcohol test, and documents verifying the existence of a medical explanation of the inability of a covered employee to provide adequate breath for alcohol testing;

(Ord. No. 2004-18, § 4, 3-16-04) 
Sec. 2-154. - Drug and alcohol testing policy for employees subject to department of transportation regulations. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of this policy is to assist in the creation of a safe driving environment and to meet the requirements of the guidelines established by the United States Department of Transportation. This policy is specifically intended to meet all regulatory requirements of 49 CFR parts 40 and 382. If there is any part of this policy is in conflict with those regulations found at 49 CFR part 40 or part 382, the terms of those regulations control. 
B.  Scope of this policy. This policy applies to every city employee who operates a commercial motor vehicle ("CMV") and who is required to have a commercial driver's license ("CDL"). Compliance with this policy is a condition of employment. The failure or refusal of an applicant or employee to cooperate fully by submitting to any test or any procedure under the terms of this policy or by signing any consent form or other document required by the testing laboratory shall be ground for refusal to hire or disciplinary actions including termination of employment at the sole discretion of the city. A commercial motor vehicle for purposes of this policy is: a tractor trailer or similar vehicle, with a gross combination weight rating of twenty-six thousand one (26,001) pounds or more (inclusive of a towed unit with a gross vehicle weight rating of at least ten thousand (10,000) pounds); a single vehicle with a gross vehicle weight rating of twenty-six thousand one (26,001) pounds or more; a vehicle that is designed to transport sixteen (16) or more persons, including the driver, or a vehicle that transports hazardous materials (as defined in 49 CFR part 172.1, et al). 
The provisions of this policy apply to the performance of any safety-sensitive job function, which is defined to include: 
 All time spent at any city property waiting to be dispatched unless the driver has been relieved from duty; 
 All time spent conducting the required equipment inspections and inspecting, servicing, or conditioning any CMV at any time. 
 All driving time; 
 All time other than driving time spent in or upon a CMV; 
 All time spent assisting, supervising or attending the loading or unloading of a vehicle, including remaining in readiness to operate and handling receipts for shipments loaded or unloaded; 
 All time spent following the required procedures for accidents; 
 All time spent repairing, obtaining assistance, or remaining in the attendance of a disabled vehicle. 
Any business which contracts with the city, and as a part of that contract provides employees who are subject to the department of transportation requirements as operators of commercial motor vehicle must comply with the drug and alcohol testing requirements of the department of transportation and must provide to the city written documentation of their drug and alcohol testing policy for those employees prior to performing any work on behalf of the city. 
C.  General statement of policy. Concerning the use of alcohol, no employee who performs safety-sensitive functions shall operate a CMV if the employee: has a blood alcohol concentrations of two one-hundredths (0.02) or greater; is presently using alcohol; or, has used alcohol within four (4) hours of coming onto duty. 
Concerning the use of drugs, an employee shall not report for duty or remain on duty if the employee uses or has in their possession any illegal drug. No employee may perform a safety-sensitive job function while unlawfully using or following a positive drug test result. 
Manufacture, distribution, dispensation, sale, unlawful use, or unlawful possession of hallucinogenic drugs, narcotics, or other controlled substances (or paraphernalia related to the use of such substances) is prohibited. Manufacture, distribution, dispensation, sale, use or possession of alcohol is prohibited during working hours or at any time on city property. 
An employee either reporting to work visibly impaired or observed to be visibly impaired while on duty will be deemed unable to perform required duties and will not be permitted to work. If possible, the employee's supervisor will seek another supervisor's opinion to confirm the employee's impaired status. If, in the opinion of the employee's supervisor, the employee is impaired, the employee may be sent home or to a medical facility by a safe means of transportation (after any reasonable cause drug or alcohol testing required by this policy). The employee may be accompanied by the supervisor or another employee if necessary. Under no circumstances will an apparently impaired employee be allowed to drive a car or other vehicle. If a drug or alcohol test cannot be administered under this policy, the apparently impaired driver shall nonetheless remain ineligible to perform any driving duties for at least twenty-four (24) hours. 
If an employee is undergoing any medical treatment that involves the ingestion of any medications that have the potential to impair work performance, he or she must advise their supervisor of treatment and present appropriate medical documentation. A decision will then be made by the supervisor whether the employee should be able to perform his or her job safely and properly. Employees must keep all prescribed medications in its original container, which identifies the drug, date of prescription, and prescribing doctor. 
D.  Required testing. 
1.  Pre-employment and pretransfer testing. The city will test each driver for alcohol and for illegal drugs before the first time a driver performs a safety-sensitive function. All applicants for employment in positions that are covered by this policy must submit to a drug test as a prequalification condition of employment. All current employees whom the city intends to transfer into a position that is covered by this policy must submit to a drug test as a pre-qualification condition of transfer. 
If a driver has participated in a department of transportation-qualified drug testing program within the previous thirty (30) days and the driver passed a drug test administered within the six (6) months prior to the driver's application date, or the driver was subject to random testing for the twelve (12) months prior to the driver's application date, then that driver may be exempt from pre-employment or pretransfer testing. If a pre-employment or pre-transfer test is not performed pursuant to the provision, then the procedures set forth in 49 CFR section 382.301(d) will be followed before the performance of any safety-sensitive job duties. 
No driver will be allowed to perform a safety-sensitive function unless that driver receives a negative drug test result and an alcohol concentration less than two one-hundredths (0.02). Employee found to have an alcohol concentration of two one-hundredths (0.02) or greater, but less than four one-hundredths (0.04) will not be allowed to perform safety-sensitive functions for twenty-four (24) hours following the test. 
2.  Postaccident testing. For each accident involving a commercial motor vehicle, the city will test each surviving driver if the employee was performing a safety-sensitive function that could have contributed to the cause of the accident. 
All alcohol tests will be administered, if possible, within two (2) hours, but not more than eight (8) hours following the accident. All drug tests will be administered within thirty-two (32) hours following the accident. The results of a breath or blood test for the use of alcohol or a urine test for the use of drugs, if conducted by local or state officials pursuant to an accident investigation, will be considered a test for the purposes of this policy. 
Whenever an alcohol test is not administered within two (2) hours after the accident, the employee's supervisor must prepare a written statement of the reasons that the test was not promptly administered. Whenever a test is not administered within the additional time limits set forth above, the employee's supervisor must prepare a written statement of the reasons that the test was not promptly administered. The original of any such statement shall be forwarded to the program manager (See attachment F). 
Any driver subject to postaccident testing must remain readily available for testing, otherwise, the driver will be deemed to have refused to submit to testing. A driver who is unable to submit to testing at the time of the accident because of serious injuries received in the accident shall provide to the city the necessary authorization for the city to obtain hospital reports or other documents that would indicate the presence of any controlled substances or alcohol in the driver's system. Refusal to provide such authorization may be treated by the city as a refusal to submit to testing under this policy. An employee may be considered readily available for testing if: the employee notifies the city of his or her whereabouts; the employee was required to leave the scene to seek medical attention for himself, herself, or others; or, the employee left the scene to obtain assistance in responding to the accident. 
3.  Random testing. The city will administer random alcohol test to twenty-five (25) percent of the average number of drivers positions in each individual category of driver positions annually unless the federal highway administrator changes the percentage of random test required. The city shall conduct random drug testing of fifty (50) percent of the average number of driver positions in each individual category of driver positions annually. 
Each driver will have any equal chance of being tested each time selections are made. Selections will be made randomly. The dates of testing will be unannounced and will be reasonably spread throughout the calendar year. If a driver is notified of selection for random testing, the driver must proceed to the test site immediately. A driver will only be tested for alcohol while the driver is performing a safety-sensitive function, just before performing a safety-sensitive function, or just after performing a safety-sensitive function. 
4.  Reasonable suspicion testing. If the city has a reasonable suspicion that a driver is under the influence of prohibited drugs or alcohol, the city, will require the driver to submit to a drug or alcohol test. Reasonable suspicion will be based on the observations of the actions, appearance, speech, body odors, or conduct of an on-duty driver that indicate the possible use of a prohibited drug or alcohol. The actions, appearance, speech, body odors, or conduct of the driver must be witnessed by at least one (1) city official or supervisor who has received department of transportation approved training, in the detection of probable drug or alcohol use. Third-party reports that an employee is impaired in his or her driving duties due to the use of prohibited drugs or alcohol shall not constitute reasonable cause, but may be cause for the observation of the employee by the supervisor. 
Whenever an employee is required to be tested under this provision, the city shall provide transportation to the testing site for the employee. 
A driver will only be required to undergo reasonable suspicion alcohol testing just before, during, or just after the performance of a safety-sensitive function. Reasonable suspicion alcohol testing will be performed if possible within two (2) hours following the reasonable suspicion observation, but not more than eight (8) hours following the observation. If an alcohol test cannot be performed within two (2) hours following a determination of reasonable cause to conduct such test, the supervisor shall prepare a written statement why the test was not administered promptly. If a written statement is made for failure to procure the required test in a prompt manner, the original must be sent to a designated official in the city personnel department. 
Once the city, through an official or supervisor, observes indications of alcohol use, the city will not allow the driver to perform any safety-sensitive functions until an alcohol test is administered and the driver's blood alcohol concentration is less than two one-hundredths (0.02), or twenty-four (24) hours have elapsed. 
A written record shall be made of the observations leading to a reasonable suspicion alcohol or controlled substance test and signed by the supervisor or official who made the specific observations within twenty-four (24) hours of the observed behavior or manifestations or before the results of the controlled substance test are released, whichever is earlier. In addition to the written record set forth above, the supervisor or official shall utilize the observation checklist which is attached. The originals of both the written record and the observation checklist shall be forwarded to the designated official in the city personnel department. 
5.  Testing following a return to duty. Employees who are charged with a criminal offense involving drugs or alcohol, or who voluntarily seek treatment for substance addiction prior to being found in violation of this policy, or who are not discharged or permanently relieved of driving duties following a violation of this policy may not resume driving duties without first: 
a.  Undergoing an initial evaluation by a substance abuse professional; 
b.  Completing all recommended treatment; 
c.  Undergoing a follow-up evaluation, with a substance abuse professional; 
d.  Providing written documentation of the successful completion of all recommended treatment to the designated treatment to the program manager; and 
e.  Taking a return-to-duty drug or alcohol test with a verified negative result. 
A driver who has completed drug or alcohol rehabilitation treatment under this policy shall, upon the resumption of driving duties, be subject to unannounced testing. Such testing shall be conducted over a period of twelve (12) to sixty (60) months and shall include at least six (6) unannounced tests during the first twelve (12) months of his or her return to duty. The type, frequency, and timing of such testing shall be at the direction of such testing shall be at the direction of the substance abuse professional who has evaluated the employee. The substance abuse professional may terminate the testing at any point following the first six (6) tests under this provision. Each unannounced alcohol test shall be administered either immediately before, during or after the driver has performed driving duties. 
E.  Notification of results. For pre-employment drug tests, the city will inform the driver of the result only if the driver requests the results within sixty (60) calendar days of being notified of the disposition of the employment application. 
For random, reasonable suspicion and postaccident test for drugs or alcohol, the medical review officer shall make all reasonable efforts to contact the driver prior to making a determination to verify a test result as positive to determine whether the driver wishes to discuss the test result with the medical review officer. The medical review officer shall notify each employee who has confirmed positive test result that the employee has seventy-two (72) hours to request a test of the split specimen. 
If, after making all reasonable efforts, the MRO is unable to contact an employee, then the MRO must contact a designated city official from the personnel department, who then shall direct the employee to speak with the medical review officer as soon as possible. If the employee cannot be contacted after reasonable efforts have been made to do so, then the employee may be placed on temporary medically unqualified status or medical leave. 
The current medical review officer is Dr. Frank Stagg, who may [be] contacted at 2510 Highway 127, Kathleen, Georgia, 31047 or by telephone at (478) 987-1778. 
F.  Employee assistance program. Each employee driver who has violated any aspect of this policy shall be advised of the resources to the driver in evaluating and resolving problems associated with the misuse of alcohol and the use of controlled substances, including the names, addresses and telephone numbers of substance abuse professionals and counseling and treatment programs. Furthermore, each driver employee who engages in any conduct prohibited by this policy shall be evaluated by a substance abuse professional, through Houston Medical Center, who shall determine what assistance, if any, the employee needs n resolving problems associated with alcohol misuse and controlled substances use. 
No aspect of this policy shall require the city to provide an employee assistance program (EAP) for employees subject to drug and alcohol testing pursuant to this policy and for supervisory personnel. The city may provide an EAP for employees subject to drug and alcohol testing pursuant to this policy; however, the availability of, and eligibility for, benefits under such EAP shall be governed by the terms of that program. Participation in such a program if it is made available by the city shall not excuse an employee from this policy's testing provisions or requirements for removal from duty. 
All employees who return to duty following a period of treatment for substance addiction shall be subject to unannounced follow-up alcohol and drug tests as explained in subsection D-5 of this section. 
G.  Consequences of violating this policy. Violation of the provisions of this policy concerning drug and alcohol abuse may lead to severe disciplinary action, including discharge for the first offense, at the sole discretion of the city.

d.  Violation of regulations A and B of this policy (Page 2) will ordinarily result in termination consistent with the procedural guidelines set forth in the city personnel policy manual. 
12.  The employee may through his/her own effort attempt to rebut the assumption of policy violation. For example, in the case of a urine sample used to detect violation of controlled substances, the employee may request an additional test of the remaining portion of his/her sample. However, additional testing will be at the expense of the employee. If such tests produce negative results, the assumption of policy violation may be considered rebutted depending upon such factors as the timing of the tests and other circumstances surrounding the indication of policy violation, and the employee may be reimbursed the cost of the second test. 
13.  A refusal of testing will be treated as insubordination and will be grounds for discipline. 
14.  Under no circumstances shall the employee suspected of being under the influence of alcohol, drugs, including controlled substances and prescriptions, or both, be permitted to leave the worksite by himself. 
Necessary arrangements should be made to have the employee taken home. If the employee refuses any assistance, be certain that the witness can verify such refusal. However, if an employee cannot control his actions, under no circumstances should he be allowed to leave without assistance. The supervisor must call the Perry Police Department to warn them of the employee's condition and refusal of assistance before the employee is allowed to leave the work site. Law enforcement officials should be told the employee's name and make of car. 
15.  The supervisor and witness shall be present throughout all proceedings, appropriate notes should be taken for future reference and supporting documentation. 
16.  The supervisor and witness shall be aware at all times of the employee's "right to privacy" and involve only those people who have a "need to know" in the situation, the confidentiality of the case will be protected.

If the owner fails to comply with an order to repair or demolish the dwelling, building, or structure, the public officer may cause such dwelling, building, or structure to be repaired, altered, or improved or to be vacated and closed or demolished. Such abatement action shall commence within two hundred seventy (270) days after the expiration of time specified in the order for abatement by the owner. Any time during which such action is prohibited by a court order issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 41-2-13 or section 5-58 of this article, or any other equitable relief granted by a court of competent jurisdiction shall not be counted toward the two hundred seventy (270) days in which such abatement action must commence. The public officer shall cause to be posted on the main entrance of the building, dwelling, or structure a placard with the following words: 
"This building is unfit for human habitation or commercial, industrial, or business use and does not comply with the applicable codes or has been ordered secured to prevent its use in connection with drug crimes or constitutes an endangerment to public health or safety as a result of unsanitary or unsafe conditions. The use or occupation of this building is prohibited and unlawful." 
d.  If the public officer has the structure demolished, reasonable effort shall be made to salvage reusable materials for credit against the cost of demolition. The proceeds of any moneys received from the sale of salvaged materials shall be used or applied against the cost of the demolition and removal of the structure, and proper records shall be kept showing application of sales proceeds. Any such sale of salvaged materials may be made without the necessity of public advertisement and bid. The public officer and governing authority are relieved of any and all liability resulting from or occasioned by the sale of any such salvaged materials, including, without limitation, defects in such salvaged materials; and 
e.  The amount of the cost of demolition, including all court costs, appraisal fees, administrative costs incurred by the county tax commissioner or municipal tax collector or city revenue officer, and all other costs necessarily associated with the abatement action, including restoration to grade of the real property after demolition, shall be a lien against the real property upon which such cost was incurred. 
(b)  (1)  The lien provided for in subsection e. [above] shall attach to the real property upon the filing of a certified copy of the order requiring repair, closure, or demolition in the office of the clerk of superior court in the county where the real property is located and shall relate back to the date of the filing of the lis pendens notice required under O.C.G.A. § 41-2-12(c) and subsection 5-56(c) of this article. The clerk of superior court shall record and index such certified copy of the order in the deed records of the county and enter the lien on the general execution docket. The lien shall be superior to all other liens on the property, except liens for taxes to which the lien shall be inferior, and shall continue in force until paid. 
(2)  Upon final determination of costs, fees, and expenses incurred in accordance with this article, the public officer responsible for enforcement actions in accordance with this article shall transmit to the appropriate county tax commissioner or municipal tax collector or city revenue officer a statement of the total amount due and secured by said lien, together with copies of all notices provided to interested parties. The statement of the public officer shall be transmitted within ninety (90) days of completion of the repairs, demolition, or closure. It shall be the duty of the appropriate county tax commissioner or municipal tax collector or city revenue officer, who is responsible or whose duties include the collection of municipal taxes, to collect the amount of the lien using all methods available for collecting real property ad valorem taxes, including specifically Chapter 4 of Title 48 of O.C.G.A.; provided, however, that the limitation of O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 which requires twelve (12) months of delinquency before commencing a tax foreclosure shall not apply. A county tax commissioner shall collect and enforce municipal liens imposed pursuant to the article in accordance with O.C.G.A. § 48-5-359.1. The county tax commissioner or municipal tax collector or city revenue officer shall remit the amount collected to the governing authority of the county or municipality whose lien is being collected. 
(3)  Enforcement of liens pursuant to this article may be initiated at any time following receipt by the county tax commissioner or municipal tax collector or city revenue officer of the final determination of costs in accordance with this article. The unpaid lien amount shall bear interest and penalties from and after the date of final determination of costs in the same amount as applicable to interest and penalties on unpaid real property ad valorem taxes. An enforcement proceeding pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 48-4-78 for delinquent ad valorem taxes may include all amounts due under this chapter. 
(4)  The redemption amount in any enforcement proceeding pursuant to this article shall be the full amount of the costs as finally determined in accordance with this article together with interest, penalties, and costs incurred by the governing authority, county tax commissioner, municipal tax collector, or city revenue officer in the enforcement of such lien. Redemption of property from the lien may be made in accordance with the provisions of O.C.G.A. §§ 48-4-80 and 48-4-81. 
(c)  The governing authority may waive and release any such lien imposed on property upon the owner of such property entering into a contract with the county or municipality agreeing to a timetable for rehabilitation of the real property or the dwelling, building, or structure on the property and demonstrating the financial means to accomplish such rehabilitation. 
(d)  Where the abatement action does not commence in the superior court, review of a court order requiring the repair, alteration, improvement, or demolition of a dwelling, building, or structure shall be by direct appeal to the superior court under O.C.G.A. § 5-3-29. 
(e)  In addition to the procedures and remedies in this chapter, a governing authority may provide by ordinance that designated public officers may issue citations for violations of state minimum standard codes, optional building, fire, life safety, and other codes adopted by ordinance, and conditions creating a public health hazard or general nuisance, and seek to enforce such citations in a court of competent jurisdiction prior to issuing a complaint in rem as provided in this article. 
(f)  Nothing in this article shall be construed to impair or limit in any way the power of the city to define and declare nuisances and to cause their removal or abatement by summary proceedings.

Sec. 5-58. - Injunctions against order to repair, close or demolish unfit buildings or structures. 
    Any person affected by any order issued by the public officer may petition to the superior court for an injunction restraining the public officer from carrying out the provisions of the order. The court may, upon such petition, issue a temporary injunction restraining the public officer pending the final disposition of the cause; provided, however, that such person shall present the petition to the court within fifteen (15) days of the posting and service of the order by the public officer.

ARTICLE VI. - BLIGHTED PROPERTY 

Sec. 5-71. - Purpose. 
    The existence of real property which is maintained in a blighted condition increases the burden of the state and local government by increasing the need for government services, including, but not limited to, social services, public safety services, and code enforcement services. Rehabilitation of blighted property decreases this need for such government services. 
    In furtherance of its objective to eradicate conditions of slum and blight within the city, this mayor and council, in exercise of the powers granted to municipal corporations at O.C.G.A. tit. 36, ch. 61, Urban Redevelopment, has designated those areas of the city where conditions of slum and blight are found or are likely to spread. 
    In recognition of the need for enhanced governmental services and in order to encourage private property owners to maintain their real property and the buildings, structures and improvement thereon in good condition and repair, and as an incentive to encourage community redevelopment, a community redevelopment tax incentive program is hereby established as authorized by Article IX, Section II, Paragraph VII(d) of the 1983 Constitution of the State of Georgia.

b.  The public officer may cause a survey of existing housing conditions to be performed, or may refer to any such survey conducted or finalized within the previous five (5) years, to locate or identify any parcels which may be in a blighted condition and for which a full inspection should be conducted to determine if that parcel or property meets the criteria set out in this article for designation as being maintained in a blighted condition.

Sec. 5-76. - Decrease of tax rate. 
(a)  Real property which has had its designation as maintained in a blighted condition removed by the public officer, as provided in section 5-75 of this article, shall be eligible for a decrease in the rate of city ad valorem taxation by applying a factor of 0.5 to the city millage rate applied to the property, so that such property shall be taxed at a lower millage rate than the millage rate generally applied in the municipality or otherwise provided by general law; such decreased rate of taxation shall be applied beginning with the next tax bill rendered following removal of official designation of a real property as blighted. The decreased rate of taxation may be given in successive years, depending on the amount of cost expended by the person(s) chargeable with payment of ad valorem taxes on the property to satisfy its remediation or redevelopment, with every twenty-five thousand dollars ($25,000.00) or portion thereof equaling one (1) year of tax reduction; provided, however, that no property shall be entitled to reduction in city ad valorem taxes for more than four (4) successive years.

ARTICLE II. - FIRE PROTECTION UTILITY ENTERPRISE FUND 

Sec. 5A-11. - Purpose. 
    This article establishes the Perry Fire Protection Utility and sets up the fire protection utility enterprise fund. 
(Ord. No. 2014-13, 6-3-14) 
Sec. 5A-12. - Findings of fact. 
    The mayor and the city council of the City of Perry make the following findings of fact: 
(1)  The City of Perry is authorized by the Georgia Constitution of 1983, including, without limitation, Article IX, Section II, Paragraph VI thereof, to create special service districts for the provision of the services within such districts, and to levy and collect within such districts fees and assessments to pay, wholly or partially, the cost of providing such services therein. 
(2)  The City of Perry, Georgia, is authorized by its Charter to fix and establish fire protection service area limits and to extend, enlarge or restrict same from time to time to ensure effective delivery of such services. 
(3)  In promulgating the provisions contained in this article, Perry is acting pursuant to its authority as granted by the Georgia Constitution, and the laws of the State of Georgia and its City Charter, to provide fire protection and emergency management services to all properties within the city's service area. Fire protection and emergency management services are needed and provide benefits to all properties within the city's service area. For the purposes of this article, fire protection services shall be inclusive of emergency management services. 
(4)  The cost of managing, operating and maintaining the Perry Fire Department, and the funding necessary for equipment, personnel and facilities thereof should, to the extent practicable, be allocated in reasonable relationship to the services received by the public from the city's fire department and the fire protection program. 
(5)  The operational and financing analysis prepared by the city properly assesses and defines the city's fire protection program service delivery needs, goals, priorities as well as the city fire department's funding strategy for delivery of those services. 
(6)  Given the city's fire protection program service delivery needs, goals, priorities and the funding strategy identified in the aforementioned financing analysis, it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of fire protection services, systems and facilities within the city in concert with other resource management programs. 
(7)  Fire protection services are applicable and needed throughout the incorporated areas of the city. While specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, one service area encompassing all lands within the designated Perry Fire Protection Utility Service Area is consistent with the present and future needs of the community. 
(8)  It is practical and equitable to allocate the cost of fire protection among the owners and/or occupants of all properties in proportion to the demands the properties impose on the city's fire department which result in services being rendered to such properties and the owners and/or occupants thereof. The fair and equitable apportionment of costs via the service fee charge should be based on a reasonable correlation to the fire protection services made available and provided to all properties. 
(9)  The fire protection needs of the city include, but are not limited to, protection of the public health, safety, and welfare of the community. Provision of fire protection services renders and/or results in both a service and a benefit to all properties, property owners, citizens, and residents to the city. 
(10)  A fire protection program provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering fire protection services throughout the city, and the most equitable means to implement the defined level of service for fire protection within the city are through fire protection service fee charges and other funding mechanisms. 
(11)  A schedule of fire protection service fee charges based on average heated square footage. The fire protection fees for customers are based on a residential equivalent unit (REU) basis as this methodology is the most appropriate and equitable means of allocating the cost of fire protection services throughout the city. 
(12)  Fire protection service fee charges may be supplemented by other types of fees and charges which address specific needs, including, but not limited to, special service fees, general fund revenues, special assessments, use of proceeds from special purpose location option sales taxes (SPLOST) and other forms of revenue, as deemed appropriate by the mayor or city council. 
(13)  The existence of privately owned and maintained on-site fire protection/suppression facilities or systems which reduce, or otherwise mitigate, the response burden imposed on the fire department, and the fire protection utility's cost of providing fire protection services, should be taken into account with regard [to] a potential reduction to the service fee charge on that property in the form of a service fee charge reduction or a credit, and such credit should be conditioned upon continuing provision of such facilities in a manner complying with the standards and codes as determined by the fire protection utility. Credits for privately owned and maintained fire protection/suppression facilities, systems and/or programs shall be generally proportional to the effect that such facilities, systems and programs have on reduction and/or mitigation of the fire risk and incident response burden associated with the property and the reduction in cost associated with provision of fire protection services related to that property. 
(14)  It is imperative that the revenue from all service fee charges for fire protection services, systems, or facilities be dedicated solely to those purposes, and such service fee charge revenues shall therefore be deposited into the city fire protection utility enterprise fund and shall remain in that fund and be dispersed only for fire protection capital and operations costs, or for other indebtedness for fire protection services. 
(15)  In order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, the governing authority of Perry hereby concludes a fire protection utility, funded by a dedicated fire protection utility enterprise fund, is warranted as the best available means of addressing the community's fire protection service delivery needs.

A bill for fire protection fee charges may be sent through the United States Postal Service or by alternative means, notifying the fire protection utility customer of the following items (as a minimum): the fire protection fee charge amount (less any approved credits), the date the payment is due and the date when payment is past due. 
b.  Unless otherwise billed directly to the property owner, the fire protection fee charge will be billed and collected on a common statement and collected along with other city utility services from the person in whose name such services have been placed on account with the city. If and when the account is closed or becomes delinquent, the bills for unpaid previous service as well as for current and future service shall be sent to the property owner. 
c.  Frequency of the billing of fire protection fee charges shall be specified by the city. 
d.  Failure to receive a bill shall not be justification for nonpayment.

e.  If a property is unbilled, or if no bill is sent for a particular tract of property, the fire protection utility may back bill for a period of up to three (3) years, but shall not be entitled to any interest or any delinquency charges during the back-billed period. 
(2)  Delinquencies and collections. 
a.  Unpaid fire protection fees shall be collected by filing suit to collect on an unpaid account and by using all methods allowed by Georgia law to collect on any judgment obtained thereby, including enforcement of any lien resulting from any such judgment. Unless reduced to a judgment and a writ of fieri facias issued, the unpaid user fee charge shall not constitute a direct lien against the owner or the property. 
b.  A late charge shall be assessed against the customer for the unpaid balance of any fire protection fee charge that becomes delinquent in accordance with applicable state law and city ordinance provisions. In addition, the city shall assess all costs of collection, including attorney's fees and court costs, against the property owner and/or the customer. 
(3)  Adjustments. 
a.  The fire chief shall administer the procedures and standards for the adjustment of the fire protection fee charge. 
1.  If a customer believes his fire protection fee is incorrect, the customer may seek an adjustment of the fire protection fee charge allocated to a property at any time by submitting the request in writing to the fire chief and setting forth in detail the grounds upon which relief is sought. The customer's public utility account must be paid and current prior to consideration of an adjustment request by the city. 
2.  Customers requesting the adjustment shall be required, at their own expense, to provide accurate information to the fire chief, including, but not limited to, inspection reports from a certified fire protection professional or building construction plans certified by a registered architect or a professional engineer. Submittal of this information will be required if the city staff cannot make a determination based on field inspection and/or review of existing city information. Failure to provide the required information within the time limits established by the fire chief, as may be reasonably extended, may result in denial of the customer's adjustment request. 
3.  Once a completed adjustment request and all required information are received by the fire chief, the fire chief shall within thirty (30) calendar days render a written decision. 
4.  In considering an adjustment request, the fire chief shall consider whether the calculation of the fire protection fee charge for the property is correct. 
5.  The fire chief's decision shall be in writing and will be mailed to the address provided on the adjustment request, and service shall be complete upon mailing. 
6.  If the result of an adjustment is that a refund is due the applicant, the refund will be applied as a credit on the applicant's next fire protection fee charge bill.

Sec. 13-36. - Computation of development impact fee. 
(a)  (1)  At the option of the developer, the amount of the development impact fee may be as per the provisions of subsection (2) below or may be determined from the fee schedule established by the city as follows: 
Land Use Fire Impact Fee Residential 
Commercial/institutional 
Manufacturing/industrial As established by the mayor and council for each land use category  
(2)  If a building permit is requested for a building with mixed uses, the fee shall be determined according to the fee schedule established by the city by apportioning the space committed to uses specified on the fee schedule. If the type of development activity for which a building permit is applied for is not specified on the fee schedule, the director shall use the fee applicable to the most nearly comparable type of land use on the fee schedule. The director shall be guided in the selection of a comparable type by the reports and studies done by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and/or the state, and/or the city department of public works, and/or professional organizations such as the American Society of Civil Engineers. 
In the case of change of use, redevelopment or modification of an existing use which requires the issuance of a building permit, the development impact fee shall be based upon the net increase in the fee for the new use as compared to the previous use. The director shall be guided in this determination by the above-named sources. 
(b)  If a developer elects not to have the development impact fee determined according to subsection (a), above, then the developer may apply for an individual fee determination. A developer applying for an individual fee determination shall prepare and submit to the director an individual fee calculation study for the development activity for which a building permit is sought. The individual fee calculation study shall follow the prescribed methodologies and formats for the study established by the director, or, subject to the prior approval of the director, such other professionally accepted methodology that identifies a project's proportionate share. The developer shall attend a pre-application meeting with the director and no agreement or understanding in regard to data, assumptions or methodology shall be binding upon the city unless provided to the developer in writing. The service demand documentation submitted shall show the basis upon which the individual fee calculation was made, including, but not limited to the following: 
(1)  Documentation demonstrating the impact of the proposed development activity on the following city-provided services: 
a.  Public safety: 
1.  Fire. 
b.  Parks. 
(2)  Engineering or any other suitable report(s), study or documentation depicting service demands or city-provided services appropriate for the proposed development activity. 
(3)  Cost documentation studies including documentation of the cost per unit of impact for construction and documentation credits attributable to the development activity which can be expected to be available to replace the portion of the service volume/demand generated by the development activity. 
This documentation shall be prepared and presented by qualified professionals in their respective fields and shall follow best professional practices and methodologies. The following formula, as explained in the methodology report, shall be used by the director to determine the development impact fee per unit of development based on the type of land use: 
[Unit Cost x Demand] - Credit = Proportionate Share 
Whereby: 
Unit cost = The average cost per unit of capacity to provide infrastructure or facilities within the service district. 
Demand = The average volume/capacity or demand expected to be utilized by a given land use on an annual basis. 
Credit = The average present value of future payments by a land use towards the retirement of debt incurred to construct facilities and infrastructure. 
The director shall provide the developer with a written individual fee determination within thirty (30) days after presentation of the individual fee calculation study. 
(c)  (1)  Upon application to the director, any person engaging in development activity requiring payment of a development impact fee may apply for and shall receive from the director a certification of the application of the development impact fee schedule to a particular development activity proposal or a certification of an individual fee determination for a particular development proposal. 
(2)  Applications for certification shall include the following information items: 
a.  A full and complete description of the project; 
b.  A full and complete description of the proposed land use and the particular proposed development activity; 
c.  A statement as to whether the applicant seeks a certification of the development impact fee schedule as applied to that particular development proposal or a certification of an individual fee determination; and 
d.  If the applicant seeks a certification of an individual fee determination, an individual fee calculation study complying with the requirements of subsection (b) above. 
(3)  The director shall provide an applicant with a written certification of the application of the development impact fee schedule to a particular proposed development activity within five (5) days after the director's receipt of a completed application. The written certification of the director shall establish the development impact fee for a particular proposed development activity for a period of one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of certification. The director shall provide the applicant with a written certification of an individual fee determination within thirty (30) days after receipt of a completed application. The individual fee determination certified by the director shall establish the development impact fee for the one hundred eighty-day period immediately following the date of such certification. Notwithstanding the issuance of any such certification, any changes in or additions to the proposed development activity different from the particular proposed development activity identified in the original application shall be subject to increased or additional development impact fees to the extent that such changes or additions require capital improvements or facilities expansions. The additional development impact fees shall be based upon the most current development impact fee schedule in effect on the date of the issuance of a building permit. 
(d)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, prior to engaging in development activity generating demand and impacting city-provided services, and in addition to any other applicable requirements, the developer shall certify in writing to the director: 
(1)  A full and complete description of the project; 
(2)  A full and complete description of the proposed land use or uses; and 
(3)  A statement of the gross square footage applicable to each category of land use. 
    Prior to the completion of the project, and as a condition of final inspection, the developer shall recertify in writing to the director the actual land use or uses of the project, and shall present an architect's certificate of the actual gross square footage attributable to each use. In the event that the actual use or uses and/or the actual gross square footage applicable to the actual use or uses differs from that originally certified, and in the event that the development impact fee was previously paid, the developer shall be required to pay the amount of the excess as a condition of final inspection. The amount of the excess shall be based upon the most current development impact fee schedule in effect on the date of final inspection.

ARTICLE VIII. - ADULT ENTERTAINMENT ESTABLISHMENTS[9] 

Footnotes: 
--- (9) --- 
Editor's note- Section 2 of Ord. No. 97-12, adopted Nov. 18, 1997, deleted Art. VIII, §§ 15-141-15-162, in its entirety. Section 3 of Ord. No. 97-12 adopted similar provisions as herein set out. Former §§ 15-141-15-162 derived from Ord. No. 95-11, adopted June 20, 1995. 
State Law reference- Municipal authority to enact legislation to restrict operation of adult bookstores, explicit media outlets and adult movie houses to areas zoned for commercial or industrial purposes, O.C.G.A. § 36-60-3; Establishment, maintenance or use of building, structure or place for unlawful sexual purposes declared a nuisance, O.C.G.A. § 41-3-1. 

Sec. 15-141. - Introduction. 
    Based on the experiences of other municipalities and counties, including, but not limited to, Peach County, Georgia, Austin, Texas and Garden Grove, California, which experiences are found to be relevant to the problems faced by the city; and based on the documentary evidence and oral testimony presented by citizens and an expert in economic development at a public hearing in which the mayor and council of the city participated in on January 6, 1997; and based on documentary evidence submitted to the city council, the city council takes note of the well-known and self-evident conditions and secondary effects attendant to the commercial exploitation of human sexuality, which do not vary greatly among the various communities within our country. 
    It is the finding of the city council that public nudity (either partial or total) under certain circumstances, particularly circumstances related to the sale and consumption of alcoholic beverages in establishments offering live nude entertainment or "adult entertainment," (whether such alcoholic beverages are sold on the premises or not) begets criminal behavior and tends to create undesirable community conditions. In the same manner, other adult businesses have the same deleterious effects on the community. 
    Among the acts of criminal behavior found to be associated with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, commercial nudity in general, and other adult businesses are disorderly conduct, prostitution, public solicitation, public indecency, drug use and drug trafficking. Among the undesirable community conditions identified with the commercial combination of live nudity and alcohol, commercial nudity in general, and other adult businesses are depression of property values and acceleration of community blight in the surrounding neighborhood, increased allocation of and expenditure of law enforcement personnel to preserve law and order, and increased burden on the judicial system as a consequence of the criminal behavior hereinabove described. The city council finds it is reasonable to believe that some or all of these undesirable community conditions will result in the city as well. 
    The city council therefore finds that it is in the best interests of the health, welfare, safety and morals of the community and the preservation of its businesses, neighborhoods and of churches, schools, residential areas, public parks and playgrounds to prevent or reduce the adverse impacts of adult business establishments. Therefore, the city council finds that licensing and regulations are necessary for any adult business establishment. The city council finds that these regulations promote the public welfare by furthering legitimate public and governmental interests, including but not limited to, reducing criminal activity and protecting against or eliminating undesirable community conditions and further finds that such will not infringe upon the protected Constitutional rights of freedom of speech or expression. To that end, this article is hereby adopted. 
(Ord. No. 97-12, § 3, 11-18-97)

Any other factor known to or discovered by the city whereby it is objectively shown the licensee, any of the licensee's employees or any person holding an interest in a license, has engaged in conduct at or involving the licensed business or has permitted conduct on the licensed premises that constitutes a violation of federal or state law, local ordinance or administrative regulations involving alcoholic beverages, gambling or narcotics for all alcohol licensed businesses and including any sex offense under state law or local ordinances with respect to businesses licensed for on-premises consumption.

At the hearing the licensee shall have the right to represent itself or be represented by counsel, may cross-examine all witnesses offered by the city, and may call witnesses and present evidence in its own behalf. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply to hearings under this section, although the hearing officer shall have the right to exclude evidence which carries no indicia of reliability. All testimony shall be offered under oath or affirmation. 
(6)  The hearing officer shall make his final determination within ten (10) business days of the completion of the hearing.

A subsequent violation within a probationary period shall be cause for revocation and/or denial of license renewal. A total of three (3) separate and unrelated violations within twenty-four (24) months, whether or not within a probationary period, shall be grounds for permanent revocation. 
(7)  The hearing officer's decision shall be personally served or mailed by certified mail, return receipt requested to the licensee and his attorney, with a copy to the city attorney, within ten (10) business days of the close of the hearing. The decision of the hearing officer shall constitute final action by the city, subject to review upon petition for certiorari to the superior court. 
(8)  Upon receipt of notice of adverse action against the licensee under this section, the licensee may waive its right to a hearing and stipulate to a sanction, as recommended by the mayor, in consultation with the chief of police. Any stipulation entered under this subsection shall be in writing, signed by the licensee, and non-appealable.

ARTICLE XVI. - STORMWATER UTILITY 

Sec. 15-2117. - Findings. 
    The mayor and city council make the following findings of fact: 
(1)  The City of Perry is authorized by the Georgia Constitution of 1983, including, without limitation, Article IX, Section II, Paragraph III thereof and O.C.G.A. § 36-82-62 to provide stormwater management services throughout the City of Perry. 
(2)  In order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the public, the government of the City of Perry hereby exercises its authority to establish a stormwater utility enterprise fund and establish rates for stormwater management services. 
(3)  In promulgating the regulations contained in this section, the City of Perry is acting pursuant to authority granted by the Constitution of the State of Georgia and the City Charter of the City of Perry to provide for stormwater collection and disposal. 
(4)  Improper management of stormwater runoff may cause erosion of lands, threaten businesses and residences, and other facilities with water damage and may environmentally impair the rivers, streams and other bodies of water within the City of Perry. 
(5)  A system for the collection, conveyance, storage, treatment and disposal of stormwater provides services to all properties within the City of Perry and surrounding areas. 
(6)  The City of Perry presently owns and operates stormwater management systems and facilities, which have been developed over many years. The future usefulness and operational function of the existing stormwater management systems and facilities owned and operated by the city, and the additions and improvements thereto, rests on the ability of the city to effectively manage, protect, control, regulate, use, and enhance stormwater systems and facilities within the city in concert with the management of other water resources within the city. In order to do so, the city must have both a comprehensive stormwater management program as well as an adequate and stable funding source for its comprehensive program operation and drainage-related capital improvement needs. 
(7)  Failure to effectively manage stormwater can adversely affect the operations of the sanitary sewer system operated by the City of Perry thereby increasing the likelihood of infiltration and inflow into the sanitary sewer system. 
(8)  Failure to effectively manage stormwater contributes to the further degradation of the water quality in area waterbodies which may result in higher levels o treatment requirements imposed on the City of Perry wastewater treatment facilities and increased water treatment cost of potable water supplies by the City of Perry. 
(9)  Proper management of stormwater is a key element of having clean water with adequate assimilative capacity for treated wastewater discharges and adequate potable drinking water that are essential to support existing development as well as future development and redevelopment in the City of Perry. 
(10)  The city will soon be required under federal and state regulations (i.e., the city's National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) Phase II Georgia Notice of Intent (NOI) and stormwater permit effective March 13, 2003) to provide enhanced management of stormwater runoff quality to mitigate the impacts of pollutants which may be discharged from the public municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) and stormwater conveyance system into State of Georgia or United States' waters. Therefore, it is appropriate for the city to impose a stormwater user fee charge upon all improved properties that may discharge, directly or indirectly, into the public MS4 and stormwater conveyance system, whether the property is private or public in nature. 
(11)  Compliance with the regulatory obligations of the NPDES phase II stormwater permit, along with other city stormwater program activities, will substantially increase the cost of providing stormwater management services above what is currently being spent for water quality management, drainage system maintenance, flood control and other program activities. 
(12)  The cost of operating and maintaining the City of Perry stormwater management system and financing necessary repairs, replacements, improvements and extensions thereof should, to the extent practicable, be allocated in relationship to the services received from the system. 
(13)  The professional engineering and financing analysis, known as the stormwater funding feasibility analysis (including amendments) and related documents, dated February 2004 and prepared by the city's consulting stormwater engineer, which report is incorporated herein by express reference, properly assesses and defines the city's stormwater management program problems, needs, goals, defines the city's stormwater management program funding strategy. 
(14)  Given the stormwater management program problems, needs, goals, priorities and funding strategy identified in the aforementioned professional engineering and financing analysis, it is appropriate to authorize the formation of an organizational and accounting entity dedicated specifically to the management, maintenance, protection, control, regulation, use, and enhancement of stormwater management systems within the city in concert with other water resource management programs. 
(15)  Stormwater management is applicable and needed throughout the incorporated areas of the city. While specific service and facility demands may differ from area to area at any given point in time, a stormwater management service area encompassing all lands and water bodies within the incorporated areas of the city is consistent with the present and future needs of the community. 
(16)  The stormwater needs in the city include, but are not limited to, protection of the public health, safety, and welfare of the community. Provision of stormwater management services renders and/or results in both a service and a benefit to all properties, property owners, citizens, and residents of the city in a variety of ways as described in the stormwater utility implementation report. 
(17)  The services and benefits rendered, or resulting from provision of stormwater management services, may differ depending on many factors and considerations, including, but not limited to, location, demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management systems and programs, and risk exposure. It is practical and equitable to allocate the cost of stormwater management among the owners of improved properties in proportion to the long term demands the properties impose on the city's stormwater management services which render or result in services and benefits to such properties and the owners thereof. 
(18)  A stormwater management program (SWMP) provides the most practical and appropriate means of properly delivering stormwater management services throughout the city, and the most equitable means to regulate the use of a higher level of stormwater management services within the city through stormwater user fee charges, user fees and other mechanisms as described in the stormwater utility implementation report, and the other related documents, that have been prepared for the city by its consultants. 
(19)  A schedule of stormwater utility user fee charges based in part on the area of impervious surface located on each improved property is the most appropriate and equitable means of allocating the cost of stormwater management services throughout the city. Such user fee charges may be complemented by other types of charges which address specific needs, including, but not limited to, special service fees, special assessments, revenue bonds, use of proceeds from special purpose local option sales taxes and other forms of revenue, as deemed appropriate by the mayor and city council. 
(20)  The existence of privately owned and maintained on-site or off-site systems, facilities, activities or assets which reduce or otherwise mitigate the impact of a particular property on the city's SWMP, and the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and/or stormwater management systems and facilities, should be taken into account to reduce the user fee charge on that property either in the form of a direct reduction or credit, and such reduction or credit should be conditional upon continuing provision of such services, systems, facilities, activities or assets in a manner complying with the standards and codes as determined by the stormwater utility manager. Reductions or credits for privately owned and maintained stormwater management systems, facilities, activities or assets shall be generally proportional to the affect that such systems have on the peak rate of runoff from the property. 
(21)  The area of impervious surfaces on each improved property is the most important factor influencing the cost of the stormwater management services provided by the city or to be provided by the city in the future, and the area of impervious surfaces on each property is therefore the most appropriate parameter for calculating a periodic stormwater user fee charge. 
(22)  It is imperative that the proceeds from all user fee charges for stormwater management services, together with any other revenues raised or otherwise allocated specifically to stormwater management services, be dedicated solely to those purposes, and such proceeds of user fee charges and revenues shall therefore be deposited into the enterprise accounting fund of the city stormwater utility and shall remain in that fund and be dispersed only for stormwater management capital, operating and non-operating costs, lease payments and debt service of bonds or other indebtedness for stormwater management purposes. 
(Ord. No. 2012-23, 10-23-12) 
Sec. 15-2118. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Act means and refers to the Clean Water Act as amended by the Water Quality Act of 1987 (33 U.S.C. § 1251 et seq.), as amended, and the rules and regulations promulgated by the United States Environmental Protection Agency pursuant thereto. 
    Attached residential property means improved property containing individually owned, attached dwelling units such as duplexes, triplexes, quadplexes, townhouses, or other residential structures not listed herein where one or more family groups commonly and normally reside or could reside. Improved property may be classified as an attached residential property despite the presence of incidental structures associated with residential uses such as garages, carports and small storage buildings. Improved property may be classified as an attached residential property despite the presence of a commercial use. Attached residential property shall not include improved property containing: structures used primarily for non-residential purposes, hotels, motels, rental apartments not individually owned, retirement centers, nursing homes and assisted living home. 
    Credit means a reduction in the amount of a stormwater user fee charge to the owner of a particular property for the existence and use of privately owned, maintained and operated on-site or off-site stormwater systems or facilities, or continuing provision of services or activities that reduce or mitigate the city's cost of providing stormwater management services for that particular property. 
    Customers of the stormwater utility shall include all persons, properties, and entities serviced by and/or benefiting from the services provided by the city's SWMP and the stormwater utility. These services include, but are not necessarily limited to, the stormwater utility's administration, management, maintenance, expansion, and improvement of the public stormwater management systems for the handling of stormwater runoff of private and public properties, and the regulation of the public and private stormwater management systems, controls, facilities, and activities. 
    Detached single-family residential property or DSFR means improved property containing one residential structure which is not attached to another dwelling, and which contains one or more bedrooms, with bathroom and kitchen facilities, designed for occupancy by one family. A detached single-family residential property may include a "stick-built," industrialized, or other type of home other than manufactured home located on one or more individual lots or parcels of land. Improved property may be classified as a detached single-family residential property even if there is present incidental structures associated with residential uses such as garages, carports, storage buildings, guesthouses, servants or caretakers quarters, cottages or barns, or the presence of a commercial use within the residence, as long as such use does not result in additional areas of impervious surfaces. Detached single-family residential properties shall not include improved property containing structures used primarily for nonresidential purposes, manufactured homes located within manufactured home parks where the land is owned by someone other than the owners of the manufactured homes, or multiple dwelling unit residential properties. 
    Improved property means property altered from its natural state by construction or installation of more than five hundred (500) square feet of impervious surfaces.

The horizontal impervious surface area includes, but is not limited to, all areas covered by structures, roof extensions, patios, porches, driveways and sidewalks. 
    Hydrologic response defines the manner and means whereby stormwater collects, remains, infiltrates, and is conveyed from a property. Hydrologic response is dependent on several factors including, but not limited to, the presence of impervious surface, the parcel's size, the parcel's shape, the parcel's vegetative canopy, the parcel's groundwater, the parcel's antecedent moisture and the parcel's geologic condition. 
    Impervious surface means those areas which prevent or impede the infiltration of stormwater into the soil in the manner in which it entered the soil, in natural conditions, prior to development. Common impervious surfaces include, but are not limited to, rooftops, buildings or structures, sidewalks, walkways, patio areas, driveways, parking lots, storage areas, compacted gravel and soil surfaces, awnings and other fabric or plastic coverings, and other surfaces which prevent or impede the natural infiltration of stormwater runoff which existed prior to development. 
    Manufactured home property or MH means a single-family property or lot that is occupied by a manufactured home used for residential purposes. 
    Non-single-family residential property or NSFR means improved property containing multiple dwelling unit residential properties, condominiums, apartments, commercial and office buildings, public buildings and structures, industrial and manufacturing buildings, storage buildings and storage areas, parking lots, parks, recreation properties, tennis courts, swimming pools, public and private schools and universities, research facilities and stations, hospitals and convalescent centers, airports, agricultural uses, water and wastewater treatment plants, and any other form of use not otherwise mentioned which is not a detached single-family residential (DSFR), attached residential (AR) property or manufactured home (MH), and which has private parking lots and private drives or roads. 
    Public water influence zone means those areas lying downstream of a culvert or other stormwater management conveyance system. On the downstream side of the conveyance system, the public water influence zone will extend for a length of six (6) times the diameter (or width) of the culvert from which runoff is being discharged (Field Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia, Third Edition, pg. 99), and within the horizontal limits set forth in the aforementioned field manual. For example, if a forty-eight-inch diameter culvert is discharging to a private property, the public water influence zone shall extend twenty-four (24) feet (six (6) times forty-eight (48) inches) from the end of the culvert and for the specified width (i.e., typically the width of the creek). The City of Perry Stormwater Utility may perform maintenance and/or capital construction activities only within that portion of the public water influence zone which the city has an ownership interest in, or for which a dedicated easement has been granted to, and accepted by the city for such purpose. 
    Service area means the entire land area within the corporate limits of the city. 
    Stormwater management services means all services provided by the city which relate to the: 
(1)  Transfer, control, conveyance or movement of stormwater runoff through the incorporated portions of the city; 
(2)  Maintenance, repair and replacement of existing stormwater management systems and facilities; 
(3)  Planning, development, design and construction of additional stormwater management systems and facilities to meet current and anticipated needs; 
(4)  Regulation of the use of stormwater management services, systems and facilities; and

Stormwater management services may address the quality of stormwater runoff as well as the quantity thereof. 
    Stormwater management systems and facilities means those natural and manmade channels, swales, ditches, rivers, streams, creeks, branches, reservoirs, ponds, drainage ways, inlets, catch basins, pipes, headwalls, storm sewers, lakes and other physical works, properties and improvements which transfer, control, convey, detain, retain, treat or otherwise influence the movement of stormwater runoff. 
    Stormwater utility manager means the person appointed by the mayor and city council to administer the provisions of this article. 
    Stormwater user fee charge means the periodic user fee charge imposed pursuant to this article by the City of Perry Stormwater Utility for providing stormwater management services. This term shall exclude special charges to the owners of particular properties for services, systems or facilities related to stormwater management, including, but not limited to, charges for development plan review, inspection of development projects, on-site stormwater control systems and other stormwater management services provided by the City of Perry for which a corresponding fee is collected for the service rendered. 
    Undeveloped land means land in its unaltered natural condition or which is modified to such a minimal degree as to have a hydrologic response comparable to land in an unaltered natural condition shall be deemed undeveloped. Undeveloped land shall have minimal impervious surface, which impedes the infiltration of stormwater runoff or causes stormwater runoff to collect, concentrate or flow in a manner materially different from what would occur if the land were in an unaltered natural condition. For purposes of this article, undeveloped land includes property altered from its natural condition by the creation or installation of five hundred (500) square feet or less of impervious surface. 
    User means any person who uses property, which maintains connection to, discharges to, or otherwise receives services from the city for stormwater management.

(1)  Within public road rights-of-way; 
(2)  On private property but within easements granted to, and accepted by, the City of Perry, or are otherwise permitted to be located on such private property by written agreements for rights-of-entry, rights-of-access, rights-of-use or other permanent provisions for operation, maintenance, improvement and access to the stormwater management system facilities located thereon; 
(3)  On private property but within the public water influence zone as defined in section 24-452 of this article;

Sec. 15-2121. - Stormwater utility customer classes. 
(a)  There shall be one stormwater utility service area in the City of Perry with specified customer classes to reflect variations in services provided to stormwater utility customers and the respective demand that those customers' properties place on the city SWMP and drainage system. The specified customer classes for the City of Perry Stormwater Utility are as follows: 
(1)  Detached single-family residential (DSFR) customers as defined in section 15-2118 of this article. 
(2)  Attached residential (AR) customers shall consist of all properties as defined in section 15-2118 of this article. 
(3)  Manufactured home (MH) customers shall consist of all properties as defined in section 15-2118 of this article, 
(4)  Non-single-family residential (NSFR) customers, as defined in section 15-2118 of this article, shall consist of all properties located in the City of Perry that are not classified as DSFR, AR or MH. 
(b)  Documentation pertaining to the City of Perry Stormwater Utility customer classes shall be kept on file in the office of the stormwater utility manager for public inspection. 
(Ord. No. 2012-23, 10-23-12) 
Sec. 15-2122. - Stormwater user fee charges. 
(a)  It shall be the policy of the city that user fee charges for stormwater management services to be provided by the stormwater utility in the designated service areas shall be equitably derived through methods which have a demonstrable relationship to the varied demands and impacts imposed on the stormwater management services by individual properties and/or the level of service rendered by, or resulting from, the provision of stormwater management services. Stormwater user fee charge rates shall be structured so as to be uniform within the customer class, and the resultant user fee charges shall bear a substantial relationship to the cost of providing stormwater management services. User fee charge rates shall be in addition to other rates, charges, or fees employed for stormwater management within the incorporated areas of the city, including, but not limited to, plan review and inspection fees, fees for special services, fees in lieu of regulatory requirements, system development charges and special assessments. 
(b)  To the extent practicable, credits against stormwater user fee charges shall be provided for onsite stormwater control systems and activities constructed, operated, maintained and performed to the city's standards by public and private property owners which eliminate, mitigate or compensate for the impact that the property or person may have upon stormwater runoff discharged to public stormwater management systems and facilities or to private stormwater management systems and facilities which impact the proper function of public stormwater management systems and facilities. 
(Ord. No. 2012-23, 10-23-12) 
Sec. 15-2123. - Stormwater user fee charge rates. 
(a)  Stormwater user fee charge rates shall be set and may be modified from time to time by the city council. A schedule of said rates shall be on file in the office of the city clerk of the City of Perry. In setting or modifying such rates it shall be the goal of the city to establish rates that are fair and reasonable, and together with other sources of support available to the City of Perry Stormwater Utility, are sufficient to support the cost of the stormwater management services, including, but not limited to, the payment of principal and interest on debt obligations, lease payments, operating expenses, capital outlays, non-operating expenses, provisions for prudent reserves and other costs as deemed appropriate by the city. 
(1)  The stormwater user fee charge shall be in accordance with a fee schedule adopted by the mayor and council. 
(2)  Detached single-family residential (DSFR) customer class. All DSFR properties shall be charged a flat rate equivalent to one ERU. 
(3)  Attached residential (AR) customer class. All AR properties as defined herein shall be charged the rate applicable to one ERU times the number of dwelling units located on the property (ERU total) times an adjustment factor (AF). The adjustment factor (AF) has been determined to be 0.72. For each monthly user fee charge billing, the ERU total figure will be multiplied by the adjustment factor (AF) which adjusts the ERU total to equal the median impervious surface of a statistical comparison of AR properties versus DSFR properties in the city. Therefore, each attached residential dwelling unit will be charged a stormwater user fee of 0.72 ERU per dwelling unit per month. 
(4)  Manufactured home (MH) customer class. All MH properties as defined herein shall be charged the rate applicable to one ERU times the number of dwelling units located on the property (ERU total) times an adjustment factor (AF). The adjustment factor (AF) has been determined to be 0.37. For each monthly user fee charge billing, the ERU total figure will be multiplied by the adjustment factor (AF) which adjusts the ERU total to equal the median impervious surface of a statistical comparison of MH properties versus DSFR properties in the city. Therefore, each attached residential dwelling unit will be charged a stormwater user fee of 0.37 ERU per dwelling unit per month. 
(5)  Non-single-family residential (NSFR) customer class. All NSFR properties as defined herein shall be billed one ERU for every three-thousand-three-hundred-square-foot increment, or portion thereof, of impervious surface. In cases where a fractional ERU is calculated, the total ERU for the customer account will be rounded down to the next whole number for billing. Increments of impervious surface less than three thousand three hundred (3,300) square feet shall not be billable except in the case of minimum bills (i.e., five hundred (500) to three thousand two hundred ninety-nine (3,299) square feet of impervious surface), which shall be billed at the rate for one ERU. For customers located within a development with shared common parking or other impervious surface, the amount of shared common impervious surface associated with the developed land shall be apportioned to the individual customer by a percentage of the impervious surface attributable to the customer as determined by the total common shared impervious surface times the percentage of the customer's square feet of leased, or owned, interior or exterior space to the total square feet within the development of interior, or exterior, space available for occupancy. Fractional ERUs for NSFR properties will be rounded to two (2) decimal places to establish the actual number of ERUs for billing. 
(b)  The customers of the stormwater utility shall be billed for the stormwater user fee charges. The stormwater user fee charge may be billed on a common statement and collected along with other city public utility charges. The customer may be the occupant, owner or user who is billed by the city for public services, i.e., water, sewer, natural gas and/or sanitation. If the improved property does not receive any other city public utility services, or is not being charged for public utility services due to vacancy, or non-use, at the time of stormwater user fee billing, then the owner of the property, shall be billed for stormwater management services by the city. Regardless of whether or not the developed land has an occupant or user, the owner is ultimately responsible for payment of the stormwater user fee charges.

Sec. 15-2124. - Stormwater user fee charge exemptions. 
    Except as provided in this section or otherwise provided by law, no public or private property located in the incorporated area of the City of Perry shall be exempt from the stormwater user fee charges. No exception, credit, offset, or other reduction in stormwater user fee charges shall be granted based on age, tax status, economic status, race, religion or other condition unrelated to the stormwater utility's cost of providing stormwater management services and facilities.

All other state, federal, and county properties are subject to the user fee charges on the same basis as private properties. 
(4)  The City of Perry (city owned) public streets and rights-of-way shall be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. This exemption is in recognition of routine drainage system maintenance and capital construction services undertaken by the city via the general fund. However, other improved property used for city purposes shall not be exempt from stormwater user fee charges. 
(5)  Any property whereby one hundred (100) percent of the stormwater runoff is contained or infiltrated on the property and no stormwater runoff is discharged, via overland flow, into the city owned storm drainage system.

The amount of credit, or reduction of the stormwater user fee charge, shall be in accordance with the criteria contained in the credit technical manual. 
(2)  Any credit allowed against the stormwater user fee charge is conditioned on continuing compliance with the city's design and performance standards as stated in the credit technical manual and/or upon continuing provision of the controls, systems, facilities, services, and activities provided, operated, and maintained by the property owner or owners upon which the credit is based. The stormwater utility manager may revoke a credit at any time for noncompliance with applicable standards and criteria as established in the credit technical manual or this article.

(5)  The application for any credit or adjustment must be in writing and must include the information necessary to establish eligibility for the credit or adjustment, and be in the format established by the stormwater utility manager. Incomplete applications will not be accepted for consideration and processing. 
(b)  When an application for a credit is deemed complete by the stormwater utility manager, he shall have thirty (30) days from the date the complete application is accepted to either grant the credit in whole, grant the credit in part, or deny the credit. Credits applied for by the property owner and granted in whole or in part, shall apply to all stormwater user fee charges in accordance with the terms defined in the credit technical manual. 
(Ord. No. 2012-23, 10-23-12) 
Sec. 15-2126. - Enforcement methods and inspections. 
(a)  All property owners of improved property within the incorporated areas of the City of Perry shall provide, manage, maintain, and operate on-site stormwater management systems sufficient to collect, convey, detain, and discharge stormwater runoff in a safe manner consistent with all applicable city development regulations, ordinances, and state and federal laws. Any failure to meet this obligation shall constitute a violation of this article and be subject to citation and prosecution in the City of Perry Municipal Court. Each day such violation exists shall constitute a separate offense, subject to the penalties set forth in section 1-11 of the City of Perry Code of Ordinances. 
(b)  Alternately, in the event a public nuisance is deemed to exist by the stormwater utility manager the city may elect to sue in the City of Perry Municipal Court to abate such nuisance. In the event a public nuisance is found by the court to exist, which the property owner fails to abate within such reasonable time as allowed by the City of Perry Municipal Court, the city may enter upon the property and cause work as is reasonably necessary to be performed, with the actual cost thereof assessed against the property owner in the same manner as a tax levied against the property. From date of filing of such abatement action, the city shall have lien rights which may be perfected, after judgment, by filing a notice of lien on the general execution docket of the City of Perry Municipal Court. 
(c)  The city shall have the right for its designated officers and employees to enter upon public and private property during reasonable hours, and after reasonable notice to the owner thereof, in order to assure compliance with the provisions of this article, and state and federal law. Such inspections shall generally be limited to the following purposes:

Sec. 15-2127. - Stormwater user fee charge billing, delinquencies, collections, adjustments. 
    Failure to receive a stormwater utility bill is not justification for non-payment. The property owner, as identified from public land records of Houston County, shall be obligated to pay the appropriate stormwater user fee charge for that property. 
(1)  Billing. 
a.  Stormwater user fee charges shall begin to accrue as established by the mayor and council, and shall be billed prospectively. A bill for stormwater user fee charges may be sent through the United States Postal Service or by alternative means, notifying the owner of the property being billed of the amount of the stormwater user fee charge, less credits, the date the payment is due and the date when payment is past due. 
b.  The stormwater user fee charge will be billed and collected as deemed most effective and efficient by the city council. 
c.  Frequency of the billing of stormwater user fee charges shall be specified by the city council. 
d.  Failure to receive a bill shall not be justification for nonpayment. Regardless of the party to whom the bill is initially directed, the owner of each improved property subject to stormwater user fee charges shall be obligated to pay stormwater user fee charges and any interest on delinquent stormwater user fee charge payments. 
e.  If a property is unbilled, or if no bill is sent for a particular tract of improved property, the City of Perry Stormwater Utility may back bill for a period of up to one year, but shall not be entitled to any interest or any delinquency charges during the back billed period. 
(2)  Delinquencies and collection. 
a.  Unpaid stormwater service fees shall be collected by filing suit to collect on an unpaid account and by using all methods allowed by Georgia law to collect on any judgment obtained thereby, including enforcement of any lien resulting from any such judgment. Unless reduced to a judgment and a writ of fieri facias issued, the unpaid user fee charge shall not constitute a direct lien against the owner and/or the property. 
b.  A late charge shall be assessed against the customer for the unpaid balance of any stormwater utility user fee charge that becomes delinquent in accordance with applicable state law. In addition, the city shall assess all costs of collection, including attorney's fees and court costs, against the property owner. 
(3)  Adjustments. The stormwater utility manager shall administer the procedures and standards for the adjustment of the stormwater user fee charge. 
a.  If a customer believes their stormwater user fee is incorrect, the customer may seek an adjustment of the stormwater user fee charge allocated to a property at any time by submitting the request in writing to the stormwater utility manager and setting forth in detail the grounds upon which relief is sought. 
b.  Customers requesting the adjustment shall be required, at their own expense, to provide supplemental information to the stormwater utility manager, including, but not limited to, a survey certified by a registered land surveyor or a professional engineer. Submittal of this information will be required if the city staff cannot make a determination based on field inspection and/or review of existing city aerial photography. Failure to provide the required information within the time limits established by the stormwater utility manager, as may be reasonably extended, may result in denial of the adjustment request. 
c.  Once a completed adjustment request and all required information are received by the stormwater utility manager, the stormwater utility manager shall have thirty (30) calendar days within which to render a written decision. Concurrent payment of any charges allocated to the property is not required as a condition precedent to this request for review. 
d.  In considering an adjustment request, the stormwater utility manager shall consider whether the calculation of the stormwater utility user fee charge for the property is correct. 
e.  The stormwater utility manager's decision shall be in writing and will be mailed to the address provided on the adjustment request, and service shall be complete upon mailing. 
f.  If the result of an adjustment is that a refund is due the applicant, the refund will be applied as a credit on the applicant's next stormwater bill. 
(Ord. No. 2012-23, 10-23-12) 
Sec. 15-2128. - Appeals, hearings.

The appeal shall be taken within thirty (30) days of the decision of the stormwater utility manager by filing with the mayor and city council a notice of appeal in writing specifying the grounds thereof. Upon the filing of the notice of appeal, the stormwater utility manager shall forthwith transmit to the mayor and city council all documentation constituting the record upon which the decision appealed from was taken. 
(b)  Hearing. The mayor and city council shall fix a reasonable time for hearing the appeal and give written notice to the appellant at least ten (10) days prior to the hearing date. The notice shall indicate the place, date and time of the hearing. The mayor and city council shall affirm, reverse, affirm in part, or reverse in part the decision of the stormwater utility manager after hearing the evidence. If the decision of the stormwater utility manager is reversed in whole or in part, resulting in a refund or credit due to the property owner, then such refund or credit shall be calculated retroactive to the date of the initial appeal. 
(c)  Decision final. The decision of the mayor and city council shall be final, and there shall be no further administrative action. Any person aggrieved or dissatisfied with the decision of the mayor and city council may appeal that decision to the Superior Court of Houston County by Writ of Certiorari.

(4)  Whether the proposed use will be of such location, size, and character that, in general, it will be in harmony with the appropriate and orderly development of the area in which it is proposed to be situated and will not be detrimental to the orderly development of adjacent properties or a deterrent to the improvement of adjacent properties in accordance with the zoning classification of such properties, the existing land use pattern or the comprehensive plan. 
(5)  Whether, in the case of any use located in, or directly adjacent to, a residential district or area; 
(a)  The nature and intensity of operations will be such that both pedestrian and vehicular traffic to and from the use and the assembly of persons in connection therewith will not be hazardous or inconvenient to, or incongruous with, said residential district or area, or conflict with the normal traffic of the neighborhood; and 
(b)  The location and height of buildings, and other structure, and the nature and extent of screening, buffering or landscaping on the site will be such that the use will not hinder or discourage the appropriate development and use of adjacent land and buildings in conformance with existing zoning districts and development pattern. 
(6)  Whether the proposed use will increase the population density resulting in the increase or overtaxing of the load on public facilities such as schools, utilities, streets, etc.; or approval of the use would encourage adjacent areas to develop at higher densities than provided in the comprehensive plan resulting in the overtaxing of such public facilities. 
(7)  Whether the proposed use will cause a health hazard, a public safety problem, or create a nuisance or cause excessively increasing traffic and associated congestion; create a drainage problem; generate unnecessary disturbance due to noise, the emission of smoke or other contaminants, odor, electrical interference cause pollution to land, air and/or water.

    2-3.9. Conditional use permit. 
(A)  Purpose. Conditional uses are uses that are generally compatible with the other uses permitted in a zoning district, but require individual review of their location, design, configuration, and density and intensity of use, and usually require the imposition of conditions to ensure the appropriateness of the use at a particular location. 
(B)  Authority. 
(1)  General. The administrator is authorized to review and decide on an application for a conditional use permit pursuant to this section. 
(2)  Uses authorized. Only those uses identified as conditional uses in subsection 4-1.2, table of uses, are authorized to be considered for conditional use permits under this section. The designation of a use as a conditional use in subsection 4-1.2, table of uses, does not constitute authorization that such use shall be approved as a conditional use permit pursuant to this section. Rather, each proposed conditional use shall be evaluated by the administrator for compliance with the standards set forth in this section, and the standards for the use in section 4-3, standards for specific uses. 
(C)  Procedure. 
(1)  Initial submission of application and staff review. Application for conditional use permit shall be submitted in the form established by the administrator. 
(2)  Review and action by administrator. The administrator shall review and take action on the application consistent with the procedures and requirements of subsection 2-1.4, duties and powers of the administrator.

(2)  Facilities and services. There is adequate infrastructure capacity available to serve the proposed conditional use (roads, potable water, sewerage, schools, parks, police, fire, and emergency medical facilities). 
(E)  Conditions of approval. In approving a conditional use permit, the administrator may impose restrictions and conditions on the approval, the proposed use, and the premises to be developed or used pursuant to such approval as are required to ensure compliance with the general goals and policies of this chapter or with particular standards of this chapter to prevent or minimize adverse effects from the proposed development on surrounding lands. The restrictions and conditions imposed must be related in both type and scale to the impact that the proposed development would have on the public and surrounding development. All conditions imposed shall be expressly set forth in the permit approval. 
(F)  Inspection. Upon completion of the development authorized by the permit, the applicant shall contact the administrator to inspect and verify compliance with the provisions of the ordinance and the conditions of the permit. 
(G)  Effect. Issuance of a conditional use permit shall authorize only the particular conditional use that is approved in the permit. Unless limited by a condition of approval, a conditional use permit, including any conditions, shall run with the land and not be affected by a change in ownership. 
(H)  Expiration. The administrator may prescribe a time limit within which the activity authorized by the permit shall begin or be completed, or both. 
(I)  Appeal. An applicant may appeal the decision of the administrator with respect to the issuance of a conditional use permit pursuant to the provisions of subsection 2-3.7. 
(J)  Amendment. A conditional use permit may be amended, extended or modified only in accordance with the procedures and standards established for its original approval.

Such site plan shall include, as a minimum, the following: lot dimensions and the use of structures; easements (private and public), watercourses, and if existing and proposed; fences; street names and street right-of-way lines; and such other information regarding abutting property as directly affects the application. 
(B)  The community development department shall cause to have posted in a conspicuous place on the property in question a minimum of one sign for every one thousand (1,000) feet of road frontage, each of which shall be not less than six (6) square feet in area with orange background and black lettering; each sign shall contain information as to the proposed change and the date and time of the public hearing, and the cost of each shall be paid by the applicant prior to the public hearing. Said signs shall be posted fifteen (15) days prior to date of public hearing. 
(C)  The commission shall fix a reasonable time for the hearing of variances and administrative appeals referred to said commission, give at least fifteen (15) days public notice thereof, as well as due notice to the parties in interest, and decide the same within forty-five (45) days from the date of such public hearing. 
(D)  An appeal stays all legal proceeding in furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the community development department certifies to the commission after the notice of appeal shall have been filed that, by reason for facts stated in the certificate a stay would cause imminent peril to life and property. In such case, proceeding shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order which may be granted by the said commission or by a court of record, on application, on notice to the official from whom the appeal is taken and on due cause. 
(E)  In exercising the powers granted the commission in subsection 2-1.2.4 of this chapter, the said commission may, in conformity with the provisions of the ordinance, reverse or affirm, wholly or in part, or may modify the order, requirements, decisions or determination of the administrator, and to that end shall have all the powers of the administrator and may issue or direct the issuance of a zoning compliance permit. 
(F)  A property owner, or his appointed agent, shall not initiate action for an administrative appeal or variance affecting the same parcel of land more often than once every six (6) months without specific approval of the commission. 
(G)  Any application for an administrative appeal or variance, unless said petition is initiated by the council or the commission, shall be accompanied by a fee payment determined by the council. 
(H)  Any application for an administrative appeal or variance may be withdrawn prior to final action at the discretion of the person, firm or corporation initiating such a request upon written notice to the administrator. Such withdrawal may result in the loss or partial loss of the fee payment described in the administrative manual. 
(I)  Any person or persons severally or jointly aggrieved by any decision of the commission may take an appeal to the superior court. 
(J)  In reviewing a proposed application for variance, the following standards shall apply where applicable: 
(1)  By reason of exceptional narrowness, shallowness, shape, topographical conditions, or other extraordinary situations or conditions peculiar to a specific parcel of property, the strict application of these regulations would result in peculiar or unusual, practical, difficulties to or exceptional or undue hardship upon the owner of such property; 
(2)  Such variance is the minimum reasonably necessary to overcome the aforesaid exceptional conditions; 
(3)  Such variance can be granted without substantial impairment to the intent, purpose, and integrity of this chapter and/or the comprehensive plan or other master plan adopted for the property; 
(4)  Such variance will not be detrimental to the use and enjoyment of adjoining or neighboring properties. These provisions, however, shall not permit the commission to grant any variance to any setback or yard requirements for property zoned for commercial or industrial purposes when such property abuts or immediately adjoins any property zoned for residential purposes unless such residential property is proposed for commercial or industrial use on the comprehensive land development plan. 
(K)  Variances cannot be granted for use of land or structures not permitted or prohibited, or to increase the density of development for a tract beyond that permitted by the zoning district. 
(L)  If the hardship invoking the provisions of this section was the result of the applicant's intentional disregard or willful failure to comply with the terms of this chapter, the commission may refuse to grant a variance. 
(M)  A variance cannot be granted to cure a violation of the ordinance unless and until the commission finds as a fact that: 
(1)  The violation cannot be reasonably remedied by any other means; 
(2)  The act creating the violation was not deliberate, intentional, or the result of gross negligence; 
(3)  Such variance can be granted without substantial impairment to the intent and purpose of this chapter and will not be detrimental to the use and enjoyment of adjoining or neighboring properties; and 
(4)  The violator has not previously requested and been granted a variance under the provisions of this subsection, except that this provision shall not apply if the violator can establish that such previous violation was the result of an accident or other excusable causes. 
    2-3.8. Certificate of appropriateness. 
2-3.8.1. Downtown development district. 
(A)  Application. Application for a downtown development district certificate of appropriateness shall be made to the office of the administrator on forms provided therefore, obtainable from the office of the administrator. Detailed drawings, plans or specifications shall not be required but each application shall be accompanied by such sketches, drawings, photographs, descriptions, or other information showing the proposed sign, exterior alterations, additions, changes of new construction as are reasonably required for the administrator. 
(B)  Action on application for certificate of appropriateness. The administrator shall receive the application, together with the supporting information and materials, and act upon the application within thirty (30) days after filing thereof; otherwise, the application shall be deemed to be approved and a certificate of appropriateness shall be issued. Nothing herein shall prohibit an extension of time where mutual agreement has been made. The administrator shall present the application for a certificate of appropriateness to the downtown development district board of review and the board may advise the administrator and make recommendations in regard to the appropriateness. If the administrator approves the application, a certificate of appropriateness shall be issued. If the certificate of appropriateness is issued, the application shall be processed in the same manner as applications for building permits. If the administrator disapproves the application, a certificate of appropriateness shall not be issued. The administrator shall state its reasons in writing and shall advise the applicant and a certificate of appropriateness shall not be issued. 
(C)  Appeal provision. Any person adversely affected by any determination made by the administrator relative to the issuance or denial of a downtown development district certificate of appropriateness may appeal such determination to the planning commission. 
    2-3.8.2. Historic overlay district. 
(A)  Certificate of appropriateness required. After a historic district is designated, no material change in the appearance of such historic district shall be made or be permitted to be made by the owner or occupant thereof, unless and until application for a certificate of appropriateness has been submitted to the commission and approved. Such application shall be accompanied by such drawings, photographs, or plans as may be required by the commission. 
(B)  Exemptions. The state department of transportation and contractors (including cities and counties) performing work funded by the state department of transportation are exempt from the provisions of subsection (C) below and local governments are exempt from the requirement of obtaining certificates of appropriateness; however, the mayor and council shall notify the commission forty-five (45) days prior to beginning an undertaking that would otherwise require a certificate of appropriateness and allow the commission an opportunity to comment. 
(C)  Application review procedure. Applications for certificates of appropriateness shall be reviewed in the following manner: 
(1)  Development standards. The commission shall establish development standards regulating buildings and structures in the historic district. A structure or building shall only be established, constructed, reconstructed, altered, demolished, moved or maintained in a manner consistent with the historical and architectural character of the district. 
(2)  Exemption from hearing. The administrator may approve certificates of appropriateness which are in conformance with performance criteria established by the commission. The administrator may require a hearing before the commission at his/her discretion. 
(3)  Appeal to commission. Any applicant whose certificate of appropriateness has been denied by the administrator may appeal the decision to the commission. 
(4)  Review criteria. The commission shall approve a certificate of appropriateness if it finds that the proposed material change in appearance is in accordance with any published guidelines; would not have a substantial adverse effect on the aesthetic, historical, or architectural significance and value of the historic property of the historic district. In making this determination, the commission shall consider, in addition to any other pertinent factors, the historical and architectural value and significance, architectural style, general design, arrangement, texture and material of the architectural features involved and the relationship thereof to the exterior architectural style and pertinent features of other structures in the immediate neighborhood. The commission shall not consider interior arrangement or use having no effect on exterior architectural features. 
(5)  Commission recommendation. The commission shall approve or reject an application for a certificate of appropriateness within no more than thirty (30) days after the filing thereof by the owner or occupant of a historic property or of a structure, site, or work of art located within a historic district. Evidence of a recommendation for approval shall be by issuance of the certificate of appropriateness. Failure of the commission to act within said thirty (30) days shall constitute approval. In the event the commission rejects an application, it shall state its reasons for doing so and shall transmit a record of such notice and reasons therefore in writing, to the applicant. The commission may suggest alternative courses of action it thinks proper if it disapproves of the application submitted. The applicant, if he or she so desires, may make modifications to the plans and may resubmit the application at any time after doing so. 
(6)  Binding nature of decision. In cases where the application covers a material change in the appearance of a structure which would require the issuance of a building permit, the rejection of an application for a certificate of appropriateness shall be binding upon the building inspector and, in such a case, no building permit shall be issued. Where, by reasons of natural circumstances, the strict application of any provision of this section would result in exceptional practical difficulty or undue hardship upon any owner of any specific property, the commission in passing upon applications shall have power to vary or modify strict adherence to said provision or to interpret the meaning of said provision so as to relieve such difficulty or hardship; provided such variance modification, or interpretation shall remain in harmony with the general purpose and intent of said provisions so that the architectural or historical integrity or character of the property shall be conserved and substantial justice done. In granting variations, the commission may impose such reasonable and additional stipulations and conditions as will, in its judgment, best fulfill the intent of the historic district. 
(7)  Appeal to city council. Any person adversely affected by any determination made by the commission relative to the issuance or denial of a certificate of appropriateness may appeal such determination of the mayor and council by filing a notice of appeal with the council. 
(8)  Public notice. An appeal to the mayor and council of a commission decision on a certificate of appropriateness shall require a public notice of said appeal. The administrator shall cause to have posted in a conspicuous place on the property one or more signs with orange background and black lettering; each sign shall contain information as to the appeal and the date and time of the public hearing. 
(D)  Affirmation of existing building and zoning codes. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed as to exempt property owners from complying with existing city building and zoning codes, nor prevent any property owner from making any use of his property not prohibited by other statutes, ordinances or regulations. 
(E)  Demolition or relocation of historic buildings. The commission shall have the authority to grant or deny certificates of appropriateness for demolition or relocation. 
(1)  Public hearing. A public hearing may be scheduled for each application for a certificate of appropriateness for demolition or relocation. 
(2)  Consideration of post-demolition or post-relocation plans. The commission shall not grant certificates of appropriateness for demolition or relocation without reviewing at the same time the post-demolition or post-relocation plans for the site. 
(3)  Demolition/relocation criteria. Upon receipt of an application for a certificate of appropriateness for demolition or relocation, the commission shall use the criteria described in this chapter to determine whether to deny the application or issue a certificate of appropriateness for demolition or relocation. 
(4)  The commission shall approve the application and issue a certificate of appropriateness if it finds that the proposed material change(s) in the appearance would not have a substantial adverse effect on the aesthetic, historic, or architectural significance and value of the historic property of the historic district. In making this determination, the commission shall consider, in addition to any other pertinent factors, the historical and architectural value and significance, architectural style, general design arrangement, texture and material of the architectural features involved, and the relationship thereof to the exterior architectural style, and pertinent features of the other structures in the immediate neighborhood. 
(F)  New structures. All new structures erected within a designated historic district shall be compatible in appearance, as seen by the traveling public, with existing structures located within one hundred (100) feet, on the same street, of the new structure. New structures shall not be required to be compatible with structures located outside of a designated historic district. The new structure shall be deemed compatible if the following features of the new structure are consistent with structures within one hundred (100) feet: 
(1)  Finished floor elevation. 
(2)  Roof heights. 
(3)  Roof shapes. 
(4)  Windows. 
(5)  Architectural features.

The administrator shall retain one copy of the zoning compliance permit and one copy of the sketch or plan for his records. 
(D)  If the sketch or plan submitted describes work which does not conform to the requirements of this chapter the administrator shall not issue a zoning compliance permit, but shall return one copy of the sketch or plan to the applicant along with a signed refusal in writing. Such refusal shall state the reasons for refusal and shall cite the portions of this chapter with which the submitted sketch plan does not comply. The administrator shall retain one copy of the sketch plan and two (2) copies of the refusal. 
(E)  Any zoning compliance permit shall automatically expire six (6) months from the date of issuance if the person, firm, or corporation to which the certificate or permit was issued has not clearly demonstrated that the permit is being exercised for the purpose for which it was issued, or if the work so authorized is suspended or discontinued for a period of one year. 
    2-3.10. Certificate of occupancy. A certificate of occupancy shall be required in advance of occupancy or use of a building hereafter erected; a building hereafter altered so as to affect height, or side, front or rear yards; and or a change of type of occupancy or use of any building on premises.

(C)  Procedure for denial and revocation. The city shall deny permits to applicants that submit applications for signs that do not comply with the provisions of this chapter, are incomplete applications, or applications containing any false material statements. Violation of any provision of this chapter will be grounds for terminating a permit granted by the city for the erection of a sign.

If later an individual desires to erect a sign at the same location, a new application must be processed and another fee paid in accordance with the fee schedule applicable at such time. 
(G)  Fees. The cost of a permit shall be in an amount as determined by mayor and council. 
    2-3.11. Subdivisions. The commission shall be the official platting authority. 
(A)  Pre-application review. Whenever the subdivision of a tract of land within the jurisdiction of the commission is proposed, the subdivider should consult early and informally with the administrator for advice and assistance. The subdivider may submit sketch plans and data showing existing conditions within the site and in its vicinity and the proposed layout and development of the subdivision. The administrator shall return within fifteen (15) days the submitted sketch to the subdivider and shall inform the subdivider where the plans do not comply with the regulations set forth in the ordinance. No fee shall be charged for the pre-application review and no formal application shall be required. 
(B)  Modification of subdivision requirements. Modifications of the provisions set forth in the subdivision regulations may be authorized by the commission in specific cases when, in its opinion, undue hardship may result from strict compliance; provided only such determination shall be based fundamentally on the fact that unusual topographical and other exceptional conditions require such modifications will not adversely affect the general public or nullify the intent of these regulations; provided further that any such modifications granted by the commission shall be made in writing to the subdivider and also made a part of the commission's records and the plat. Application for any modifications must be filed in writing with necessary supporting documents with the reasons and facts supporting the application. 
2-3.11.1. Minor subdivisions. Notwithstanding the provisions stated elsewhere in this chapter the administrator is hereby delegated the authority to give preliminary and final approval in the name and on behalf of the commission to applications for approval of a subdivision not exceeding five (5) lots in size provided no new street is involved; the required certifications have been approved by the appropriate agent; no variances are involved; and all the requirements set forth in this chapter are met. Final approval may be given by the administrator on a plat that was preliminarily approved by the commission. 
2-3.11.2. Preliminary plats. Prior to the cutting or grading of any street or the making of any street improvements or the installation of utilities, the subdivider shall submit to the commission a preliminary plat of the proposed subdivision in accordance with the following. 
(A)  Application for preliminary plat approval. Applications for preliminary plat shall be submitted to the administrator pursuant to established application submittal schedules included in the administrative manual. 
(B)  Review of preliminary plat. The administrator shall check the plat for conformance to the rules and regulations of this chapter and report his findings and recommendations to the commission, which shall afford a hearing on the preliminary plat. 
(C)  Preliminary approval. Following the hearing of the preliminary plat and other related material the commission may express preliminary approval noting the conditions of such approval on three (3) copies of the preliminary plat with one copy being returned to the subdivider, one copy to the administrator for the council and one copy to be added to the records of the commission. Approval of a preliminary plat does not constitute approval of a final plat. It indicates only approval of the layout as a guide to the preparation of the final plat. 
(D)  Automatic approval. Failure of the commission to act on the preliminary plat within thirty (30) days after submission thereof, without due cause, shall be deemed to be approval of the plat and a certificate of preliminary approval shall be issued by the commission on demand, provided, however, that the subdivider may waive this requirement and consent to an extension of time. 
(E)  Disapproval. Following the hearing of the preliminary plat and other related material, the commission may find reasons detrimental to the public safety, health, and general welfare, or in conflict with adopted plans of the commission which required the disapproval of the preliminary plat. A statement of the reasons for disapproval shall be made on two (2) copies of the preliminary plat with one copy being added to the records of the commission. The applicant may reapply for preliminary plat approval in accordance with subsection 2-3.11(A) herein. 
(F)  Expiration time. Preliminary approval shall expire and be of no further effect twelve (12) months from the date of the preliminary approval unless final plat approval has been given on at least one lot of the development. 
2-3.11.3. Conservation subdivisions. 
(A)  Procedures. The procedures and submission requirements for approval of a conservation subdivision shall be the same as those for a standard subdivision as specified in this subsection 2-3.11, except as specified below. 
(1)  Prior to submission of an application for preliminary plat approval, the applicant shall request written consent to prepare a subdivision plat using the conservation subdivision option from the commission at a regular or special meeting. Such request must be submitted to the administrator at least ten (10) days prior to a regularly scheduled commission meeting. The commission shall act on the request on or before the second regularly scheduled meeting following the date of submission, unless the request includes a conceptual plan review as specified in section 5-7. When conceptual plan review is requested or required, the commission shall act on the letter of consent request within forty-five (45) days of the meeting at which the commission receives the request. 
(2)  The commission's letter of consent shall, at a minimum, reiterate the objectives of the conservation subdivision development option and refer the applicant to the specific standards for conservation subdivision development. A letter of consent shall not constitute nor imply commission approval of the development plan. 
(B)  Application requirements. Concurrent with the submission of a site concept plan, applicant shall prepare and submit a site analysis map. The purpose of the site analysis map is to ensure that the important site features have been adequately identified prior to the creation of the site design, and that the proposed conservation space will meet the requirements of this article. The preliminary site plan shall include the following features: 
(1)  Property boundaries; 
(2)  All streams, rivers, lakes, wetlands and other hydrologic features; 
(3)  Topographic contours of no less than ten-foot intervals; 
(4)  All primary and secondary conservation areas labeled by type, as described in section 5-7;

The disapproval shall be placed on two (2) copies of the final plat with one copy being returned to the subdivider and one copy being added to the public record. No certificate of approval shall be given. The final plat may be resubmitted as a new application for final plat approval after the corrections noted are made. 
(E)  Automatic approval. Failure of the administrator to act on the final plat within thirty (30) days after submission of a complete application thereof shall be deemed to be approval of the plat and a certificate of final approval shall be issued by the administrator on demand, provided, however, that the subdivider may waive this requirement and consent to an extension of time. 
(F)  Recording of final plat. Upon the approval of a final plat, the owner or his agent, shall have the final plat recorded in the office of the clerk of the superior court prior to the sale of any lot in the subdivision.

(g)  The use of a motor vehicle, trailer, or shipping container in which, out of which, or from which any goods are sold, stored, services performed, or other business conducted except pursuant to subsection 4.5.3(F). 
(E)  Additional regulations. Regardless of whether a use category is permitted by right or permitted as a conditional use or special exception, there may be additional regulations that are applicable to a specific use. The existence of these use-specific regulations is noted through a section reference in the last column of the table entitled "additional regulations." References refer to section 4.3, use-specific standards. These regulations apply to all districts unless otherwise specified. 
(F)  Uses not listed. The administrator shall determine whether or not an unlisted use is part of an existing use category defined in section 4.2, use classifications, or is substantially similar to an already defined use, using the criteria in subsection 4.2.1(D)(2).

(Ord. No. 2017-25, § 2, 12-19-17; Ord. No. 2018-08, §§ 3, 4, 6-19-18; Ord. No. 2018-17, § 2(Exh. A), 8-21-18) 
Sec. 4-2. - Use classifications. 
    4-2.1. General. 
(A)  Purpose. Use classifications organize land uses and activities into general "use categories" and specific "use types" based on common functional, product, or physical characteristics, such as the type and amount of activity, the type of customers or residents, how goods or services are sold or delivered, and site conditions. The use classifications provide a systematic basis for assigning present and future land uses into appropriate districts. Use classifications describe one or more uses having similar characteristics, but do not list every use or activity that may appropriately be within the classification. 
(B)  Structure of this section. 
(1)  Principal use characteristics and accessory uses. The "characteristics" subsection describes common characteristics of each use category. Principal uses are assigned to the category that most closely describes the nature of the principal use. Also listed are examples of common accessory uses, which, unless otherwise stated in this chapter, are allowed in conjunction with a principal use and are subject to the same regulations as the principal use. 
(2)  Examples. The "examples" subsection lists common examples of uses included in the respective use category. The names of these sample uses are generic. They are based on common meanings and not on what a specific use may call itself. For example, a use that calls itself "wholesale sales," but sells mostly to consumers, is included in the retail sales and service category rather than the wholesale sales category. This is because the activity on the site matches the characteristics of the retail sales and service category. 
(C)  Developments with multiple principal uses. When all principal uses of a development fall within one use category, the entire development is assigned to that use category. A development that contains a coffee shop, bookstore, and bakery, for example, would be classified in the retail sales and service category because all of the development's principal uses are in that category. When the principal uses of a development fall within different use categories, each principal use is classified in the applicable category and each use is subject to applicable regulations within that category. Developments with multiple principal uses, such as shopping centers, shall incorporate only those uses allowed in the underlying district. 
(D)  Unlisted uses. 
(1)  Procedure for approving unlisted uses. Where a particular use category or use type is not specifically listed in Table 4-1-1, the administrator may permit the use category or type upon a finding that the criteria of subsection 4-2.1(D)(2) are met. The administrator shall give due consideration to the intent of this chapter concerning the districts involved, the character of the uses specifically identified, and the character of the use in question. 
(2)  Criteria for approving unlisted uses. In order to determine that the proposed use has an impact that is similar in nature, function, and duration to the other uses allowed in a specific district, the administrator shall assess all relevant characteristics of the proposed use, including, but not limited to, the following: 
(a)  The volume and type of sales, retail, wholesale; size and type of items sold and nature of inventory on the premises; 
(b)  Any processing done on the premises, including assembly, manufacturing, warehousing, shipping, distribution; 
(c)  The nature and location of storage and outdoor display of merchandise; enclosed, open, inside or outside the principal building; and predominant types of items stored (such as business vehicles, works-in-process, inventory, and merchandise, construction materials, scrap and junk, and raw materials including liquids and powders); 
(d)  The type, size and nature of buildings and structures; 
(e)  The number and density of employees and customers per unit area of site in relation to business hours and employment shifts; 
(f)  Transportation requirements, including the modal split for people and freight, by volume type and characteristic of traffic generation to and from the site, trip purposes and whether trip purposes can be shared by other uses on the site; 
(g)  Parking requirements, turnover and generation, ratio of the number of spaces required per unit area or activity, and the potential for shared parking with other uses; 
(h)  The amount and nature of any nuisances generated on the premises, including, but not limited to, noise, smoke, odor, glare, vibration, radiation and fumes; 
(i)  Any special public utility requirements for serving the proposed use, including, but not limited to, water supply, wastewater output, pre-treatment of wastes and emissions required or recommended, and any significant power structures and communications towers or facilities; and 
(j)  The impact on adjacent properties created by the proposed use will not be greater than that of other uses in the district. 
(3)  Prohibited uses. Notwithstanding subsection 4-2.1(D)(2), all uses that are not listed in Table 4-1-1, table of uses, even given the liberal interpretation of subsection 4-2.1(D)(2), are prohibited. 
(4)  Effects of finding by the administrator. 
(a)  Typical uses: Added to this chapter. In making the determination described in subsection 4-2.1(D)(1), the administrator shall initiate an amendment to this chapter if he finds that the particular use category or use type is likely to be common or to recur frequently, or that omission of specific inclusion and reference to this chapter is likely to lead to public uncertainty and confusion. Until final action has been taken on such a proposed amendment, the determination of the administrator shall be binding on all officers and departments of the city. 
(b)  Atypical uses: Determination binding. In making a determination whether to approve an unlisted use, the administrator's determination shall thereafter be binding on all officers and departments of the city without further action or amendment of this chapter provided the administrator finds the particular use or class of uses is of an unusual or transitory nature, or is unlikely to recur frequently. 
    4-2.2. Residential use categories. 
(A)  Household living. 
(1)  Characteristics. Household living is characterized by the residential occupancy of a dwelling unit by a family. Tenancy is arranged on a month-to-month or longer basis. Accessory uses commonly associated with household living are garages, storage buildings, carports, swimming pools, basketball goals, etc. Home occupations are accessory uses that are subject to additional regulations (see subsections 4-4.3(C) and (D)). 
(2)  Examples. Examples include occupancy of single-family dwellings, duplexes, and multiple dwelling structures, retirement center apartments, family personal care homes, manufactured homes, and other structures with self-contained dwelling units. 
(3)  Exceptions. Lodging in a dwelling unit or where units are rented on a less than monthly basis is classified in the visitor accommodations category. 
(B)  Group living. 
(1)  Characteristics. Group living is characterized by the residential occupancy of a structure by a group of people who do not meet the definition of "household." The size of the group may be larger than the average size of a household. Tenancy is arranged on a monthly or longer basis. Generally, group living structures have a common eating area for residents. The residents may receive care, training, or treatment, as long as the caregivers also reside at the site. Common accessory uses include garages, storage buildings, etc. 
(2)  Examples. Examples include dormitories, fraternities and sororities, monasteries and convents, group personal care homes, and boardinghouses. 
(3)  Exceptions. 
(a)  Lodging where tenancy may be arranged for periods of less than thirty (30) days is classified as visitor accommodations. 
(b)  Lodging where the residents meet the definition of "household" and where tenancy is arranged on a month-to-month basis or for a longer period is classified as household living. 
(c)  Most group home facilities are classified as institutions. However, group home facilities where individual units meet the definition of a "dwelling unit" in section 19-1.11, definitions, are classified as household living. 
    4-2.3. Public and institutional use categories. 
(A)  Community service. 
(1)  Characteristics. The community services category includes uses of a public, nonprofit, or charitable nature providing a local service to people of the community. Generally, they provide the service on-site or have employees at the site on a regular basis. The service is ongoing, not just for special events. Community centers or facilities that have membership provisions are open to the general public to join at any time (for instance, any senior citizen could join a senior center). The use may provide special counseling, education, or training of a public, nonprofit, or charitable nature. 
(2)  Examples. Examples include libraries, museums, senior centers, community centers, youth club facilities, and social service facilities. 
(3)  Exceptions. 
(a)  Civic clubs and private or commercial health clubs are classified as retail sales and service. 
(b)  Parks are classified as parks and open space. 
(c)  Uses where tenancy is arranged on a month-to-month basis or for a longer period are residential and are classified as household or group living. 
(B)  Day care. 
(1)  Characteristics. Day care uses provide care, protection, and supervision for more than six (6) children or adults on a regular basis away from their primary residence for less than twenty-four (24) hours per day. 
(2)  Examples. Examples include child learning centers (nineteen (19) or more people); group day care homes (seven (7) to eighteen (18) people); and preschools. 
(3)  Exceptions. Day care does not include public or private schools or facilities operated in connection with an employment use, shopping center, or other principal use where children are cared for while parents or guardians are occupied on the premises or in the immediate vicinity. In-home care for six (6) or fewer individuals is considered a home occupation (accessory use) and subject to the standards of subsection 4-4.3(C). 
(C)  Educational facilities. 
(1)  Characteristics. This category includes public and private schools at the primary, elementary, middle, junior high, or high school level that provide state-mandated basic education. This category also includes colleges and other institutions of higher learning that offer courses of general or specialized study leading to a degree. Colleges tend to be in campus-like settings or on multiple blocks. This category also includes business or trade schools. Accessory uses at schools include play areas, cafeterias, recreational and sport facilities, auditoriums, and before-school or after-school day care. 
(2)  Examples. Examples include public and private daytime schools, boarding schools, military academies, universities, colleges, community colleges, nursing and medical schools not accessory to a hospital, seminaries, and business or trade schools. 
(3)  Exceptions. Preschools are classified as day care uses. 
(D)  Government facilities. 
(1)  Characteristics. Government facilities include emergency response facilities (police, fire, and medical); detention centers; maintenance, storage, and distribution facilities; and other facilities for the operation of local, state, or federal government. 
(2)  Examples. Examples include emergency response facilities (police, fire, and medical); maintenance facilities, detention centers; and post offices. 
(3)  Exceptions. 
(a)  Offices and courthouses are classified as offices. 
(b)  Passenger terminals for airports and surface transportation are classified as transportation terminals. 
(c)  City, county, or state parks are classified as parks and open space. 
(d)  Water, wastewater, gas, electric, and other infrastructure services, whether public or private, are classified as utilities. 
(e)  Waste and recycling services are classified as waste-related services. 
(E)  Health care facilities. 
(1)  Characteristics. Health care facilities include uses providing medical or surgical care to patients. Hospitals offer overnight care, while other medical facilities provide outpatient care only. 
(2)  Examples. Examples include hospitals; medical centers; emergency medical care establishments; medical and dental clinics; and medical and dental labs. 
(3)  Exceptions. Uses that provide exclusive care and planned treatment or training for psychiatric, alcohol, or drug problems, where patients are residents of the program, are classified as institutions. 
(F)  Institutions. 
(1)  Characteristics. Institutions provide a variety of facilities, including buildings that primarily provide meeting areas for religious activities; housing and care for the elderly or disabled; and housing related to treatment programs, including post-treatment recovery programs. Accessory uses include school facilities, food preparation, meeting rooms, parking, and staff residences. 
(2)  Examples. Examples include churches, temples, synagogues, and mosques; nursing, convalescent, and assisted living homes; hospices; rehabilitation centers; congregate personal care homes; some residential programs for drug and alcohol treatment; and alternative or post-incarceration facilities (halfway houses). 
(3)  Exceptions. Group home facilities or residential programs where individual units meet the definition of a dwelling unit are classified as household living. 
(G)  Parks and open areas. 
(1)  Characteristics. Parks and open areas are uses of land focusing on natural areas consisting mostly of vegetative landscaping or outdoor recreation, community gardens, or public squares. Lands tend to have few structures. Accessory uses may include club houses, maintenance facilities, concessions, and parking. 
(2)  Examples. Examples include parks; accesses to public water bodies; golf courses; public squares and plazas; recreational trails; greenways; botanical gardens and nature preserves; and cemeteries, columbaria, and mausoleums. 
(H)  Transportation terminals. 
(1)  Characteristics. This category includes facilities for the landing and takeoff of airplanes and helicopters, including loading and unloading areas. Aviation facilities may be improved or unimproved. This category also includes passenger terminals for bus or train service. 
(2)  Examples. Examples include airports, helicopter landing facilities, bus passenger terminals, and train depots. 
(3)  Exceptions. 
(a)  Bus passenger stations for local service such as mass transit stops and park-and-ride facilities are classified as utilities. 
(b)  Private helicopter landing facilities that are accessory to another use may be considered accessory uses subject to all the regulations and approval criteria for helicopter landing facilities. 
(I)  Utilities. 
(1)  Characteristics. This category includes both major utilities, which are infrastructure services providing regional or community-wide service, and minor utilities, which are infrastructure services that need to be located in or near the neighborhood where the service is provided. Communication towers also are a type of utility. Services may be publicly or privately provided. 
(2)  Examples. 
(a)  Examples of major utilities include water towers, water and wastewater treatment plants, public transit park and ride facilities, and electrical substations.

Eight (8) feet plus two (2) additional feet for each story (floor) above two (2) stories, but not exceeding twenty (20) feet; and when dwelling unit faces side yard, the dwelling unit shall not be less than twenty (20) feet from the side lot line. b. None, except when abutting residential district and then not less than twenty-five (25) feet. *See Appendix A for requirements in Form Based Code districts.  
(A)  Front and side yard setbacks for dwellings. The setback requirements of this chapter for side yards on corner lots and/or front yards shall not apply to any lot where the average setback on developed lots located, wholly or in part, one hundred (100) feet on each side of such lot and within the same block and zoning district and fronting on the same streets as such lot, is less than the minimum required setback. In such cases, the setback on such lot may be less than the required setback but not less than the average of the existing setbacks on the existing developed lots. 
(B)  Zero (0) side yard setbacks. Upon review and approval by the commission, the side yard setback requirement for single-family dwelling lots may be reduced to allow a zero (0) side yard setback on one side of a lot providing the following conditions are met. 
(1)  Any reduction in one yard requirement shall result in a corresponding increase in the side yard requirement for the opposite side yard. In this manner the overall side yard requirement of the district shall be met. 
(2)  Front yard, rear yard and corner side yard requirements of the district shall not be modified. 
(3)  Side yard setback requirements shall not be modified for an individual lot unless it is part of a block in which each lot's side yard setback is to be modified. The arrangement of modified side yard requirements shall allow for an open yard area between each dwelling unit. 
(4)  The developer of a subdivision for which modifications to the side yard setback requirements are requested shall furnish to the commission a copy of proposed deed restrictions, conditions, or covenants. Such covenants shall include at a minimum, provisions for: 
(a)  A maintenance easement which will allow for the maintenance of exterior dwelling walls facing a zero (0) setback line. 
(b)  A requirement that dwelling walls facing a zero (0) setback be windowless. 
(5)  The developer of a subdivision for which modifications to the side yard setback requirements are requested shall be fully responsible for constructing the development in compliance with the approved final plat. Therefore, the applicant shall place a disclaimer in black ink on each page of the final plat which boldly states: 
"The City of Perry assumes no responsibility or liability for any changes to this final plat made during construction or any material defects in construction of the development resulting from noncompliance with the requirements of this final plat that were not expressly authorized by the Perry Planning Commission." 
No final plat for a development utilizing the zero (0) side yard setback option that does not contain the aforementioned disclaimer shall be approved by the planning commission. 
(6)  If, during construction of an approved development for which modifications to the side yard setback requirements were approved, the need for changes to the final plat arise, the applicant shall petition the administrator in writing for approval of said changes prior to construction in accordance with the amendment of an approved final plat. The petition shall contain a clear written description of the requested change, a revised final plat illustrating the requested change, an assessment of all properties that would be affected by the requested change (including properties within the development and adjacent to the development), and a rational outlining the specific need for the requested change. The administrator may approve or disapprove changes that will not affect overall development densities or result in a significant change to the overall development concept. All other requested changes shall be referred by the administrator to the planning commission for approval or disapproval. If the requested changes will affect any property abutting the development, the planning commission may require a public hearing on the proposed change. The planning commission may further require that the developer submit a copy of the written petition for final plat amendment (absent a copy of the revised final plat) via certified mail, return receipt requested to the owners of each affected abutting property at least fifteen (15) days prior to the scheduled public hearing. 
(7)  The developer of a subdivision for which modifications to the side yard setback requirements are requested shall prepare an "as-built" plat for approval by the planning commission after construction improvements have been completed and prior to recording of the final plat. The "as-built" plat shall indicate the true location of all construction improvements, property lines, and maintenance easements as determined by a transit survey of the development as constructed. If the planning commission determines that any changes to the final plat have been made during construction without planning commission approval as specified in subsection 5-2(B)(6), the developer may be required to repair any such unauthorized changes prior to recording of the final plat. 
    5-2.2. Minimum distance between buildings. The following minimum distances between buildings shall be required unless otherwise specified within this chapter. The minimum distance between main building located on the same lot or parcel shall be: 
(A)  Front to rear arrangement-Fifty (50) feet. 
(B)  Front to front arrangement-Forty (40) feet. 
(C)  Rear to rear arrangement-Thirty (30) feet. 
(D)  Side to side arrangement-Twenty (20) feet. 
(E)  All other combinations-Twenty (20) feet.

(B)  Schedule B. Uses that reference "Schedule B" have widely varying parking and loading demand characteristics, making it impossible to specify a single off-street parking or loading standard. Upon receiving a development application for a use subject to Schedule B standards, the administrator shall apply the off-street parking and loading standard specified for the listed use that is deemed most similar to the proposed use or establish minimum off-street parking requirements on the basis of a parking and loading study prepared by the applicant. Such a study shall include estimates of parking demand based on recommendations of the Institute of Transportation Engineers (ITE), or other acceptable estimates as approved by the administrator, and should include other reliable data collected from uses or combinations of uses that are the same as or comparable with the proposed use. Comparability will be determined by density, scale, bulk, area, type of activity, and location. The study shall document the source of data used to develop the recommendations. 
(C)  Off-street bicycle parking requirements. The minimum number of parking spaces for bicycles shall be equal to one percent of the total number of off-street parking spaces provided. A minimum of two (2) bicycle parking spaces shall be provided for all sites. 
    6-1.4. Off-street loading requirements. Unless otherwise approved by the administrator, every building or structure erected and used for business, trade, or industry shall provide space as indicated in this section for the loading and unloading of vehicles, with access to a public street or alley. The spaces shall be arranged so that no vehicle will be required to back onto a public street or way and so that vehicles may maneuver for loading and unloading entirely within the property lines of the premises. Off-street loading spaces shall be provided in the following numbers: 
(A)  Commercial uses. Each use shall provide one loading space, measuring ten (10) feet by twenty-five (25) feet with overhead clearance of fourteen (14) feet, for each twenty thousand (20,000) square feet of gross floor area or fraction thereof. 
(B)  Service and industrial uses. Each use shall provide loading spaces that measure ten (10) feet by fifty (50) feet with overhead clearance of fourteen (14) feet, based on the gross floor area as shown below:

Alternative materials shall only be considered if such material exhibits equivalent load bearing and wear characteristics as concrete or asphalt concrete. All surfaces shall be maintained in sound condition free of pot holes, weeds, dust, trash, and debris. 
(B)  Low impact development (LID) techniques required. All parking areas, for uses other than single-family detached and two-family dwellings, which exceed the number of parking spaces required by the minimum spaces required column and equal to or less than the maximum spaces allowed column as listed in Table 6-1-1 shall incorporate low impact development (LID) techniques for the area in which there are excess spaces. Each LID technique shall be approved by the administrator. Examples include but are not limited to bioretention areas and vegetative filter strips. The LID technique shall be sized to treat the first 0.5 (1/2) inches of runoff from the excess spaces and will be in addition to the stormwater requirements set forth in article 7, stormwater management. 
(C)  Reserved. 
(D)  Overflow parking. All parking areas above the maximum number of spaces required in Table 6-1-1 are considered as overflow parking and shall be turf or an approved pervious paving system. Turf may be used for parking areas and vehicular driving surfaces only for parking areas which are designed to be used no more than ten (10) times per year or for storage lots which generate less than thirty (30) average daily trips. 
(E)  Paving exemption for assembly uses. The administrator may waive the paving requirement for up to fifty (50) percent of the required parking spaces and vehicular driving surfaces for assembly uses (religious institutions, sports facilities, and the like). The waiver may be granted only if evidence is presented to the administrator that these parking spaces and vehicular driving surfaces will be used less than five (5) times per week and are not required for access by emergency vehicles. Parking areas for which paving is waived shall maintain a turf surface and be constructed with proper drainage. 
(F)  Markings. All paved parking spaces shall be identified by surface markings and shall be maintained in a manner so as to be readily visible at all times. Such markings shall be arranged to provide for orderly and safe loading, unloading, parking, and storage of vehicles. Parallel parking spaces shall be marked with standard "cross" and "T" pavement markings as reflected in the design and specification manual. All striping shall be marked with four-inch lines. As appropriate, time and use restrictions may apply and signs shall be posted displaying the required information. 
(G)  Backing movements prohibited. All off-street parking spaces and driveways, with the exception of parking areas for one-family detached and two-family dwellings, shall be arranged to require ingress and egress from the lot to a public street by forward motion of the vehicle. For single-family and two-family residences only, driveways may be used to satisfy minimum off-street parking requirements, provided that sufficient space is available to satisfy the minimum design standards. 
(H)  Dimensions of parking stalls and driveways. All required parking spaces shall be designed to comply with the following minimum standards: 
Table 6-1-3: Standards for Parking Stalls

(I)  Overhang protection. Wheel or bumper guards, curbing, or other methods approved by the administrator shall be provided, located and arranged so that no part of any parked vehicle will extend beyond the boundaries of the parking space and into a pedestrian area, landscape area or beyond the property line of the site. 
(J)  Stacked parking. Generally, no parking spaces shall be located so as to require the moving of any vehicle on the premises in order to enter or leave any other space. However, the administrator may, on a case-by-case basis, allow stacking spaces provided for auto-related uses to count toward the minimum required parking as long as such spaces are not part of areas required for site ingress or egress or areas intended for fueling. For example, stacking spaces may be permitted if the parking is dedicated to one use only. 
(K)  Bicycle parking. Bicycle parking areas shall be located for the convenient access to site amenities and primary building entrances. Bicycle parking areas shall be located on a hardscape surface, physically separated from automobile parking lots. They shall be designed to provide adequate space for ingress and egress, and not impede pedestrian and vehicle circulation. Bicycle racks shall be designed to support a bicycle frame in two (2) places in a stable, upright position. Bicycle racks shall be securely anchored to the lot surface. Bicycle parking areas and bicycle racks shall be designed and installed as specified in the design and specifications manual. 
(L)  Parking in historic districts. In designated historic overlay districts, parking located in the front yard, including the front yard on corner lots, shall not be permitted on turf or other landscaped areas. All parking in the front yard shall meet the requirements of subsection (A) above.

    6-3.3. Street trees. Street trees shall be provided and maintained within, or adjacent to, all existing and proposed public street rights-of-way in accordance with the following requirements: 
(A)  Street trees shall include only those trees listed in the approved list of tree species unless use of an alternative species is approved by the administrator. 
(B)  Street trees shall be located in an area no further than ten (10) feet from the existing or proposed street right-of-way line. 
(C)  Street trees shall be planted at a spacing of forty (40) feet on-center for shade trees or twenty (20) feet on-center for ornamental and understory trees along the entire length of the street frontage of the proposed development or as approved by the administrator based on the development plans. Ornamental and understory trees shall be used as street trees only when there is an overhead obstacle which would preclude the use of taller-growing shade trees. A list of acceptable street trees is available in the administrative manual. 
(D)  Preserved existing trees of a three-inch DBH or greater may be used to satisfy the street tree requirement. Preserved existing trees shall meet all the requirements outlined in section 6-4, tree protection, be of an acceptable species as listed in the administrative manual, and be alive and healthy at the time of final inspection. 
(E)  Trees used to comply with street tree requirements shall not count toward the minimum number of trees required to meet interior parking lot landscaping. 
    6-3.4. Interior parking lot landscaping. 
(A)  In addition to all other landscape requirements, all parking lots subject to this section 6-2 shall provide and maintain landscaped planting areas within the interior of the parking lot. These standards shall not apply to multi-level parking structures. Each planting area shall consist of at least one hundred eighty (180) square feet, or as approved by the administrator. 
(B)  In cases where the area required for the construction of the minimum parking spaces as required by section 6-1, off-street parking requirements, would cause the removal of a historic or heritage tree, the administrator may modify the landscaping requirements and/or the parking requirements in order to preserve the affected historic or heritage tree. 
(C)  Planting areas shall be designed within parking areas as: 
(1)  Islands located at the end of parking bays; 
(2)  Islands located between parallel rows of cars, used to visually separate parking areas into pods; 
(3)  Driveway medians, which shall have a minimum width of six (6) feet; 
(4)  Other options may be approved by the administrator. 
(D)  Each parking lot shall include one shade tree and eight (8) shrubs for every two thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet, or portion thereof, of the total parking lot area, including drives and service areas. 
(E)  Not more than ten (10) continuous parking spaces shall be allowed in a row of parking without separation by a one hundred eighty (180) square-foot median containing at least one shade tree. 
(F)  Shade trees are not to be located closer than twenty-five (25) feet apart measured from trunk to trunk. 
(G)  Proposed shade trees being used to meet the interior parking lot landscaping requirements shall be located no further than ten (10) feet and no closer than four (4) feet from the edge of pavement. 
(H)  Existing shade trees may be used to meet the interior parking lot landscaping requirements at the discretion of the administrator if the trees meet the intent of the interior parking lot landscaping requirements and the tree protection requirements. 
(I)  Trees used to comply with interior parking lot requirements shall not count toward the number of trees required to meet the street tree requirements. 
(J)  No more than twenty-five (25) percent of required shrubs may be deciduous. 
Figure 6-3-1: Illustration of Interior Parking Lot Landscaping 

    6-3.5. Perimeter buffering and screening requirements. 
(A)  Purpose. Perimeter buffer yards and screening are required in order to reduce the impact of a use of land on adjacent uses that are of a significantly different character, density, or intensity, and to reduce the visual impact of service facilities. A buffer yard shall not include underground utilities and stormwater facilities. Perimeter buffer yards and screening shall be required in addition to any other landscaping requirement listed in this section. 
(B)  Applicability. Perimeter buffer yards and screening shall be installed and maintained by the developer of: 
(1)  A nonresidential development adjoining a residential zoning district; 
(2)  A multi-family residential development adjoining lots used as or zoned for single-family detached dwellings. 
(C)  Permitted screening materials. The following items are permitted for use as screening materials. Alternative screening materials that are not listed may be used if approved by the administrator. 
(1)  Evergreen buffer vegetation that is listed on the acceptable evergreen screen/buffer shrub species list, in the administrative manual, and meet the minimum planting height and spacing requirements of Table 6-3-2. 
(2)  An earth berm may be used to achieve a portion of the minimum required six-foot height. Berms shall be covered with grass or mulch and shall be planted with other landscaping materials designed to meet the requirements of subsections 6-3.2(A) and (B). The slope of the berm shall not exceed the ratio of 3:1. 
(3)  A solid fence measuring at least six (6) feet in height, but not more than eight (8) feet in height. If wood is used, only treated or rot resistant wood is acceptable. Chainlink, barbed wire, stock wire, chicken wire, and similar type fences are not permitted. 
(4)  Masonry walls measuring at least six (6) feet in height, but not more than eight (8) feet in height. Walls shall be finished with brick, stone, textured concrete masonry units, or stucco. Natural and painted concrete block walls are not permitted. 
(D)  Screening standard. With the approval of the administrator, a developer may use any combination of the screening materials referenced in subsection 6-3.3(C), provided the screen provides complete opacity pursuant to the requirements of this section. 
(1)  Developments for which perimeter buffer yards and screening is required shall provide one of the following screening treatments along all lot lines abutting single-family detached dwellings (see Figure 6-3-2): 
(a)  A buffer yard with a minimum width of five (5) feet that includes a solid masonry wall measuring at least six (6) feet in height, meeting the requirements of subsection 6-6.1(A)(10), and shade trees, meeting the requirements of Table 6-3-1, planted along the inside perimeter with a maximum on-center spacing of thirty (30) feet; or 
(b)  A buffer yard with a minimum width of ten (10) feet that includes an alternating double row of a variety of evergreen shrubs and may include a berm to achieve a minimum height at time of planting of six (6) feet, planted a maximum of sixty (60) inches on-center; or 
(c)  A buffer yard with a minimum width of twenty (20) feet that includes vegetative screening meeting the following standards per one hundred (100) linear feet and the requirements of Table 6-3-1: 
i.  Eight (8) shade trees (at least two (2) evergreen); and 
ii.  Four (4) understory trees (at least one evergreen); and 
iii.  Thirty (30) shrubs (at least twenty-one (21) evergreen shrubs).

Detached Dwellings 

    6-3.6. Street buffer yards. In addition to the requirements of subsection 6-3.2, landscaping requirements, and subsection 6-3.3, buffering and screening requirements, all multi-family residential and nonresidential developments shall be buffered from streets and rights-of-way according to the following requirements: 
(A)  The minimum width for any buffer yard shall be five (5) feet with an average of ten (10) feet measured along the property lines at ten-foot intervals. Properties developed with a zero front setback are exempt from these requirements. Parking structures located in the C-3 district shall be exempt from the buffer yard requirement when fences, walls, or similar structures are located between the ground level parking and the street or right-of-way. 
(B)  All areas used for street buffer yards shall be located on the property. In unusual or extraordinary circumstances, as determined by the administrator, the public right-of-way may be used to meet the requirements of this section provided the property owner obtains permission from the owner of the right-of-way. 
(C)  The street buffer yard shall have a continuous shrub border, maintained at thirty (30) inches in height, along the entire street frontage of the lot, excluding driveways. Seventy-five (75) percent of the shrubs shall be evergreen. Plant material must meet the minimum planting height listed in Table 6-3-1. 
(D)  Unless waived by the administrator, vacant lots resulting from the demolition of buildings within the C-3 district shall provide a street buffer. 
    6-3.7. Additional screening requirements. In addition to the landscaping and screening required in this section, additional screening shall be required to conceal specific areas of high visual impact or hazardous areas. 
(A)  Plants and a solid fence or wall, at least the height of the item being screened, but not more than eight (8) feet tall, shall be installed around all sides, excluding access areas. Access gates to these areas shall be solid and, to the extent practical, not oriented to a public street. Plant material must meet the minimum planting heights listed on Table 6-2-1 and shall be installed around the following areas: 
(1)  Loading and service areas. 
(2)  Dumpsters/refuse collection points/recycling drop-off centers. 
(3)  Ground level mechanical, heating and air-conditioning equipment (except for single-family detached and two-family dwellings). 
(4)  Outdoor electrical or other above-ground utility equipment. 
(5)  Outdoor storage lots. 
(6)  Storage tanks. 
(7)  Ground level equipment associated with communication towers. 
(B)  In addition to any fence that may be required by article 7, stormwater management, above-ground stormwater retention/detention facilities shall be screened with a continuous shrub border, maintained at thirty (30) inches in height, along the entire perimeter of the facility, excluding access gates. Seventy-five (75) percent of the shrubs shall be evergreen. Plant material must meet the minimum planting height listed in Table 6-3-1. 
    6-3.8. Alternative landscape plan. At the discretion of the administrator, alternate landscaping plans, plant material, planting methods, or landscape design may be used where unreasonable or impractical situations would result from application of landscaping requirements, or where necessary to protect existing vegetation, or where a more creative plan is proposed which substantially complies with the intent of these requirements. Landscaping requirements may be reduced if existing trees or other types of existing vegetation are preserved. Alternative plans, materials, or methods may be justified from natural conditions such as streams, natural rock formations, topography, and other physical conditions related to the site. Lot configuration and the presence and location of utility easements may justify an alternative landscaping plan. 
(Ord. No. 2017-25, § 2, 12-19-17) 
Sec. 6-4. - Tree protection. 
    6-4.1. General. 
(A)  Purpose. Protection of existing tree cover is intended to preserve the environmental and aesthetic qualities of Perry; to encourage site design techniques that preserve the natural environment and enhance the developed environment; to control erosion, slippage, and sediment runoff into streams and waterways; to increase slope stability; and, to protect wildlife habitat and migration corridors. Preservation or provision of trees near structures also serves to conserve energy by reducing heating and cooling costs. 
(B)  Applicability. The requirements of this section shall apply to all existing and new development, except that the following developments and activities shall be exempt from this section: 
(1)  The removal of dead or naturally fallen trees, or trees that are found by the administrator to be a threat to the public health, safety, or welfare; 
(2)  The removal of pine trees, provided the minimum requirements of this section are maintained; 
(3)  The selective and limited removal of trees or vegetation necessary to obtain clear visibility at driveways or intersections, or for the purpose of performing authorized field survey work; 
(4)  The selective and limited clearing of utility easements to maintain their intended function; and 
(5)  The removal of trees or vegetation on land zoned or lawfully used for: 
(a)  Agricultural and forestry activities, including tree farms and approved forestry management practices, except that if a site is substantially cleared of trees pursuant to legitimate forestry activities, no development applications shall be accepted for thirty-six (36) months from the date the clearing is completed; or 
(b)  Commercial garden centers, greenhouses, or nurseries. 
    6-4.2. Tree protection and replacement. 
(A)  Tree inventory required. A tree inventory shall be submitted as part of an application for a site plan permit and land disturbance permit. The inventory shall be in a form approved by the administrator and contain the information as required in the administrative manual. 
(B)  Tree protection and replacement. 
(1)  All properties, except lots containing a single-family detached or two-family dwelling, to which this section applies shall provide and maintain a tree density of twelve (12) tree credit units per acre or pro rata portion of an acre, excluding building footprints and the area of athletic fields and courts. 
(2)  Including required street trees, each lot containing a single-family detached or two-family dwelling shall provide or maintain one shade tree for each three thousand (3,000) square feet of lot area, excluding the building footprint. Each existing tree exceeding six (6) inches DBH which will be maintained shall count as two (2) trees. 
(3)  The required tree density may be obtained by preserving existing trees and/or planting new trees which may include required street trees, interior parking lot landscaping, and heritage and historic tree replacements. 
(4)  Tree credit units are established for existing and new trees based on each tree's caliper or diameter. The credit units are established in the administrative manual. 
(5)  The form, size, quality, and proportions of preserved and proposed trees must meet the guidelines outlined in the ANSI Z60.1 American Standard for Nursery Stock. 
(6)  Single-family residential subdivisions must comply with a required density factor of ten (10) units per acre, excluding individual single-family lots. This requirement may be met as an average for the total acreage of each phase of the subdivision development, rather than for each individual acre. Trees may be retained or planted along the street right-of-way, as buffer edge plantings along a development's perimeter, in entranceways, or in common open space. Emphasis shall be placed upon retaining existing trees. It is the responsibility of the current property owner to maintain and manage the required trees per the standards of this chapter. 
(7)  If the minimum protection standards are not met, or if trees are observed by the city to be injured or threatened, they may be deemed ineligible for meeting these requirements and additional trees will be required. 
(C)  Protection and replacement of heritage and historic trees. 
(1)  In order to protect significant trees, the city has established the heritage and historic tree designations. A heritage tree is any tree greater than twenty (20) inches in diameter and a historic tree is any tree greater than thirty (30) inches in diameter. A heritage tree which is removed shall be replaced with a minimum of two (2) four-inch caliper shade trees. A historic tree which is removed shall be replaced with a minimum of four (4) four-inch caliper shade trees. Because their shallow root system and narrow growth habit combine to pose risk to life and property, pine trees are not considered to be heritage or historic trees. 
(a)  New trees used to comply with heritage and historic tree replacement requirements shall not count toward the street tree requirements. 
(b)  New trees used to comply with heritage and historic tree replacement requirements shall not count toward the interior parking lot landscaping requirements. 
(c)  No construction, grading, equipment, or material storage, or any other activity, shall be allowed within the critical root zone of a heritage or historic tree unless the steps to be taken to adequately ensure the health of the tree are submitted to the administrator in writing. 
(d)  Heritage or historic trees shall not be cut, removed, pushed over, killed, harmed, trimmed, sprayed, or destroyed without written approval by the administrator. 
(e)  Permits for trimming, removing or replacing heritage or historic trees from the administrator. 
(2)  If the administrator determines that there is insufficient space on the property to replace a heritage or historic tree, the replacement tree may be planted on public property approved by the administrator or a fee based on market price in lieu of the replacement cost may be paid to the city tree fund. 
    6-4.3. Tree protection during construction. 
(A)  Protective fencing. 
(1)  When and where required. Before grading begins, fencing shall be required, at a minimum, around the critical root zone of all trees that are to be preserved. Additional fencing shall be required around the critical root zone of trees on adjacent properties or located in a right-of-way. 
(2)  Type of fencing. All fencing required by this section shall be a minimum of four (4) feet high and of durable construction; such as wood or metal fencing. 
(3)  Signs. Signs shall be installed on the protective fence visible on all sides of the fenced-in area (minimum one on each side and/or every three hundred (300) linear feet). The size of each sign must be a minimum of one foot by one and one-half (1.5) feet and shall contain the following: "TREE PROTECTION ZONE: KEEP OUT." 
(4)  Activity within a fenced tree protection zone. No construction, grading, parking, equipment, or material storage, or any other activity, shall be allowed within the fenced area. 
(5)  Maintenance of fencing. For existing trees to be counted toward required tree credits, they must be protected during the entire development period, beginning prior to the commencement of site work. Encroachment within the tree protection zone is permitted to allow the landscape contractor access to complete site work. 
(B)  Encroachments. Encroachments within the critical root zones of any tree being preserved to comply with required tree credits, or within designated tree protection zones, shall occur only in rare instances. If such an encroachment is anticipated, a written request must be made to the city parks and recreations administrator for allowance of encroachment. Request must detail preventative measures taken. If approved the following preventative measures shall be employed: 
(1)  Clearing activities. The removal of trees adjacent to a tree protection zone can cause inadvertent damage to the protected trees. Wherever possible, it is advisable to cut minimum two-foot trenches along the limits of land-disturbance, so as to cut, rather than tear, roots. Trenching is required for the protection of historic and heritage trees. 
(2)  Soil compaction. Where compaction might occur due to traffic or materials through the tree protection zone, the area must first be mulched with a minimum four-inch layer of processed pine bark or wood chips or a six-inch layer of pine straw. Equipment or materials storage shall not be allowed within tree protection areas. 
(Ord. No. 2017-25, § 2, 12-19-17) 
Sec. 6-5. - Exterior lighting. 
    6-5.1. Outdoor lighting of all types shall be directed so as to reflect away from all residential dwellings, and shall be so situated as not to reflect directly into any public rights-of-way. 
(Ord. No. 2017-25, § 2, 12-19-17) 
Sec. 6-6. - Design standards. 
    6-6.1. Architectural design standards for nonresidential structures. These regulations are intended to ensure the construction of new structures in commercial areas is consistent with the intent of the comprehensive plan. 
(A)  Single tenant structures. All new commercial structures and all new nonresidential structures in the commercial districts shall meet the following standards: 
(1)  Outside of pedestrian retail districts, building surfaces over two (2) stories high or fifty (50) feet in length shall be relieved with changes of wall plane (i.e., recesses and projections) that provide strong shadow or visual interest. 
(2)  Buildings shall utilize natural building materials, such as wood, stone, and brick on building exteriors, except that roofing materials may be manmade. Steel or other metals shall not be used on building exteriors, except as may be necessary for roofing, window trim, gutters, and down spouts. Unpainted, smooth-faced concrete block shall not be used on building exteriors. Synthetic stucco shall not be used on building exteriors. All sides of a building may impact on its surroundings and shall be considered for treatment with an architectural finish of primary materials (i.e., brick and stone), unless other materials demonstrating equal or greater quality are used. As a general rule, except in industrial zoning districts, front facades shall be at least eighty (80) percent brick and stone. Side facades shall be at least fifty (50) percent brick and stone. Rear facades do not have a minimum suggested standard for primary materials unless they are visible from a public right-of-way. 
(3)  Material or color changes generally shall occur at a change of plane. Piecemeal embellishment and frequent changes in material shall be avoided. A horizontal accent stripe (e.g., a foot-wide stripe of different color) shall be used to help reduce the monotonous color and break up the appearance of large building walls. 
(4)  Facade colors shall be low reflectance, subtle, neutral, or earth tone colors. High intensity colors, metallic colors, black, or fluorescent colors shall not be used. Building trim and accent areas may feature brighter colors, including primary colors, provided that the width of the trim shall not exceed four (4) feet. 
(5)  Building colors shall be carefully chosen so that each building complements that of its neighbors. Colors can be classified as the "base" color (used on the majority of the building surface), "trim" color (used on the window trim, fascia, balustrades, and posts), and "accent" color (used on signs, awnings, and doors). The base color shall consist of more subdued earth tones or brick shades. Trim colors shall have contrasted lighter or darker shade than the base color. If natural brick is used, it shall not be painted. 
(6)  The use of awnings on buildings is recommended so as to provide much needed protection from sun, wind, and rain, and to improve aesthetics of the building exterior. 
(7)  Awnings are recommended to be constructed with a durable frame covered by a canvas material. Awnings that are backlit through translucent materials may be acceptable but are not particularly encouraged. Aluminum and other metal canopies are acceptable in most instances, particularly when integrated into shopping center designs. Flameproof vinyl, canvas or metal awnings and canopies may be used. 
(8)  Solid colors are preferred over striped awnings, but striping is permitted if colors compliment the character of the structure or group of buildings. 
(9)  Awnings are encouraged for first floor retail uses to provide architectural interest and to encourage pedestrian activity. Where awnings are used, they shall be designed to coordinate with the design of the building and any other awnings along the same block face. 
(10)  The design of fences and walls shall be compatible with the architecture of the main building(s) and shall use similar materials. All walls or fences fifty (50) feet in length or longer, and four (4) feet in height or taller, shall be designed to minimize visual monotony though changes in plane, height, material or material texture or significant landscape massing. Except in M-1 and M-2 zoning districts, chain link fencing is prohibited in the front yard, or within the required front building setback for undeveloped parcels. Any chain link fencing visible from a public street shall be coated in dark green or black vinyl. Chain link fencing is prohibited in all cases in the C-3 zoning district. Barbed wire or other similar additions to fences is prohibited, except in M-1 and M-2 zoning districts. Use of special fencing design or materials shall be discussed in cases where site security is paramount. All fencing materials must be approved by the department prior to construction. 
(11)  Rooftop mechanical and electrical equipment shall be screened from public view by building elements that are designed as an integral part of the building architecture, or by a parapet wall. 
(B)  Shopping centers including automobile related establishments. All new shopping centers and automobile related establishments containing less than fifty thousand (50,000) square feet shall meet the standards listed in subsection 6-6.1(A). In addition, the following standards shall apply: 
(1)  Within a shopping center, a logical hierarchy of building forms shall be created. Building heights and masses shall be greatest in the focus area and inner portion of the support area (the part closest to the focus area), and shall transition to lower heights and less mass outward from the focus area to the outer edge of the support area. Building massing shall be varied to create a logical hierarchy of building forms, to break up long expanses of facade, and to create shade and shadow. Buildings at the outer edge of an activity center's support area shall be comparable in height and mass with the surrounding neighborhood beyond the support area. 
(2)  Building location, setbacks, and orientation shall be carefully considered so as to increase pedestrian comfort. 
(3)  As far as practicable, buildings in activity centers shall not be separated from fronting streets by large parking lots. At a minimum, placement of out-parcel buildings between a large parking lot and the street shall be used to help define the street scape, and lessen the visual impact of the parking lot from the street. 
(4)  Auto service facilities shall not have their service bays facing the street, and parking for all uses shall be located to the side or rear of the building rather than in the front yard. Regardless, service areas and/or service bays shall be screened or sited so they are not visible from the street. 
(5)  Vehicles under repair shall be kept either inside a structure or in an area which is screened from views from the street. 
(6)  Service areas shall provide adequate queuing space that does not impede vehicle circulation through the site or result in vehicles stacking into the street. 
(7)  The design of fences and walls shall be compatible with the architecture of the main building(s) and shall use similar materials. All walls or fences fifty (50) feet in length or longer, and four (4) feet in height or taller, shall be designed to minimize visual monotony though changes in plane, height, material or material texture or significant landscape massing. Except in M-1 and M-2 zoning districts, chain link fencing is prohibited in the front yard, or within the required front building setback for undeveloped parcels. Any chain link fencing visible from a public street shall be coated in dark green or black vinyl. Chain link fencing is prohibited in all cases in the C-3 zoning district. Barbed wire or other similar additions to fences is prohibited, except in M-1 and M-2 zoning districts. Use of special fencing design or materials shall be discussed in cases where site security is paramount. All fencing materials must be approved by the department prior to construction. 
(8)  Separate structures (canopy, car wash, cashier's booth, etc.) on the site shall have consistent architectural detail and design elements to provide a cohesive project site. If a car wash is incorporated into the project, it shall be well integrated into the design. The car wash opening shall be sited so that it is not directly visible as the primary view from the street into the project site. 
(9)  All areas devoted to the outside storage of vehicles, merchandise, and/or equipment not intended for display for public rent, lease, or sale, shall be screened from view from the right-of-way of the highway or public road along the entire property frontage, except in areas where access crossings have been approved. Screening may be accomplished by a natural vegetative buffer, by a building, by an earthen berm, by a one hundred (100) percent opaque, solid wooden fence or wall, or combination of these screening methods. The use of low-lying landscaping that does not screen the display areas from view from the public right-of-way shall not be deemed to comply with this policy. 
    6-6.2. Design standards for large retail establishments. 
(A)  The intent of these standards is to ensure that large retail building development, defined as single-tenant buildings exceeding thirty-five thousand (35,000) square feet and shopping centers exceeding fifty thousand (50,000) square feet, contributes to the unique community character of Perry. All other rules and regulations of the this land development ordinance shall apply unless noted below. 
(B)  Location standards. 
(1)  Site must abut or have direct access to an arterial street. 
(2)  Must be located in an area where city services can be provided efficiently. 
(3)  Must be compatible with city's comprehensive plan. 
(4)  The development cannot abut a residential street, have a private driveway into a residential street, or a street leading directly into a residential subdivision. 
(C)  Sign standards. All signs at large retail establishments shall meet the requirements of section 106 [6-9], except the following regulations shall apply: 
(1)  Large retail establishments shall be allowed one freestanding sign per road frontage. Freestanding signs shall be subject to the following requirements: 
(a)  Parcels exceeding three (3) acres shall be allowed a maximum aggregate sign area of two hundred (200) square feet for the entire parcel. 
(b)  Parcels less than three (3) acres but greater than thirty thousand (30,000) square feet shall be allowed a maximum aggregate sign area of one hundred fifty (150) square feet for the entire parcel. 
(c)  Parcels less than thirty thousand (30,000) square feet in size shall be allowed a maximum aggregate sign area of one hundred (100) square feet for the entire parcel. 
(d)  These limits shall not include the area of any wall signs or billboard signs located on the parcel. 
(e)  These limits shall include the area of all freestanding signs on the parcel. 
(f)  The only freestanding signs permitted at shopping centers shall be shopping center identification signs. 
(2)  No freestanding sign shall be located within one hundred fifty (150) feet of another freestanding sign. 
(3)  The maximum height of freestanding signs shall not exceed twenty (20) feet. 
(4)  Rooftop signs or sign structures shall not be permitted. 
(5)  Mono-pole sign structures shall not be permitted. 
(6)  Portable signs shall not be permitted. 
(7)  All signs shall be subject to the same side yard setbacks imposed upon other buildings and structures in the same zoning district in which said signs are located. 
(8)  Setbacks along road right-of-way shall be a minimum of fifteen (15) feet from the curb or edge of pavement or on private property whichever is greater. 
(D)  Architectural design standards. 
(1)  Facades and exterior walls. 
(a)  Facades greater than one hundred (100) feet in length, measured horizontally, shall incorporate wall plane projections or recesses having a depth of at least three (3) percent of the length of the facade and extending at least twenty (20) percent of the length of the facade. No uninterrupted length of any facade shall exceed one hundred (100) horizontal feet. See Figure 1. 

(b)  Ground floor facades that face public streets shall have arcades, display windows, entry areas, awnings or other such features along no less than sixty (60) percent of their horizontal length. See Figure 2. 

(2)  Small retail stores. Where shopping centers contain separately owned stores that occupy less than thirty-five thousand (35,000) square feet of gross floor area, with separate, exterior customer entrances, the street level facade of such stores shall be transparent between the height of three (3) feet and eight (8) feet above the walkway grade for no less than sixty (60) percent of the horizontal length of the building facade of such additional stores. Windows shall be recessed and should include visually prominent sills, shutters, or other such forms of framing. 
(3)  Detail features. Building facades must include: 
(a)  A repeating pattern that includes no less than three (3) of the elements listed below. At least one of these elements shall repeat horizontally. All elements shall repeat at intervals of no more than thirty (30) feet, either horizontally or vertically. 
i)  Color change; 
ii)  Texture change; 
iii)  Material module change; 
iv)  An expression of architectural or structural bays through a change in plane no less than twelve (12) inches in width, such as an offset, reveal or projecting rib. See Figure 3. 

(4)  Roofs. Roofs shall have no less than two (2) of the following features: 
(a)  Parapets concealing flat roofs and rooftop equipment such as HVAC units from public view.

ARTICLE 7. - STORMWATER MANAGEMENT 

Sec. 7-1. - Stormwater management requirements and controls. 
    7-1.1. General provisions. 
(A)  Findings of fact. It is hereby determined that: 
(1)  Land development and associated increases in impervious cover alter the hydrologic response of local watersheds and increase stormwater runoff rates and volumes, flooding, stream channel erosion, and sediment transport and deposition; 
(2)  This stormwater runoff contributes to increased quantities of water-borne pollutants; and 
(3)  Stormwater runoff, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution can be controlled and minimized through the regulation of stormwater runoff from development sites. 
Therefore, the city establishes this set of water quality and quantity policies applicable to all surface waters to provide reasonable guidance for the regulation of stormwater runoff for the purpose of protecting local water resources from degradation. It is determined that the regulation of stormwater runoff discharges from land development projects and other construction activities in order to control and minimize increases in stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion, stream channel erosion, and nonpoint source pollution associated with stormwater runoff is in the public interest and will prevent threats to public health and safety. 
(B)  Purpose. The purpose of this article is to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health, safety, and welfare of the public residing in watersheds within this jurisdiction. This article seeks to meet that purpose through regulation of activities that can through proper regulation improve and maintain those water resources that lie partially or wholly within the jurisdictional boundaries of the city. 
(C)  Compatibility with other permit and ordinance requirements. This article is not intended to interfere with, abrogate, or annul any other ordinance, rule or regulation, stature, or other provision of law. The requirements of this article should be considered minimum requirements, and where any provision of this article imposes restrictions different from those imposed by any other ordinance, rule or regulation, or other provision of law, whichever provisions are more restrictive or impose higher protective standards for human health or the environment shall be considered to take precedence. 
(D)  Severability. The provisions of this article are hereby declared to be severable. If any provision, clause, sentence, or paragraph of this article or the application thereof to any person, establishment, or circumstances shall be held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect the other provisions or application of this article. 
(E)  Responsibility for administration. Unless otherwise stated, the administrator shall administer, implement, and enforce the provisions of this article. Any powers granted or duties imposed upon the administrator may be delegated to persons or entities acting under the authority of city.

    7-1.3 Illicit discharge prohibition. 
(A)  General provisions. 
(1)  Purpose. The purpose of this article is to provide for the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the city through the regulation of non-stormwater discharges to the storm drainage system to the maximum extent practicable. The objectives of this article are: 
(a)  To regulate the contribution of pollutants to the municipal separate storm sewer system (MS4) by stormwater discharges by any user; 
(b)  To prohibit illicit connections and discharges to the MS4; and 
(c)  To establish legal authority to carry out all inspection; surveillance and monitoring; and enforcement procedures as necessary to ensure compliance with this article. 
(2)  Applicability. This article shall apply to all non-stormwater discharges entering the storm drain system generated on any developed or undeveloped lands unless explicitly exempted by the city under subsection 7-1.4(B)(1) of this article. 
(B)  Discharge prohibitions. 
(1)  Prohibition of illegal discharges. No person shall discharge or cause to be discharged into the MS4 or watercourses any materials, including but not limited to pollutants or waters containing any pollutants that cause or contribute to a violation of applicable water quality standards, other than stormwater. 
The commencement, conduct or continuance of any illegal discharge to the storm drain system is prohibited except as described as follows: 
(a)  The following discharges are exempt from discharge prohibitions established by this article: water line flushing or other potable water sources, landscape irrigation or lawn watering, diverted stream flows, rising ground water, ground water infiltration to storm drains, uncontaminated pumped ground water, foundation or footing drains (not including active groundwater dewatering systems), crawl space pumps, air conditioning condensation, springs, non-commercial washing of vehicles, natural riparian habitat or wetland flows, swimming pools (if dechlorinated, typically less than one mg/L chlorine), firefighting activities, and any other water source not containing pollutants. 
(b)  Discharges specified in writing by the administrator as being necessary to protect public health and safety. 
(c)  Dye testing is an allowable discharge, but requires a verbal notification to the administrator twenty-four (24) hours prior to the time of the test followed by written notice within ten (10) days. 
(d)  Any non-stormwater discharge permitted under an NPDES permit, waiver, or waste discharge order issued to the discharger and administered under the authority of the United States Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA), provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit, waiver, or order and other applicable laws and regulations, and provided that approval has been granted for any discharge to the storm drain system. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the administrator prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4. 
(e)  Any stormwater discharge regulated under an NPDES stormwater discharge permit for industrial activities provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the administrator prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4. 
(f)  Any stormwater discharge regulated under an NPDES stormwater discharge permit for construction activities or other local land disturbance permit provided that the discharger is in full compliance with all requirements of the permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the administrator prior to the allowing of discharges to the MS4. 
(2)  Prohibition of illicit connections. The construction, use, maintenance or continued existence of illicit connections to the MS4 or watercourses is prohibited. This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation, illicit connections made in the past, regardless of whether the connection was permissible under law or practices applicable or prevailing at the time of connection. 
(C)  Suspension of MS4 access. 
(1)  Suspension due to illicit discharges in emergency situations. The administrator may, without prior notice, suspend MS4 discharge access to a person when such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge that presents or may present imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of the United States. If the violator fails to comply with a suspension order issued in an emergency, the administrator may take such steps as deemed necessary to prevent or minimize damage to the MS4 or Waters of the United States, or to minimize danger to persons. 
(2)  Suspension due to the detection of illicit discharge. Any person discharging to the MS4 or watercourses in violation of this article may have their MS4 access terminated if such termination would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. The administrative will notify a violator of the proposed termination of its MS4 access. The violator may petition the administrator for a reconsideration and hearing. A person commits a violation of this article if the person reinstates MS4 access to premises terminated pursuant to this section, without the prior written approval of the administrator. 
(D)  Monitoring of discharges. 
(1)  Applicability. This section applies to all facilities that have stormwater discharges associated with industrial activity, including construction activity. 
(2)  Access to facilities. 
(a)  The administrator shall be permitted to enter and inspect facilities subject to regulation under this article as often as may be necessary to determine compliance with this article. If a discharger has security measures in force, which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary arrangements to allow access to representatives of the administrator. 
(b)  Facility operators shall allow the administrator ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records that must be kept under the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater, and the performance of any additional duties as defined by state and federal law. 
(c)  The administrator shall have the right to set up on any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the administrator to conduct monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's stormwater discharge. 
(d)  The administrator has the right to require the discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be calibrated to ensure their accuracy. 
(e)  Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the operator at the written or oral request of the administrator and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne by the operator. 
(f)  Unreasonable delay in allowing the administrator access to a permitted facility is a violation of a stormwater discharge permit and of this article. A person who is the operator of a facility with a NPDES permit to discharge stormwater associated with industrial activity commits a violation if the person denies the administrator reasonable access to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this article. 
(g)  If the administrator has been refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is discharged, and he/she is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program designed to verify compliance with this article or any order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the community, then city may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent jurisdiction. 
(E)  Requirement to prevent, control and reduce stormwater pollutants. 
(1)  Specification of best management practices. The city may adopt requirements identifying best management practices for any activity, operation, or facility, which may cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the MS4 or watercourses, or waters of the U.S. 
(2)  Pollution prevention in new facilities. The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the MS4 or watercourses through the use of these structural and non-structural BMPs. 
(3)  Pollution prevention in existing facilities. Any person responsible for a property or premise, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge, may be required to implement, at said person's expense, additional structural and non-structural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the MS4 or watercourses. 
(4)  Discharge permits from regulatory agencies other than the city. Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of stormwater associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed compliance with the provisions of this section. BMPs designated for compliance with the NPDES permit or BMPs implemented as a result of action taken in compliance of this Article shall be included in a SWPPP as necessary for compliance with requirements of the NPDES permit. 
(F)  Watercourse protection. Every person owning property through which a watercourse passes, or such person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the watercourse within the property free of trash, debris, excessive vegetation, and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse. 
(G)  Notification of spills. Notwithstanding other requirements of law, as soon as any person responsible for a facility or operation, or responsible for emergency response for a facility or operation has information of any known or suspected release of materials which are resulting or may result in illegal discharges or pollutants discharging into stormwater, the MS4 or watercourses, or water of the United States said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment, and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous materials said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of non-hazardous materials, said person shall notify the administrator in person, by phone, facsimile or email no later than the next business day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice addressed and mailed to the administrator within three (3) business days of the phone notice. The notification of the discharge of materials to the administrator shall be in addition to notification of other applicable city, county, regional, state and federal authorities. If the discharge of prohibited materials emanates from a commercial or industrial establishment, the owner or operator of such establishment shall also retain an on-site written record of the discharge and the actions taken to prevent its recurrence. Such records shall be retained for at least three (3) years. 
(H)  Enforcement. 
(1)  Notice of violation. Whenever the administrator finds that a person has violated a prohibition or failed to meet a requirement of this article, the administrator may order compliance by written notice of violation to the responsible party. Such notice may require without limitation: 
(a)  The performance of monitoring, analyses, and reporting; 
(b)  The elimination of illicit connections or discharges;

    7-1.4. Post construction stormwater runoff. 
(A)  General provisions. 
(1)  Purpose. The purpose of this article is to establish minimum stormwater management requirements and controls to protect and safeguard the general health, safety, and welfare of the public residing in watersheds within this jurisdiction. This article seeks to meet that purpose through the following objectives: 
(a)  Minimize increases in stormwater runoff from any development in order to reduce flooding, siltation, increases in stream temperature, and streambank erosion and maintain the integrity of stream and drainage channels; 
(b)  Minimize increases in nonpoint source pollution caused by stormwater runoff from development which would otherwise degrade local water quality; 
(c)  Minimize the total annual volume of surface water runoff which flows from any specific site during and following development to not exceed the pre-development hydrologic regime to the maximum extent practicable; and 
(d)  Reduce stormwater runoff rates and volumes, soil erosion and nonpoint source pollution, wherever possible, through stormwater management controls and to ensure that these management controls are properly maintained and pose no threat to public safety. 
(2)  Applicability. This article shall be applicable to all development plan applications, unless eligible for an exemption or granted a waiver by the administrator under the specifications of subsection 7-1.4(C) of this article. This article also applies to land development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development that meets the following applicability criteria, even though multiple separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules. 
(a)  New development that involves the creation of five thousand (5,000) square feet or more of impervious cover, or that disturbs one acre or more of land; 
(b)  Redevelopment that includes the creation, addition or replacement of five thousand (5,000) square feet or more of impervious cover, or that involves other land development activity of one acre or more; 
(c)  Any new development or redevelopment, regardless of size, that is defined by the administrator to be a hotspot land use; or 
(d)  Land development activities that are smaller than the minimum applicability criteria set forth in subsections a. and b. above if such activities are part of a larger common plan of development, even though multiple, separate and distinct land development activities may take place at different times on different schedules. 
(e)  Any development project regardless of size deemed by the administrator that shall contribute to a known or suspected water quality or quantity impairment. 
(3)  Exempt activities. The following activities are exempt from this article: 
(a)  Individual single-family or duplex residential lots that are not part of a subdivision or phased development project; 
(b)  Additions or modifications to existing single-family or duplex residential structures; 
(c)  Agricultural or silvicultural land management activities within areas zoned for these activities; and 
(d)  Repairs to any stormwater management facility or practice deemed necessary by the administrator. 
When a site development plan is submitted that qualifies as a redevelopment project as defined in article II of this chapter, decisions on permitting and on-site stormwater requirements shall be governed by special stormwater sizing criteria found in the current local stormwater design manual (LDM). These criteria are dependent on the amount of impervious area created by the redevelopment and its impact on water quality. Final authorization of all redevelopment projects will be determined after a review by the administrator. 
(4)  Development of a local stormwater design manual (LDM). The city may furnish additional policy, criteria and information including specifications and standards, for the proper implementation of the requirements of this article and will provide such information in the form of a LDM. The LDM will serve to supplement and/or clarify information set forth in the Georgia Stormwater Management Manual. 
The LDM will include a list of acceptable stormwater treatment practices, including the specific design criteria and operation and maintenance requirements for each stormwater practice. The manual may be updated and expanded from time to time, at the discretion of the city, based on improvements in engineering, science, monitoring and local maintenance experience. Stormwater treatment practices that are designed and constructed in accordance with these design and sizing criteria will be presumed to meet the minimum water quality performance standards during the design and permitting phase of a land development project. 
(B)  Permit procedures and requirements. 
(1)  Permit required. No land owner or land operator shall receive any of the building, grading or other land development permits required for land disturbance activities without first meeting the requirements of this article prior to commencing the proposed activity. 
(2)  Application requirements. Unless specifically excluded by this article, any landowner or operator desiring a permit for a land disturbance activity shall submit to the city a permit application on a form provided for that purpose. Unless otherwise excepted by this article, a permit application must include the minimum requirements as defined in this article or LDM in order for the permit application to be considered. 
(3)  Application review fees. The city may require the submittal of a review fee for review of the stormwater management plan. This review fee shall be based on the amount of land to be disturbed at the site, and the fee structure shall be established by the mayor and council of the city. All of the monetary contributions shall be credited to a local budgetary category to support local plan review, inspection and program administration, and all fees shall be paid prior to the issuance of any development permits. 
(4)  Application procedure. All applications received by the city will be received and processed in the manner outlined in this chapter. 
(5)  Permit duration. Permits issued under this section shall be valid from the date of issuance through the date the administrator notifies the permit holder that all stormwater management practices have passed the final inspection required under permit condition. Should no activity take place on the site, the permit shall expire within one year of issuance. 
(C)  Waivers to stormwater management requirements. 
(1)  Waivers for providing stormwater management. Every applicant shall provide for stormwater management as required by this article, unless a written request is filed to waive this requirement. Requests to waive the stormwater management plan requirements shall be submitted to the administrator for approval. 
The minimum requirements for stormwater management may be waived in whole or in part upon written request of the applicant, provided that at least one of the following conditions apply or the applicant presents sufficient engineering data and analysis to support their request for a waiver as determined by the local jurisdiction: 
(a)  It can be demonstrated that the proposed development is not likely to impair attainment of the objectives of this article. 
(b)  Alternative minimum requirements for on-site management of stormwater discharges have been established in a stormwater management plan that has been approved by the administrator and local ordinance (or some other legally enforceable document) that requires the implementation of the plan. 
(c)  Provisions are made to manage stormwater by an off-site facility. The off-site facility is required to be in place, to be designed and adequately sized to provide a level of stormwater control that is equal to or greater than that which would be afforded by on-site practices and there is a legally obligated entity responsible for long-term operation and maintenance of the stormwater practice. 
(d)  The administrator finds that meeting the minimum on-site management requirements is not feasible due to the natural or existing physical characteristics of a site. 
(e)  Non-structural practices will be used on the site that reduce: a) the generation of stormwater from the site; b) the size and cost of stormwater storage; and c) the pollutants generated at the site. These non-structural practices shall be explained in detail in the local or state design manual and the amount of credit available for using such practices shall be determined by the administrator. 
(2)  Conditions of waiver. In instances where one of the conditions above applies, the administrator may grant a waiver from strict compliance with these stormwater management provisions, as long as acceptable mitigation measures are provided. However, to be eligible for a variance, the applicant must demonstrate to the satisfaction of the administrator that the waiver will not result in the following impacts to downstream waterways: 
(a)  Deterioration of existing culverts, bridges, dams, and other structures; 
(b)  Degradation of biological functions or habitat; 
(c)  Accelerated streambank or streambed erosion or siltation; and 
(d)  Increased threat of flood damage to public health, life, and property. 
(3)  Mitigation requirements for waivers. Where compliance with minimum requirements for stormwater management is waived, the applicant will satisfy the minimum requirements by meeting one of the mitigation measures selected by the administrator. Mitigation measures may include, but are not limited to, the following: 
(a)  The purchase and donation of privately owned lands, or the grant of an easement to be dedicated for preservation and/or reforestation. These lands should be located adjacent to the stream corridor in order to provide permanent buffer areas to protect water quality and aquatic habitat. 
(b)  The creation of a stormwater management facility or other drainage improvements on previously developed properties, public or private, that currently lack stormwater management facilities designed and constructed in accordance with the purposes and standards of this article. 
(c)  Monetary contributions (fee-in-lieu) to fund stormwater management activities such as research and studies (e.g., regional wetland delineation studies, stream monitoring studies for water quality and macroinvertebrates, stream flow monitoring, threatened and endangered species studies, hydrologic studies, and monitoring of stormwater management practices, etc.). 
(4)  Fee in lieu of stormwater management practices. Where the administrator waives all or part of the minimum stormwater management requirements, or where the waiver is based on the provision of adequate stormwater facilities provided downstream of the proposed development, the applicant may be required to pay a fee in an amount as determined by the administrator. 
When an applicant obtains a waiver of the required stormwater management, the monetary contribution required shall be in accordance with a fee schedule (unless the developer and the city agree on a greater alternate contribution) established by the city's mayor and council. All of the monetary contributions shall be credited to an appropriate capital improvements program project, and shall be made by the developer prior to the issuance of any development permits. 
(5)  Dedication of land. In lieu of a monetary contribution, an applicant may obtain a waiver of the required stormwater management by entering into an agreement with the city for the granting of an easement or the dedication of land by the applicant, to be used for the construction of an off-site stormwater management facility. The agreement shall be entered into by the applicant and the city prior to the recording of plats or, if no record plat is required, prior to the issuance of the development permits. 
(D)  General performance criteria for stormwater management. Unless judged by the administrator to be exempt or granted a waiver, the following performance criteria shall be addressed for stormwater management at all sites: 
(1)  All site designs shall establish stormwater management practices to control the peak flow rates of stormwater discharge associated with specified design storms and reduce the generation of stormwater. These practices should seek to utilize previous areas for stormwater treatment and to infiltrate stormwater runoff from driveways, sidewalks, rooftops, parking lots, and landscaped areas to the maximum extent practical to provide treatment for both water quality and quantity. 
(2)  All stormwater runoff generated from new development shall not discharge untreated stormwater directly into a state water without adequate control of stormwater runoff. Where such discharges are proposed, the impact of the proposal on wetland functional values shall be assessed using a method acceptable to the administrator. In no case shall the impact on functional values be any less than allowed by the Army Corp of Engineers (ACOE) or the Georgia Department of Natural Resources (DNR). 
(3)  Annual groundwater recharge rates shall be maintained to the maximum extent practical, by promoting infiltration through the use of structural and non-structural methods where allowable. 
(4)  For new development, stormwater treatment practices shall be designed to remove pollutants to levels prescribed in the current LDM. It is presumed that a BMP complies with this performance standard if it is: 
(a)  Sized to capture the prescribed water quality volume (WQ v ); 
(b)  Designed according to the specific performance criteria outlined in the LDM; 
(c)  Constructed properly; and 
(d)  Maintained regularly. 
(5)  To protect stream channels from degradation, specific channel protection criteria shall be provided as prescribed in the current LDM. 
(6)  Stormwater discharges to critical areas with sensitive resources (i.e., fisheries, shellfish beds, swimming beaches, recharge areas, etc.) may be subject to additional performance criteria, or may need to utilize or restrict certain stormwater management practices. 
(7)  Certain industrial sites are required to prepare and implement a SWPPP, and shall file a notice of intent (NOI) under the provisions of the NPDES industrial stormwater general permit. The stormwater pollution prevention plan requirement applies to both existing and new industrial sites. 
(8)  Stormwater discharges from land uses or activities with higher potential pollutant loadings, known as "hotspots", may require the use of specific structural stormwater treatment practices (STPs) and pollution prevention practices. 
(9)  Prior to design, applicants are encouraged to consult with the administrator to determine if they are subject to additional stormwater design requirements. 
(10)  The calculations for determining peak flows as found in the LDM shall be used for sizing all stormwater management practices. 
(E)  Basic stormwater management design criteria. 
(1)  Minimum control requirements. All stormwater management practices will be designed so that the specific storm frequency storage volumes (e.g., recharge, water quality, channel protection, ten-year, 100-year) as identified in the LDM are met, unless the administrator grants the applicant a waiver or the applicant is exempt from such requirements. In addition, if hydrologic or topographic conditions warrant greater control than that provided by the minimum control requirements, the administrator reserves the right to impose any and all additional requirements deemed necessary to control the volume, timing, and rate of runoff. 
(2)  Site design feasibility. Stormwater management practices for a site shall be chosen based on the physical conditions of the site. Applicants shall consult the current LDM for guidance on the factors that determine site design feasibility when selecting a stormwater management practice. 
(3)  Conveyance issues. All stormwater management practices shall be designed to convey stormwater to allow for the maximum removal of pollutants and reduction in flow velocities. The current LDM shall provide detailed guidance on the requirements for conveyance for each of the approved stormwater management practices. 
(4)  Landscaping plans required. All stormwater management practices that utilize wetlands vegetation as part of the functional treatment process (e.g. constructed wetlands, etc.) must submit a separate landscaping plan detailing both the vegetation to be in the practice and how and who will manage and maintain this vegetation. This plan must be prepared by an individual having a professional certification by the Society of Wetlands Scientists and has completed three (3) projects of a similar nature that have been successfully implemented or equivalent qualifications as determined by the administrator. 
(5)  Maintenance agreements. All stormwater treatment practices shall have an enforceable operation and maintenance agreement to ensure the system functions as designed. This agreement will include any and all maintenance easements required to access and inspect the stormwater treatment practices, and to perform routine maintenance as necessary to ensure proper functioning of the stormwater treatment practice. In addition, a legally binding covenant specifying the parties responsible for the proper maintenance of all stormwater treatment practices shall be secured prior to issuance of any permits for land disturbance activities. An example of the covenant can be found in the LDM. 
(6)  Non-structural stormwater practices. The use of non-structural stormwater treatment practices is encouraged in order to minimize the reliance on structural practices. Credit in the form of reductions in the amount of stormwater that must be managed can be earned through the use of non-structural practices that reduce the generation of stormwater from the site. These non-structural practices are explained in detail in the current LDM and applicants wishing to obtain credit for use of non-structural practices must ensure that these practices are documented and remain unaltered by subsequent property owners. 
(F)  Requirements for stormwater management plan approval. 
(1)  Stormwater management plan required for all developments. No application for development will be approved unless it includes a stormwater management plan detailing in concept how runoff and associated water quality impacts resulting from the development will be controlled or managed. This plan must be certified by a professional engineer licensed in the state and must indicate whether stormwater will be managed on-site or off-site and if on-site, the general location and type of practices. 
The stormwater management plan(s) shall be referred for comment to all other interested agencies, and any comments must be addressed in a final stormwater management plan. This final plan must be signed by a professional engineer licensed in the state, who will verify that the design of all stormwater management practices meet the submittal requirements outlined in the submittal checklist found in the current LDM. No development permits shall be issued until a satisfactory final stormwater management plan, or a waiver thereof, shall have undergone a review and been approved by the administrator after determining that the plan or waiver is consistent with the requirements of this article. 
(2)  Stormwater management plan requirements. A stormwater management plan shall be required with all land disturbance activity (LDA) permit applications and will include sufficient information (e.g., maps, hydrologic calculations, etc.) to evaluate the environmental characteristics of the project site, the potential impacts of all proposed development of the site, both present and future, on the water resources, and the effectiveness and acceptability of the measures proposed for managing stormwater generated at the project site. The intent of this planning process is to determine the type of stormwater management measures necessary for the proposed project, and ensure adequate planning for management of stormwater runoff from future development. To accomplish this goal the applicant will prepare a design report which shall include elements sufficient to ensure compliance with this article as outlined in the current LDM. The administrator reserves the right to extend these requirements to ensure compliance with this article if the requirements in the current LDM prove to be insufficient. However, in these cases, the administrator must provide a written explanation of the additional elements needed to the applicant. 
(3)  Performance bond/security; letter of credit; negotiable instrument. The city may, at its discretion, require the submittal of a performance security, bond, letter of credit or negotiable instrument in order to ensure that the stormwater practices are installed by the permit holder as required by the approved stormwater management plan. The amount of the installation performance security, bond, letter of credit or negotiable instrument shall be the total estimated construction cost of the stormwater management practices approved under the permit, plus twenty-five (25) percent as agreed to by the applicant and the city. The performance security, letter of credit or negotiable instrument shall contain forfeiture provisions for failure to complete work specified in the stormwater management plan. 
The installation performance security, letter of credit or negotiable instrument shall be released in full only upon submission of "as-built plans" and written certification by a professional engineer licensed in the state and/or registered land surveyor licensed in the state that the stormwater practice will function in accordance with the approved plan and other applicable provisions of this article. The administrator will make a final inspection of the stormwater practice to ensure that it is in compliance with the approved plan and the provisions of this article. Provisions for a partial pro-rata release of the performance security, letter of credit or negotiable instrument based on the completion of various development stages may be done at the discretion of the administrator. 
(G)  Construction inspection. 
(1)  Notice of construction commencement. The applicant must notify the administrator in advance before the commencement of construction. If any violations are found, the property owner shall be notified in writing of the nature of the violation and the required corrective actions. No added work shall proceed until any violations are corrected and all work previously completed has received approval by the administrator. 
(2)  As-built plans. All applicants are required to submit actual "as-built" plans for any stormwater management practices located both on-site and off-site after final construction is completed in a format specified in the current LDM. The plan must show the final design specifications for all stormwater management facilities and must be certified by a professional engineer licensed in the state. A final inspection by the administrator is required before the release of any performance securities can occur. 
(3)  Landscaping and stabilization requirements. Any area of land from which the natural vegetative cover has been either partially or wholly cleared or removed by development activities shall be revegetated within ten (10) days from the substantial completion of such clearing and construction. The following criteria shall apply to revegetation efforts: 
(a)  Reseeding must be done with an annual or perennial cover crop accompanied by placement of straw mulch or its equivalent of sufficient coverage to control erosion until such time as the cover crop is established over ninety (90) percent of the seeded area. 
(b)  Replanting with native woody and herbaceous vegetation must be accompanied by placement of straw mulch or its equivalent of sufficient coverage to control erosion until the plantings are established and are capable of controlling erosion. 
(c)  Any area of revegetation must exhibit survival of a minimum of seventy-five (75) percent of the cover crop throughout the year immediately following revegetation. Revegetation must be repeated in successive years until the minimum seventy-five (75) percent survival for one year is achieved. 
In addition to the above requirements, a landscaping plan must be submitted with the final design describing the vegetative stabilization and management techniques to be used at a site after construction is completed in accordance with other such requirements in the City Code. This plan will explain not only how the site will be stabilized after construction, but who will be responsible for the maintenance of vegetation at the site and what practices will be employed to ensure that adequate vegetative cover is preserved. 
(H)  Maintenance and repair of stormwater facilities. 
(1)  Maintenance easement. Prior to the issuance of any certificate of occupancy or final plat that has a stormwater management facility as part of the project, the applicant or owner of the site must execute a maintenance easement agreement that shall be binding on all subsequent owners of land served by the stormwater management facility. The agreement shall provide for access to the facility at reasonable times for periodic inspection by the administrator, or their contractor or agent, and for regular or special assessments of property owners to ensure that the facility is maintained in proper working condition to meet design standards and any other provisions established by this article. 
(2)  Maintenance covenants. Maintenance of all stormwater management facilities shall be ensured through the creation of a formal maintenance covenant that must be approved by the administrator and recorded into the final plat prior to final approval. As part of the covenant, a schedule shall be developed for when and how often maintenance will occur to ensure proper function of the stormwater management facility. The covenant shall also include plans for periodic inspections to ensure proper performance of the facility between scheduled cleanouts. 
The city, in lieu of a maintenance covenant, may accept dedication of any existing or future stormwater management facility for maintenance, provided such facility meets all the requirements of this article and includes adequate and perpetual access and sufficient area, by easement or otherwise, for inspection and regular maintenance. 
(3)  Requirements for maintenance covenants. Stormwater management facilities may be required to undergo annual inspections to document maintenance and repair needs and ensure compliance with the requirements of this article and accomplishment of its purposes. These needs may include: removal of silt, litter and other debris from all catch basins, inlets and drainage pipes; grass cutting and vegetation removal; and necessary replacement of landscape vegetation. Any maintenance needs found must be addressed in a timely manner, as determined by the administrator, and the inspection and maintenance requirement may be increased as deemed necessary to ensure proper functioning of the stormwater management facility. The requirement for such inspections shall be outlined in the maintenance covenant. 
(4)  Inspection of stormwater facilities. Inspection programs may be established on any reasonable basis, including but not limited to: routine inspections; inspections; inspections based upon complaints or other notice of possible violations; inspection of drainage basins or areas identified as higher than typical sources of sediment or other contaminants or pollutants; inspections of businesses or industries of a type associated with higher than usual discharges of contaminants or pollutants or with discharges of a type which are more likely than the typical discharge to cause violations of state or federal water or sediment quality standards or an applicable NPDES stormwater permit; and joint inspections with other agencies inspecting under environmental or safety laws. Inspections may include, but are not limited to: reviewing maintenance and repair records; sampling discharges, surface water, groundwater, and material or water in drainage control facilities; and evaluating the condition of drainage control facilities and other stormwater treatment practices. 
(5)  Right-of-entry for inspection. When any new drainage control facility is installed on private property, or when any new connection is made between private property and a public drainage control system or sanitary sewer, the property owner shall grant to the administrator the right to enter the property at reasonable times and in a reasonable manner for the purpose of inspection. This includes the right to enter a property when it has a reasonable basis to believe that a violation of this article is occurring or has occurred, and to enter when necessary for abatement of a public nuisance or correction of a violation of this article. 
(6)  Records of installation and maintenance activities. Parties responsible for the operation and maintenance of a stormwater management facility shall make records of the installation and of all maintenance and repairs, and shall retain the records for at least three (3) years. These records shall be made available to the administrator during inspection of the facility and at other reasonable times upon request. 
(7)  Failure to maintain practices. If a responsible party fails or refuses to meet the requirements of the maintenance covenant, the city, after reasonable notice, may correct a violation of the design standards or maintenance needs by performing all necessary work to place the facility in proper working condition. In the event that the stormwater management facility becomes a danger to public safety or public health, the administrator shall notify the party responsible for maintenance of the stormwater management facility in writing. Upon receipt of that notice, the responsible person shall affect maintenance and repair of the facility in an approved manner and within the established deadline. After proper notice, the city may assess the owner(s) of the facility for the cost of repair work and any penalties; and the cost of the work shall be a lien on the property, or prorated against the beneficial users of the property, and may be placed on the tax bill and collected as ordinary taxes by the city. 
(I)  Enforcement and penalties. 
(1)  Violations. Any development activity that is commenced or is conducted contrary to this article may be restrained by injunction or otherwise abated in a manner provided by law. 
(2)  Notice of violation. When the administrator determines that an activity is not being carried out in accordance with the requirements of this article, the administrator shall issue a written notice of violation to the owner of the property. The notice of violation shall contain: 
(a)  The name and address of the owner or applicant; 
(b)  The address when available or a description of the building, structure or land upon which the violation is occurring; 
(c)  A statement specifying the nature of the violation; 
(d)  A description of the remedial measures necessary to bring the development activity into compliance with this article and a time schedule for the completion of such remedial action; 
(e)  A statement of the penalty or penalties that shall or may be assessed against the person to whom the notice of violation is directed as provided herein; and 
(f)  A statement that the determination of violation may be appealed to the county by filing a written notice of appeal within three (3) days of service of notice of violation. 
Persons receiving a notice of violation may be required to halt all construction activities via a stop work order. 
(3)  Stop work orders. This "stop work order" will be in effect until the administrator confirms that the development activity is in compliance and the violation has been satisfactorily addressed. Failure to address a notice of violation in a timely manner as determined by the administrator can result in civil, criminal, or monetary penalties in accordance with the enforcement measures authorized in this article. 
(4)  Civil and criminal penalties. In addition to or as an alternative to any penalty provided herein or by law, any person who violates the provisions of this article shall be punished by a fine of not less than two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00). Such person shall be guilty of a separate offense for each day during which the violation occurs or continues. 
(5)  Restoration of lands. Any violator may be required to restore land to its undisturbed condition. In the event that restoration is not undertaken within a reasonable time after notice, the city may take necessary corrective action, the cost of which shall become a lien upon the property until paid. 
(6)  Holds on occupation permits. Occupation permits will not be granted until all corrections to all stormwater practices have been made and accepted by the administrator. 
    7-1.5. Flood damage prevention. 
(A)  Statutory authorization, findings of fact, purpose and objectives. 
(1)  Statutory authorization. The legislature of the state has, in O.C.G.A. § 36-1-20(a), delegated the responsibility to local government units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. 
Therefore, the mayor and council of the city do hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations. 
(2)  Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation that results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
(3)  Statement of purpose. It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(a)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
(b)  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction or substantial improvement; 
(c)  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 
(d)  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage; and 
(e)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(4)  Objectives. The objectives of this article are: 
(a)  To protect human life and health; 
(b)  To minimize expenditures of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(c)  To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(d)  To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(e)  To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, street and bridges located in floodplains; 
(f)  To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; 
(g)  To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a potential flood area; and 
(h)  Comply with the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) so as to ensure the availability of flood insurance for residents and property owners. 
(5)  Methods of reducing flood losses. In order to accomplish its purposes, this article includes methods and provisions for: 
(a)  Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
(b)  Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
(c)  Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters; 
(d)  Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
(e)  Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers that will unnaturally divert flood waters or may increase flood hazards in other areas. 
(B)  General provisions. 
(1)  Lands to which this article applies. This article shall apply to all areas of special flood hazard as designated by the city within the zoning and building code jurisdiction of the city. 
(2)  Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard. The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the flood insurance study (FIS) or flood insurance rate maps (FIRM), dated September 28, 2007, with accompanying maps and other supporting data, and any revision thereto, are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this article. The flood insurance study is on file at the administrator. In addition, the local administrator shall reasonably utilize any base flood evaluation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to identify a special flood hazard not otherwise identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency. This data is also on file with the administrator. 
(3)  Establishment of development permit. A development permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of this article prior to the commencement of any development activities. 
(4)  Compliance. No structure or land shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or structurally altered without full compliance with the terms of this article and other applicable regulations. 
(5)  Abrogation and greater restrictions. This article is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this article and another conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
(6)  Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this article all provisions shall be: 
(a)  Considered as minimum requirements; 
(b)  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and 
(c)  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
(7)  Warning and disclaimer of liability. The degree of flood protection required by this article is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This article does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazard or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This article shall not create liability on the part of the city or any officer or employee thereof for any flood damages that result from reliance on this article or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
(8)  Penalties for violation. Violation of the provisions of this article or failure to comply with any of its requirements, including violation of conditions and safeguards established in connection with grants of variance or special exceptions, shall constitute a misdemeanor. Any person who violates this article or fails to comply with any of its requirements shall, upon conviction thereof, be fined not more than two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00), and in addition, shall pay all costs and expenses involved in the case. Each day such violation continues shall be considered a separate offense. Nothing herein contained shall prevent the city or its agent from taking such other lawful actions as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. 
(C)  Administration. 
(1)  Designation of flood damage prevention article administrator. The mayor and council of the city hereby appoints the administrator to administer and implement the provisions of this article. 
(2)  Permit procedures-Application phase. No application for land development within any area of special flood hazard will be approved unless it includes a floodplain management/flood damage prevention plan. This plan shall be made to the administrator on forms furnished by him prior to any development activities. This plan shall be in accordance with the criteria established in this section. This plan must be submitted with the stamp and signature of a professional engineer licensed in the state, who will verify that, all designs are consistent with the requirements of this article. 
The approved floodplain management/flood prevention damage plan shall contain certification by the applicant that all land development activities will be done according to the plan or previously approved revisions. Any and all land development permits and/or use and occupancy certificates or permits may be revoked at any time if the construction and building activities are not in strict accordance with approved plans. 
The floodplain management/flood damage prevention plan shall include, but not be limited to the following: plans drawn to scale of the site in question and the nature, location, and dimensions of existing or proposed structures; earthen fill placement; storage of materials or equipment; and drainage and stormwater management facilities. Specifically, the following information is required: 
(a)  Site plan, including but not limited to: 
1.  For all proposed structures, spot ground elevations at building corners and 20-foot or smaller intervals along the foundation footprint, or one-foot contour elevations throughout the building site; 
2.  Proposed locations of water supply, sanitary sewer, and utilities; 
3.  If applicable, the base flood elevation and location of the base flood boundary; and 
4.  If applicable, the location and elevation of the floodway. 
(b)  Foundation design detail, including but not limited to: 
1.  Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level (or highest adjacent grade) of the lowest finished floor, including basement, of all structures; and 
2.  For crawl-space foundation, location and total net area of foundation openings as required in subsection 7-1.5(D)(2) of this article.

(e)  All appropriate certifications required under this article. 
1.  If the project proposes to alter the configuration of the watercourse for which a detailed flood study has been developed (or the boundaries of a floodway), the applicant shall submit the proposed grading and drainage plans, stormwater management plans, floodplain studies, and all supporting computer modeling to the FEMA Region IV office for a conditional letter of map revision. The project will not receive final approval until the proposed alteration of the watercourse (and/or floodway boundaries) has been approved by FEMA. 
2.  If a proposed project will alter the boundaries of the area of special flood hazard as shown on the FEMA flood insurance rate maps, the applicant shall submit the approved grading and drainage plans, stormwater management plans, floodplain studies, and all supporting computer modeling to the FEMA Region IV office for a conditional letter of map revision, within thirty (30) days of receiving final approval. 
3.  Within thirty (30) days following completion of the entire project or a phase thereof, the applicant shall submit engineer's certified copies of the final, constructed grading and drainage plans and stormwater management plans to the FEMA Region IV office for issuance of a final letter of map revision. 
4.  The administrator shall be provided copies of all related correspondence, and shall sign the required community acknowledgement form. 
(3)  Permit procedures-Construction phase. Upon placement of the lowest floor, or flood-proofing by construction means, it shall be the duty of the permit holder to submit to the floodplain management administrator a certification of the NGVD 88 (National Geodetic Vertical Datum) elevation of the lowest floor or flood-proofed elevation, as built, in relation to mean sea level. Said certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a professional engineer and certified by same. When flood proofing is utilized for a particular building, said certification shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a professional engineer or architect and certified by same. Any work undertaken prior to submission of the certification shall be at the permit holder's risk. The permit holder immediately and prior to further progressive work being permitted to proceed shall correct deficiencies detected by such review. Failure to submit the survey or failure to make said corrections required hereby shall be cause to issue a stop work order for the project. 
(4)  Duties and responsibilities of the administrator. Duties of the administrator shall include, but not be limited to: 
(a)  Review all development permits to assure that the permit requirements of this article have been satisfied. 
(b)  Advise permittee that additional federal or state permits may be required, and if specific federal or state permit requirements are known, require that copies of such permits be provided and maintained on file with the development permit. 
(c)  Notify adjacent communities, the state floodplain coordinator, and other federal and/or state agencies with statutory or regulatory authority prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse. 
(d)  Assure that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is not diminished. 
(e)  Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new or substantially improved buildings, in accordance with subsection 7-1.5(C)(3). 
(f)  Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which the new or substantially improved buildings have been flood-proofed, in accordance with subsection 7-1.5(C)(3). 
(g)  Review certified plans and specifications for compliance. 
(h)  Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions) the administrator shall make the necessary interpretation. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in this section. 
(i)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with subsection 7-1.5(B)(2) then the administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state or other source, in order to administer the provisions of subsection 7-1.5(D). Review all development permits to assure that the permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied. 
(j)  Advise permittees that additional federal or state permits may be required, and if specific federal or state permit requirements are known, require that copies of such permit be provided and maintained on file with the development permit. 
(k)  Notify adjacent communities, the state department of natural resources (and any other appropriate agencies, such as regional planning, water management, or flood control districts) prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification along with a copy of the notice to the FEMA Region IV office. 
(l)  Assure that the flood-carrying capacity of the watercourse is not diminished by the proposed alteration or relocation. 
(m)  Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including basement) of all new or substantially improved buildings, in accordance with this section. 
(n)  Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) to which the new or substantially improved buildings have been flood proofed, in accordance with this section. 
(o)  When flood proofing is utilized for a particular building, obtain certification from a registered professional engineer or architect, in accordance with this section. 
(p)  Determine whether a building or development site is located within an area of special flood hazard by referencing the FEMA flood insurance study and accompanying maps, or other available and appropriate data. If detailed topographic mapping is available, the boundary of the area of special flood hazard shall be plotted on such mapping utilizing the base flood elevations provided for the area in question. This more detailed definition of the boundary of the base flood shall be utilized as best available data for purposes of regulating the area of special flood hazard. If there are significant discrepancies between the boundary as shown on the FEMA maps and the topographic mapping available, the administrator shall so advise the FEMA Region IV office. 
(q)  Within A zones along rivers, streams, lakes, swamps, and marshes, determine the appropriate base flood elevation for each individual building site utilizing the flood data tables (for lakes) and the stream profiles contained in the FEMA flood insurance study. The base flood elevations printed on the FEMA maps are illustrative only. The administrator shall interpolate the base flood elevation at a site between two (2) given base flood elevation markers by referring to the stream profiles and measuring the distance of the site upstream or downstream from a cross section shown on the FEMA map. 
(r)  Where interpretation is needed as to the exact location of boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and the natural grade of actual field conditions) make the necessary interpretation, utilizing the most accurate topographic mapping available. The elevations published in the FEMA flood insurance study, as portrayed in the profile sheets, shall be the ruling reference for delineating the boundary of the floodplain. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in this article. Property may not be excluded from the area of special flood hazard as a result of filling unless a letter of map revision has been approved by FEMA. 
(s)  Where the administrator has determined all or a portion of a property to be located outside of the flood hazard area, yet it is shown as being within the flood hazard area on the FEMA maps, the applicant shall be advised of the need to obtain a letter of map amendment or revision from the FEMA Region IV Office and shall be given an application packet utilizing forms provided by FEMA. While the property may be exempt from the requirements of this chapter, flood insurance purchase will remain mandatory until FEMA authorizes a letter of map amendment or revision. 
(t)  When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with subsection 7-1.5(B)(2), obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provisions of this chapter. Base flood elevations may be estimated using topographic maps or scientific engineering methodology. Base flood elevation and delineation of the boundaries of the special flood hazard areas shall be developed and provided for subdivision proposals and other proposed developments (including industrial parks, shopping centers, public facilities, and manufactured home parks and subdivisions) that are greater in size than the lesser of fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres. Also, floodway data shall be developed for all definable streams subject to a flood study. Base flood elevation, flood hazard area boundary mapping, and floodway data, if developed, shall be submitted to the FEMA Region IV office within thirty (30) days of receipt and acceptance by the community for review as a possible map revision. 
(u)  When a development project will cause a reconfiguration of the flood hazard area due to grading, filling, channel alteration, or relocation, development of a stormwater management system, or the excavation of lakes, require the applicant to submit and obtain approval from FEMA of a conditional letter of map revision. Where a floodway is being impacted, this must be obtained prior to construction. Following completion of all or each phase of such a development, the administrator shall require the applicant to submit to FEMA the as-built topographic and hydrologic information to obtain a final letter of map revision. 
(v)  The office of the administrator shall serve as the official map repository for FEMA flood insurance rate maps, flood boundary and floodway maps (if applicable), and flood hazard boundary maps for the community, together with letters of map amendment (LOMAs) and letters of map revision (LOMRs). At least one copy of all current and superseded maps, LOMAs, and LOMRs shall be maintained for public use and viewing. 
(w)  All records pertaining to the provisions of this section shall be maintained in the administrator and shall be open for public inspection. Copies of all development permits and summary supporting documentation shall be filed by geographic area for ease of coordinating all floodplain development activities.

(k)  The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges. 
(4)  Conditions for variances. 
(a)  Variances shall only be issued when there is: 
1.  A showing of good and sufficient cause; 
2.  A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship; and 
3.  A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public expense, create nuisance, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or articles. 
(b)  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and in the instance of an "historic structure," a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary so as not to destroy the historic character and design of the building. 
(c)  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the elevation to which the lowest floor is to be built and stating that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. 
(d)  The administrator shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Georgia Emergency Management Agency upon request. 
(5)  Variance notification. Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that: 
(a)  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood elevation will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance, and 
(b)  Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the administrator with the clerk of superior court for the county in which the property is located and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land. The administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in the community's biennial report submission to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(6)  Historic structures. Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "historic structures" upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure" and the variance is the minimum to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
(7)  Special conditions. Upon consideration of the purposes of this article, the city or its agent may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this article. 
(8)  No-impact certification within designated special flood hazard areas. Variances shall not be issued within any designated Special flood hazard area if an increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

(F)  Forestry land management practices, including harvesting; provided, however, that when such exempt forestry practices cause or result in land-disturbing or other activities otherwise prohibited in a buffer, as established in subsections (15) and (16) of subsection 7-2.3(C) of this chapter, no other land-disturbing activities, except for normal forest management practices, shall be allowed on the entire property upon which the forestry practices were conducted for a period of three (3) years after completion of such forestry practices; 
(G)  Any project carried out under the technical supervision of the Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) of the United States Department of Agriculture; 
(H)  Any project involving less than one acre of disturbed area; provided, however, that this exemption shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity within a larger common plan of development or sale with a planned disturbance of equal to or greater than one acre or within two hundred (200) feet of the bank of any state waters, and for purposes of this paragraph, "state waters" excludes channels and drainage ways which have water in them only during and immediately after rainfall events and intermittent streams which do not have water in them year-round; provided, however, that any person responsible for a project which involves less than one acre, which involves land-disturbing activity, and which is within two hundred (200) feet of any such excluded channel or drainage way, must prevent sediment from moving beyond the boundaries of the property on which such project is located and provided, further, that nothing contained herein shall prevent the local issuing authority from regulating any such project which is not specifically exempted by this section; 
(I)  Construction or maintenance projects, or both, undertaken or financed in whole or in part, or both, by the department of transportation, the state highway authority, or the state road and tollway authority; or any road construction or maintenance project, or both, undertaken by any county or municipality; provided, however, that construction or maintenance projects of the department of transportation or the state road and tollway authority which disturb one or more contiguous acres of land shall be subject to provisions of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7.1; except where the department of transportation, the state highway authority, or the state road and tollway authority is a secondary permittee for a project located within a larger common plan of development or sale under the state general permit, in which case a copy of a notice of intent under the state general permit shall be submitted to the local issuing authority, the local issuing authority shall enforce compliance with the minimum requirements set forth in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 as if a permit had been issued, and violations shall be subject to the same penalties as violations by permit holders; 
(J)  Any land-disturbing activities conducted by any electric membership corporation or municipal electrical system or any public utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the public service commission, any utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, any cable television system as defined in O.C.G.A. § 36-18-1, or any agency or instrumentality of the United States engaged in the generation, transmission, or distribution of power; except where an electric membership corporation or municipal electrical system or any public utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the public service commission, any utility under the regulatory jurisdiction of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, any cable television system as defined in O.C.G.A. § 36-18-1, or any agency or instrumentality of the United states engaged in the generation, transmission, or distribution of power is a secondary permittee for a project located within a larger common plan of development or sale under the state general permit, in which case the local issuing authority shall enforce compliance with the minimum requirements set forth in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 as if a permit had been issued, and violations shall be subject to the same penalties as violations by permit holders; and 
(K)  Any public water system reservoir. 
    7-2.3. Minimum requirements for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control using best management practices. 
(A)  General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place during land-disturbing activities if requirements of the ordinance and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land-disturbing activities which are not exempted by this chapter shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices. The provisions shall be incorporated into the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirements of subsections 7-2.3(B) and (C) of this chapter. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installations, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be installed to prevent or control erosion, sedimentation and pollution during all stages of any land-disturbing activity in accordance with requirements of this chapter and the NPDES general permit. 
(B)  Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
(1)  Best management practices as set forth in subsections 7-2.3(B) and (C) of this chapter shall be required for all land-disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management practices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the Director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of storm water issued pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean designed in accordance with the hydraulic design specifications contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" specified in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 
(2)  A discharge of storm water runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land-disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such discharge results in the turbidity of receiving waters being increased by more than twenty-five (25) nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water fisheries or by more than ten (10) nephelometric turbidity units for waters classified as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiving waters shall be measured in accordance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construction is equal to or greater than five (5) acres. 
(3)  Failure to properly design, install, or maintain best management practices shall constitute a violation of any land- disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to subsection (f) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act," for each day on which such failure occurs. 
(4)  The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
(5)  The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections (C)(15), (16) and (17), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(c). 
(C)  The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land-disturbing activities shall require, as a minimum, protections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, including sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
(1)  Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be conducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion; 
(2)  Cut-fill operations must be kept to a minimum; 
(3)  Development plans must conform to topography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 
(4)  Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 
(5)  The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 
(6)  Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 
(7)  Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 
(8)  Permanent vegetation and structural erosion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 
(9)  To the extent necessary, sediment in run-off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this paragraph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of O.C.G.A. §§ 12-7-1 et seq.; 
(10)  Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of fills; 
(11)  Cuts and fills may not endanger adjoining property; 
(12)  Fills may not encroach upon natural watercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 
(13)  Grading equipment must cross flowing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasible, provided, in any case, that such crossings are kept to a minimum; 
(14)  Land-disturbing activity plans for erosion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels specified in this subsection (B); 
(15)  Except as provided in subsections (16) and (17) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where a drainage structure or a roadway drainage structure must be constructed, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications, and are implemented; or where bulkheads and sea walls are installed to prevent shoreline erosion on Lake Oconee and Lake Sinclair; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has water flowing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground-water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water flow. Unless exempted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least twenty-five (25) feet established pursuant to Part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buffer: 
(a)  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
(b)  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within twenty-five (25) degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines; and 
(16)  There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream flow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classified as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a roadway drainage structure must be constructed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classified as trout streams which discharge an average annual flow of twenty-five (25) gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buffer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a variance from such buffer to allow land-disturbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and specifications and are implemented. The following requirements shall apply to such buffer: 
(a)  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
(b)  The buffer shall not apply to the following land-disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of crossing, within twenty-five (25) degrees of perpendicular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer; and adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and are implemented: (i) stream crossings for water lines; or (ii) stream crossings for sewer lines. 
(17)  There is established a 25-foot buffer along coastal marshlands, as measured horizontally from the coastal marshland-upland interface, as determined in accordance with O.C.G.A. Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Coastal Marshlands Protection Act of 1970," and the rules and regulations promulgated thereunder, except where the director determines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-2-8, where an alteration within the buffer area has been authorized pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-286, for maintenance of any currently serviceable structure, landscaping, or hardscaping, including bridges, roads, parking lots, golf courses, golf cart paths, retaining walls, bulkheads, and patios; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, where a drainage structure or roadway drainage structure is constructed or maintained; provided, however, that if such maintenance requires any land-disturbing activity, adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented, on the landward side of any currently serviceable shoreline stabilization structure, or for the maintenance of any manmade storm-water detention basin, golf course pond, or impoundment that is located entirely within the property of a single individual, partnership, or corporation; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. For the purposes of this paragraph maintenance shall be defined as actions necessary or appropriate for retaining or restoring a currently serviceable improvement to the specified operable condition to achieve its maximum useful life. Maintenance includes emergency reconstruction of recently damaged parts of a currently serviceable structure so long as it occurs within a reasonable period of time after damage occurs. Maintenance does not include any modification that changes the character, scope or size of the original design and serviceable shall be defined as usable in its current state or with minor maintenance but not so degraded as to essentially require reconstruction. 
(a)  No land-disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation until all land-disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the final stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; provided, however, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat; and 
(b)  The buffer shall not apply to crossings for utility lines that cause a width of disturbance of not more than fifty (50) feet within the buffer, provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
(c)  The buffer shall not apply to any land-disturbing activity conducted pursuant to and in compliance with a valid and effective land-disturbing permit issued subsequent to April 22, 2014, and prior to December 31, 2015; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented or any lot for which the preliminary plat has been approved prior to December 31, 2015 if roadways, bridges, or water and sewer lines have been extended to such lot prior to the effective date of this Act and if the requirement to maintain a 25-foot buffer would consume at least eighteen (18) percent of the high ground of the platted lot otherwise available for development; provided, however, that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated into the project plans and specifications and such measures are fully implemented. 
(d)  Activities where the area within the buffer is not more than five hundred (500) square feet or that have a "minor buffer impact" as defined in [EPD Rule] 391-3-7-.01(r), provided that the total area of buffer impacts is less than five thousand (5,000) square feet are deemed to have an approved buffer variance by rule. Bank stabilization structures are not eligible for coverage under the variance by rule and notification shall be made to the division at least fourteen (14) days prior to the commencement of land disturbing activities. 
(D)  Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. §§ 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer requirements that exceed the minimum requirements in subsections 7-2.3(B) and (C) of this chapter. 
(E)  The fact that land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this chapter or the terms of the permit. 
    7-2.4. Application/permit process. 
(A)  General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general development plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, storm water management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, this chapter, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. However, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
(B)  Application requirements. 
(1)  No person shall conduct any land-disturbing activity within the jurisdictional boundaries of city without first obtaining a permit from the administrator to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 
(2)  The application for a permit shall be submitted to the administrator and must include the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data specified in subsection 7-2.4(C) of this chapter. Erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans, together with supporting data, must demonstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be carried out in such a manner that the provisions of subsections 7-2.3(B) and (C) of this chapter will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accompanied by copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plans. All applications shall contain a certification stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-.10. 
(3)  In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to paragraph (5) subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23, provided that such fees shall not exceed eighty dollars ($80.00) per acre of land-disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the primary permittee as defined in the state general permit for each acre of land-disturbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of development. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certified pursuant to subsection (a) of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8, one-half (1/2) of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to paragraph (9) or (10) of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17 shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
(4)  Immediately upon receipt of an application and plan for a permit, the local issuing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within thirty-five (35) days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within thirty-five (35) days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by subsection 7-2.3(C)(15), (16) and (17) have been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per subsection 7-2.4(B)(6), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agreement which allows the local issuing authority to conduct such review and approval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within thirty-five (35) days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing authority with plan review authority to act within thirty-five (35) days shall be considered an approval of the revised Plan submittal. 
(5)  If a permit applicant has had two (2) or more violations of previous permits, this chapter section, or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act, as amended, within three (3) years prior to the date of filing the application under consideration, the local issuing authority may deny the permit application. 
(6)  The local issuing authority may require the permit applicant to post a bond in the form of government security, cash, irrevocable letter of credit, or any combination thereof up to, but not exceeding, three thousand dollars ($3,000.00) per acre or fraction thereof of the proposed land-disturbing activity, prior to issuing the permit. If the applicant does not comply with this section or with the conditions of the permit after issuance, the local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. These provisions shall not apply unless there is in effect an ordinance or statute specifically providing for hearing and judicial review of any determination or order of the local issuing authority with respect to alleged permit violations. 
(C)  Plan requirements. Plans must be prepared to meet the minimum requirements as contained in subsections 7-2.3(B) and (C) of this chapter, or through the use of more stringent, alternate design criteria which conform to sound conservation and engineering practices. The Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia is hereby incorporated by reference into this chapter. The plan for the land-disturbing activity shall consider the interrelationship of the soil types, geological and hydrological characteristics, topography, watershed, vegetation, proposed permanent structures including roadways, constructed waterways, sediment control and storm water management facilities, local ordinances and state laws. Maps, drawings and supportive computations shall bear the signature and seal of the certified design professional. Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspections or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on his or her level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission and in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
(1)  Data required for site plan shall include all the information required from the appropriate erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan review checklist established by the commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land-disturbing activity was permitted. 
(D)  Permits. 
(1)  Permits shall be issued or denied as soon as practicable but in any event not later than forty-five (45) days after receipt by the local issuing authority of a completed application, providing variances and bonding are obtained, where necessary and all applicable fees have been paid prior to permit issuance. The permit shall include conditions under which the activity may be undertaken. 
(2)  No permit shall be issued by the local issuing authority unless the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan has been approved by the district and the local issuing authority has affirmatively determined that the plan is in compliance with this chapter, any variances required by subsections 7-2.3(C)(15), (16) and (17) are obtained, bonding requirements, if necessary, as per subsection 7-2.4(B)(6) are met and all ordinances and rules and regulations in effect within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority are met. If the permit is denied, the reason for denial shall be furnished to the applicant. 
(3)  Any land-disturbing activities by a local issuing authority shall be subject to the same requirements of this chapter, and any other ordinances relating to land development, as are applied to private persons and the division shall enforce such requirements upon the local issuing authority. 
(4)  If the tract is to be developed in phases, then a separate permit shall be required for each phase. 
(5)  The permit may be suspended, revoked, or modified by the local issuing authority, as to all or any portion of the land affected by the plan, upon finding that the holder or his successor in the title is not in compliance with the approved erosion and sedimentation control plan or that the holder or his successor in title is in violation of this chapter. A holder of a permit shall notify any successor in title to him as to all or any portion of the land affected by the approved plan of the conditions contained in the permit. 
(6)  The LIA may reject a permit application if the applicant has had two (2) or more violations of previous permits or the Erosion and Sedimentation Act permit requirements within three (3) years prior to the date of the application, in light of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(f)(1). 
    7-2.5. Inspection and enforcement. 
(A)  The administrator will periodically inspect the sites of land-disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedimentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permittees as such terms are defined in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the primary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land-disturbing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities as defined herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this chapter, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this chapter. 
(B)  The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within twelve (12) months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 
(C)  The administrator shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reasonably deem necessary to carry out duties as prescribed in this chapter, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land-disturbing activities. 
(D)  No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the district, or division who requests entry for the purposes of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, hamper or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 
(E)  The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's erosion, sedimentation and pollution control program. The district or the commission shall notify the division and request investigation by the division if any deficient or ineffective local program is found. 
(F)  The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certified as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indicates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certified pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so notified shall have ninety (90) days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certification as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within ninety (90) days after notification by the division, the division shall revoke the certification of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority. 
    7-2.6. Penalties and incentives. 
(A)  Failure to obtain a permit for land-disturbing activity. If any person commences any land-disturbing activity requiring a land-disturbing permit as prescribed in this chapter without first obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a business and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. 
(B)  Stop-work orders. 
(1)  For the first and second violations of the provisions of this chapter, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The violator shall have five (5) days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within five (5) days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop-work order requiring that land-disturbing activities be stopped until necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land-disturbing activities are conducted without obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning; 
(2)  For a third and each subsequent violation, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order; and 
(3)  All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. 
(4)  When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to maintain a stream buffer, or significant amounts of sediment, as determined by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee, have been or are being discharged into state waters and where best management practices have not been properly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or his or her designee. All such stop work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land-disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of temporary or permanent erosion and sediment controls. 
(C)  Bond forfeiture. If it is determined that a person engaged in land-disturbing activities has failed to comply with the approved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land-disturbing activity fails to comply within the time specified, he shall be deemed in violation of this chapter and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of subsection 7-2.4(B)(6). The local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land-disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
(D)  Monetary penalties. Any person who violates any provisions of this chapter, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this chapter, or who negligently or intentionally fails or refuses to comply with any final or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this chapter shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this chapter, notwithstanding any provisions in any city charter to the contrary, municipal courts shall be authorized to impose penalty not to exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) for each violation. Notwithstanding any limitation of law as to penalties which can be assessed for violations of county ordinances, any magistrate court or any other court of competent jurisdiction trying cases brought as violations of this chapter under county ordinances approved under this chapter shall be authorized to impose penalties for such violations not to exceed two thousand five hundred dollars ($2,500.00) for each violation. Each day during which violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation. 
    7-2.7. Education and certification. 
(A)  Persons involved in land development design, review, permitting, construction, monitoring, or inspection or any land-disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certification requirements, dependent on their level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
(B)  For each site on which land-disturbing activity occurs, each entity or person acting as either a primary, secondary, or tertiary permittee, as defined in the state general permit, shall have as a minimum one person who is in responsible charge of erosion and sedimentation control activities on behalf of said entity or person and meets the applicable education or training certification requirements developed by the commission present on site whenever land-disturbing activities are conducted on that site. A project site shall herein be defined as any land-disturbance site or multiple sites within a larger common plan of development or sale permitted by an owner or operator for compliance with the state general permit. 
(C)  Persons or entities involved in projects not requiring a state general permit but otherwise requiring certified personnel on site may contract with certified persons to meet the requirements of this chapter. 
(D)  If a state general permittee who has operational control of land-disturbing activities for a site has met the certification requirements of paragraph (1) of subsection (b) of O.C.G.A. § 12-7-19, then any person or entity involved in land-disturbing activity at that site and operating in a subcontractor capacity for such permittee shall meet those educational requirements specified in paragraph (4) of subsection (b) of O.C.G.A § 12-7-19 and shall not be required to meet any educational requirements that exceed those specified in said paragraph. 
    7-2.8. Administrative appeal, judicial review. 
(A)  Administrative remedies. The suspension, revocation, modification or grant with condition of a permit by the local issuing authority upon finding that the holder is not in compliance with the approved erosion, sediment and pollution control plan; or that the holder is in violation of permit conditions; or that the holder is in violation of any ordinance; shall entitle the person submitting the plan or holding the permit to a hearing before the city planning commission within thirty (30) days after receipt by the local issuing authority of written notice of appeal. 
(B)  Judicial review. Any person, aggrieved by a decision or order of the local issuing authority, after exhausting his administrative remedies, shall have the right to appeal de novo to the Superior Court of Houston County, Georgia. 
    7-2.9. Liability. 
(A)  Neither the approval of a plan under the provisions of this chapter, nor the compliance with provisions of this chapter shall relieve any person from the responsibility for damage to any person or property otherwise imposed by law nor impose any liability upon the local issuing authority or district for damage to any person or property. 
(B)  The fact that a land-disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this chapter or the terms of the permit. 
(C)  No provision of this chapter shall permit any persons to violate the Georgia Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act or the rules and regulations promulgated and approved thereunder or pollute any waters of the state as defined thereby. 
(Ord. No. 2017-25, § 2, 12-19-17) 
Sec. 7-3. - Water resource protection. 
    7-3.1. Purpose. The intent of this article is to establish minimum development standards and criteria which will afford reasonable protection of environmentally sensitive natural resources found throughout the city. It has been determined the wise management of these resources as defined in this section is essential to maintaining the health, safety, general welfare and economic well-being of the public. 
    7-3.2. Establishment of water resource districts. The city's water resource districts shall include the following: 
(A)  Groundwater recharge area district. 
(B)  Wetlands protection district. 
The boundaries of these water resource districts are shown on a set of maps designated as "water resource districts" and are included as part of the city's official zoning map, which is on file with the administrator. 
    7-3.3. Definitions. In addition to the general definitions provided in this article, the following definitions shall apply to this section: 
    Aquifer means any stratum or zone of rock beneath the surface of the earth capable of containing or producing water from a well. 
    Drastic means the standardized system for evaluating groundwater pollution potential using the hydrogeologic settings described in the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Document EPA-600-87-035 (Note: The Drastic methodology is the most widely used technique for evaluating pollution susceptibility). 
    Generalized wetlands map means the current U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service National Wetlands Inventory Maps for the City of Perry, Georgia. 
    Jurisdictional wetland means an area that meets the definitional requirements for wetlands as determined by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. 
    Jurisdictional wetland determination means a delineation of jurisdictional wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, 33 U.S.C. § 1344, as amended. 
    Pollution susceptibility means the relative vulnerability of an aquifer to being polluted from spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, applications of chemicals, injections and other human activities in the recharge area. 
    Pollution susceptibility map means the relative vulnerability to pollution prepared by the department of natural resources using the Drastic methodology. (Georgia Department of Natural Resources Hydrologic Atlas 20: Groundwater Pollution Susceptibility Map of Georgia.) 
    Recharge area means any portion of the earth's surface where water infiltrates into the ground to replenish an aquifer. 
    Regulated activity means any activity which will or which may reasonably be expected to result in the discharge of dredged or fill material into the waters of the U.S. excepting those activities exempted in Section 404 of the Federal Clean Water Act. 
    Significant recharge areas mean those areas mapped by the Georgia Department of Natural Resources in Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 Edition). 
    Water resource districts mean a map overlay which imposes a set of requirements in addition to those of the underlying zoning district. 
    Wetlands means those areas inundated or saturated by surface or groundwater at a frequency and duration sufficient to support, and under normal circumstances do support, a prevalence of vegetation typically adapted for life in saturated soil conditions. Wetlands generally include swamps, marshes, bogs and similar areas. The ecological parameters for designating wetlands include hydric soils, hydrological vegetation and hydrological conditions involving a temporary or permanent source of water to cause soil saturation. 
    7-3.4. Groundwater recharge area district. 
(A)  Findings of fact. Recharge areas are vulnerable to urban development activities as well as agricultural activities. Pesticides, herbicides, animal waste and septic tank effluents contribute to deterioration in the groundwater quality and can threaten the health of residents relying on well water. Development usually means an increase in the amount of land covered with impervious surfaces. Paving land in recharge areas can alter or impair their recharge characteristics thereby decreasing groundwater supplies. 
(B)  Purpose. The purpose of this overlay district is to establish criteria to protect significant groundwater recharge areas from pollution by spills, discharges, leaks, impoundments, application of chemicals, injections and other development pressures. 
(C)  District delineation. The groundwater recharge area district is delineated according to the Georgia Department of Natural Resources' "Most Significant Groundwater Recharge Areas of Georgia Hydrologic Atlas 18 (1989 Edition)". Each recharge area shall be determined to have a pollution susceptibility of high, medium, or low based on the "Georgia Pollution Susceptibility Map Atlas 20, 1992 Edition." Said maps are hereby adopted and made a part of this chapter. 
(D)  Permitted uses. All uses allowed in the underlying zoning districts are permitted in the groundwater recharge area protection district. The following are additional requirements for specific uses: 
(1)  New above-ground chemical or petroleum storage tanks, having a minimum volume of six hundred sixty (660) gallons, shall have secondary containment for one hundred ten (110) percent of the volume of such tanks or one hundred ten (110) percent of the volume of the largest tank in a cluster of tanks. Such tanks used for agricultural purposes are exempt provided they comply with all federal requirements. 
(2)  New agricultural waste impoundment sites shall be lined if they are within: 
(a)  A high pollution susceptibility area; 
(b)  A medium pollution susceptibility area and exceed fifteen (15) acre-feet in size; and 
(c)  A low pollution susceptibility area and exceed fifty (50) acre-feet in size. 
As a minimum, the liner shall be constructed of compacted clay having a thickness of one foot and a vertical hydraulic conductivity of less than 5 × 10-7 cm/sec or other criteria established by the National Resource and Conservation Service. 
(3)  New homes served by septic tank/drain field systems shall be on lots having the following minimum size limitations as identified on Table MT-1 of the Department of Human Resources' Manual for On-Site Sewage Management Systems (hereafter DHR Table MT-1). The minimum set forth in Table MT-1 may be increased further based on consideration of other factors (set forth in Sections A-F) of the DHR Manual. 
(a)  One hundred fifty (150) percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated based on application of DHR Table MT-1 if they are within a high pollution susceptibility area; 
(b)  One hundred twenty-five (125) percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated based on application of DHR Table MT-1 if they are within a medium pollution susceptibility area; 
(c)  One hundred ten (110) percent of the subdivision minimum lot size calculated based on application of DHR Table MT-1 if they are within a low pollution susceptibility area. 
(4)  New manufactured home parks served by septic tank/drain field systems shall have lots or spaces having the following size limitation as identified on Table MT-2 of the Department of Human Resources' (DHR) Manual for On-site Sewage Management Systems (hereafter DHR Table MT-2). The minimums set forth in Table MT-2 may be increased further based on consideration of other factors (set forth in sections A-F) of the DHR Manual. 
(a)  One hundred fifty (150) percent of the subdivision minimum lot or space calculated based on application of DHR Table MT-2 if they are within a high pollution susceptibility area; 
(b)  One hundred twenty-five (125) percent of the subdivision minimum lot or space size calculated based on application of DHR Table MT-2 if they are within a medium pollution susceptibility area; and 
(c)  One hundred ten (110) percent of the subdivision minimum lot size or space size calculated based on application of DHR Table MT-2 if they are within a low pollution susceptibility area. 
(5)  No construction may proceed on a building or manufactured home to be served by a septic tank unless the Houston County Health Department first approves the proposed septic tank installation as meeting the requirements of the Georgia Department of Human Resources Manual for On-Site Sewage Management (hereinafter DHR Manual and subsections 7-3.4(D(3) and (4) above. 
(6)  New facilities which handle hazardous materials, of the types (listed in Section 312 of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act of 1976, excluding underground storage tanks) and in amounts ten thousand (10,000) pounds or more on any one day shall perform their operations on impervious surfaces and in conformance with any applicable federal spill prevention requirements and any local fire prevention code requirements. 
(7)  Permanent stormwater infiltration basins shall not be constructed in areas having high pollution susceptibility. 
(E)  Exemptions. Any lot of record approved prior to the adoption of this article is exempt from the minimum lot size requirements contained in subsections 7-3.4(D)(3) and (4). 
    7-3.5. Wetlands protection district. 
(A)  Findings of fact. The wetlands within the city are indispensable and fragile natural resources with significant development constraints due to flooding, erosion and soil limitations. In their natural state, wetlands serve man and nature. They provide habitat areas for fish, wildlife and vegetation; water quality maintenance and pollution control; flood control; natural resource education; scientific study, and recreational opportunities. 
(B)  Purpose. The purpose of this overlay district is to promote them from alterations which will significantly affect or reduce the primary functions for water quality, floodplain and erosion control, groundwater recharge, aesthetic natural areas and wildlife habitat areas. 
(C)  District delineation. The wetlands protection district is hereby established which shall correspond to all lands within the jurisdiction of the City of Perry, Georgia that are mapped as wetland areas by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife National Wetlands Inventory Maps. This map shall be referred to as the generalized wetlands map and is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be part of this article, together with all explanatory matter thereon as attached thereto. 
The generalized wetlands map does not necessarily represent the boundaries of jurisdictional wetlands with the city and cannot serve as a substitute for a delineation of wetland boundaries by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, as required by Section 404 of the Clean Water Act, as amended. Any local government action under this chapter does not relieve the landowner from federal or state permitting requirements. 
(D)  Wetland development permit requirements. No regulated activity or use except those identified in subsection (E) shall be allowed within the wetland protection district without a development permit from the city. If the area proposed for development is located within fifty (50) feet of a wetlands protection district boundary as determined by the administrator using the Generalized Wetlands Map, a U.S. Army Corps of Engineers determination shall be required. If the Corps determines that wetlands are present on the proposed development site, the development permit will not be granted until Section 404 [of the Clean Water Act], permit or letter of permission, is issued. 
(E)  Permitted uses. The following uses are permitted by right within the wetland protection district to the extent they are not prohibited by any other ordinance or law and provided they do not require structures, grading, fill, draining or dredging as provided herein. (These activities listed in this section are exempted from Section 404 [of the Clean Water Act] regulations provided they do not have impacts on a navigable waterway that would necessitate acquisition of an individual 404 permit. However, under Section 10 of the Rivers and Harbors Act, a permit may be required in some circumstances.) 
(1)  Forestry practices applied in accordance with best management practices approved by the Georgia Forestry Commission and as specified in Section 404 of the Clean Water Act. 
(2)  Conservation or preservation soil, water, vegetation, fish or other wildlife, provided it does not affect waters of the state or of the United States in such a way that would require an individual 404 permit. 
(3)  Outdoor passive recreational activities, including fishing, bird watching, hiking, boating, horseback riding and canoeing. 
(4)  The cultivation of agricultural crops. Agricultural activities shall be subject to best management practices approved by the Georgia Department of Agriculture. 
(5)  The pasturing of livestock, provided that riparian wetlands are protected, that soil profiles are not disturbed, and that approved agricultural best management practices are followed. 
(6)  Education, scientific research and nature trails. 
(F)  Prohibited uses. The following uses are prohibited in a wetland district: 
(1)  Receiving areas for toxic or hazardous waste or other contaminants. 
(2)  Hazardous or sanitary landfills.

ARTICLE 9. - NONCONFORMING USES AND SITUATIONS 

Sec. 9-1. - General. 
    9-1.1. Purpose and intent. 
(A)  Within the provisions established by this chapter, there exist nonconforming situations that were lawfully established before this chapter was adopted or amended, that now do not conform to the terms and requirements of this chapter. Nonconforming situations include unlawful uses of land or buildings and lots, structures, and signs that do not conform to one or more regulations of the districts in which the lot, structure, or sign is located. The purpose of this article is to regulate and limit the continued existence of those uses, structures, lots, and signs that do not conform to the provisions of this chapter or any amendments thereto. 
(B)  It is the intent of this chapter to permit these nonconforming situations to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival except under the limited circumstances established in this article. The provisions of this article are designed to curtail substantial investment in nonconforming situations to preserve the integrity of this chapter. However, it is not the intent of this chapter to require compliance with a requirement of this chapter that is not reasonably achieved if compliance cannot be achieved without adding additional land not under the same ownership to the lot where the nonconforming situation is maintained or moving a substantial structure that is located on a permanent foundation. 
    9-1.2. Authority to continue. Nonconforming uses and situations are allowed to continue in accordance with the requirements of this article. 
    9-1.3. Determination of nonconformity status. In all cases, the burden of establishing that a nonconforming situation lawfully exists shall be on the owner of the land on which the purported nonconforming situation is located. 
    9-1.4. Repairs, maintenance and reconstruction. 
(A)  Repairs and maintenance that are required to keep nonconforming uses, structures, situations, and signs in a safe condition are permitted, provided that the repair or maintenance does not extend, expand, or enlarge the nonconforming use, structure, situation, or sign. For the purposes of this section, the term "repair or maintenance" shall include the total cost of labor and materials (within a five-year period) utilized in the repair or maintenance, the value of which does not exceed fifty (50) percent of the appraised value of the structure or fifty (50) percent of the replacement cost of the sign and: 
(1)  Maintenance of safe condition. Repair that is necessary to maintain a nonconforming use, structure, or sign in a safe condition; 
(2)  Correction of damage or deterioration. Repair that is necessary to correct any damage or deterioration to the structural soundness or interior appearance of a building or structure; 
(3)  Maintenance of land for safety. Maintenance of land areas to protect against health hazards and promote the safety of surrounding land uses; and 
(4)  Sign repair and maintenance. Repair and maintenance of nonconforming signs, such as repainting and electrical repair, provided the cost does not exceed fifty (50) percent of the replacement cost of the sign. 
(B)  In the event any nonconforming structure is damaged, by any means, to the extent of fifty (50) percent or more of its replacement value prior to such destruction, such structure shall not be repaired or restored except in conformance with the standards for the zoning district in which it is located. The determination of replacement valuation shall be made by the administrator or, at the applicant's option and cost, by a certified independent appraiser. 
(C)  In the event a structure is damaged, by any means, to an extent of less than fifty (50) percent of its replacement value prior to such damage, no repairs or restoration shall be made unless a building permit is obtained within six (6) months of the date of the damage and repair or restoration is begun within one year after the date of such damage and is diligently pursued to completion. The determination of replacement valuation shall be made by the administrator or, at the applicant's option and cost, by a certified independent appraiser. 
(D)  Garages, carports, and storage buildings accessory to single-family dwellings in which the garages, carports, or storage buildings are nonconforming due to the structure not meeting minimum setback requirements may be repaired, replaced, or increased in area not exceeding twenty (20) percent of the original footprint of the structure regardless of the repair or replacement cost relative to appraised value provided there is no increase to any nonconformity and provided further that the structure is not increased in its number of stories. 
    9-1.5. Change of tenancy or ownership. 
(A)  General. Changes of tenancy, ownership, or management of a use containing a nonconforming situation wherein the use does not change are permitted, and, in such cases, the nonconforming situation shall continue to be subject to the requirements of this article. 
(B)  Exception. The transfer of ownership or operation of a sexually oriented business located within one thousand (1,000) feet of another sexually oriented business is not permitted (see subsection 4.3.3(E), sexually oriented business). 
    9-1.6. Temporary nonconforming uses. A temporary use permit may be issued by the administrator pursuant to temporary use permit provisions in article 2, administration, for an appropriate period of time for the following uses, provided that the owner of the temporary nonconforming use agrees to remove the temporary nonconforming use upon expiration of the permit. 
(A)  Nonconforming buildings, structures or uses incidental to building construction or land development may be allowed for the duration of the construction or development period. 
(Ord. No. 2017-25, § 2, 12-19-17) 
Sec. 9-2. - Change of use where nonconforming situation exists. 
    9-2.1. Change to permitted use. A nonconforming use may be changed to a principal use permitted in the district in which the property is located provided all other requirements of this chapter applicable to that change of use can be met. Permission to accomplish the change must be obtained in the same manner as permission to make the initial use of a vacant lot in the district. Once conformity with this chapter is achieved, the property may not be changed to a nonconforming use. 
    9-2.2. Change to another nonconforming use. A nonconforming use shall not be changed to any other nonconforming use except as may be permitted pursuant to procedures and standards for special exception permit in article 2, administration. 
(Ord. No. 2017-25, § 2, 12-19-17) 
Sec. 9-3. - Expansion or enlargement where nonconforming situation exists. 
    9-3.1. Increase of nonconformity. Except as specifically provided for in this section, the extent of nonconformity shall not be increased. In particular, physical alteration of structures, the placement of new structures on open land, the relocation of structures, or the extension of a use to cover more land than was occupied when the use became nonconforming, is unlawful if such activity results in: 
(A)  An increase in the total amount of space devoted to a nonconforming use; or 
(B)  Greater nonconformity with respect to dimensional restrictions such as setback requirements, height limitations, density limitations, parking requirements, etc. 
    Notwithstanding subsection 9-3.1(B), the administrator may authorize the enlargement of a single-family dwelling determined to be nonconforming due to its not meeting minimum setback requirements provided there is no decrease in the prevailing setback and the number of stories is not increased. 
    9-3.2. Increase of use. A nonconforming use shall not be enlarged, expanded in area occupied, or intensified. A nonconforming use may be enlarged in any area of the same structure which is designed for such use prior to the date the use became a nonconforming use. 
(Ord. No. 2017-25, § 2, 12-19-17) 
Sec. 9-4. - Discontinuance and reestablishment of a nonconforming situation. 
    9-4.1. A nonconforming use shall not be reestablished after: 
(A)  Discontinuance for one hundred eighty (180) days; or 
(B)  Discontinuance for any period of time without a present intention to reinstate the nonconforming use. 
    Pursuant to subsection 9-1.4, repairs, maintenance and reconstruction, a nonconforming use may be reestablished if the reestablishment occurs within three (3) months from the time the renovations or repairs are completed. 
    9-4.2. If a nonconforming use is located within the same development as a conforming use, discontinuance of the nonconforming use pursuant to subsection 9-4.1(A)(2) shall terminate the right to continue the use thereafter. 
    9-4.3. Except as specifically provided in this chapter, a structure or lot accommodating a use or situation that does not conform to one or more regulations of article 6, development and design standards, shall not be reestablished or changed to another use after discontinuance for one hundred eighty (180) days. 
(Ord. No. 2017-25, § 2, 12-19-17) 
Sec. 9-5. - Nonconforming signs. 
    9-5.1. General. 
(A)  Subject to the conditions set forth in this section, and pursuant to the provisions of O.C.G.A. § 32-6-83, nonconforming signs may continue in operation and maintenance, provided that nonconforming signs: 
(1)  Shall not be changed to or replaced with another nonconforming sign; 
(2)  Shall not be structurally altered so as to extend useful life; 
(3)  Shall not be expanded; 
(4)  Shall not be relocated, except in compliance with this article; or 
(5)  Shall not be re-established after damage or destruction of more than fifty (50) percent of the replacement value of the same type of sign at the time of such damage or destruction. Any damage to a nonconforming sign that is not repaired constitutes damage or destruction for purposes of this subsection, and that damage shall be cumulative; and 
(6)  Shall be removed if the parcel on which the sign is located is redeveloped or the building on the same parcel as the sign is demolished and/or redeveloped or reconstructed. 
(B)  This section shall not prevent normal maintenance operations performed on a nonconforming sign or sign structure, provided structural elements are not removed and replaced. Nonconforming signs declared to be structurally unsafe by the administrator shall be removed and not repaired.

(Ord. No. 2017-25, § 2, 12-19-17) 
Sec. 86.3. - Form Based Zoning Districts. 
86.3.1. Form Based Zoning Districts Established 
A.  The following Zoning Districts are established within the area regulated by this code: 
1.  Interstate Mixed Use (IMU)

(Ord. No. 2017-25, § 2, 12-19-17) 
ARTICLE 87. - GENERAL REQUIREMENTS 

Sec. 87.1. - Applicability. 
87.1.1. Applicability 
A.  The requirements of this Article apply to all parcels in the Perry Form Based Code unless expressly stated otherwise in this Article. 
B.  The requirements of the Perry Land Development Ordinance still apply unless expressly stated otherwise in this Article. In addition, State and Federal laws may also apply. 
C.  When the word "street" is used in this Article it means both public and private streets unless stated otherwise. 
(Ord. No. 2017-25, § 2, 12-19-17) 
Sec. 87.2. - Block and Access. 
87.2.1. Intent 
A.  The intent of the block and access standards is to provide a well-connected street network. Large blocks with limited connectivity discourage walking, contribute to street congestion, and add driving distance that can negatively impact emergency services. New streets should also be designed to consider the future development identified in the Perry Future Land Use Plan. 
B.  The intent of the access standards is to provide safe and convenient vehicular and pedestrian access within developments and between adjacent developments and to lessen traffic congestion and increase connectivity. Pedestrian, bike, and vehicular access should be safe, direct and convenient. 
87.2.2. Blocks 
A.  Sites greater than 4 acres in size must incorporate existing or new streets that terminate at other existing or new streets to form an interconnected network with the maximum block perimeter lengths that follow: 
Block Perimeter (Max.) Form Based Zoning Districts  MUC 1,600 feet  NMU 2,000 feet  IMU, FBR 2,400 feet  

B.  In addition to the block standards above, blocks containing exclusively detached dwellings must be wide enough to provide two tiers of lots, except where fronting on arterial streets prevented by topographical conditions or size of the property, in which case the Community Developer Director or their designee may require and/or approve a single tier of lots. 
C.  Other than stub-out streets, dead-end streets are not allowed unless a variance is granted for topographic hardship. 
D.  Block Measurement 
1.  A block is bounded by a public or private right-of-way (not including an alley). All public or private rights-of-way proposed as part of a development must be improved with a street. 
2.  Block perimeter is measured along the edge of the property abutting the public or private right-of-way, except for the measurement of dead-end streets, which are measured from intersecting centerlines. 
3.  The City Transportation Engineer may modify the block perimeter requirements when steep slopes in excess of 25%, preexisting development, tree protection areas, stream buffers, cemeteries, open space, or easements would make the provision of a complete block infeasible. 
4.  Where the block pattern is interrupted by public parklands including greenways that are open and accessible to the public, pedestrian access points must be provided with a minimum spacing equal to half of the maximum block perimeter. 
E.  No public or private street within the Form Based Code area, including alleys, may be gated. 
87.2.3. Access 
A.  General. When land is subdivided or otherwise developed, parcels and buildings must be arranged and designed so as to allow for the opening of future streets and must provide access to those areas not presently served by streets. No development may be designed to completely eliminate street access to abutting parcels without current street access. 
B.  Stub-Out Streets 
1.  Stub-Out Required 
a.  Where a development abuts unsubdivided land, stub-out streets within the new development must be installed to the meet the block standards of Section 87.2.2. 
b.  The stub-out street right-of-way, pavement, and curbing must extend to the boundary of the abutting parcel to the point where the connection to the anticipated street is expected. 
c.  Where a stub-out street is provided, a sign noting the future street extension must be posted at the applicant's expense. 
2.  Connecting to an Existing Stub-Out Street. If a stub-out street exists on an abutting parcel, the street system of any new development must connect to the stub-out street to form a through street. 
3.  Exception. The City Transportation Engineer may eliminate the requirement for a stub-out street or require pedestrian and bicycle only access when steep slopes in excess of 25%, freeways, waterways, tree conservation areas, stream buffers, cemeteries, open space or easements would make the provision of a stub-out street infeasible. 
87.2.4. Vehicle Cross-Access 
All lots in districts allowing commercial uses, attached dwellings, and all lots where the adopted comprehensive plan land use classification would allow for rezoning to such district, that abut another lot in a district or land use classification allowing either commercial uses, or attached dwellings must comply with the following standards. 
A.  Internal vehicular circulation areas must be designed and installed to allow for cross-access between abutting lots. 
B.  Vehicle cross-access may not be gated. 
C.  When an abutting lot is vacant or already developed, a stub for a future cross-access connection must be provided at the point where the connection to the abutting parcel is expected to occur in the future. 
D.  If a cross-access driveway stub exists on an abutting parcel, the internal vehicular circulation area must connect to the stub to form a cross-access connection. 
E.  When cross-access for vehicles is deemed impractical by the City Transportation Engineer on the basis of topography, the presence of natural features, or vehicular safety factors, the requirement for cross access may be waived. Bicycle and pedestrian connections must be provided between abutting properties when cross-access is waived. 
F.  Property owners who establish cross-access easements must: 
1.  Allow pedestrian and vehicular access to all properties on the same block face as the property owner establishing the cross-access. Pedestrian and vehicular access is contingent upon the granting of reciprocal vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian access rights to the granting property; 
2.  Record an easement allowing cross-access to and from properties served by the cross-access easement; 
3.  Record a joint maintenance agreement requiring each property owner to maintain the vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian access areas on their lot; 
4.  Contain a provision prohibiting the erection of fences, walls and other obstructions that prevent the use of vehicular, bicycle, and pedestrian access ways; 
5.  Include a statement that the cross-access agreement is conveyed with the land, is binding on all successors, heirs and assigns and that the easement rights are perpetual; and 
6.  The cross access agreement must be signed by all of owners of the granting property. 
G.  Exception. The Community Developer Director or their designee may eliminate the requirement for a cross-access easement when steep slopes in excess of 25%, freeways, waterways, tree conservation areas, stream buffers, cemeteries, open space or easements would make the provision of a cross-access easement infeasible. 
(Ord. No. 2017-25, § 2, 12-19-17) 
Sec. 87.3. - Streets. 
87.3.1. Intent 
A.  The intent of this Section is to provide a palette of street types and design elements that reflect the character of different areas within the Form Based Code area. 
B.  The regulations provide adequate accommodations for vehicles, cyclists, and pedestrians. 
C.  The street types defined in this Section provide a guide to balancing the needs of all modes of travel. Modifications to these types may be made by the Community Developer Director or their designee. 
D.  The appropriate street type will be selected by the Community Developer Director or their designee based on the Perry Regulating Plan and engineering and land use context factors, including anticipated vehicle volumes. 
87.3.2. Applicability 
A.  When a development proposes the construction of a new public or private street, the requirements of this Section apply. 
B.  When constructing a new street or reconstructing an existing street, sidewalks, bike lanes, curb and gutter, and street trees must be installed and constructed in accordance with this Section and the City of Perry Community Development Department/Public Works Design Standards. 
C.  Existing streets may continue serving existing development in their current configuration; however, they must not be extended or substantially rebuilt except in conformance with this Section. 
87.3.3. Street Types 
A.  All new or extended public or private streets must meet the following standards unless modified by the Community Developer Director or their designee for the following public purposes:
