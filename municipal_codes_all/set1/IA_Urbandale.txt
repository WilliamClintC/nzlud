§ 52.003  GENERAL ADOPTION.



    The provisions of this chapter are enacted to aid in the enforcement
of the pretreatment regulations set forth in this chapter. The city by
enacting this subchapter designates the WRA and its operating contractor as
the enforcement agency under this chapter. Employees, agents and officers of
the WRA and of its operating contractor, while acting to enforce this chapter
for the WRA, are empowered to make inspections, issue orders or permits and
take those actions within the corporate boundaries of the city or sanitary
sewer district as are authorized by this subchapter. The WRA or its operating
contractor is also authorized to impose and collect all fees or penalties
authorized by this chapter, and are authorized to directly bill and collect
from contributors penalties, fees, charges and surcharges from all users
within the city. A user's failure to pay any fee, charge, penalty or
surcharge is a municipal infraction and shall also be grounds to discontinue
sewer service to the user, all as hereafter more particularly provided. The
enforcement of this chapter in the city or sanitary sewer district is not
dependent upon passage of this chapter or a similar ordinance by other WRA
participating communities.

§ 52.009  USER REQUIREMENTS.



    (A)   The following requirements shall apply to all users of the
POTW.



      (1)   All users shall promptly notify the WRA Director in
advance of any substantial change in the volume or character of pollutants in
their discharge.



      (2)   New or increased contributions of pollutants or changes
in the nature of pollutant discharged to the POTW shall require prior
approval by the WRA Director.



      (3)   Industrial users shall notify the WRA Director, the
Environmental Protection Agency Regional Waste Management Division Director
and state hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge into the
POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous
waste under 40 C.F.R. part 261. The notification shall comply with the
requirements set forth in 40 C.F.R. § 403.12(p).



      (4)   Discharge of any pollutants without the notice and
approval required by this section is prohibited. Upon the receipt of notice
required by this section, the WRA Director shall within 180 days or less
approve the discharge if he or she finds the proposed discharge meets
applicable pretreatment standards and requirements and would not cause the
WRA to violate its national pollutant discharge elimination system permit.
The WRA Director shall deny permission for the discharge if he or she finds
applicable pretreatment standards and requirements are not met or the
discharge would cause a violation of the national pollutant discharge
elimination system permit for the WRF. In lieu of denial of permission for
discharge, the WRA Director may allow the discharge or contribution upon
conditions which would not violate applicable pretreatment standards or
requirements and would not cause a violation of the national pollutant
discharge elimination system permit for the WRF.



      (5)   Food service establishments shall initially be regulated
under §§ 52.060 through 52.075 of this chapter but may be required to
obtain a wastewater discharge permit and be subject to the requirements of
§§ 52.001 through 52.048 if the WRA Director determines that additional
pretreatment is required in order to comply with fat, oil and grease
discharge limits.



   (B)   Any part of this section notwithstanding, upon receipt of the
notice required by this section, the WRA Director may require, in addition to
the requirements of this section, that an industrial user obtain a permit
under this subchapter.



   (C)   Users who are determined to be industrial users as herein
defined and who refuse to apply for or obtain a wastewater discharge permit
shall be subject to termination of sewer services as provided in § 52.043.

any dimension, animal tissues, paunch manure, bones, hair, hides or
fleshings, entrails, whole blood, feathers, ashes, cinders, sand, spent lime,
stone or marble dust, metal, glass, straw, shavings, grass clippings, rags,
wipes, spent grains, spent hops, wastepaper, wood, plastics, tar, asphalt
residues from refining or processing of fuel or lubricating oil, mud or glass
grinding or polishing waste, or tumbling and de-burring stones, and
wastewater containing fat, wax, O & G, or other substances which may solidify
or become viscous at temperatures between 32° and 150°F (0° and 65°C).



   (D)   Any pollutant, including oxygen demanding pollutants (BOD,
etc.) released in a discharge at a flow rate or pollutant concentration which
will cause interference or pass through at the WRF or which constitutes a
slug load as defined in this section.



   (E)   Heat in amounts which will inhibit biological activity in the
POTW resulting in interference, but in no case wastewater or vapor having a
temperature higher than 150°F (65°C) at the point of introduction into the
POTW, and in no case wastewater or vapor which alone or in concert with other
discharges produces a temperature at the WRF greater than 104°F (40°C).



   (F)   Petroleum oil, non-biodegradable cutting oil, or products of
mineral oil origin in amounts that will cause interference or pass through.



   (G)   Pollutants which result in the presence of toxic gases,
vapors, or fumes within the POTW in a quantity that may cause acute worker
health and safety problems or a public nuisance.



   (H)   Any trucked or hauled pollutants, except at discharge points
designated by the WRA.



   (I)   Radioactive wastes unless they comply with Atomic Energy
Commission Act of 1954 (68 Stat. 919 as amended and part 20, subpart D, Waste
Disposal, § 20.303 of the regulations issued by the Atomic Energy
Commission, or amendments thereto).



   (J)   Any wastewater containing concentrations of inert suspended
solids, such as but not limited to fuller's earth, lime slurries, and lime
residues, or of dissolved solids, such as but not limited to, sodium chloride
and sodium sulfate, which exceed 3,000 mg/l nonvolatile or 3,000 mg/l total
dissolved solids unless approved by the WRA director.



   (K)   Pollutants causing excessive discoloration, such as but not
limited to dye waste and vegetable tanning solutions.

facility or from a regulated process is prohibited as a method for treatment
of wastes in order to meet the limits set forth in this section.



      (2)   Sample location. Measurement of pollutant concentrations
to determine compliance shall be made at the point immediately following the
pretreatment facility and before mixture with other waters, unless another
point is designated by the WRA Director. If necessary, the concentrations so
measured shall be recomputed to exclude the effect of any dilution that is
improper using the combined waste stream formula.



   (B)   Headworks limits; average mass. The average composite loading
of all industrial users contributing the following specific pollutants to the
POTW shall not exceed the allowable total pounds. The allocation of

of the Director, may cause interference or pass through.



   (F)   Users shall obtain the specific approval of the WRA Director
prior to discharging any waste resulting from a pretreatment facility to the
POTW. The WRA Director may develop a documentation system to track the
transportation and final disposition of any pretreatment waste. Pretreatment
waste regulated by this division (F) shall include waste generated as a
result of pretreatment processes used to comply with national pollutant
discharge elimination system permits, air pollution permits, wastewater
discharge permits, soil/groundwater reclamation processes and pollutants
resulting from a spill of any liquid or solid material or the cleanup of any
spill. Pretreatment waste is prohibited from disposal to the water of the
state except as specifically permitted by the State Department of Natural
Resources.

   (C)   Users shall immediately telephone and notify the WRA of any
accidental or deliberate discharge of pollutants which violates § 52.010 or
which is a slug load. Any discharge into the POTW of a substance which is a
listed or characteristic waste under § 3001 of RCRA must be immediately
reported to the United States Environmental Protection Agency Regional
Director, the State Department of Natural Resources and the WRA.
Notifications required in this division (C) shall include the name of caller,
location and time of discharge, pollutant concentration, volume and the
corrective actions taken.



   (D)   Users shall submit a written report to the WRA Director within
five days following an accidental or deliberate discharge describing the
cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent
similar future occurrences. Users shall submit follow-up reports as may be
required by the WRA Director. The report shall not relieve the user of any
expense, loss, damage or other liability which may be incurred as a result of
damage to the POTW, fish kills or any other damage to person or property, nor
shall this report relieve the user of any fines, civil penalties or other
liability which may be imposed by this subchapter or otherwise. Failure to
report accidental or deliberate discharges may, in addition to any other
remedies available to the city and sewer district, result in the revocation
of the discharger's wastewater discharge permit.



   (E)   Users shall control production or all discharges to the extent
necessary to maintain compliance with all applicable regulations upon
reduction, loss or failure of its pretreatment facility until the facility is
restored or an alternative method of pretreatment is provided. This
requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary
source of power to the user's pretreatment facility is reduced, lost or fails.



   (F)   Users required to have a spill containment plan must
permanently post a notice in English and the language of common use on the
user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to
call if a prohibited discharge occurs. Users shall ensure that all employees
who are in a position to cause, discover or observe an accidental discharge
are advised of the emergency notification procedures.

§ 52.023  PERMIT APPLICATIONS; BASELINE MONITORING REPORTS.



    Users applying for a wastewater discharge permit or submitting a
baseline monitoring report shall submit the following information as required
by 40 C.F.R. § 403.12 or by the WRA Director.



   (A)   Users applying for a wastewater discharge permit must submit
an application form prescribed by the WRA and accompanied by the application
fee. All new significant users must submit an application 180 days prior to
the date of any wastewater discharge. Existing users subject to new national
categorical pretreatment standards must, within 180 days after the effective
date of the standard, submit an application. The following information is
required:



      (1)   Name, address and location of the facility, if different
from the mailing address;



      (2)   The name of a person or agent authorized to accept legal
service of process;



      (3)   Standard industrial classification (SIC) code of both
the industry as a whole and any processes for which national categorical
pretreatment standards have been promulgated and a list of any environmental
control permits held by or for the facility;



      (4)   Wastewater constituents and characteristics including
any pollutants in the discharge which are limited by any Federal, state or
local standards with sampling and analysis performed in accordance with
Environmental Protection Agency approved methods and meeting the following
requirements:



         (a)   The user shall identify the pretreatment standards
applicable to each regulated process if the user is a categorical user;



         (b)   All samples shall be representative of daily
operations;



         (c)   A minimum of four grab samples, if required, must
be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide and volatile
organics. For all other pollutants required, 24-hour composite samples must
be obtained through flow-proportional composite sampling techniques where
feasible. The WRA Director may waive flow-proportional composite sampling for
any user who demonstrates that flow-proportional sampling is not feasible. In
these cases, samples may be obtained through time-proportional techniques or
through a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that the
sampling will provide a representative sample of the effluent being
discharged;



         (d)   Where the flow of the stream being sampled is less
than or equal to 250,000 gallons per day, the user must analyze three samples
within a two-week period. Where the flow of the stream being sampled is
greater than 250,000 gallons per day, the user must analyze six samples
within a two-week period;



         (e)   Samples must be taken immediately downstream from
pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately downstream from the
regulated process if no pretreatment exists and prior to mixing with other
waste. If non-regulated wastewater is mixed with regulated wastewater prior
to pretreatment, the user must measure the flows and concentrations necessary
to allow use of the combined waste stream formula of 40 C.F.R. § 403.6(e) in
order to evaluate compliance with pretreatment standards. Where an alternate
concentrations or mass limit has been calculated in accordance with 40 C.F.R.
§ 403.6(e), this adjusted limit along with supporting data shall be
submitted to the WRA Director. Users not subject to categorical standards
shall submit analysis of wastewater representative of the effluent discharged
to the POTW;



         (f)   The WRA Director may allow the submission of an
application which utilizes only historical data so long as the data provides
information sufficient to determine the need for pretreatment; and



         (g)   A statement indicating the time, date and place of
sampling, methods of analysis and certifying that the sampling and analysis
is representative of normal work cycles and expected pollutant discharges to
the POTW shall accompany each application/baseline monitoring report unless
the sampling and analysis was performed by the city.



      (5)   Time and duration of all discharges;



      (6)   Daily maximum, daily average and monthly average
wastewater flow rates, including daily, monthly and seasonal variations, if
any;

plans and details to show all sewers, floor drains and appurtenances by size,
location and elevation. The plans shall include a schematic process diagram
which indicates all points of discharge to the POTW. All plans must be
certified for accuracy by a professional engineer registered in the state;



      (9)   Each product produced by type, amount, process and rate
of production;



      (10)   Type and amount of raw materials processed (average and
maximum per day);



      (11)   Number and type of employees and hours of operation and
proposed or actual hours of operation of the pretreatment facility;



      (12)   A statement, reviewed by an authorized representative
of the user, as defined in § 52.001, and certified to by a professional
engineer registered in the state, indicating whether pretreatment standards
are being met on a consistent basis and if not whether additional operation
and maintenance or additional pretreatment is required for the user to meet
pretreatment standards and requirements;



      (13)   If additional pretreatment or O & M will be required to
meet pretreatment standards or requirements, the user shall supply a
compliance schedule indicating the shortest time schedule necessary to
accomplish installation or adoption of additional pretreatment or O & M. The
completion date in this schedule shall not be longer than the compliance date
established for the applicable pretreatment standard. The following
conditions apply to this schedule:



         (a)   The schedule shall contain increments of progress
in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events
leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required
for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards. This schedule
shall include, where applicable, but shall not be limited to, dates for the
hiring of an engineer, completing preliminary plans, executing contracts for
major components, commencing construction, beginning operation and conducting
routine operations;



         (b)   No increment referred to in division (A)(13)(a)
above shall exceed nine months, nor shall the total compliance period exceed
18 months; and



         (c)   No later than 14 days following each date in the
schedule and the final date for compliance, the user shall submit a progress
report to the WRA Director, including, as a minimum, whether or not it
complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay and if
appropriate the steps being taken by the user to return to the established
schedule. In no event shall more than nine months elapse between progress
reports to the WRA Director.



      (14)   If additional pretreatment and/or operation and
maintenance will be required to meet the limits on discharge into the POTW
set forth in §§ 52.010, 52.011, 52.012 or any other limits set by the WRA
Director, a plan shall be provided by the user giving the shortest schedule
by which the user will provide the needed equipment, operation or maintenance
changes and additions to meet those limits. The completion date in this
schedule shall not be later than the compliance date established for the
national categorical pretreatment standards. For a compliance schedule for
meeting national categorical pretreatment standards, the following condition
shall apply:



         (a)   The schedule shall contain increments of progress
in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events

§ 52.032  PERIODIC COMPLIANCE REPORTS.



    Under this chapter, periodic compliance reports are required as
follows.



   (A)   Significant users shall submit to the WRA Director, during the
months of January and July, a report indicating the nature, concentration and
flow of pollutants in the effluent, which are limited by permit or
pretreatment standards for the preceding six-month period. This report shall
include a record of the monthly average flows and the daily flow for each
analysis date during the reporting period. At the discretion of the WRA
Director and in consideration of those factors as local high or low flow
rates, holidays, budget cycles and the like, the WRA Director may agree to
alter the months during which the reports are to be submitted. More frequent
reports may be required by the WRA Director.



   (B)   The WRA Director may impose mass limitations on users. In
these cases, the report required by division (A) above shall indicate the
mass of pollutants regulated by pretreatment standards in the effluent of the
user. All analyses shall be performed using Environmental Protection Agency
approved methods using sampling techniques approved by the State Department
of Natural Resources.



   (C)   Users shall meet the certification and signatory requirements
in § 52.033 for each report submitted under this section. Where the WRA
itself collects all the information required for the report, including flow
data, the industrial user will not be required to submit a periodic
compliance report.



   (D)   A user must notify the WRA Director of all violations
identified as a result of self-monitoring to the POTW by telephone, during
normal business hours, within 24 hours of the time the user becomes aware of
the violation. The user must also submit the results of repeat analyses to
the WRA within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation, together with a
complete report on all steps taken to resolve the violation. The user need
not repeat the analyses if:



      (1)   The WRA performs sampling of the industrial user at a
frequency of at least once per month; or



      (2)   The WRA performs sampling of the user between the time
when the user performs its initial sampling and the time when the user
receives the results of this sampling.



   (E)   A user who monitors any pollutant more frequently than
required by the WRA or who self-monitors in addition to WRA monitoring, using
Environmental Protection Agency methods or standard methods, shall report the
monitoring results to the WRA Director in accordance with divisions (A), (C)
and (D) above.



(Ord. 2010-09, passed 7-13-2010; Am. Ord. 2019-03, passed 2-26-2019)



§ 52.033  CERTIFICATION AND SIGNATORY REQUIREMENTS.



    (A)   All applications or reports submitted by a user pursuant to
this chapter shall contain the following certification statement:



      “I certify under penalty of law that this document and all
attachments were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance
with a system designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and
evaluate the information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or
persons who manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for
gathering the information, the information submitted is, to the best of my
knowledge and belief, true, accurate and complete. I am aware that there are
significant penalties for submitting false information, including the
possibility of fine and imprisonment for knowing violations.”



   (B)   All applications and reports shall be signed by an authorized
representative of the user as defined in § 52.001. A user shall maintain a
current and accurate authorization on file with the WRA Director.

§ 52.034  MONITORING FACILITIES.



    (A)   When required by the WRA Director pursuant to this chapter,
each permitted user shall at its expense provide and operate monitoring
facilities to allow inspection, sampling and flow measurement of the building
sewer or internal drainage systems. The WRA Director may require the
placement of the monitoring facilities at the end of each process where
pollutants are used, produced or treated. The monitoring facility should
normally be situated on the user's premises and located so that it will not
be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles.



   (B)   When required by the wastewater discharge permit and within 90
days of written notification, a user shall install a sampling chamber for
each separate discharge of the building sewer in accordance with plans and
specification approved by the WRA Director. A user shall provide ample room
in or near the sampling chamber to allow accurate sampling and preparation of
samples for analysis. Each user shall at its expense maintain all sampling
and measuring equipment in a safe and proper operating condition at all
times, which equipment shall be safely, easily and independently accessible
to authorized representatives of the WRA. Users shall certify all flow
measuring devices to be in proper working condition at a frequency specified
in the permit or in writing by the WRA Director, using a qualified technician
acceptable to the WRA Director. Sampling shall be in accordance with the
following.



      (1)   Each sampling chamber shall contain a flume unless
another device is approved by the WRA Director, with a recording and
totalizing device for measurement of the liquid quantity.



      (2)   At the discretion of the WRA Director, metered water
supply to a user may be used as the volume quantity where it is substantiated
that the metered water supply and waste quantities are approximately the
same, or where a measurable adjustment agreed to by the Director is made in
the metered water supply to determine the liquid waste quantity. Separate
meters may be used to subtract water, which is not discharged to the POTW or
is discharged to a sewer other than the sampled location.



      (3)   Samples shall be taken at a frequency and volume
determined by the WRA Director and shall be properly refrigerated and
preserved in accordance with Environmental Protection Agency approved
methods. The sample shall be composited in proportion to the flow for a
representative 24-hour sample. A time proportioned 24-hour sample may be used
if flow proportioned sampling is determined by the WRA Director to be
impractical. Grab samples shall be used where appropriate.



   (C)   A user must inform the WRA Director prior to breaking a
sampler seal, used by the WRA to detect sample tampering, unless necessary to
prevent loss of life, personal injury or severe property damage. A user shall
not place additional seals or locks upon a sampler, which may be used by the
WRA without first obtaining approval from the WRA Director.

§ 52.035  INSPECTION, SAMPLING AND RECORD KEEPING AUTHORITY.



    Under this division, users shall be deemed to have given the following
authorities to the WRA and its operating contractor:



   (A)   Users shall permit authorized representatives or agents of the
WRA to enter upon all properties and all parts of the premises, or upon
properties of users with wastewater discharge permits, for the purposes of
inspection, sampling, records examination, records copying, or the
performance of any of their duties. This shall include the right to set up,
on the user's property, such devices as are necessary to conduct sampling,
inspection, compliance monitoring, or metering operations as may be required
in pursuance of the implementation and enforcement of this article.



   (B)   Where a user has security measures in force which would
require proper identification and clearance before entry into the premises,
the user shall make necessary arrangements in the security measures so that,
upon presentation of suitable identification, WRA or operating contractor
personnel will be permitted to enter, without delay, for the purposes of
performing their specific responsibilities.



   (C)   All users subject to any of the reporting requirements of this
article shall maintain copies of reports and records of all information as
required in 40 CFR 403.12(o) resulting from any monitoring activities
required by this article for a minimum of three years and shall make such
records available for inspection and copying by the WRA and its operating
contractor. This period of retention shall be extended until the completion
of any unresolved negotiation, hearing, or litigation involving a purported
violation.

§ 52.036  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.



    A)   Except as provided in this section, documents, data and
information obtained from user reports, questionnaires, permit applications
and inspections pursuant to this chapter shall be made available to the
public or other governmental agencies without restriction. If the user
specifically requests and is able to demonstrate that the release of the
information would divulge information concerning processes or methods of
production entitled to protection under law as trade secrets of the user or
would give advantage to competitors and serve no public purpose, the WRA
Director may determine that the information should be kept confidential and
not made available for public examination, but the information shall be
available to the United States Environmental Protection Agency or the State
Department of Natural Resources.



   (B)   Decisions by the WRA Director to deny confidential status for
information may be appealed using the procedures in § 52.037. In determining
whether information is confidential, the provisions of Iowa Code Chapter 22
shall prevail.



   (C)   Effluent data and enforcement actions by the WRA or its
operating contractor will not be considered confidential records or
information.

the WRA Director shall make a determination with respect to the
confidentiality of the information or data at issue. The WRA Director shall
notify the parties, in writing, of the WRA Director's decision within seven
days after receipt of the appeal.



   (C)   If still aggrieved by the WRA Director's determination on
appeal, a party may file an action in Polk County District Court, seeking a
declaratory ruling with respect to the confidentiality of the documents, data
and information, or seeking an injunction to prevent the disclosure of the
same.



   (D)   During the pendency of an appeal to the WRA Director, the
documents, data or information at issue shall be kept confidential. However,
if during the pendency of the appeal, a request for examination or copying of
the documents, data or information is made of the WRA or its operating
contractor pursuant to Iowa Code Chapter 22, the WRA or its operating
contractor will notify the appealing party of the request for disclosure and
will keep confidential the requested documents, data or information, pending
action by the appealing party to defend its confidentiality request. In the
notification, the appealing party requesting confidentiality will be given
not more than five calendar days within which to file suit in Polk County
District Court seeking the entry of a declaratory order and/or injunction to
protect and keep confidential the documents, data or information. If the
appealing party fails to initiate suit within the time requested, the WRA
Director shall release the documents, data or informational issue for public
examination.



   (E)   If during the pendency of the appeal, a lawsuit is initialed
pursuant to Iowa Code Chapter 22 seeking the release of the documents, data
or information, the appealing party shall take action to defend its
confidentiality request in the lawsuit. If the appealing party fails to
defend its confidentiality request in the suit, the WRA Director shall
release the documents, data or information at issue for public examination.

         (b)   Technical review criteria (TRC) violations.
Thirty-three percent or more of the measurements exceed the same daily
maximum limit or the same average limit by more than the TRC in a six-month
period, (e.g., limit x TRC = the point at which a violation becomes a TRC
violation). There are two groups of TRCs as follow:



 


Group I for conventional pollutants (BOD, TSS, FOG)

 
TRC = 1.4


Group II for all other pollutants
 
TRC = 1.2



 



         (c)   Wastewater discharge permit limit. Any other
violation of a wastewater discharge permit limit (average or daily maximum)
that the WRA Director believes has caused, alone or in combination with other
discharges, interference, including slug loads or pass through or which
endangers the health of city, sanitary sewer district, WRA or operating
contractor personnel or the public; and



         (d)   Discharge of a pollutant. Any discharge of a
pollutant that has caused imminent endangerment to human health/welfare or to
the environment and has resulted in the WRA's exercise of its emergency
authority to halt or prevent a discharge.



      (2)   Violations of compliance schedule milestones, contained
in a wastewater discharge permit or enforcement order, for starting
construction, completing construction or attaining final compliance by 90
days or more after the schedule date;



      (3)   Failure to provide reports for compliance schedules,
self-monitoring data or any other report required by the WRA within 45 days
from the due date;



      (4)   Failure to accurately report noncompliance; and



      (5)   Any other violation or group of violations, which may
include a violation of best management practices that the WRA Director
considers to be significant.



   (B)   When a user is in significant noncompliance, the WRA Director
is directed to:



      (1)   Report the information to the State Department of
Natural Resources as part of the annual pretreatment performance summary of
permitted user noncompliance;



      (2)   Include the user in the annual public notification
according to § 52.038; and



      (3)   Address significant noncompliance through appropriate

magnitude and impact of the violation upon the POTW. The notice may also
include the following:



      (1)   An order requiring a plan of action for preventing
reoccurrence of the violation;



      (2)   An order requiring specific action for accomplishing
remediation; and



      (3)   An order requiring the user to respond in writing within
30 days.



   (B)   The WRA Director is empowered to enter into consent orders,
assurances of voluntary compliance or other similar documents establishing an
agreement with the user responsible for any noncompliance. These orders will
include specific action to be taken by the user to correct noncompliance
within a time period specified by the order.



   (C)   The WRA Director may issue enforceable orders or schedules to

      (10)   Failure to obtain a wastewater discharge permit as
required by this article after notification by the WRA director that such
permit is required.



   (B)   Procedure for revocation of discharge permit and for
termination of sewer service. The procedure for revocation of a discharge
permit and termination of sewer service shall be as follows:



      (1)   Any permit issued to a user pursuant to this article may
be revoked, and sewer service terminated, by written order of the WRA
Director, specifying the grounds for such revocation and termination as
outlined in division (A) of this section, which order shall not take effect
until hearing thereon as hereafter provided. Upon determining that grounds
exist for an order to revoke a user's discharge permit and terminate sewer
service, the WRA Director shall cause a notice of hearing to be prepared,
specifying the violations of division (A) of this section which are deemed to
have occurred, and the time, date and place that such hearing will be held.
The notice shall be sent to the user by regular mail addressed to the user's
address listed on the wastewater discharge permit a minimum of ten days prior
to the date set for hearing, and shall be deemed delivered when placed in the
mail.



      (2)   Sewer service may be terminated by written order of the
WRA Director, specifying the grounds for such revocation and termination as
outlined in division (A)(10) of this section, which order shall not take
effect until hearing thereon as hereafter provided. Upon determining that
grounds exist for an order to terminate sewer service, the WRA Director shall
cause a notice of hearing to be prepared, specifying the violation of
division (A)(10) of this section which is deemed to have occurred, and the
time, date and place that such hearing will be held. The notice shall be sent
to the user by regular mail addressed to the user's address a minimum of ten
days prior to the date set for hearing, and shall be deemed delivered when

based on substantial evidence that violations under division (A) of this
section have occurred as alleged, the director may issue an order immediately
revoking the permit, if a permit had previously been issued, and terminating
sewer service to the user's premises. The determination to revoke such permit
and terminate service, shall be in the discretion of WRA Director and shall
be dependent upon the circumstances surrounding the user's violations of
division (A) of this section and the severity of those violations. If the
user does not appear for the hearing, the WRA Director shall issue the order
revoking the discharge permit and/or terminating sewer service, which shall
take effect immediately.



      (4)   (a)   The decision and order of the WRA Director to
revoke the permit of a user may be appealed to the WRA Appeal Committee. Such
appeal request shall be in writing, shall include the grounds for appeal

or trap into the city sanitary sewer system. Interceptors and traps shall be
cleaned at three month intervals or less. A longer cleaning interval must be
approved by the WRA Director.  If the owner or operator of the FSE, or an
employee of the owner or operator, has a current grease hauler certification
from the WRA indicating satisfactory completion of the course of training
offered by the WRA on the cleaning of grease interceptors and traps, such
person or persons may clean the grease trap in the facility included in such
grease hauler's certification Failure to adequately clean the grease trap,
properly dispose of all grease trap waste, or maintain clean out records and
measurements may result in revocation of a grease hauler certification
pursuant to § 52.102. Alternatively, the owner or operator of an FSE may
employ a waste hauler licensed by the WRA pursuant to this chapter to clean
the grease interceptor or trap, provided that the waste hauler personnel
performing the cleaning has a current grease hauler certification from the
WRA indicating satisfactory completion of the course of training offered by
the WRA on the cleaning of grease interceptors and traps.

§ 52.099  TREATMENT FEES FOR HAULED WASTES.



    (A)   (1)   A treatment fee shall be charged per pound of hauled
waste received at the WRF for all wastes originating within WRA participating
communities which are treated through the headworks at the WRF using all
treatment processes at the WRF, which fee shall be equal to the cost of
disposal and treatment of an equivalent volume and mass of pollutants
otherwise delivered into the POTW. The treatment fee shall include:



         (a)   The volume charge component;



         (b)   A treatment surcharge component for each pollutant
as found in § 52.020 of this chapter; and



         (c)   A program cost component.



      (2)   The program cost component shall be calculated by
dividing the annual administrative costs of the waste hauler program by the
total gallons of hauled waste treated in the previous calendar year. The
surcharge component shall be calculated using the average concentration of
pollutants found in hauled wastes delivered to the wastewater reclamation
facility. The treatment surcharge and program cost components shall be
reviewed and updated annually based on the most recent data collected by the
operating agency. The treatment fee for loads originating outside the
corporate limits of the WRA participating communities shall be one and
one-half times the fee for loads originating within the WRA participating
communities.



   (B)   (1)   A treatment fee shall be charged for hauled wastes
originating within the corporate limits of the WRA participating communities
which are treated using only a portion of the treatment processes at the WRF,
which fee shall be calculated to recover the cost of treatment. The cost of
treatment shall include electrical, chemical, personnel and any capital costs
associated with the treatment processes utilized, and a program cost
component which shall be calculated by dividing the annual administrative
costs of the waste hauler program associated with partial process treatment
by the total gallons of hauled waste treated using only a portion of the
treatment processes in the previous calendar year.



      (2)   Treatment costs shall be reviewed and updated annually
based on the most recent data collected by the operating agency.



      (3)   The treatment fee for loads originating outside the
corporate limits of the WRA participating communities shall be one and
one-half times the fee for loads originating within the WRA participating
communities.



   (C)   Fees shall be computed and recorded at the disposal station
and shall be paid by the waste hauler on the basis of monthly billings by the
operating contractor. Limits of credit shall not exceed 60 days. Abuse of the
credit shall be grounds for liability on the waste hauler's bond and for
refusal of disposal services to any waste hauler under this chapter.



   (D)   Waste haulers may elect to have their loads tested for actual
concentration at their expense as set out in § 52.020. When a waste hauler
has elected to have loads tested for actual concentration, the treatment fee
will be based on the actual concentration whether it be higher or lower than
the average concentration treatment fee. Testing will be done at least once a
month or more often as required by the WRA Director.

§ 54.01  PURPOSE.



   (A)   The United States EPA’s national pollutant discharge
elimination system (NPDES) permit program administered by the State
Department of Natural Resources (IDNR) requires that cities meeting certain
demographic and environmental impact criteria obtain from the IDNR an NPDES
permit for the discharge of stormwater from a municipal separate storm sewer
system (MS4) (MS4 permit). The city is subject to the program and is required
to obtain, and has obtained, an MS4 permit. The city’s MS4 permit is on
file at the office of the City Clerk and is available for public inspection
during regular office hours.



   (B)   The program requires certain individuals engaged in
construction activities (applicant or applicants) to submit an application to
the IDNR for a state NPDES general permit #2. Notwithstanding any provision
of this chapter, every applicant bears final and complete responsibility for
compliance with a state NPDES general permit #2 and any other requirement of
state or federal law or administrative rule.



   (C)   As a condition of the city’s MS4 permit, the city will
perform periodic monitoring and primary enforcement of the program by
adopting a construction site erosion and sediment control ordinance (COSESCO)
designed to achieve the following objectives:



      (1)   Any person, firm, sole proprietorship, partnership,
corporation, state agency or political subdivision (“applicant”) required
by law or administrative rule to apply to the:



         (a)   IDNR for a state NPDES general permit #2 shall be
subject to the terms of the COSESCO; and



         (b)   The city for a building permit for new
construction and/or a commercial addition shall be subject to the terms of
the COSESCO.



      (2)   The city will perform periodic monitoring and initiate
enforcement procedures when appropriate to promote applicants’ compliance
with city ordinances and state and federal laws regulating stormwater.



   (D)   No state or federal funds have been made available to assist
the city with monitoring and/or enforcing the program. Accordingly, the city
shall fund its monitoring and enforcement responsibilities entirely by fees
imposed on the owners of properties or applicants of permits which are made
subject to the program by virtue of state and federal law and/or other
sources of funding established by a separate ordinance.



   (E)   Terms used in this chapter shall have the meanings specified
in the program.

permit #2:



         (a)   Submit to the city a copy of the site plan
prepared by the applicant to meet the requirements of the state NPDES general
permit #2. The site plan shall show best management practices (BMP) control
measures and a stormwater pollution prevention plan (SWPPP) applicable to the
site;



         (b)   Submit a copy of the applicant’s authorizations
issued pursuant to applicant’s state NPDES general permit #2; and



         (c)   Every SWPPP submitted to the city shall:



            1.   Comply with all existing requirements for
SWPPPs promulgated by the IDNR in connection with issuance of a state NPDES
general permit #2;



            2.   If the applicant is required by law to file a
joint application form protecting state waters, State Department of Natural
Resources and United States Army Corps of Engineers, comply with all
mandatory minimum requirements pertaining to those applicants; and



            3.   Comply with all other applicable state or
federal permit requirements in existence at the time of application
including, but not limited to, waste at construction sites that may cause
adverse impact to water quality such as building materials, concrete truck
washout, chemicals, solid waste and sanitary waste.



      (2)   If the applicant is applying for a city building permit,
submit to the city a completed and correct construction site erosion and
sediment control form.



   (C)   All construction sites shall be furnished with a stabilized
construction site entrance to handle the type and frequency of the traffic
entering and exiting the site or make use of some other method designed to
prevent off-site tracking. All construction sites shall have erosion control
measures (multiple measures may be needed, depending on the site conditions)
in place at all locations where stormwater flows from the construction site.
Any soils tracked off-site shall be cleaned up by the applicant at the end of
each day or before sediments enter the public storm sewer or waters of the
state. Any soils entering public storm sewer or waters of the state will be
considered a violation of this chapter.

CHAPTER 55:  POST-CONSTRUCTION STORMWATER MANAGEMENT



Section



   55.01   Findings



   55.02   Procedure for post-construction



   55.03   Maintenance and repair of stormwater facilities



 



   55.99   Penalty



§ 55.01  FINDINGS.



   (A)   The United States EPA’s national pollutant discharge
elimination system (“NPDES”) permit program administered by the State
Department of Natural Resources (“IDNR”) requires that cities meeting
certain demographic and environmental impact criteria obtain from the IDNR an
NPDES permit for the discharge of stormwater from a municipal separate storm
sewer system (MS4). The city’s MS4 permit is on file at the office of the
City Clerk and is available for public inspection during regular office hours.



   (B)   As a condition of the city’s MS4 permit, the city is obliged
to develop, implement and enforce a program to address stormwater runoff from
new construction and reconstruction projects for which the State NPDES
general permit #2 stormwater permit coverage is required by adopting a
post-construction stormwater management ordinance designed to:



      (1)   Require water quality and quantity components be
considered in the design of new construction and implemented when practical;



      (2)   Promote the use of stormwater detention and retention,
grass swales, buffer strips and proper operation and maintenance of these
facilities;



      (3)   Allow use of bio-retention swales and riparian buffers
where practical and the soils and topography are suitable to ensure these
measures will be effective in accomplishing the purpose of this chapter;



      (4)   Prohibit construction activities from commencing until
the plans for post-construction runoff controls have been submitted to the
city; and



      (5)   Allow the city to have the ability to access private
property for the purpose of enforcement procedures to promote compliance with
the state NPDES general permits #2 which require post-construction compliance
by applicants.



   (C)   No state or federal funds have been made available to assist
the city with inspections, monitoring and/or enforcing the program.
Accordingly, the city shall fund its inspection, monitoring and enforcement
responsibilities entirely by fees imposed on the owners of properties which
are made subject to the program by virtue of state and federal law and/or
other sources of funding established by a separate ordinance.



   (D)   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definition
shall apply unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different
meaning.



      APPLICANT.  Any person, firm or entity applying for a permit to
develop, grade or construct within the corporate limits of the city.



(Ord. 2007-18, passed 9-25-2007)



§ 55.02  PROCEDURE FOR POST-CONSTRUCTION.



   (A)   Each applicant who is required to have coverage under general
permit #2 for a site shall install post-construction stormwater management
facilities as set forth herein and as approved by the city during site plan,
platting or construction plans.



   (B)   Each applicant or its successor person(s) or entity shall be
responsible for maintaining all stormwater management facilities as approved
by the city.



   (C)   For sites equal to or greater than one acre, each applicant
must provide to the city as-built plans detailing dimensions and elevations
as well as a certification that stormwater management facilities were built
as part of the approved development that includes the site. For sites less
than one acre that are part of a common plan of development and for which the
applicant establishes that stormwater management facilities were or will be
built to address all properties (either collectively or individually) within
the development, each applicant must provide to the city a copy of the notice
of discontinuation for general permit #2 applicable to the property.



   (D)   Each applicant must include in their site design those
stormwater management facilities that will convey drainage through the
property to one or more detention and/or treatment areas so that no
development shall cause downstream property owners, water courses, channels
or conduits to receive stormwater runoff from the proposed development site
at a peak flow rate greater than that allowed by the policy or standard in
effect at the time of approval of the development unless those requirements
are waived by the city. Nothing contained herein shall prohibit the city from
changing the policies or standards in the future, nor from requiring the site
to comply with the new requirements.



   (E)   Each applicant shall comply with all other applicable city,
state or federal permit requirements as they apply to the city or to the
property.



   (F)   At the discretion of the city, the applicant may satisfy the
post-construction stormwater management requirements by ensuring the
conveyance of the stormwater discharge from the property to a regional
detention facility. For purposes of this chapter, a regional detention
facility shall be wet or dry detention basins, which are designed to accept
stormwater runoff from two or more site that are required to obtain a state
NPDES general permit #2 and that otherwise complies with all city, state or
federal permit requirements as they apply to stormwater management
requirements for those sites.



(Ord. 2007-18, passed 9-25-2007)



§ 55.03  MAINTENANCE AND REPAIR OF STORMWATER FACILITIES.



   (A)   Prior to the issuance of any permit that has a stormwater
management facility as one of the requirements of the permit, the applicant
or owner of the site must execute a maintenance easement agreement that shall
be binding on all subsequent owners of land served by the stormwater
management facility. The agreement shall provide for access to the facility
at reasonable times for periodic inspection by the city, or its contractor or
agent, to ensure that the facility is maintained in proper working condition
to meet design standards and any other provisions established by this
chapter. The easement agreement shall be recorded by the city in the land
records.



   (B)   Maintenance of all stormwater management facilities shall be
ensured through the creation of a formal maintenance covenant that must be
approved by the city and recorded into the land record at the time of final
plat approval. As part of the covenant, a schedule shall be developed for
when and how often maintenance will occur to ensure proper function of the
stormwater management facility. The covenant shall also include plans for
periodic inspections by the applicant, owner or assigns to ensure proper
performance of the facility.



   (C)   The city shall be permitted to enter and inspect any property
subject to regulation under this section as often as is necessary to document
maintenance and repair needs and determine compliance with the requirements
of this chapter. If a responsible party owning, controlling or possessing a
property has security measures that require identification and clearance
before entry to its property, the responsible party shall make the necessary
arrangements to allow access by the city. By way of specification but not
limitation:



      (1)   A responsible party shall allow the city ready access to
all parts of the property for purposes of inspection, examination and copying
of records related to compliance with this chapter;



      (2)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction that obstructs
the safe and easy access to property to be inspected and shall be promptly
removed by the responsible party at the written or oral order of the city and
shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing the access shall be borne by the
responsible party; and



      (3)   An unreasonable delay in allowing the city access to a
property is a violation of this chapter.



   (D)   Parties responsible for the operation and maintenance of a
stormwater management facility shall make records of the installation and of
all maintenance and repairs, and shall retain the records for at least three
years. Copies of the as-built plans and records of all self inspections,
maintenance and repairs shall be kept on-site and shall be made available to
the city during inspection of the facility and at other reasonable times upon
request.



   (E)   In the event that a stormwater management facility is found by
the city to be noncompliant with the plans as submitted and approved or is
found to be in need of maintenance, the responsible party will be notified in
writing of the deficiencies. Upon receipt of the notice, the responsible
party shall have 15 days to correct the deficiencies. After proper notice,
and if the responsible party fails to make the repairs or perform the
maintenance, the city may have the work performed and assess the owner(s) of
the facility for the cost of repair work and any penalties; and the cost of
the work shall be a lien on the property, or prorated against the beneficial
users of the property, and may be placed on the tax bill and collected as
ordinary taxes by the city.

   Unless another penalty is expressly provided by this chapter for any
particular provision or section, any person(s) violating any provision of
this chapter or any rule or regulation adopted herein by reference shall be
subject to a civil penalty as set forth in the municipal infractions in

thereof in minimum amounts, as set by resolution by the City Council.

(1999 Code, § 80.01)



§ 76.02  AUTHORITY TO TAKE POSSESSION OF ABANDONED VEHICLES.



   A police authority, upon the authority’s own initiative or upon the
request of any other authority having the duties of control of highways or
traffic, shall take into custody an abandoned vehicle on public property and
may take into custody any abandoned vehicle on private property. A police
authority taking into custody an abandoned vehicle which has been determined
to create a traffic hazard shall report the reasons constituting the hazard
in writing to the appropriate authority having duties of control of the
highway. The police authority may employ its own personnel, equipment and
facilities or hire a private entity, equipment and facilities for the purpose
of removing, preserving, storing or disposing of abandoned vehicles. If a
police authority employs a private entity to dispose of abandoned vehicles,
the police authority shall provide the private entity with the names and
addresses of the registered owners, all lienholders of record and any other
known claimant to the vehicle or the personal property found in the vehicle.



(Iowa Code § 321.89(2))  (1999 Code, § 80.02)



§ 76.03  NOTICE BY MAIL.



   The police authority or private entity which takes into custody an
abandoned vehicle shall notify, within 20 days, by certified mail, the last
known registered owner of the vehicle, all lienholders of record and any
other known claimant to the vehicle or to personal property found in the
vehicle, addressed to their last known addresses of record, that the
abandoned vehicle has been taken into custody. Notice shall be deemed given
when mailed. The notice shall describe the year, make, model and serial
number of the vehicle, describe the personal property found in the vehicle,
set forth the location of the facility where the vehicle is being held, and
inform the persons receiving the notice of their right to reclaim the vehicle
and personal property within ten days after the effective date of the notice
upon payment of all towing, preservation and storage charges resulting from
placing the vehicle in custody and upon payment of the costs of the notice.
The notice shall also state that the failure of the owner, lienholders or
claimants to exercise their right to reclaim the vehicle or personal property
within the time provided shall be deemed a waiver by the owner, lienholders
and claimants of all right, title, claim and interest in the vehicle or
personal property and that failure to reclaim the vehicle or personal
property is deemed consent to the sale of the vehicle at a public auction or
disposal of the vehicle to a demolisher and to disposal of the personal
property by sale or destruction. The notice shall state that any person
claiming rightful possession of the vehicle or personal property who disputes
the planned disposition of the vehicle or property by the police authority or
private entity or of the assessment of fees and charges provided by this
section may ask for an evidentiary hearing before the police authority to
contest those matters. If the persons receiving the notice do not ask for a
hearing or exercise their right to reclaim the vehicle or personal property
within the ten-day reclaiming period, the owner, lienholders or claimants
shall no longer have any right, title, claim or interest in or to the vehicle
or the personal property. A court in any case in law or equity shall not
recognize any right, title, claim or interest of the owner, lienholders or
claimants after the expiration of the ten-day reclaiming period.



(Iowa Code § 321.89(3a))  (1999 Code, § 80.03)



§ 76.04  NOTIFICATION IN NEWSPAPER.



   If the identity of the last registered owner cannot be determined, or
if the registration contains no address for the owner, or if it is impossible
to determine with reasonable certainty the identity and addresses of all
lienholders, notice by one publication in one newspaper of general
circulation in the area where the vehicle was abandoned shall be sufficient
to meet all requirements of notice under § 76.03. The published notice may
contain multiple listings of abandoned vehicles and personal property but
shall be published within the same time requirements and contain the same
information as prescribed for mailed notice in § 76.03.



(Iowa Code § 321.89(3b))  (1999 Code, § 80.04)



§ 76.05  EXTENSION OF TIME.



   The owner, lienholders or claimants may, by written request delivered
to the police authority or private entity prior to the expiration of the
ten-day reclaiming period, obtain an additional five days within which the
motor vehicle or personal property may be reclaimed.



(Iowa Code § 321.89(3c))  (1999 Code, § 80.05)



§ 76.06  FEES FOR IMPOUNDMENT.



   The owner or lienholder shall pay an impoundment fee, as set per city
resolution, per day if stored by the city, or towing and storage fees, if
stored in a public garage, whereupon the vehicle shall be released. At least
once each year, the Council may take bids from privately-owned garages for
schedules of fees for towing and storing impounded vehicles or vehicles taken
up because of being illegally parked. Thereupon, the Council shall designate
such of the bidders as are geographically located to tow and store the
vehicles at a minimum cost in the event city facilities are not available for
towing or storing vehicles to be impounded. The Police Chief is hereby
authorized to direct the public garage designated by the Council as aforesaid
and located nearest to the vehicle to tow and store the same until disposed
of as provided in this section. The garage is hereby authorized to retain the
vehicles until the fees for towing and storage, on the basis of the bid, are
paid.



(1999 Code, § 80.06)



§ 76.07  DISPOSAL OF ABANDONED VEHICLES.



   If an abandoned vehicle has not been reclaimed as provided herein, the
police authority or private entity shall make a determination as to whether
or not the motor vehicle should be sold for use upon the highways, and shall
dispose of the motor vehicle in accordance with state law.



(Iowa Code § 321.89(4))  (1999 Code, § 80.07)



§ 76.08  DISPOSAL OF TOTALLY INOPERABLE VEHICLES.



   The city or any person upon whose property or in whose possession is
found any abandoned motor vehicle, or any person being the owner of a motor
vehicle whose title certificate is faulty, lost or destroyed, may dispose of
the motor vehicle to a demolisher for junk, without a title and without
notification procedures, if the motor vehicle lacks an engine or two or more
wheels or other structural part which renders the vehicle totally inoperable.
The police authority shall give the applicant a certificate of authority. The
applicant shall then apply to the County Treasurer for a junking certificate
and shall surrender the certificate of authority in lieu of the certificate
of title.



(Iowa Code § 321.90(2e))  (1999 Code, § 80.08)



§ 76.09  PROCEEDS FROM SALES.



   Proceeds from the sale of any abandoned vehicle shall be applied to the
expense of auction, cost of towing, preserving, storing and notification
required, in accordance with state law. Any balance shall be held for the
owner of the motor vehicle or entitled lienholder for 90 days, and then shall
be deposited in the State Road Use Tax Fund. Where the sale of any vehicle
fails to realize the amount necessary to meet costs, the police authority
shall apply for reimbursement from the Department of Transportation.



(Iowa Code § 321.89(4))  (1999 Code, § 80.09)



§ 76.10  DUTIES OF DEMOLISHER.



   Any demolisher who purchases or otherwise acquires an abandoned motor
vehicle for junk shall junk, scrap, wreck, dismantle or otherwise demolish
the motor vehicle. A demolisher shall not junk, scrap, wreck, dismantle or
demolish a vehicle until the demolisher has obtained the junking certificate
issued for the vehicle.

§ 90.05  SEIZURE, IMPOUNDMENT AND DISPOSITION OF DANGEROUS ANIMALS.



   (A)   In the event that a dangerous animal is found at large and
unattended upon public property, park property, public right-of-way or the
property of someone other than its owner, thereby creating a hazard to person
or property, such animal may, in the discretion of the animal control officer
or the Chief of Police, be destroyed if it cannot be confined or captured.
The city shall be under no duty to attempt the confinement or capture of a
dangerous animal found at large, nor shall it have a duty to notify the owner
of such animal prior to its destruction.



   (B)   Upon the written complaint of any individual that a person is
keeping, sheltering or harboring a dangerous animal on premises located in
the city, the animal control officer shall cause the matter to be
investigated and, if after investigation, the facts indicate that the person
named in the complaint is keeping, sheltering or harboring a dangerous animal
in the city, the animal control officer shall order the person named in the
complaint to permanently place the animal with an organization or group
allowed under § 90.04 of this chapter to possess dangerous animals, or
destroy the animal, within three business days of the receipt of such order.
Such order shall be contained in a notice, which shall be given in writing to
the person keeping, sheltering or harboring the dangerous animal, and shall
be served personally or by certified mail. Such order and notice shall not be
required where such dangerous animal has previously caused serious physical
harm or death to any person, in which case the animal control officer shall
cause the animal to be immediately seized and impounded or killed if seizure
and impoundment are not possible without risk of serious physical harm or
death to any person.



   (C)   The order issued by the animal control officer may be appealed
to the City Council. In order to appeal such order, written notice of appeal
must be filed with the City Clerk within three business days after receipt of
the order. Failure to file such written notice of appeal shall constitute a
waiver of right to appeal the order of the animal control officer.



   (D)   The notice of appeal shall state the grounds for such appeal
and shall be delivered personally or by certified mail to the City Clerk. The
hearing of such appeal shall be scheduled within 14 business days of the
receipt of notice of appeal. After such hearing, the City Council may affirm
or reverse the order of the animal control officer. Such determination shall
be contained in a written decision and shall be filed with the City Clerk
within three business days after the hearing, or any continued sessions
thereof.



   (E)   If the City Council affirms the action of the animal control
officer, the Council shall order in its written decision that the individual
or entity owning, sheltering, harboring or keeping such dangerous animal,
permanently place such animal with an organization or group allowed under §
90.04 of this chapter to possess dangerous animals, or destroy it. The
decision and order shall immediately be served upon the person or entity
against whom rendered in the same manner as the notice. If the original order
of the animal control officer is not appealed and is not complied with within
three business days, or the order of the City Council after appeal is not
complied with within three business days of its issuance, the animal control
officer is authorized to seize and impound such dangerous animal. An animal
so seized shall be impounded for a period of seven calendar days. If, at the
end of the impoundment period, the individual or entity against whom the
decision and order of the City Council was issued has not petitioned the
district court for a review of said order, the city shall cause the animal to
be disposed of by sale, permanently place such animal with an organization or
group allowed under § 90.04 of this chapter to possess dangerous animals, or
destroy such animal in a humane manner. Failure to comply with an order of
the city issued pursuant hereto shall constitute a simple misdemeanor and is
also punishable pursuant to this code.



(Ord. 2012-02, passed 2-7-2012)



§ 90.06  KEEPING OF VICIOUS ANIMALS PROHIBITED; VICIOUS DOGS.



   (A)   No person shall keep, shelter or harbor for any reason within
the city a “vicious animal” so defined herein, except as otherwise
provided in this chapter. Once an animal has been deemed a vicious animal,
the animal shall not be removed from the city and transferred to another city.



   (B)   Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, no person
owning, possessing, harboring or having the care of a vicious dog shall
permit such animal to go unconfined upon the premises unless the dog is
securely leashed and muzzled.



      (1)   For the purpose of this section, a VICIOUS DOG means:



         (a)   Any animal whose behavior constitutes a physical
threat of bodily harm to a person in a place where such person is conducting
himself or herself peacefully and lawfully. For the purposes of this division
(B), a person is peaceably and lawfully upon the private property of an owner
or possessor of an animal when he or she is on such property in the
performance of any duty imposed by the laws of the jurisdiction or when he or
she is on such property upon invitation, express or implied;



         (b)   Any animal involved in an attack which requires
defensive action by any person to prevent bodily injury and/or property
damage in a place where such person is conducting himself or herself
peacefully and lawfully;



         (c)   Any animal involved in an attack on another animal
or livestock which occurs off the property of the owner of the attacking
animal;



         (d)   Any animal which, in a threatening or terrorizing
manner, in an attitude of attack, approaches any person upon the streets,
sidewalks or any public grounds;



         (e)   Any animal with a known propensity, tendency or
disposition to attack, to cause injury or to otherwise threaten the safety of
human beings or domestic animals;



         (f)   Any animal which has attacked a human being or a
domestic animal on any occasion causing bodily injury or death;



         (g)   Any animal owned or harbored primarily or in part
for the purpose of fighting or any animal trained for fighting; and/or



         (h)   Any animal that has been trained, tormented,
badgered, baited or used for the purpose of causing or encouraging the animal
to attack humans or domestic animals.



      (2)   An animal shall not be deemed vicious if it bites,
attacks or menaces:



         (a)   Anyone assaulting its owner;



         (b)   A trespasser on the property of its owner;



         (c)   A person who has tormented, teased, abused or
assaulted it. If a minor was under the age of seven at the time the dog
injured such minor, it shall be rebuttably presumed that the minor was not
committing a trespass or other tort such as teasing, tormenting or abusing
the dog; and



         (d)   In the defense of any human being within the
immediate vicinity who was being attacked or assaulted.



      (3)   An animal shall not be deemed vicious if it is assisting
a peace officer engaged in law enforcement duties.



      (4)   A vicious dog is UNCONFINED unless such dog is:



         (a)   Securely confined in a dwelling house. An animal
is not securely confined in a house if it is kept on a porch, patio or in any
part of a house or building that would allow the dog to exit such structure
on its own volition. In addition, no such animal is securely confined in a
house where the windows are open or when screened windows or screened doors
are the only obstacles preventing the dog from exiting the structure and
running at large;



         (b)   Securely enclosed in a locked pen or kennel,
except when secured within a dwelling house or leashed and muzzled as
provided below. The pen or kennel must have secure sides and a secure top.
The walls must be at least six feet high. In the absence of a secure top, the
walls must be at least six feet taller than any internal structure (such as a
dog house);



         (c)   All pens or other structures used to confine
vicious dogs must be locked with a key or combination lock when the animal is

and sunken into a concrete pad so as to prevent digging under the walls by
the confined dog;

its home, kennel or pen unless the dog is secured by a leash no longer than
six feet in length. Both dog and leash must be under the physical control of
a person 18 years of age or older with sufficient strength to prevent the
dog’s escape. The dog may not be leashed or chained or tethered or
otherwise tied to any inanimate object, such as a tree, post or building,
outside of its pen, kennel or secured dwelling house.



      (5)   A vicious dog may not be required to be muzzled when
shown in an American Kennel Club show or when securely confined in a private
vehicle and inaccessible to persons other than those within the vehicle. A
vicious dog will be required to be muzzled in the above mentioned
circumstances when a person, who is in the presence of the vicious dog, is
concerned about his or her safety and requests the owner place a muzzle on
the vicious dog.



      (6)   An application to license a vicious dog must include:



         (a)   An insurance policy or a certificate of insurance
issued by an insurance company licensed to do business in the state,
providing personal liability insurance coverage as in a homeowner’s policy,
with a minimum liability amount, set by resolution approved by the City
Council, for the injury or death of any person, for damage to property of
others and for acts of negligence by the owner or agent of the owner in the
negligent keeping of such vicious dog;



         (b)   Posting a bond for the amount, set buy resolution
approved by the City Council, may be used as an alternative to insurance
mentioned in division (B)(6)(a) above. Any association or corporation, whose
primary business is the insuring of the fidelity of others, and which has the
authority to do business in the state, shall be acceptable as security on the
aforementioned bond. All bonds, when duly executed, shall be filed with the
Clerk;



         (c)   The insurance policy or certificate of insurance
or posting of a bond referred to in this section shall provide that it cannot
be canceled or terminated until ten days’ notice by registered mail of such
cancellation or termination has been received by the City Manager or
designee; and



         (d)   The cancellation or other termination of any
insurance policy or bond issued in compliance with this division (B) shall
automatically revoke and terminate the license issued for a vicious dog
unless another policy or bond complying with this section is provided and in
effect at the time of such cancellation or termination. The City Manager or
designee shall immediately issue written notification of the revocation of
said certificate and any license issued as aforesaid.



      (7)   Any owner failing to comply with the provisions of this
chapter after it has been determined that said owner’s dog is vicious under
this section is guilty of a misdemeanor. See Chapter 11 entitled “Municipal
Infractions.”



      (8)   The following procedure will be followed by the city
when it has received a complaint about a dog or when the animal control
officer or other law enforcement official has personally seen a dog which is
acting in a manner which might conform with the description of a vicious dog
in division (B)(1) above.

shall devise or cause to be devised a list of people qualified and willing to
sit upon a hearing panel for the purpose of determining whether a dog should
be labeled vicious under the structures of this section. People qualified to
serve on this panel are licensed veterinarians, the city’s animal control
officer, qualified dog breeders with not less than ten years’ experience as
active breeders and qualified obedience instructors with not less than ten
years’ experience in American Kennel Club recognized obedience clubs. From
this pool, three people shall be chosen to act as the jury in an official
hearing to be conducted to determine the disposition of an impounded dog.



         (c)   The official conducting the hearing shall notify
the owner of the impounded dog of the hearing and its purpose by personal
service or registered mail. The hearing shall be held no sooner than five
days and no later than ten days after the owner is given notice.



         (d)   If an owner is notified of a hearing and no reply
is received within ten days, the dog will be humanely destroyed or otherwise
disposed of in accordance with state law.



         (e)   During the hearing, both the owner and the person
charging the dog shall have opportunity to present evidence both written and
oral and to be represented by legal counsel. The panel, after hearing the
evidence, shall declare a dog vicious if it finds by a preponderance of the
evidence that the dog meets any of the definitions of a vicious dog as laid
out in division (A)(1) above.



         (f)   The panel shall have the right to pronounce
judgment and require the dog to be impounded until the owner complies with
divisions (B)(6)(a) through (B)(6)(c) above, and a failure by the owner to
comply within 20 days shall cause the procedures for euthanasia to be carried
out.



      (9)   Apprehension and impoundment of vicious dogs shall
include:



         (a)   If the owner has previously complied with this
section and the dog has nonetheless caused injury to either person or
property, the panel may require euthanasia to be carried out on the vicious
dog;



         (b)   The order of the panel may be appealed to the
Council. In order to appeal, written notice must be filed with the Clerk
within three days after receipt of the order of the panel. Failure to file
such written notice of appeal shall constitute a waiver of the right to
appeal the order of the panel;



         (c)   The notice of appeal shall state the grounds for
such appeal and shall be delivered personally or by certified mail to the
Clerk. The hearing of such appeal shall be scheduled within 14 days of the
receipt of notice of appeal. The hearing may be continued for good cause. The
hearing shall be confined to the record made before the panel and no
additional evidence shall be taken. After such hearing, the Council may
affirm or reverse the order of the panel. Such determination shall be
contained in a written decision and shall be filed with the Clerk within
three days after the hearing. A copy of the written decision shall also be
sent by certified mail to the dog’s owner or the owner’s designated legal
representative;



         (d)   The order of the Council may be appealed within 20
days after the receipt of the written order by the dog’s owner or the
owner’s legal representative, to the District Court in accordance with the
Iowa Rules of Civil Procedure. Failure to file such appeal shall constitute a
waiver of the right to appeal the order of the Council; and



         (e)   During the process of appeal, the dog will be kept
impounded by the city at the expense of the owner or the owner may redeem the
dog by complying with the confinement and insurance provisions of this
section.

discretion or upon receipt of a complaint alleging that a particular animal
is a “vicious animal” as defined herein, may initiate proceedings to
declare such animal a vicious animal. A hearing on the matter shall be
conducted by the municipal hearing officer or Magistrate. The person owning,
keeping, sheltering or harboring the animal in question shall be given not
less than 72 hours’ written notice of the time and place of said hearing.
Said notice shall set forth the description of the animal in question and the
basis for the allegation of viciousness. The notice shall also set forth that
if the animal is determined to be vicious, the owner may be required to
securely confine the animal within a proper enclosure, allow the animal to be
destroyed or comply with additional or alternative terms and conditions
imposed by the City Council or its designee. Once proceedings have been
initiated to declare such animal a vicious animal, the animal shall not be
removed from the city and transferred to another city unless and until it is
decided that the animal is not vicious. The notice shall be served upon any
adult residing at the premises where the animal is located, or may be posted
on those premises if no adult is present to accept service.



   (B)   If, after hearing, the municipal hearing officer or Magistrate

shall order the person, firm or corporation owning, sheltering, harboring or
keeping the animal to securely confine the animal within a proper enclosure,
cause it to be destroyed in a humane manner, or comply with additional or
alternative terms and conditions. Once a determination has been made that the
animal is vicious, the animal shall not be removed from the city and
transferred to another city. The order shall immediately be served upon the
individual or entity against whom issued in the same manner as the notice of
hearing. The individual or entity so served shall have three business days
from the date of service to file a written appeal of the hearing officer’s
or Magistrate’s order to the City Council who may confirm or alter the
findings of the hearing officer or Magistrate after holding a public hearing
on the matter. If the order is not complied with within a time period the
city has deemed to be reasonable, and the order is not appealed to the City
Council as provided above, the animal control officer is authorized to seize
and impound the animal. An animal so seized shall be impounded for a period
of seven calendar days. If, at the end of the impoundment period, the
individual or entity against whom the order of the hearing officer or
Magistrate was issued has not petitioned the district court for a review of
said order, the animal control officer shall cause the animal to be destroyed.



   (C)   Failure to comply with an order of the hearing officer or
Magistrate or Council issued pursuant hereto shall constitute a simple
misdemeanor, and is also punishable pursuant to this code.



   (D)   Any animal found at large which displays vicious tendencies
may be impounded and processed as a vicious animal pursuant to the foregoing,
unless the animal is so vicious that it cannot safely be apprehended, in
which case the animal control officer may immediately destroy it. If an
animal is so impounded, the animal control officer shall try to ascertain and
contact the owner of the animal, but if unable to ascertain the owner within
72 hours of the animal’s seizure, the animal control officer may destroy
the seized animal in a humane manner.

outcome of the hearing. All costs of such impoundment or quarantine shall be
paid by the owner if the animal is determined to be vicious. If the animal is
not determined to be vicious, all costs of such impoundment or quarantine
shall be paid by the city.

   (A)   The purpose of this chapter is to provide for the reasonable
regulation of after hours businesses within the city.



   (B)   The City Council finds that the existence of after hours
businesses, which allow on premises consumption of alcohol during early
morning hours, in the greater Des Moines metropolitan area has caused
detrimental effects on the health, safety, welfare and quality of life of
residents, visitors and upon cities in general.



   (C)   Based on these findings, the City Council has deemed it
necessary to enact regulations for after hours businesses in the city.

for the hearing.



      (3)   If, after the hearing, the City Council makes a finding
based on substantial evidence that a violation of this chapter or state law

civil penalty and/or suspend or revoke the license. The determination of
whether to impose a civil penalty and/or suspend or revoke the license shall
be in the discretion of the City Council, and shall be dependent upon the
circumstances surrounding the violation and its severity.

places as directed by the city.



   ALARM SYSTEM. Any device used to detect or prevent intrusion, criminal
activity or other emergency situations which, when activated, causes
notification to be made directly, or indirectly to the Police or Fire/EMS
Departments, or any device or system designed primarily for the purpose of
giving an audible or visual signal of an attempted intrusion, criminal
activity, fire or other emergency. An ALARM SYSTEM for the purpose of this
chapter shall not include an alarm installed on a motor vehicle.



   ALARM USER. The person, firm, partnership, association, corporation,
company or organization of any kind in control of any building, structure or
facility who owns, leases, installs or contracts for or otherwise obtains an

   MONITORING. The process by which an alarm company or its designated
alarm answering service receives signals from an alarm system and relays an
alarm dispatch request to the communication center, or other places as
directed by the city, for the purpose of summoning police and/or fire
personnel to the alarm site.



§ 116.03  GRACE PERIOD AFTER INSTALLATION OF AN ALARM SYSTEM.



   (A)   Upon the installation date of a new or replacement alarm
system, a grace period of 14 calendar days will be allowed for the alarm user
to become familiar with the operations of the alarm system and to make
corrections to the alarm system. Service charges for a false alarm, as stated
in § 116.04, may be waived during the grace period, providing the number of
false alarms during the grace period is not excessive.



   (B)   An excessive number of false alarms are:



      (1)   Equal to three or more false alarms in one calendar day

robbery and other non-fire causes usually requires from one to three police
officers to respond in individual vehicular units depending on the type of
alarm.

the service charge for a false alarm resulting from extreme weather
conditions or other extenuating circumstances, as determined on a
case-by-case review.



§ 116.05  EXCESSIVE FALSE ALARMS.



   (A)   The alarm user shall pay the city, within 45 days of invoice,

   (C)   The Chief shall notify the alarm user of the appeal decision
within five business days.



§ 116.06  NOTICES.

GENERAL PROVISIONS



§ 117.01  LEGISLATIVE FINDINGS.



   The City Council hereby finds and declares that:



   (A)   The public rights-of-way within the city can be partially
occupied by public utilities and other service entities for facilities used
in the delivery, conveyance, and transmission of services rendered for
profit, to the enhancement of the health, welfare, and general economic
well-being of the city and its citizens;



   (B)   The public rights-of-way within the city are physically
limited so that proper management by the city is necessary to maximize the
efficiency and to minimize the costs to the taxpayers of the foregoing uses,
to prevent foreclosure of future uses through premature exhaustion of
available right-of-way capacity, and to minimize the inconvenience to the
public from such facilities' construction, emplacement, relocation, and
maintenance in the rights-of-way;



   (C)   The use of the public rights-of-way by multiple users renders
more pressing the city's right-of-way management responsibilities;



   (D)   The public rights-of-way within the city are valuable public
property acquired and maintained by the state and the city at great expense
to the taxpayers; and



   (E)   The right to occupy portions of such public rights-of-way for
limited times for the business of providing utility and cable services is a
valuable economic asset.



(Ord. 2015-20, passed 11-10-2015)

   (C)   Minimize inconvenience to the public occasioned by the
emplacement and maintenance of  facilities in the public rights-of-way;



   (D)   Prevent premature exhaustion of capacity in the public
rights-of-way to accommodate communications and other services; and



   (E)   Promote competition in the provision of communications service
in the city and ensure that citizens have a wide variety of services
available to them by establishing clear and consistent rules by which
providers may occupy the public rights-of-way.



(Ord. 2015-20, passed 11-10-2015)

authorization (e.g., in the case of a cable operator, a franchise or
certificate of franchise authority) required under local, state or federal
law.



   (B)   An owner or operator of facilities may be required to hold
different authorizations for its use of the public rights-of-way to provide
different services.  For example, and without limitation, the owner or
operator of facilities that provides both cable service and telephone service
must obtain both a cable franchise and any authorization needed to provide

conditions of franchises under this chapter.



(Ord. 2015-20, passed 11-10-2015)



§ 117.12  AUDITS.



   Each owner and operator of facilities in the public rights-of-way shall
maintain books, records, and plant accounts sufficient to document its
obligations for any fee or payment owed pursuant to the City Code.  Such
books, records, and accounts shall be maintained and available for inspection
for a period of five years; provided, however, that such books, records, and
accounts shall be maintained and available during the continuation of any
audit by or on behalf of the city commenced during such five-year period or
during any dispute or litigation with respect thereto.  Any financial audit
of a grantee shall be in conformance with Iowa Code § 477A.7(d).



(Ord. 2015-20, passed 11-10-2015)



§ 117.13  REPORTS AND RECORDS.



   (A)   Open books and records.



      (1)   The city shall have the right to inspect and analyze at
any time during normal business hours at the nearest office of an owner or
operator of facilities, or, if such office is not in the city, then at such
other location in the city as the city may reasonably designate, all books,
receipts, maps, records, codes, programs, and disks or other storage media
and other like material reasonably appropriate in order to monitor compliance
with the terms of this chapter or applicable law, where the owner or operator
shall have the burden of showing that such materials are not reasonably
appropriate.  This includes not only the books and records directly relevant
to enforcement of this chapter or the owner or operator's franchise agreement
that are held by the operator, but any books and records held by an
affiliate, or any contractor, subcontractor or any person holding any form of
management contract for the facilities in the public rights-of-way to the
extent such books or records relate to the facilities.  An owner or operator
is responsible for collecting the information and producing it at a location
as specified above.  The city shall provide the owner or operator with
advance notice stating the types of records sought to be reviewed and the
reason for such review.



      (2)   Access to an owner or operator's records shall not be
denied on the basis that said records contain "proprietary" information. 
Any confidential information received by the city shall remain confidential
insofar as permitted by the Iowa Open Records Act, Iowa Code Ch. 22, and
other applicable state and federal law.



   (B)   Records required.  An owner or operator of facilities in the
public rights-of-way shall at all times maintain:



      (1)   A full and complete set of plans, records, and "as
built" maps showing the exact location of all equipment installed or in use
in the city, exclusive of customer service drops.



      (2)   A file showing its plan and timetable for future major
construction of the facilities. 



   (C)   Voluminous materials.  If any books, records, maps or plans,
or other requested documents are too voluminous, or for security reasons
cannot be copied and moved, then an owner or operator of facilities in the
public rights-of-way may request that the inspection take place at some other
location, provided that:



      (1)   The owner or operator must make necessary arrangements
for copying documents selected by the city after review; and



      (2)   The owner or operator must pay all travel and additional
copying expenses incurred by the city in inspecting those documents or having
those documents inspected by its designee, as charges incidental to the
enforcing of the owner or operator's franchise or other authorization for use
of the public rights-of-way.



(Ord. 2015-20, passed 11-10-2015)



§ 117.14  SEVERABILITY.



   If any term, condition, or provision of this chapter shall, to any
extent, be held to be invalid or unenforceable, the remainder hereof shall be
valid in all other respects and continue to be effective.  In the event of a
subsequent change in applicable law so that the provision which had been held
invalid is no longer invalid, said provision shall thereupon return to full
force and effect without further action by the city and shall thereafter be
binding on owners and operators.



(Ord. 2015-20, passed 11-10-2015)



CABLE CUSTOMER SERVICE



§ 117.30  GENERAL PROVISIONS.



   (A)   Title.  This subchapter shall be known and may be cited as
the "Cable Customer Service Code."



   (B)   Further findings and purpose. 



      (1)   The City of Urbandale, Iowa ("city") finds that the
further development of cable communications may result in great benefits for
the people of the city.  Cable technology is rapidly changing, and cable
plays an essential role as part of the city's basic infrastructure.  Cable
television systems permanently occupy and extensively make use of scarce and
valuable public rights-of-way, in a manner different from the way in which
the general public uses them, and in a manner reserved primarily for those
who provide essential services to the public subject to special public
interest obligations, such as utility companies.  The grant of a franchise
has the effect of giving the holder extensive economic benefits and placing
the holder in a position of public trust. The city finds that public
convenience, safety, and general welfare can best be served by establishing
regulatory powers vested in the city or such persons as the city so
designates to protect the public and to ensure that any franchise granted is
operated in the public interest.



      (2)   Further, it is recognized that cable systems have the
capacity to provide not only entertainment and information services to the
city's residents, but can provide a variety of broadband, interactive
communications services to institutions and individuals.  Many of these
services involve city agencies and other public institutions.



   (C)   In light of the foregoing, the following goals, among others,
underlie the provisions set forth in this subchapter:



      (1)   Cable should be available to as many city residents and
businesses as possible.



      (2)   A cable system should be capable of accommodating both
present and reasonably foreseeable future cable-related needs of the city.



      (3)   A cable system should be constructed and maintained
during a franchise term so that changes in technology may be integrated to
the maximum extent commercially practicable into existing system facilities.



      (4)   A cable system should be responsive to the needs and
interests of the local community, and shall provide the widest possible
diversity of information sources and service to the public.



      (5)   A cable operator should pay fair compensation to the
city for the occupation and use of scarce and valuable local public
rights-of-way.



   (D)   The city intends that all provisions set forth in this chapter
be construed to serve the public interest and the foregoing public purposes,
and that any franchise issued pursuant to this chapter be construed to
include the foregoing findings and public purposes as integral parts thereof.



   (E)   Delegation of powers.  The city may delegate the performance
of any act, duty, or obligation, or the exercise of any power, under this
chapter or any franchise agreement to any employee, officer, department or
agency of the city, except where prohibited by applicable law.

rights and/or obligations held by the grantee under the franchise are
transferred, directly or indirectly, to another party; or (C) any change or
substitution occurs in the managing general partners of the grantee, where

between affiliates under common ownership or control shall not constitute a
TRANSFER, provided that the ultimate parent of the grantee executes and

franchise agreement in substantially the form attached hereto as Appendix B.



            2.   Notwithstanding any other provision of this
subchapter, pledges in trust or mortgages of the assets of a cable system to
secure the construction, operation, or repair of the system may be made
without application and without city's prior consent.  However, no such
arrangement shall be made if it would in any respect under any condition: (1)
prevent the grantee or any successor from complying with this subchapter,
franchise agreement or other applicable law or regulation; or (2) permit a
third party to succeed to the interest of the operator, or to own or control
the system, without the prior consent of city.  Any mortgage, pledge or

franchise, this subchapter, or other applicable law.



               A.   "Control" for purposes of this
definition of TRANSFER means the legal or practical ability to exert actual
working control over the affairs of an entity, either directly or indirectly,
whether by contractual agreement, majority ownership interest, any lesser

               B.   A rebuttable presumption that a
transfer of control has occurred shall arise upon the acquisition or
accumulation of 5% or more of the ownership (as measured by voting interests,
not number of shares) of an entity by any person or group of persons acting
in concert, none of whom already own or control 50% or more of such right or
control, singularly or collectively.



               C.   A grantee is responsible for ensuring
that the intent of § 117.40 herein is carried out.  If for any reason an
event occurs that would require the city's approval under § 117.40, whether
or not such event is directly or indirectly within the grantee's control,
such event shall constitute a "transfer" for purposes of this chapter and any
applicable law.



         USER.  A person or organization using a channel or
equipment and facilities for purposes of producing or transmitting material,
as contrasted with the receipt thereof in the capacity of a subscriber.



      (2)   The definitions contained in Iowa Code § 477A.1 are
incorporated herein by reference.



(Ord. 2015-20, passed 11-10-2015)



§ 117.31  GRANT OF FRANCHISE.



   (A)   Grant.



      (1)   The city may grant one or more cable franchises, and
each such franchise shall be awarded in accordance with and subject to the
provisions of this chapter.



      (2)   This chapter may be amended from time to time, and in no
event shall this chapter be considered a contract between the city and a
grantee such that the city would be prohibited from amending any provision
hereof.



      (3)   No person may construct or operate a cable system in the
city without a franchise granted by the city.  No person may be granted a
franchise without having entered into a franchise agreement with the city
pursuant to this chapter.



   (B)   Term of franchise. No franchise shall be granted for a period
of more than ten years, except that a grantee may apply for renewal or
extension pursuant to applicable law.



   (C)   Franchise characteristics.



      (1)   A franchise authorizes use of public rights-of-way for
installing cables, wires, lines, optical fiber, underground conduit, and
other devices necessary and appurtenant to the operation of a cable system to
provide cable service within a franchise area, but does not expressly or
implicitly authorize a grantee to provide service to, or install a cable
system on, private property without owner consent (except for use of
compatible easements pursuant to Section 621 of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. §
541(a)(2)), or to use publicly or privately owned conduits without a separate
agreement with the owners.



      (2)   A franchise shall constitute both a right and an
obligation to provide the cable services regulated by the provisions of this
chapter and the franchise agreement.



      (3)   A franchise is non-exclusive and will not explicitly or
implicitly preclude the issuance of other franchises to operate cable systems
within the city; affect the city's right to authorize use of public
rights-of-way by other persons to operate cable systems or for other purposes
as it determines appropriate; or affect the city's right to itself construct,
operate, or maintain a cable system, with or without a franchise, subject to
applicable state and federal law.



      (4)   All privileges prescribed by a franchise shall be
subordinate to (without limitation) the city's use of the public
rights-of-way for purposes that do not directly or indirectly compete with
the grantee and to any prior lawful occupancy of the public rights-of-way.



      (5)   No reference herein, or in any franchise agreement, to
"public rights-of-way" shall be deemed to be a representation or guarantee by
the city that its interest or other right to control the use of such property
is sufficient to permit its use for such purposes, and a grantee shall be
deemed to gain only those rights to use as are properly in the city and as
the city may have the undisputed right and power to give.



   (D)   Grantee subject to other laws, police power.



      (1)   A grantee shall at all times be subject to and shall
comply with all applicable federal, state, and local laws.  A grantee shall
at all times be subject to all lawful exercise of the police power and any
other lawful authority of the city, including without limitation all rights
the city may have under 47 U.S.C. § 552.  Nothing in a franchise agreement
shall be deemed to waive the requirements of the various codes and ordinances
of the city regarding permits, zoning, fees to be paid, or manner of
construction, installation, operation, maintenance, or repair of system
equipment.



      (2)   No course of dealing between a grantee and the city, or
any delay on the part of the city in exercising any rights hereunder, or any
acquiescence by the city in the actions of a grantee that are in
contravention of such rights (except to the extent such rights are expressly
waived by the city) shall operate as a waiver of any such rights of the city.



      (3)   The city shall have the maximum authority to regulate
cable systems, grantees, and franchises as may now or hereafter be lawfully
permissible; except where rights are expressly waived by a franchise
agreement, they are reserved, whether expressly enumerated or not.



      (4)   The city may, from time to time, issue such reasonable
rules and regulations concerning cable systems as are consistent with
applicable law and § 117.06.



   (E)   Eminent domain. Nothing herein shall be deemed or construed to
impair or affect, in any way or to any extent, the city's rights of eminent
domain to the extent to which they may apply to any cable system.



   (F)   Applications for initial grant or modification of franchise.



      (1)   Application required.



         (a)   A written application shall be filed with the city
for grant of an initial franchise or modification of a franchise agreement
pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 545.



         (b)   To be acceptable for filing, a signed original of
the application shall be submitted together with five hard copies and one
electronic copy.  The application must be accompanied by any required
application filing fee, conform to any applicable request for proposals, and
contain all required information.  All applications shall include the names
and addresses of persons authorized to act on behalf of all applicants with
respect to the application.



         (c)   All applications accepted for filing shall be made
available by the city for public inspection.



      (2)   Application for grant of an initial franchise.



         (a)   A person may apply for an initial franchise by
submitting an application containing the information required in §
117.31(F)(3).  Upon receipt of such an application, the city may either (a)
evaluate the application pursuant to § 117.31(F)(2)(c), conducting such
investigations as it deems necessary; or (b) issue a Request for Proposals
("RFP"), after conducting, if necessary, a proceeding to identify the future
cable-related needs and interests of the community.  Any such RFP shall be
mailed to the person requesting its issuance and made available to any other
interested party.  The RFP may contain a proposed franchise agreement.



         (b)   An applicant shall respond to a RFP by filing an
application within the time directed by the city, delivering a copy to each
existing grantee and providing the information and material set forth in §
117.31(F)(3).  The procedures, instructions, and requirements set forth in
the RFP shall be followed by each applicant.  Any applicant that has already
filed materials pursuant to § 117.31(F)(2)(a) herein need not refile the
same materials with its RFP response, but must amplify its application to
include any additional or different materials required by the RFP.  The city
or its designee may seek additional information from any applicant and
establish deadlines for the submission of such information.



         (c)   In evaluating an application for a franchise, the
city shall consider, among other things, the following factors:



            1.   The extent to which the applicant has
substantially complied with the applicable law and the material terms of any
existing cable franchise for the city;



            2.   Whether the quality of the applicant's
service under any existing franchise in the city, including signal quality,
response to customer complaints, billing practices, and the like, has been
reasonable in light of the needs and interests of the communities served;



            3.   Whether the applicant has the financial,
technical, and legal qualifications to provide cable service;



            4.   Whether the application satisfies any minimum
requirements established by the city and is otherwise reasonable to meet the
future cable-related needs and interests of the community, taking into
account the cost of meeting such needs and interests;



            5.   Whether the application satisfies any
requirements under applicable state or federal law governing the issuance of
additional franchises;



            6.   Whether, to the extent not considered under
§ 117.31(F)(2)(c)4, the applicant will provide adequate public, educational,
and governmental access channel capacity, facilities, or financial support;



            7.   Whether issuance of a franchise is warranted
in the public interest considering the immediate and future effect on the
public rights-of-way and private property that would be used by the cable
system, including the extent to which installation or maintenance as planned
would require replacement of property or involve disruption of property,
public services, or use of the public rights-of-way; the effect of granting a
franchise on the ability of cable to meet the cable-related needs and
interests of the community;



            8.   What effects a grant of the application may
have on competition in the delivery of cable service in the city.



         (d)   If the city finds that it is in the public
interest to issue a franchise considering the factors set forth above, and
subject to the applicant's entry into an appropriate franchise agreement, it
shall issue a franchise.  If the city denies a franchise, it will issue a
written decision explaining why the franchise was denied.  Prior to deciding
whether or not to issue a franchise, the city may hold one or more public
hearings or implement other procedures under which comments from the public
on an application may be received.  The city also may grant or deny a
request for a franchise based on its review of an application without further
proceedings and may reject any application that is incomplete or fails to
respond to an RFP.  This chapter is not intended and shall not be
interpreted to grant any applicant or existing grantee standing to challenge
the denial of its application or the issuance of a franchise to another;
however, an existing grantee shall be deemed an interested party for purposes
of § 117.31(J).



      (3)   Contents of application. An RFP for the grant of an
initial franchise shall require, and any such application shall contain, at a
minimum, the following information:

franchise authority to the Iowa Utilities Board pursuant to Iowa Code §
477A.3.

§ 117.34  CONSUMER PROTECTION.



   (A)   General provisions. 



      (1)   This section sets forth minimum customer service
standards that a grantee must satisfy.  In addition, the grantee shall at
all times satisfy any additional or stricter requirements established by FCC
regulations, or other applicable federal, state, or local law or regulation,
as the same may be adopted or amended from time to time.



      (2)   Nothing in this chapter may be construed to prevent or
prohibit:



         (a)   The city and a grantee from agreeing to customer
service requirements that exceed the standards set forth in this chapter;



         (b)   The city from enforcing, through the end of a
franchise term, pre-existing customer service requirements that exceed the
standards set forth in this chapter and are contained in current franchise
agreements;



         (c)   The city from enacting or enforcing any customer
service or consumer protection laws or regulations; or



         (d)   The establishment or enforcement of any city law
or regulation concerning customer service that imposes customer service
requirements that exceed, or address matters not addressed by, the standards
set forth in this chapter, a franchise agreement or federal or state law;



         (e)   The city from waiving, for good cause,
requirements established in this section.



   (B)   Nothing in this chapter in any way relieves a grantee of its
obligation to comply with other applicable consumer protection laws and its
franchise agreement.



   (C)   Installations, connections, and other grantee services.



      (1)   Standard installations.  Except as federal rate
regulations may otherwise require or preempt, the grantee shall not assess a
subscriber any cost other than a standard installation charge for service
drops, for a single outlet, unless the grantee demonstrates to the city's
satisfaction that extraordinary circumstances justify a higher charge.



      (2)   The subscriber's preference as to the point of entry
into the residence shall be observed whenever feasible.  Runs in building
interiors shall be as unobtrusive as possible.  The grantee shall use due
care in the process of installation and shall repair any damage to the
subscriber's property caused by said installation.  Such restoration shall
be undertaken as soon as possible after the damage is incurred and shall be
completed within no more than 30 days after the damage is incurred.



      (3)   Location of drops.  In locations where the grantee's
system must be underground, drops must be placed underground as well. 
Except as federal law may otherwise require, in any area where a grantee
would be entitled to install a drop above-ground, the grantee will provide
the homeowner the option to have the drop installed underground if requested,
but may charge the homeowner the difference between the actual cost of the
above-ground installation and the actual cost of the underground installation.



      (4)   Time for extension.  Where a grantee is required under
this § 117.34(C)(1) to provide service to a person, it must provide such
service (i) within 30 days of the person's request if such person resides no
further than 150 feet from the grantee's distribution system; (ii) within 60
days if the person resides more than 150 feet from the grantee's distribution
system, but the distribution system need not be extended for one-half mile or
more to provide service; and (iii) within six months if an extension of the
distribution system for one-half mile or more is required.



      (5)   Deposits.  A grantee may require a reasonable deposit
on equipment provided to subscribers, in addition to any allowable monthly
rental fees.  Any subscriber deposit required by grantee shall bear interest
in accordance with applicable law or at the going rate, which shall be not
less than the prime rate of the bank being used by the city for the conduct
of ordinary business.  All deposits, with interest, shall be returned to the
subscriber within 30 days after termination of service or return of the
equipment, whichever is sooner.



      (6)   Antennas. A grantee shall not, as a condition to
providing cable service, require any subscriber or potential subscriber to
remove any existing reception devices for the receipt of over-the-air signals.



   (D)   Telephone and office availability.



      (1)   Each grantee shall maintain an office at a convenient
location that shall be open during normal business hours to allow subscribers
to request service, pay bills, and conduct other business.



      (2)   Each grantee will maintain at least one local, toll-free
or collect call telephone access line which will be available to subscribers
24 hours a day, seven days a week.  Trained representatives of a grantee
shall be available to respond to subscriber telephone inquiries during normal
business hours.



      (3)   Under normal operating conditions, the following
standards shall be met by a grantee at least 90% of the time, measured
quarterly.



         (a)   Telephone answering time shall not exceed 30
seconds, and the time to transfer the call to a customer service
representative (including hold time) shall not exceed an additional 30
seconds.



         (b)   A customer will receive a busy signal less than 3%
of the time.



         (c)   When the business office is closed, an answering
machine or service capable of receiving and recording service complaints and
inquiries shall be employed.  Inquiries received after hours must be
responded to by a trained representative of a grantee on the next business
day.  To the extent possible, the after-hours answering service shall comply
with the same telephone answer time standard set forth in this section.



      (4)   A grantee must hire sufficient staff (which may include
contract labor) so that it can respond to customer inquiries, complaints, and
requests for service in its office, over the phone, and at the subscriber's
residence as required by this chapter.



   (E)   Scheduling and completing service.



      (1)   Installations, outages and service calls.  Under normal
operating conditions, each of the following standards shall be met by all
grantees at least 95% of the time, as measured on a quarterly basis:



         (a)   Repairs and maintenance for service interruptions
and other repairs not requiring work within a subscriber's premises must be
completed within 24 hours after the subscriber reports the problem to the
grantee or its representative or the interruption or need for repairs
otherwise becomes known to the grantee. Work on all other requests for
service must be begun by the next business day after notification of the
problem.  All such work must be completed within three days from the date of
the initial request, except installation requests.  In any case where, for
reasons beyond a grantee's control, the work could not be completed in the
specified time periods even with the exercise of all due diligence, the
grantee shall complete the work in the shortest time possible; the failure of
a grantee to hire sufficient staff or to properly train its staff shall not
justify a grantee's failure to comply with this provision.  Except as
federal law requires, no charge shall be made to the subscriber for this
service, except for the cost of repairs to the grantee's equipment or
facilities where it can be documented that the equipment or facility was
damaged by a subscriber. System outages affecting more than 500 subscribers
shall be acted upon within four hours after the grantee becomes aware of the
outage, including Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays.



         (b)   The appointment window for installations, service
calls, and other installation activities will be either a specific time or,
at maximum, a 4-hour time block during normal business hours.



         (c)   A grantee may not cancel an appointment with a
subscriber after the close of business on the business day preceding the
appointment.  If a grantee's representative is running late for an
appointment with a subscriber and will not be able to keep the appointment as
scheduled, the subscriber will be contacted, and the appointment rescheduled,
as necessary, at a time which is convenient for the subscriber.



         (d)   Missed appointments.  If a subscriber experiences
a missed appointment due to the fault of a grantee, the grantee shall pay the
subscriber $20 for each missed appointment, or such other amount as the city
and the grantee may agree, in addition to any other penalties or liquidated
damages.



      (2)   Each grantee shall perform service calls, installations,
and disconnects at least during normal business hours.  In addition,
maintenance service capability enabling the prompt location and correction of
major system malfunctions shall be available 24 hours a day, seven days a
week.



      (3)   Emergency maintenance.  A grantee shall keep an
emergency system maintenance and repair staff, capable of responding to and
repairing system malfunctions or interruptions, on a 24- hour basis.



      (4)   Other inquiries.  Under normal operating conditions,
billing inquiries and requests for service, repair, and maintenance not
involving service interruptions must be acknowledged by a trained customer
service representative within 24 hours, or prior to the end of the next
business day, whichever is earlier.  A grantee shall respond to all other
inquiries within five business days of the inquiry or complaint.



      (5)   Repair of facilities.  Except as federal law requires,
no charge shall be made to the subscriber for repairs or maintenance of
grantee-owned equipment or facilities, except for the cost of repairs to the
grantee's equipment or facilities where it can be shown that the equipment or
facility was damaged by a subscriber.



      (6)   Mobility-limited subscribers. With regard to
mobility-limited subscribers, upon subscriber request, each grantee shall
arrange for pickup and/or replacement of converters or other grantee
equipment at the subscriber's address or by a satisfactory equivalent (such
as the provision of a postage-prepaid mailer).



   (F)   Interruptions of service.  A grantee may intentionally
interrupt service on the cable system only for good cause and for the
shortest time possible and, except in emergency situations or to the extent
necessary to fix the affected subscriber's service problems, only after a
minimum of 48 hours' prior notice to subscribers and the city of the
anticipated service interruption; provided, however, that planned maintenance
that does not require more than two hours' interruption of service and that
occurs between the hours of 12:00 midnight and 6:00 a.m. shall not require
such notice to subscribers, but shall require notice to the city no less than
24 hours prior to the anticipated service interruption.



   (G)   Notice to subscribers.



      (1)   When a subscriber is connected or reconnected to a cable
system and at least once annually afterwards, and at any time upon request,
the grantee shall provide each subscriber with written information concerning
the following.  Copies of all such materials provided to subscribers shall
also be provided to the city.  Such information shall also be made available
on a generally accessible Internet site.



         (a)   A description of products and services offered,
including a schedule of rates and charges, a list of channel positions, and a
description of programming services, options, and conditions;



         (b)   A description of the grantee's installation and
service maintenance policies, delinquent subscriber disconnect and reconnect
procedures, and any other of its policies applicable to its subscribers;



         (c)   Instructions on how to use the cable service;



         (d)   Instructions for placing a service call;



         (e)   A description of the grantee's billing and
complaint procedures, including the address and telephone number of the
office responsible for receiving subscriber complaints;



         (f)   A copy of the service contract, if any;



         (g)   Notice regarding subscribers' privacy rights
pursuant to 47 U.S.C. § 551;



         (h)   Notice of the availability of universal remote
controls and other compatible equipment (a list of which, specifying brands
and models, shall be provided to any subscriber upon request).



      (2)   The grantee shall provide to all subscribers at least 30
days' written notice before the implementation of any change in rates,
programming services, business hours, or procedures for responding to
inquiries after normal business hours.  At least five working days before
the subscriber notice, unless waived by the city, the grantee shall provide
to the city the specific points to be contained in a subscriber notice and
the text of the subscriber notice, if  available.  If the text is not
available, it shall be provided to the city as soon as it is available.



      (3)   All grantee promotional materials, announcements, and
advertising of residential cable service to subscribers and the general
public, where price information is listed in any manner, shall clearly and
accurately disclose price terms.  In the case of pay-per-view or
pay-per-event programming, all promotional materials must clearly and
accurately disclose price terms and in the case of telephone orders, a
grantee shall take appropriate steps to ensure that price terms are clearly
and accurately disclosed to potential customers before the order is accepted.



      (4)   Each grantee shall maintain a public file containing all
notices provided to subscribers under these customer service standards. 
Copies of all such notices sent to subscribers, and of any agreements used
with subscribers, shall be filed promptly with the city.



   (H)   Subscriber agreements.



      (1)   Upon request, grantee shall promptly provide a copy of
all agreements between the grantee and its subscribers to the city. All such
agreements must comply with applicable consumer protection laws.



      (2)   No agreement with a subscriber shall contain false or
misleading information.



   (I)   Billing. 



      (1)   Bills shall be clear, concise, and understandable. 
Bills must be fully itemized with itemizations including, but not limited to,
basic and premium service charges and equipment charges.  Bills shall
clearly delineate all activity during the billing period, including optional
charges, rebates, and credits.  Amounts itemized on bills pursuant to 47
U.S.C. § 542(c) shall not be identified as separate costs over and above the
amount the franchisee charges a subscriber for cable service, but shall be
shown in such a way as to make clear to the subscriber that these amounts are
part of the total amount a grantee charges a cable subscriber for cable
service, as set forth in the example in H.R. Rep. No. 628, 102d Cong., 2d
Sess., at 86 (1992).



      (2)   Refund checks to subscribers shall be issued promptly,
but no later than the later of:



         (a)   The subscriber's next billing cycle, or 30 days,
following resolution of the refund request, whichever is earlier; or



         (b)   The return of all equipment supplied by the
grantee, if service is terminated.



      (3)   Credits for service shall be issued no later than the
subscriber's next billing cycle following the determination that a credit is
warranted.



      (4)   A grantee's first billing statement after a new
installation or service change shall be prorated as appropriate and shall
reflect any security deposit.



      (5)   A grantee's billing statement must show a specific
payment due date not earlier than the tenth day of the period for which the
service being billed is rendered. Any balance not received by the end of the
period for which the service is being billed ("current month") may be
assessed a late fee not exceeding $5 in 2005 dollars, adjusted for inflation
according to CPI-U All Urban Consumers U.S. City Average All Items, or such
other amount as the city and the grantee may agree, consistent with state and
local law. Any late fee shall appear on the billing statement for the month
after the current month ("subsequent month").  If a late fee is shown on the
subsequent month's billing statement and such late fee amount is paid before
the end of the current month, then the grantee shall reverse such late fee
and credit such subscriber's account for the amount of such late fee.



      (6)   A grantee must notify the subscriber that he or she can
remit payment in person at the grantee's business office and inform the
subscriber of the address of that office.



      (7)   Subscribers shall not be charged a late fee or otherwise
penalized for any failure by a grantee, including failure to timely or
correctly bill the subscriber, or failure to properly credit the subscriber
for a payment timely made.



      (8)   The account of any subscriber shall be credited a
prorated share of the monthly charge for the service upon the subscriber's
reasonably prompt request and, without a subscriber's request, in any case
where the grantee can identify the affected subscribers, if said subscriber
is without service or if service is substantially impaired for any reason for
a period exceeding four hours during any 24 hour period, except where (i) it
can be documented that a subscriber seeks a refund for an outage or
impairment which that subscriber caused, or (ii) in the case of a planned
outage of two hours or less occurring between the hours of 12:00 midnight and
6:00 a.m. of which the subscriber had prior notice, or (iii) if the
interruption is necessary to perform tests required by applicable law.



      (9)   A grantee shall respond to all written billing
complaints from subscribers within 30 days.



   (J)   Disconnection/downgrades.



      (1)   A subscriber may terminate service at any time unless
the subscriber has voluntarily entered into a contract for service for a term
of longer than one month, in which case the contract terms shall govern.



      (2)   A grantee shall promptly disconnect or downgrade any
subscriber upon request.  No period of notice prior to voluntary termination
or downgrade of service may be required of subscribers by any grantee. So
long as the subscriber returns, or permits the grantee to retrieve, any
equipment necessary to receive a service within five business days of the
disconnection, no charge may be imposed by any grantee for any cable service
delivered after the date of the disconnect request.



      (3)   Any security deposit and/or other funds due the
subscriber shall be refunded on disconnected accounts after any customer
premises equipment provided by the grantee has been recovered by the
grantee.  The refund must be made within 30 days or by the end of the next
billing cycle, whichever is earlier, from the date disconnection was
requested (or, if later, the date on which any customer premises equipment
provided by the grantee is returned).



      (4)   If a subscriber fails to pay a monthly subscriber fee or
other fee or charge, a grantee may disconnect the subscriber's service;
however, such disconnection shall not be effected until after 45 days from
the beginning of the period for which the service being billed is rendered,
plus at least ten days' advance written notice to the subscriber in question
of intent to disconnect, given after the 45 days have elapsed.  If the
subscriber pays all amounts due, including late charges, before the date
scheduled for disconnection, the grantee shall not disconnect service. 
After disconnection, upon payment by the subscriber in full of all proper
fees or charges, including the payment of the reconnection charge, if any,
the grantee shall promptly reinstate service.



      (5)   A grantee may immediately disconnect a subscriber if the
subscriber is damaging or destroying the grantee's cable system or
equipment.  After disconnection, the grantee shall restore service after the
subscriber provides adequate assurance that it has ceased the practices that
led to disconnection, and pays all proper fees and charges, including any
reconnect fees and amounts owed the grantee for damage to its cable system or
equipment.



      (6)   A grantee may also disconnect a subscriber that causes
signal leakage in excess of federal limits.  Disconnection may be effected
after five days' written notice to the subscriber, if the subscriber fails to
take steps to correct the problem.  In addition, a grantee may disconnect a
subscriber without notice where signal leakage is detected originating from
the subscriber's premises in excess of federal limits, provided that the
grantee shall immediately notify the subscriber of the problem and, once the
problem is corrected, reconnect the subscriber.



      (7)   If a grantee fails to remove its subscriber terminal
equipment from a subscriber's premises within 120 days of the termination of
service, the property shall be deemed abandoned, unless such subscriber is
responsible for the grantee's failure to remove such property.



      (8)   A grantee shall reconnect service to customers wishing
restoration of service, provided such a customer shall first satisfy any
previous obligations owed.



   (K)   Parental control option. A grantee shall make available to any
subscribers upon request the option of blocking the video or audio portion of
any channel or channels of programming entering the subscriber's home. The
control option described herein shall be made available to all subscribers
requesting it when any cable service is provided, or reasonably soon
thereafter.



   (L)   Subscriber contracts.  No grantee shall require a subscriber,
as a condition of service, to waive any rights the subscriber may have
against the grantee at law or equity.



   (M)   Enforcement.



      (1)   A grantee shall keep such records as are necessary to
show compliance with these customer service standards and FCC customer
service standards.



      (2)   A grantee shall file annually with the city a statement
signed by an officer or employee certifying compliance with these customer
service standards and FCC customer service standards for each calendar
quarter.  Each such certification shall be filed with the grantee's annual
report.  If a grantee is unable to certify full compliance for each calendar
quarter, it must indicate in its filing each standard with which it is in
compliance, and in non-compliance statement.



      (3)   If a grantee in non-compliance with any standard during
any calendar quarter, it shall include in its annual filing a statement
specifying areas of non-compliance, the reason for the non- compliance and a
remedial plan.



      (4)   An officer or employee of a grantee who knowingly and
intentionally signs a compliance certificate or noncompliance statement
knowing that such statement is materially false shall be guilty of a
misdemeanor.



      (5)   A grantee that fails to file a compliance certificate or
noncompliance statement as required herein shall be liable for the penalty
specified for violation of customer service standards herein.



      (6)   In addition, except as prohibited by federal law, a
grantee shall be subject to penalties, forfeitures and any other remedies or
sanctions available under federal, state or local law, including without
limitation this chapter and a grantee's franchise with the city, if it fails
to comply with the standards herein.



      (7)   Violation of the consumer protection obligations
referred to in this § 117.34 shall be a municipal infraction as set forth in
Chapter 11, Municipal Infractions, and shall be punishable as provided
therein.



   (N)   Exclusive contracts and anticompetitive acts prohibited.



      (1)   No grantee shall enter into an exclusive agreement to
serve a subscriber, person or location unless the grantee has also offered
cable service under terms not requiring an exclusive contract.



      (2)   No grantee shall engage in acts that have the purpose or
effect of limiting competition for the provision of cable service or services
similar to cable service in the city, except for such actions as are
expressly authorized by federal or state law.

§ 117.36  FRANCHISE FEE.



   (A)   Payment of franchise fee.



      (1)   Each grantee shall pay a franchise fee in an amount
determined in the franchise agreement.



      (2)   In the event that any franchise fee payment or any
recomputation amount is not paid by the due date, then interest shall accrue
to the city from such due date at a rate equal to the interest rate then
chargeable for unpaid federal income taxes (26 U.S.C. § 6621).



      (3)   In the event that a franchise is revoked prior to its
expiration date, the grantee shall file with the city, within 30 days after
the date of revocation, a financial statement certified by the grantee's
chief financial officer or an independent certified public accountant clearly
showing the gross revenues received by the grantee since the previous
franchise fee payment period and shall pay at that time any franchise fees
accrued as of the date of revocation.



   (B)   Not a tax or in lieu of any other tax or fee.



      (1)   Payment of the franchise fee shall not be considered in
the nature of a tax, nor shall it be considered in lieu of other taxes or
fees imposed by the city except to the extent that federal law requires such
other taxes or fees to be considered part of the franchise fee.



      (2)   No grantee may designate the franchise fee as a tax in
any communication to a subscriber.



   (C)   No accord or satisfaction.  No acceptance of any payment by
the city shall be construed as a release or an accord and satisfaction of any
claim the city may have for further or additional sums due or for the
performance of any other obligation of a grantee, or as an acknowledgement
that the amount paid is the correct amount due.



   (D)   Allocation of discounts.  For purposes of calculating
franchise fee payments under applicable franchise provisions, any discount
reflected in an aggregated bill for services which include cable services
will be allocated proportionately to cable services.

§ 117.37  SYSTEM TESTS AND INSPECTIONS.



   (A)   A grantee shall perform all tests necessary to demonstrate
compliance with the requirements of its franchise and other performance
standards established by law or regulation, and to ensure that system
components are operating as expected.



   (B)   A grantee shall conduct tests as follows:



      (1)   Acceptance tests on each newly constructed or rebuilt
segment prior to subscriber connection or activation;



      (2)   Proof of performance tests on the system at least once
every six months or as required by FCC rules, whichever is more often, except
as federal law may otherwise limit the grantee's obligation;



      (3)   Special tests when subscriber or user complaints
indicate tests are warranted;



      (4)   Special tests, at no cost, at the city's reasonable
request.



   (C)   Tests shall be supervised by the grantee's professional
engineer, who shall sign all records of tests provided to the city.



   (D)   If the city notifies a grantee that the city wishes to observe
the next proof of performance test, then the grantee shall provide the city
with at least two business days' notice of the test, and an opportunity to
observe it.  The city may also conduct inspections of construction areas and
subscriber installations, including but not limited to inspections to assess
compliance with the grantee's construction and installation requirements, its
franchise agreement, and applicable laws generally.  Inspection does not
relieve the grantee of its obligation to build in compliance with all
provisions of its franchise.



   (E)   A written report of the results of any tests required by the
city shall be filed with the city within seven days of each test upon the
city's request.  In addition, the grantee shall retain written reports of
the results of any tests required by the FCC, and such reports shall be
submitted to the city upon the city's request.



   (F)   If any test requested by the city indicates that any part or
component of the system fails to meet applicable requirements, the grantee,
without requirement of additional notice or request from city, shall take
corrective action, retest the locations and advise the city of the action
taken and results achieved.



   (G)   The city reserves the right to conduct its own tests upon
reasonable notice to the grantee.  If noncompliance is found, the expense
thereof shall be borne by the grantee.  The city will endeavor to arrange
any request for such tests so as to minimize hardship or inconvenience to the
grantee or to subscribers.

§ 117.38  INSURANCE.



   (A)   A grantee shall maintain, and by its acceptance of the
franchise specifically agrees that it will maintain, throughout the entire
length of the franchise period, insurance as set forth in the Insurance
Schedule, Appendix A, as such schedule may from time to time be amended by
the city. The Insurance Schedule attached as Appendix A is the city's current
schedule.



   (B)   All contractual liability insurance policies and certificates
maintained pursuant to this agreement shall include the provision of the
following indemnification clause:



      To the fullest extent permitted by law, the Grantee shall
indemnify and hold harmless the City from and against all claims, damages,
losses and expenses, including but not limited to attorneys' fees, arising
out of or resulting from the Franchise, provided that such claim, damages,
loss or expense is attributable to bodily injury, sickness, disease or death,
or injury to or destruction of property  including loss of use resulting
therefrom, but only to the extent caused in whole or in part by negligent
acts or omissions of the Grantee, the Grantee's subcontractor, or anyone
directly or indirectly employed by the Grantee or the Grantee's subcontractor
or anyone for whose acts the Grantee or the Grantee's subcontractor may be
liable, regardless of whether or not such claim, damage, loss or expense is
caused in part by a party indemnified hereunder.

with the city no later than the next business day after they are submitted to
the receiving agency.  Materials received by the grantee shall be filed with
the city within 30 days of the date they are received by the grantee, except
that if applicable law permits a response to such materials by the city and
sets a deadline of 60 or fewer days for the city's response, they shall be
filed with the city within five days of the date they are received by the
grantee.



      (3)   Public access to such materials received by the city
shall not be denied, except to the extent expressly required by law.



   (C)   Annual report.  Unless this requirement is waived in whole or
in part by the city, no later than 120 days after the end of its fiscal year,
a grantee shall submit a written report to the city, in a form directed by
the city, which shall include:



      (1)   A summary of the previous year's activities in
development of the cable system, including but not limited to descriptions of
services begun or dropped, the number of subscribers gained or lost for each
category of service, the amount collected annually from users of the system
and the character and extent of the services rendered to any users from whom
amounts are collected, including leased access channel users, provided that
if the city directly or indirectly competes with a grantee in providing
communications services, it shall provide such grantee with the number of
subscribers gained or lost for each category of service by the city during
the city's fiscal year;



      (2)   A summary of complaints, identifying both the number and
nature of the complaints received and an explanation of their dispositions,
as such records are kept by the grantee.  Where complaints involve recurrent
system problems, the nature of each such problem and the corrective measures
taken shall be identified;



      (3)   A report showing the number of service calls received by
type during each quarter, and the percentage of service calls compared to the
subscriber base by type of complaint;



      (4)   A report showing the number of outages and service
degradations for each quarter, and identifying separately each planned
outage, the time it occurred, its duration, and the estimated area and number
of subscribers affected; each unplanned outage or service degradation, the
time it occurred, its estimated duration and the estimated area and the
number of subscribers affected; and the total hours of outages and service
degradations as a percentage of total hours of cable system operation.



      (5)   A copy of any rules and regulations of the grantee
applicable to subscribers of the cable system, and of any contracts for cable
service initiated with current subscribers during the year;



      (6)   An annual statement of gross revenues derived from the
operation of the cable system, certified by an officer of the grantee;



      (7)   A full schedule of all subscriber and other user rates,
fees and charges;



      (8)   The grantee's policies regarding subscriber privacy;



      (9)   Such other information as the city may direct that is
relevant to compliance with the grantee's franchise agreement, this chapter
and other applicable law.



   (D)   A grantee must submit a copy and full explanation of any
notice of deficiency, forfeiture, or other document issued by any state or
federal agency instituting any investigation or civil or criminal proceeding
regarding the cable system, the grantee, or any affiliate of the grantee, to
the extent the same may affect or bear on operations in the city.  By way of
illustration and not limitation, a notice that an affiliate that has a
management contract for the cable system was not in compliance with FCC EEO
requirements would be deemed to affect or bear on operations in the city. 
This material shall be submitted in accordance with the deadlines specified
in § 117.39(B)(2) herein.



   (E)   Additional reports. Each grantee shall prepare and furnish to
the city, at the times and in the form prescribed by the city, such
additional reports with respect to its operation, affairs, transactions or
property, as the city may reasonably deem necessary or relevant to the
performance of any of the rights, functions or duties of the city in
connection with this agreement and/or the Cable Ordinance.



   (F)   Records required.  The grantee shall maintain:



      (1)   Records of all complaints received.  The term
"complaints" as used herein and throughout this agreement refers to written
complaints or complaints documented in the grantee's normal course of
business about any aspect of the cable system or the grantee's operations,
including, without limitation, complaints about employee courtesy. 
Complaints recorded may not be limited to complaints requiring an employee
service call.



      (2)   Records of outages, indicating date, duration, area,
number of subscribers affected, type of outage, and cause.



      (3)   Records of service calls for repair and maintenance,
indicating the date and time service was requested, the date and time service
was provided, and (if different) the date and time the problem was resolved.



      (4)   Records of installation/reconnection and written
requests for service extension, indicating date of request, date of
acknowledgment, and the date and time service was extended.



   (G)   Retention of records; relation to privacy rights.  A grantee
shall take all steps that may be required to ensure that it is able to
provide the city all information which must be provided or may be requested
under the Cable Ordinance or this agreement, including by providing
appropriate subscriber privacy notices.  Nothing in this section shall be
read to require a grantee to violate 47 U.S.C. § 551.  Each grantee shall
be responsible for redacting any data that federal law prevents it from
providing to the city.  The city retains the right to question any such
redaction and to challenge it in any forum having jurisdiction over such a
challenge.  Records shall be kept for at least five years, unless otherwise
agreed to in writing by the city.



   (H)   Waiver of reporting requirements.  The city may, at its
discretion, waive in writing the requirement of any particular report
specified in this § 117.39 .



(Ord. 2015-20, passed 11-10-2015)



§ 117.40  TRANSFERS.



   (A)   City approval required.



      (1)   A franchise shall be a privilege that is in the public
trust and personal to the grantee.  A grantee's obligations under its
franchise involve personal services whose performance involves personal
credit, trust, and confidence in the grantee.



      (2)   No transfer of a franchise, grantee, or cable system, or
of control over the same (including, but not limited to, transfer by forced
or voluntary sale, merger, consolidation, receivership, or any other means)
shall occur unless prior application is made by the grantee to the city and
the city's prior written consent is obtained, pursuant to this chapter and
the franchise agreement, and only then upon such terms and conditions as the
city deems necessary and proper.  Any such transfer without the prior
written consent of the city shall be considered to impair the city's
assurance of due performance.  The granting of approval for a transfer in
one instance shall not render unnecessary approval of any subsequent transfer.



   (B)   Application.



      (1)   A grantee shall promptly notify the city of any proposed
transfer.



      (2)   At least 120 calendar days prior to the contemplated
effective date of a transfer, a grantee shall submit to the city a written
application for approval of a transfer.  Such an application shall provide
complete information on the proposed transaction, including details on the
legal, financial, technical, and other qualifications of the transferee, and
on the potential impact of the transfer on subscriber rates and service.  At
a minimum, the following information must be included in the application,
unless these requirements are waived, reduced, or modified by the city:



         (a)   All information and forms required under federal
law;



         (b)   All information required in § 117.31(F)(3)(a)-(e);



         (c)   A detailed statement of the corporate or other
business entity organization of the proposed transferee, together with an
explanation of how decisions regarding the system will be made if the
proposed transaction is approved;



         (d)   Complete and unredacted copies of any contracts,
financing documents, or other documents that relate to the proposed
transaction, and all documents, schedules, exhibits, or the like referred to
therein;



         (e)   Any documents related to the transaction
(including any documents regarding rates the transferee expects to charge)
that have been provided to any entity that has been asked to provide
financing (debt, equity, or any other kind) for, or to underwrite any
offering made in connection with, the proposed transaction;



         (f)   Any shareholder reports or filings with the
Securities and Exchange Commission ("SEC") or the Federal Trade Commission
("FTC") that discuss the transaction, and any filings required under federal
or state law in connection with the proposed transaction;



         (g)   Complete financial statements for the grantee and
any potential transferees for the last three years, including balance sheets,
income statements, profit and loss statements, and documents detailing
capital investments and operating costs;



         (h)   A detailed description of the sources and amounts
of the funds to be used in the proposed transaction, indicating how the
debt-equity ratio of the system will change in the course of the transaction;
what entities will be liable for repayment of any debt incurred; what
interest, payment schedule, and other terms or conditions will apply to any
debt financing; any debt coverages or financial ratios any potential
transferees will be required to maintain over the franchise term if the
proposed transaction is approved; what financial resources would be available
to the system under the control of the proposed transferee; whether the
proposed transferee can meet debt-equity or any other required ratios without
increasing rates, with any assumptions underlying that conclusion, and if
not, what increases would be required and why;



         (i)   Any other information necessary to provide a
complete and accurate understanding of the financial position of the system
before and after the proposed transfer;



         (j)   Complete information regarding any potential
impact of the transfer on subscriber rates and service;



         (k)   Any representations made to anyone, in connection
with the transaction, about the grantee's compliance with its franchise; and



         (l)   A brief summary of the proposed transferee's plans
for at least the next five years regarding line extension, plant and
equipment upgrades, channel capacity, expansion or elimination of services,
and any other changes affecting or enhancing the performance of the system.



      (3)   To the extent consistent with applicable law, the city
may waive in writing any such requirement that information be submitted as
part of the initial application, without thereby waiving any rights the city
may have to request such information after the initial application is filed.



      (4)   For the purposes of determining whether it shall consent
to a transfer, the city or its agents may inquire into all qualifications of
the prospective transferee and such other matters as the city may deem
necessary in considering the matters described in § 117.40(C)(1).  The
grantee and any prospective transferees shall assist the city in any such
inquiry, and if they fail to do so, the request for transfer may be denied.



      (5)   Any transfer review period established by federal law
will not begin until all documents and information required by §
117.40(B)(2), without exception, have been provided to the city, unless the
city and the grantee have expressly agreed in writing, before the transfer
application is filed with the city, that specified documents or parts of
documents may be redacted, excluded, or reviewed through special
arrangements.  It shall be the responsibility of the grantee in any transfer
to make any arrangements with the city with regard to redaction, exclusion,
or confidentiality, including without limitation the execution of any
confidentiality agreements that may be appropriate, prior to the filing of
any FCC Form 394 or transfer application.  By accepting its franchise, a
grantee agrees that any transfer application inconsistent with this
requirement is void and, in addition, that filing such an application
constitutes a violation of this chapter.



   (C)   Determination by city.



      (1)   In making a determination as to whether to grant, deny,
or grant subject to conditions an application for a transfer, the city may
consider, without limitation, the legal, financial, and technical
qualifications of the transferee to operate its system; any potential impact
of the transfer on subscriber rates or services; whether the incumbent cable
operator is in compliance with its franchise agreement, this chapter, and
applicable law, and, if not, whether the proposed transferee will cure any
noncompliance; whether the transferee owns or controls any other cable system
in the city, and whether operation by the transferee may eliminate or reduce
competition in the delivery of cable service in the city; whether operation
by the transferee or approval of the transfer would adversely affect
subscribers or the public, or the city's interest under the franchise
agreement, this chapter, and other applicable law; whether the transfer would
make it less likely that the future cable-related needs and interests of the
community would be satisfied at a reasonable cost; and any other matters that
it is required or permitted to consider under applicable law.



      (2)   Any transfer without the city's prior written approval
shall be ineffective, and shall make this franchise subject to cancellation
at the city's sole discretion, and to any other remedies available under the
franchise agreement, this chapter, or other applicable law.  Any such
transfer shall be deemed to cause irreparable harm to the city.



      (3)   A grantee shall be fully liable for any transfer that is
in violation of the terms of its franchise agreement or this chapter and is
caused in whole or in part by any other entity or entities, including but not
limited to any parents or affiliated entities, as if such transfer had been
caused by the grantee itself.



   (D)   Transferee's agreement.  No application for a transfer shall
be granted unless the transferee agrees in writing that it will abide by and
accept all terms of the franchise agreement and this chapter, and that it
will assume the obligations, liabilities, and responsibility for all acts and
omissions, known and unknown, of the previous grantee for all purposes,
including renewal, unless the city, in its sole discretion, expressly waives
this requirement in whole or in part.



   (E)   Approval does not constitute waiver. Approval by the city of a
transfer does not constitute a waiver or release of any of the rights of the
city under this chapter or a franchise agreement, whether arising before or
after the date of the transfer.



(Ord. 2015-20, passed 11-10-2015)



§ 117.41  RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS PROTECTED.



   (A)   Discriminatory practices prohibited.



      (1)   A grantee shall not deny service, deny access, or
otherwise discriminate against subscribers, programmers, or residents of the
city on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, sex, gender
identity, sexual orientation, physical disability, or age.



      (2)   A grantee shall not discriminate among persons or take
any retaliatory action against a person because of that person's exercise of
any right it may have under federal, state, or local law, nor may the grantee
require a person to waive such rights as a condition of taking service.



      (3)   A grantee shall not deny access or levy different rates
and charges on any group of potential residential cable subscribers because
of the income of the residents of the local area in which such group resides.



      (4)   Subject to applicable law and except to the extent the
city may waive such a requirement, a grantee is prohibited from
discriminating in its rates or charges or from granting undue preferences to
any subscriber, potential subscriber, or group of subscribers or potential
subscribers; provided, however, that a grantee may offer temporary, bona fide
promotional discounts in order to attract or maintain subscribers, so long as
such discounts are offered on a non-discriminatory basis to similar classes
of subscribers throughout the city; and a grantee may offer discounts for the
elderly, the handicapped, non-for-profit persons or organizations, or the
economically disadvantaged, and such other discounts as it is expressly
entitled to provide under federal law, if such discounts are applied in a
uniform and consistent manner.  A grantee shall comply at all times with all
applicable federal, state, and city laws, and all executive and
administrative orders relating to non-discrimination.



      (5)   A grantee may impose different financial terms and
conditions on different subscribers based on rational classifications (for
example, the subscriber's credit history), provided that such imposition does
not violate applicable state or federal law.



   (B)   Subscriber privacy.



      (1)   A grantee shall at all times protect the privacy rights
of all subscribers, including but not limited to those rights secured by the
provisions of Section 631 of the Cable Act, 47 U.S.C. § 551.



      (2)   A subscriber may at any time revoke any authorization to
release information by delivering to the grantee in writing, by mail or
otherwise, the subscriber's decision to revoke the authorization.  Any such
revocation shall be effective upon receipt by the grantee.



      (3)   A grantee shall not condition subscriber service on the
subscriber's grant or denial of permission to collect, maintain or disclose
personally identifiable information except to the extent that such
information is necessary for credit check or billing purposes.  A subscriber
may at any time revoke any permission previously given by delivering to the
grantee a written statement of that intent.



(Ord. 2015-20, passed 11-10-2015)



§ 117.42  MISCELLANEOUS PROVISIONS.



   No recourse against the city.  Without limiting such immunities as the
city or other persons may have under applicable law, a grantee shall have no
recourse whatsoever against the city or its officials, boards, commissions,
agents or employees for any loss, costs, expense or damage arising out of any
provision or requirement of this chapter or because of the enforcement of
this chapter or the city's exercise of its authority pursuant to this
chapter, a franchise agreement, or other applicable law, unless the same
shall be caused by criminal acts or by willful or gross negligence.

§ 118.01  PURPOSE.



   (A)   The State of Iowa licenses massage therapists and businesses
in Iowa Code Chapter152C.  State licensed massage therapists and businesses
offering therapy services perform an important service in addressing the
health and well being of Urbandale's residents.  Unfortunately, there are
businesses that advertise they provide massage therapy and/or therapeutic
services, but actually engage in various illegal activities, which may
include prostitution and/or human trafficking.  This chapter is not intended
to discourage a legitimately licensed massage therapist or massage therapy
business from providing their/its services in the City of Urbandale.



   (B)   The purpose of this chapter is to identify and address
businesses that engage in the practice of massage therapy without a license
and/or are involved in illegal activities, which may include prostitution
and/or human trafficking.  Businesses providing massage therapy yet
conducting various types of illegal activity are harmful to the Urbandale
community and the massage therapy profession.

§ 118.03  STATE LICENSE REQUIRED.

"licensed massage therapist", "massage therapist", "masseur", "masseuse", or
any other word or title that implies or represents that the person(s)
practice massage therapy, unless the person possesses a license issued under
the provision of Iowa Code § 152C.3.



(Ord. 2018-05, passed 4-24-2018)



§ 118.04  DISPLAY OF LICENSE.



   Each massage therapist shall keep his/her license in possession at all
times while doing business in the city and shall, upon the request of
prospective customers or city official, exhibit the license as evidence of

§ 118.99  PENALTY.



   (A)   Any person or in connection with one or more persons or as
principle, agent, or accessory is found violating any provision of this
chapter, shall be subject to the penalty provisions of § 10.99.



   (B)   The Chief of Police, or designee, shall place in a highly
noticeable location a placard stating the business as unsafe for entry where
any person has established a practice of massage therapy without a state
license.  The Chief, or designee, shall keep the premises placarded until a
state license has been obtained or some other legal use has been established.



   (C)   Any person or in connection with one or more persons or as
principle, agent, or accessory is found continuing to offer "massage therapy"
services after that establishment has been placarded as unsafe for entry, may
be subject to a municipal infraction, punishable as provided in Chapter 11 of
this code or pursuant to state law.

the other thereof.



   (B)   A person commits theft when the person does any of the
following:



      (1)   Takes possession or control of the property of another
or property in the possession of another, with the intent to deprive the
other thereof;



      (2)   Misappropriates property which the person has in trust
or property of another which the person has in the person’s possession or
control whether the possession or control is lawful or unlawful, by using or
disposing of it in a manner which is inconsistent with or a denial of the
trust or of the owner’s rights in the property, or conceals found property
or appropriates that property to the person’s own use, when the owner of
the property is known to the person. Failure by a bailee or lessee of
personal property to return the property within 72 hours after a time
specified in a written agreement of lease or bailment shall be evidence of
misappropriation;



      (3)   Obtains the labor or services of another, or a transfer
of possession, control or ownership of the property of another, or the
beneficial use of property of another, by deception. Where compensation for
goods and services is ordinarily paid immediately upon the obtaining of the
goods or the rendering of the services, the refusal to pay or leaving the
premises without payment or offer to pay or without having obtained from the
owner or operator the right to pay subsequent to leaving the premises gives
rise to an inference that the goods or services were obtained by deception;



      (4)   Exercises control over stolen property, knowing the
property to have been stolen, or having reasonable cause to believe that the
property has been stolen, unless the person’s purpose is to promptly
restore it to the owner or to deliver it to an appropriate public officer.
The fact that the person is found in possession of property which has been
stolen from two or more persons on separate occasions, or that the person is
a dealer or other person familiar with the value of the property and had
acquired it for a consideration which is far below its reasonable value,
shall be evidence from which the court or jury may infer that the person knew
or believed that the property had been stolen;



      (5)   Takes, destroys, conceals or disposes of property in
which someone else has a security interest with intent to defraud the secured
party;



      (6)   Makes, utters, draws, delivers or gives any check, share
draft, draft or written order on any bank, credit union, person or
corporation, and obtains property or service in exchange therefor, if the
person knows that the check, share draft, draft or written order will not be
paid when presented. Whenever the drawee of the instrument has refused
payment because of insufficient funds, and the maker has not paid the holder
of the instrument the amount due thereon within ten days of the maker’s
receipt of notice from the holder that payment has been refused by the
drawee, the court or jury may infer from these facts that the maker knew that
the instrument would not be paid on presentation. Notice of refusal of
payment shall be by certified mail, or by personal service in the manner
prescribed for serving original notices. Whenever the drawee of the
instrument has refused payment because the maker has no account with the
drawee, or whenever the drawee of the instrument has refused payment because
the maker’s account has been closed, the court or jury may infer from that
fact that the maker knew that the instrument would not be paid on
presentation; and/or



      (7)   Obtains gas, electricity or water from a public utility
or obtains cable television or telephone service from an unauthorized
connection to the supply or service line or by intentionally altering,
adjusting, removing or tampering with the metering or service device so as to
cause inaccurate readings.

“City of Urbandale” in the brackets.



      (2)   Amend IBC § 104.10.1 by adding that the Building
Official shall not modify flood hazard areas.



      (3)   (a)   In IBC § 105.2 and IRC § R105.2 amend item
number 1 to read:



         One story detached accessory structures used as tool and
storage sheds, playhouses and similar uses, provided the floor area does not
exceed 120 square feet and the structure does not utilize a permanent
foundation.



         (b)   Delete item numbered “2.  Fences not over seven
feet high.”



      (4)   Add new § 105.8 to the IBC and new § R105.10 to the
IRC as follows:



         No building permits shall be issued to any person or
company who has fees outstanding, or who has outstanding, unresolved
violations of this Code or any other laws or ordinances of the City. The
Building Official may waive this restriction for just cause.



      (5)   (a)   Permit fees mentioned in IBC § 109.2, IRC §
R108.2, and here in division (B)(5) shall be as set by resolution approved by
City Council.



         (b)   Fee refunds.



         The Building Official may authorize the refunding of any
fee paid under this section which was erroneously paid or collected.



         The Building Official may authorize the refunding of not
more than 80% of the permit fee paid when no work has been done under a
permit issued in accordance with this Code.



      (6)   Delete IBC § 109.3 and IRC § R108.3 and replace with
the following.



         The building valuation will be derived from the most
current Building Valuation Data Schedule published in the Building Safety
Journal.



         Add a line valuing detached garages and accessory
structures at $15 per square foot.



         Add a line valuing open decks at $10 per square foot.



         Add a line valuing below-ground swimming pools at $25 per
square foot and above-ground swimming pools at $10 per square foot.



         Add a line valuing screened porches at $15 per square foot.



         Crawl spaces and garage foundations are not included in

         The fee for starting work before acquiring the permit is
100 percent of the usual permit fee in addition to the required permit fee,
with a $750 limit.  This section is not to be interpreted as requiring this
fee the first time the person neglects to acquire the permit, but to control
the practice of failing to acquire permits before construction commences.



      (8)   Add IBC § 109.5.1 and amend IRC § R108.4 by adding
provisions as follows.



         Plan Review Fees. When submittal documents are required, a
plan review fee shall be paid at the time of submitting the submittal
documents for plan review, unless the Building Official delays requiring
payment until permit issuance.  The plan review fee shall be 65% of the
building permit fee.  This plan review fee is separate from the permit fee,
and is in addition to the permit fee.



         When submittal documents are incomplete or changed so as to
require additional plan review or when the project involves deferred
submittal items, an additional plan review fee shall be charged at the
applicable rate.  This subsection does not apply to Group U Occupancies or
Group R-3 (one & two family) occupancies, unless the Building Official
determines that there are unusual or unique features requiring specialized
plan review.



         Expiration of Plan Review.  Applications for which no
permit is issued within 180 days following the date of application shall
expire by limitation, and plans and other data submitted for review may
thereafter be returned to the applicant or destroyed by the Building
Official.  The Building Official may extend the time for action by the
applicant for a period not exceeding 180 days on request by the applicant
showing that circumstances beyond the control of the applicant have prevented
action from being taken.  No application shall be extended more than once.
In order to renew action on an application after expiration, the applicant
shall resubmit plans and pay a new plan review fee.



      (9)   In IBC § 110.3.8 and IRC § 109.1.5 add the following:



         Fences: To be made after holes have been dug for all corner
posts, and for additional posts as deemed necessary by the Building
Inspector; and a final inspection upon completion of work.



      (10)   In IBC § 110.3 and IRC § R109 add the following
paragraph:



         Where the work requiring a building permit includes one or
more prefabricated assemblies, the certificate of approval required by IBC §
1703.6 may be accepted in lieu of the written approvals required by IBC §§
110.3.1 through 110.3.7, and the frame and lath and/or wallboard inspection
required by IBC § 110.3.5 where the use of prefabricated assemblies renders
the obtaining of approvals or inspection impractical.  All certificates of
approval for this purpose and as required by IBC § 1703.6 of this Code shall
be made by the International Code Council, Underwriter’s Laboratories,
Inc., or any other approved independent inspection agency qualified to make
the certification.  Also all prefabricated assemblies must be certified to
comply with regulations of the State Building Code.



      (11)   Add IBC § 110.7 and IRC § R109.5 regarding
reinspections as follows:



         Reinspections.  A reinspection fee may be assessed for
each inspection or reinspection when such portion of work for which
inspection is called is not complete or when corrections called for are not
made.



         This section is not to be interpreted as requiring
reinspection fees the first time a job is rejected for failure to comply with
the requirements of this Code, but as controlling the practice of calling for
inspections before the job is ready for inspection or reinspection.



         Reinspection fees may be assessed when the inspection
record card is not posted or otherwise available on the work site, the
approved plans are not readily available to the inspector, for failure to
provide access at the scheduled time for which inspection is requested, or
for deviating from plans, which then requires the approval of the Building
Official.



         To obtain a reinspection, the applicant shall request that
it be scheduled in the normal manner in which inspections are scheduled, and
pay the reinspection fee in accordance with this ordinance.



         In instances where reinspection fees have been assessed, no
additional inspection of the work will be performed until the required fees
have been paid.  Only the work necessary to correct what has been noted in
the inspection or reinspection report is to be done until all reinspection
fees are paid and reinspections satisfactorily completed.



      (11.1)   Add IRC § R110.3.1 as follows:



         Prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy for new
one- and two-family dwellings, structures, and any other construction as
determined by the Community Development Department, the permit applicant's
land surveyor shall provide a certified as-built grading plan to the City
showing the as-built elevations of critical locations on the site as shown on
the individual grading plan (including but not limited to the rear corners,
the mid-point of the side yard lines, the front lot corners where the storm
water flows from the rear yard to the front yard, overflow locations, and
along the proposed drainageways and easements), sanitary sewer manholes, and
all storm water management facilities (including but not limited to detention
areas, intakes, structures, sub-drain cleanouts, and flared end sections) are
in compliance with the approved grading plan.  Elevations shall be within
0.2 foot of the approved grading plan.



      (11.2)   Add IBC § 111.2.1 as follows:



         Prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy for new
buildings, structures, and any other construction as determined by the
Community Development Department, the permit applicant's land surveyor shall
provide a certified as-built grading plan to the City showing the as-built
elevations of critical locations on the site as shown on the grading plan
(including but not limited to the rear corners, the mid-point of the side
yard lines, the front lot corners where the storm water flows from the rear
yard to the front yard, overflow locations, and along the proposed
drainageways and easements), sanitary sewer manholes, and all storm water
management facilities (including but not limited to detention areas, intakes,
structures, sub-drain cleanouts, and flared end sections) are in compliance
with the approved grading plan.  Elevations shall be within 0.2 foot of the
approved grading plan.

      In their interpretation and application, the provisions of this

hardships in carrying out the strict letter of any notice or order that are
not purely economic in nature; and that the difficulties or hardships are not
generally applicable to other properties;



      2.   That the effect of the application of the provisions
would be arbitrary in the specific case;

not constitute an appropriate remedy for these practical difficulties or
unnecessary hardships and this arbitrary effect; and



      4.   That the variance is in harmony with the general purpose
and intent of this chapter in securing the public health, safety and general
welfare.



      The concurring vote of three members of the Board shall be
necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision or determination of the
Building Official, or to decide in favor of the applicant on any matter upon
which it is required to pass under this Code; provided, however, that the
action of the Board shall not become effective until after the resolution of
the Board, setting forth the full reason for its decision and vote of each
member participating therein, has been filed. The resolution, immediately
following the Board’s final decision, shall be filed in the office of the
Department of Community Development, and shall be open to public inspection.

shall be supported by a written testimony or evidence submitted in connection
therewith.

specifying the grounds of the illegality. The petition shall be presented to
the court within 30 days after the filing of the decision in the office of
the Board.



      If any application for a variance or exception shall have been
denied by the Board, then no new application for the same relief shall be
considered by the Board unless the Board first finds that conditions have
changed.

§ 152.03  AMENDMENTS, MODIFICATIONS, ADDITIONS AND DELETIONS.



   The following amendments, modifications, additions and deletions to the
National Electrical Code, 2011 Edition, are hereby made.



   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this Code is to provide minimum
provisions to safeguard life or limb, health, property and public welfare by
regulating, licensing and controlling the design, installation, quality of
materials, location and maintenance of all electrical installations and uses
within the city.



   (B)   Scope.



      (1)   The provisions of this Code shall apply to the
electrical conductors and equipment installed within or on public and private
buildings and other premises; the conductors that connect the installations
to a supply of electricity; other outside conductors adjacent to the
premises; and manufactured dwellings, mobile homes and travel trailers.



      (2)   Additions to, alterations of and repairs to existing
electrical equipment shall comply with the provisions of this Code.  The
Electrical Inspector may, when the additions, alterations or repairs are
made, order further reasonable additions or alterations in a building,
structure or on premises, when a danger to life or property may exist or
result if further additions or alterations are not made.



      (3)   Installations which were in compliance with the Code in
existence at the time the installations were made shall be presumed to be
safe and proper, which presumption can be rebutted by evidence that the
installation may be dangerous to life or property.



      (4)   Where the classification of a building has been changed
due to a change in occupancy, the wiring in the entire building shall comply
with all the electrical standards applicable to the new classification. 
Where the occupancy of a building has been changed to a mixed occupancy, with
the required fire separation between the mixed occupancy, each occupancy
shall comply with its own particular classification and shall be wired in
compliance with the electrical standards of its particular classification.



      (5)   For the purposes of this Code, the term ELECTRICAL WORK
shall apply to all uses, installations, alterations, repairs, removals,
replacements, connections, disconnections and maintenance of all electrical
equipment.



      (6)   The term ELECTRICAL EQUIPMENT shall include all
electrical materials, wiring, conductors, fittings, apparatus, devices,
appliances, fixtures, signs or parts thereof, used in electrical work.



      (7)   Where the occupancy of a building has been changed to a
mixed occupancy and no fire separation is provided, the entire building shall
be wired to comply with the requirements for the most restrictive
classification.



   (C)   Moved buildings. Buildings or structures moved into or within
the city shall comply with the provisions of this Code for new buildings or
structures.



   (D)   Building Official; appointment, assistants, powers and duties.



      (1)   The Building Official appointed under provisions of the
City Building Code shall be responsible for the administration and
enforcement of this Code and to make any required inspection or tests.  He
or she may also be referred to as the Chief Electrical Inspector.  The
Building Official may delegate power and authority to qualified assistants to
act as Electrical Inspectors and agents of the Building Official in whatever
manner that may be necessary to administer and enforce this Code. The
Building Official and his or her authorized assistants shall have the right
to enter any building or premises during reasonable hours in the discharge of
his or her official duties; and the authority to cause disconnection of any
wiring or equipment which, in his or her judgment, is dangerous to life and
property or may interfere with the work of the Fire Department.



      (2)   The Building Official is hereby authorized, directed and
empowered to inspect any and all electrical installations within the city; to
condemn and order removed or remodeled and put in proper and safe condition,
all electrical heating and lighting apparatus, power generators, motors,
machinery, fixtures and connections, and electrical equipment used in the
supply distribution or utilization of electrical current for light, heat or
power purposes, and to control the disposition and arrangements of the same
so that persons and property shall not be in danger therefrom.



      (3)   The Building Official shall have the right at any time
to enter any building, area, manhole or subway, and shall be given prompt
access thereto upon application to the company or individual owning or having
charge or control of the same, for the purpose of making inspections and
tests of the electrical apparatus and appliances therein or thereon, or
otherwise discharging his or her official duties.  Whenever, in the judgment
of the Electrical Inspector, any electrical wire or appliance is deemed to be
defective or dangerous, or the premises are for any reason or cause deemed to
be in a defective or hazardous condition that may be a risk or potential
cause of fire, or threat to the safety of workers, occupants, or the general
public, the Electrical Inspector may order the immediate removal of the
defects and the full remedy of the improper or unsafe condition.



      (4)   It shall be the duty of the Building Official to
administer and enforce the provisions of this Code.  He or she shall keep
records of each ruling or determination made under the provisions of this
Code, and notify in writing all persons involved.  He or she shall keep
complete records of all permits issued, inspections made and other official
work performed in accordance with the provisions of this Code.



      (5)   The Building Official and his or her assistants shall
not engage in the business of the sale, installation or maintenance of
electrical equipment, either directly or indirectly, and shall not have any
financial interest in any firm engaged in the business in the city at any
time while holding office.



   (E)   Board of Appeals.



      (1)   The Board of Appeals for the Electrical Code shall be
the same Board of Appeals which serves for the Building Code (herein
“Board” or “Board of Appeals”), and persons who are appointed to the
Board of Appeals are hereby concurrently appointed to this Board without
further action or specific citation.  The Building Official shall be an ex
officio member and shall act as secretary to the Board, but shall have no
vote upon any matter before the Board.



      (2)   The Board shall have no authority relative to
interpretation of the administrative provisions of this Code, and the Board
shall not be empowered to waive requirements of this Code.



      (3)   The rules of procedure, powers and obligations of the
Board shall be the same as those set forth in the Building Code, including
but not limited to rendering all decisions and findings in writing to the
appellant with a duplicate copy to the Building Official.



   (F)   Violations. Any violation of any of the terms or conditions of
this Code, or any failure to comply with any of its requirements, shall
constitute a civil infraction or misdemeanor and shall be accordingly subject
to fines or imprisonment in accordance with the provisions of the Code of
Iowa. Each day a violation exists may be considered to be a new and separate
infraction or misdemeanor.



   (G)   Permits.



      (1)   Permit required.



         (a)   No person shall perform electrical work nor
install electrical equipment in or upon any building or property without
first securing from the Department of Community Development a permit
therefore; nor shall any alteration or change be made in the wiring of any
building, or in any electrical installation therein or thereon, either before
or after inspection, nor shall any electric current be connected to any wires
or apparatus, without notifying the Electrical Inspector and securing a
permit therefor.  This provision does not include very minor work such as
replacing light fixtures, replacing electrical receptacles, replacing
switches and similar activity normally perceived as maintenance. A separate
permit shall be obtained for each building.



         (b)   The owner of an owner-occupied existing
single-family dwelling who desires to work on branch circuitry or perform
maintenance branch circuit work in said single-family dwelling may apply for
a homeowner’s exemption on forms that may be provided by the Department of
Community Development for such purpose.  If the Building Official determines
that the proposed wiring would not overload the existing system, the Building
Official may issue an electrical permit for the proposed wiring to the
owner-occupant, upon receipt of an application for a permit and payment of
the applicable fee.  The permit shall be valid for not more than 180 days. 
Home-owner electrical work shall be limited to branch circuits.  For
purposes of this section, a SINGLE-FAMILY DWELLING shall mean a residence
designed for and intended to be occupied by one family, the term family
having the same meaning as is defined by the Zoning Code.



         (c)   No electrical work shall be finally enclosed until
a final inspection has been made by the Building Official.



      (2)   Issuance. After proper application on forms provided by
the Department of Community Development and payment of the applicable fee,
permits may be issued. A person holding an electrician’s license issued by
the state shall secure permits only for their firm or corporation. All
applications for electrical permits shall be signed by a state-licensed
master or their designee.



      (3)   Not transferable; permit restrictions. Permits are not
transferable. Electrical work performed under permits issued under the
provisions of this Code shall be done by the contractor securing a permit,
and only the employees of the contractor shall perform the electrical work
for which the permit was obtained. For purposes of this section, an EMPLOYEE
shall be one employed by the contractor for a wage or salary. The Building
Official may require an electrical contractor to show positive evidence as to
the employee status of workers on the job. The evidence shall be in the form
of payroll and time records, canceled checks or other documents that are
acceptable to the Building Official.  The contractor may also be required to
show the agreement or contract pertaining to the work being questioned as
evidence that he or she is, in fact, the actual contractor for the work. 
Failure or refusal by the contractor to make available the employee or
contractual records within 24 hours from demand therefor shall be grounds for
immediate revocation of any electrical permit for the work in question.



      (4)   Starting permit.  When the scope or extent of the
electrical work is indefinite or impossible to determine until the work is in
actual progress, the Building Official may issue a starting permit, which
shall generally describe the nature of the anticipated work. As soon as
practicable before the final inspection, the contractor shall secure a
regular electrical permit, describing in detail all work involved in the job.
A starting permit shall be clearly identified as such and the application
therefore shall clearly describe the reason(s) why a regular electrical
permit is not being applied for.



      (5)   Double fee for failure to obtain permit before starting
work.



         (a)   Except in emergency situations, as determined by
the Electrical Inspector, where work for which an electrical permit is
required by this Code is started or proceeded with by any person prior to
obtaining a required permit, the regular fees as specified in this Code for
the work shall be doubled, provided the increase shall not exceed $100. The
payment of the double fee shall not relieve any persons from fully complying
with the requirements of this Code in the execution of the work nor from any
other penalties prescribed herein.



         (b)   However, no double fee shall be imposed upon any
person who starts work without a permit if the work is started at a time when
the Department of Community Development is not open, and the person secures
the proper permit on the next working day for the Department of Community
Development.



         (c)   No additional permits shall be issued to any
person who owes the city the double fee described in this section.



      (6)   Revocation of permit; expiration of permit. Any permit
required by the provisions of this Code may be revoked by the Chief
Electrical Inspector upon the violations of any provision of this Code. Every
permit issued under the provisions of this Code shall expire by limitation
and become null and void, if the work authorized by the permit is not
commenced within 180 days from the date of issuance of a permit, or if the
work authorized by the permit is suspended or abandoned at any time after the
work is commenced for a period of 180 days. Before the work can be
recommenced a new permit shall be first obtained, and the fee therefor shall
be one-half of the amount required for a new permit for the work, provided
that the suspension or abandonment has not exceeded 180 days.



      (7)   Fees.



         (a)   Every application shall be accompanied by the
payment of a fee as set by resolution of the City Council from time to time.



         (b)   In the event that an electrical permit is issued
for a specific amount of work and, upon inspection, it is determined that
more work was performed than was authorized on the permit, the permit holder
shall obtain another permit to include all additional work and shall pay only
the unit fees prescribed in this preceding table, provided that no permit
shall be issued for less than as set by resolution approved by City Council.



   (H)   Refund of permit fee. If, within 30 days of the date of
issuance, the holder of an electrical permit decides not to commence the work
described in the permit, he or she may, upon application to the Department of
Community Development, be refunded that portion of the permit fee which is in
excess of $15. The refund of any fee of $15 or less shall not be made.



   (I)   Inspections.



      (1)   Notification; inspection.



         (a)   It shall be the duty of the person doing
electrical work, for which a permit is required, to notify the Electrical
Inspector that the work is ready for inspection. The Electrical Inspector
shall, without undue delay, perform the required inspection. If the work
complies with the code, the Inspector shall so advise the contractor and/or
owner. If the work does not comply with the provisions of this Code, the
Inspector shall post a violation notice in a conspicuous place on or near the
work. The violation notice shall contain the date and results of the
inspection, and when requested, note specific violations. Notices shall not
be removed by any person other than an Electrical Inspector.



         (b)   When the electrical work is completed, the person
doing the electrical work shall notify the Electrical Inspector that the work
is ready for final inspection.



      (2)   Prefabricated assemblies.



         (a)   Where the work requiring an electrical permit will
be wholly or partially enclosed within one or more prefabricated assemblies,
the requirements of divisions (I)(1) above and (I)(3) below pertaining to
inspections by the Building Official, requests therefor and the concealment
of electrical work shall not be applicable to the work if the use of
prefabricated assemblies renders compliance with the requirements
impracticable. In lieu of compliance with the requirements of divisions
(I)(1) above and (I)(3) below, the fabricator shall provide the Building
Official with a certification from the International Code Council,
Underwriter’s Laboratories, Inc. or any approved independent inspection
agency qualified to make the certification stating that the electrical work
wholly or partially enclosed within the prefabricated assembly has been
inspected by the certifying agency and complies with the requirements of this
Code and containing any other information as may be required by the Building
Official.



         (b)   The provisions of division (G) above shall not be
applicable to electrical work required in fabricating prefabricated
assemblies for use or installation outside the corporate limits of the city.
The provisions of division (G) above shall be applicable to electrical work
required for assembly or fabrication of prefabricated assemblies within the
corporate limits or intended to be used within the city.



      (3)   Prefabricated assemblies; covering or concealing work. 
No electrical work for which a permit is required shall be concealed in any
manner from access or sight until the work has been inspected and approved by
the Electrical Inspector.



      (4)   Removal of covering. The Electrical Inspector shall have
the authority to remove or cause the removal of lath, plaster, boarding or
any other obstruction that may prevent the proper inspection of wires or
electrical equipment.



      (5)   Correcting defective work. When an electrical contractor
is notified that defects exist in his or her electrical work, he or she shall
make corrections promptly. Corrections shall be made within ten days after
notification, and if not so made, the electrical contractor shall not be
issued any other permits until the defects are corrected, and approval given
by the Electrical Inspector.



   (J)   Furnishing current prior to approval of wiring. No person or
corporation generating current for electric light, heat or power in the city
shall connect its system or furnish current for electrical purposes to any
building or premises which has not been inspected and approved by the
Electrical Inspector. Any person or corporation shall, upon written notice
from the Electrical Inspector to do so, immediately disconnect the building
or premises from its source of current.



   (K)   Upgrades and new service requirements for existing dwellings.
The Building Official may, upon substantial evidence, determine that a
complete upgrade and new service is required. A new service and complete
upgrade shall be required if the calculated load exceeds the capacity of the
existing service. An upgrade shall be required if new service entrance
conductors and/or service equipment is/are installed.



      (1)   Minimum service. The minimum replacement service size
shall be 100 amperes.



      (2)   Upgrades. All upgrades shall include the following:



         (a)   Conductors shall be protected by the proper size
overcurrent devices;

persons causing or maintaining the violation.



   (C)   If a violation is found to exist on an owner-occupied premises

financial hardship, enforcement shall be held in temporary abeyance until a
means of financing or assistance can be identified.



   (D)   The objective of this Code being the abatement of violations,
persons violating this Code shall be allowed a reasonable amount of time to
voluntarily remedy the violation before action to assess costs or penalties
for a violation is undertaken. Consideration will be given to evidence of a
good faith effort to correct the violation; whether an imminent health or
safety hazard exists; whether the person has previously been notified of or
charged with violations of a similar nature; and other factors.



   (E)   Violations which are not voluntarily remedied may be abated by
an administrative abatement process; the municipal infraction process; by
court proceedings; or by city abatement and assessment of costs therefore
against the responsible party, at the discretion of the city.



   (F)   It is further provided by this Code that if the city judges
that an emergency exists which creates a dangerous and imminent health or
safety hazard to persons, property or the general public which requires

effective immediately or in the time and manner prescribed in the order
itself.

causing or maintaining the violation; and/or

Code may request a hearing on the matter before the Board of Appeals;
provided that a written appeal shall be filed with the Enforcement Officer
within ten days after the notice to abate was served. The appeal shall be
filed on a form provided by the city for that purpose, and shall state the
particular section of the chapter or interpretation thereof being appealed,
and a brief statement of the grounds upon which the appeal is taken. Failure
to file a timely appeal as prescribed herein shall constitute a waiver of the
right to a hearing, and the notice shall become final.

the County District Court by writ of certiorari. The appeal shall be filed
within 30 days from the date of the Board’s decision. The Board’s order
shall not be carried out until the time for filing the writ of certiorari has
expired.

therefore against the property; or

notification; filing costs; and other related administrative costs.
Inoperable or obsolete vehicles which have been impounded may be sold in
accordance with state law. If an inoperable or obsolete vehicle is not sold
or if the proceeds of the sale or redemption are not sufficient to pay the
costs of abatement, storage and sale of the inoperable or obsolete vehicle,
the cost or the balance of the cost may be assessed against the premises in
the same manner as a property tax.



   (C)   Before the assessment of any charges for work done or caused
to be done by the city, the owner of the property proposed to be assessed
shall be provided notice and opportunity for hearing before the City Council.
The notice shall set forth the amount proposed to be assessed, and include a
statement of the time, place and date of hearing.



(Title VI, Ch. 6, § 3.04)



§ 154.44  EMERGENCY ABATEMENT PROCEDURE.

and constitutes an imminent, clear and compelling danger to health, safety or
welfare of persons or property, the Enforcement Officer is authorized to
abate the violation or have it abated without prior notice and opportunity
for hearing. The costs of the action may be assessed against the premises.

and the opportunity for a hearing before the City Council in accordance with

purpose of installing sewer or water connections for buildings, shall be not
be issued until a plumbing permit has first been issued by the Department
work.  Each excavation permit shall list the number of the pertinent
plumbing permit. A cash bond in an amount set by resolution approved by the
City Council shall be provided to the City as part of each excavation permit
that necessitates the cutting and removal of any street or sidewalk pavement
and shall remain on file with the City for a minimum of four years for each
paving cut. Alternatively a minimum insurance performance bond in an amount
set by resolution approved by City Council shall be provided to the City when
a street cut is necessary, and is good for all street cuts within the City by
that contractor.

      Sewer connection and plumbing construction fees.



      Any sewer connection fee that is required by the Urbandale
Sanitary Sewer District or Urbandale-Windsor Heights Sanitary Sewer District
shall be paid at the time that an application is submitted for a building
permit, and no plumbing permit shall be issued for any work until said
connection fee has been paid.  The connection fee shall be the amount that
is required by the applicable Sanitary Sewer District at the time that the
application for a building permit is submitted, unless the District’s
requirements state otherwise.



      Every application for a plumbing permit shall be accompanied by
the payment of a fee as set by Resolution of the City Council from time to
time.



      Where work for which a permit is required by this Code is started
prior to obtaining the permit, the fees above specified shall be doubled. 
The payment of the double fee shall not relieve any persons from complying
with the requirements of this Code in the execution of the work, nor from any
other penalties described herein.



   (F)   Amend § 107 by adding the following:

partially be enclosed within one or more prefabricated assemblies, the
requirements for local licensing and inspections or requests therefore, shall
not be applicable to the work if the use of prefabricated assemblies renders
compliance with the requirements impractical.  In lieu of local inspection,
the fabricator shall provide the Building Official with a certification from
the International Code Council, Underwriter’s Laboratories, Inc., or any
other approved independent inspection agency qualified to make the
certification stating that the plumbing work wholly or partially enclosed
within the prefabricated assembly has been inspected by the certifying agency
and complies with the requirements of this chapter and the state plumbing
regulations, and containing other information as may be required by the
Building Official.  The Building Official may for due cause shown, require
that any plumbing work wholly or partially enclosed within a prefabricated
assembly be exposed to allow inspection.



      Where the fabrication of prefabricated assemblies is performed
outside the corporate limits of the city, the provisions requiring local
inspection shall not be applicable.



      The plumbing permits required for fabrication of prefabricated
assemblies outside of the corporate limits shall be obtained by and issued to
the fabricator, regardless of whether the fabricator holds a plumber’s
license.



   (G)   Amend § 109 entitled Means of Appeal as follows:

§ 156.01  TITLE, PURPOSE, FINDINGS AND INTENT.



   (A)   This chapter may be referred to as the “Parks and Open Space
Ordinance” or “Parkland Ordinance” or “Parkland Code” (herein
referred to as “code,” “chapter” or “parkland ordinance”), and is
adopted pursuant to the provisions of Iowa Code Chapters 18B, 354 and 414,
and any and all other relevant chapters or provisions of the Code of Iowa.



   (B)   In accordance with its Comprehensive Plan and to implement the
Plan, the city has adopted a zoning ordinance to regulate the use of land,
size and configuration of land parcels; height and bulk of buildings;
locations and uses of buildings and structures; size of yards and open
spaces; density of population; and other matters to lessen congestion in the
streets; secure safety from fire, flood, panic and other dangers; promote
public health and general welfare; provide adequate light and air; protect
life and property from flooding; prevent the overcrowding of land and avoid
undue concentrations of population; facilitate the provision of adequate
streets, pedestrianways, water, sewerage, drainage, schools, parks and other
public needs; preserve the natural environment and the character of the city
and its neighborhoods; and to conserve property values throughout the city.



   (C)   (1)   The development of land must be regulated to ensure
that new developments conform to and implement the city’s Comprehensive
Plan and the purposes of its zoning ordinance. The City Council has therefore
adopted subdivision and site plan ordinances to prescribe minimum standards
that are intended to ensure that new developments are properly designed in
accordance with professional standards, and properly improved to provide all
of the new and additional facilities and infrastructure that will benefit and
be needed by the new residents and occupants of such developments.



      (2)   The subdivision ordinance also is an expression of the
City Council’s intent to have the costs for said new facilities and
infrastructure to be equitably apportioned on the basis of the additional
needs that are created by each new development, so new developments will not
usurp the existing services and infrastructure that have been provided for
and financed by existing taxpayers, or necessitate the expenditure of public
funds collected from existing resident taxpayers to provide additional
facilities and infrastructure that benefit the residents and occupants of new
developments.



   (D)   Each and every existing public facility and piece of
infrastructure has a finite capacity, whether it be a sewer, water main,
street, fire station, school, playground or other recreational facility,
park, open space area, floodplain, treatment plant or other facility or
infrastructure. Through the virtues of sound planning and continual
investment, the city’s existing resident taxpayers have customarily
provided significantly more than the minimum capacities that are required by
the existing population of resident taxpayers, in order to assure the
public’s health and safety and freedom from threat or crisis; provide a
high level of public services for their personal benefit; and to attain and
maintain a high quality of life for their personal benefit.



   (E)   The city has found through studies, preparation, and adoption
of its Comprehensive Plan and its Parks and Open Space Plan, that the needs
of its existing resident taxpayers for public parks and open spaces have been
met and continue to be met due its considerable and ongoing annual
investments in improvements, maintenance, upkeep and repairs, and operations
of its existing public parks and open space system.



   (F)   New residential developments are being added within the city
and many new homes are being erected and occupied annually within the new
developments.  It is generally understood and accepted that the new streets,
sewers, water mains, sidewalks and other facilities and infrastructure that
adjoin each lot within a new development directly benefit and increase the
value of the lot. The new streets, et al., would not be needed if not for the
creation of and subsequent building on and occupancy of said lots, and the
lots could not be built upon, occupied and used if such new facilities and
infrastructure were not constructed in conjunction with and as part of the
new development. Accordingly, it is found to be reasonable and proper for the
developers of new developments to bear the full costs for such new facilities
and infrastructure, and the developers are expected to pass such full costs
passed on to the purchasers and occupants of the lots in the new
developments, as part of the lots’ purchase price.



   (G)   Developers and the purchasers/occupants of lots in new
developments are less cognizant of and may be unwilling to recognize or
acknowledge the full benefits and increased value that the new developments
derive from the service capacities being provided by existing public
facilities and infrastructure that may not be located within or near a new
development, and that may not exclusively serve a single new development.
Each new development generates new users, and each new user consumes a
portion of the existing capacities of such off-site facilities and
infrastructure at a rate that usually is at least commensurate to that of the
existing resident taxpayers. Any single new user will not overwhelm the
existing capacity of any of the city’s off-site facilities and
infrastructure and cause catastrophic failure, especially given that more
than the minimum capacities required by the existing resident taxpayers has
been created and maintained by said existing resident taxpayers for their
personal benefit and quality of life. Nonetheless, each new user of existing
facilities and infrastructure does usurp existing service capacity and
infrastructure that had been provided for and financed by existing resident
taxpayers for their own benefit and enjoyment, and thereby deprives the
existing resident taxpayers of benefits they had paid for and previously
enjoyed.



   (H)   (1)   As new developments continue to be created,
eventually any and all available capacity of the existing off-site facilities
and infrastructure will be usurped by the purchasers and occupants of the new
developments. Although additional facilities and capacities may not become
necessary solely because of the added use by any one new user or development,
they do become necessary because of the cumulative effect of numerous
additional users generated by a progression of new developments over an
indefinite period of time. Additional facilities and expansions of
infrastructure capacities inevitably become necessary to restore the level of
benefits previously enjoyed by existing resident taxpayers: said additional
facilities and capacities would not be necessary if not for the new residents
and occupants of new developments.



      (2)   Therefore, the City Council finds that it is found to be
fair, reasonable and appropriate for each and every developer of each and
every new development to bear the fair share of the costs for new off-site
facilities and additional infrastructure capacities that are or will be made
necessary by the purchasers/occupants of each and every new development; for
the costs of maintaining or restoring the previously existing benefits that
are usurped from existing resident taxpayers to be fully accounted for in the
sales prices of parcels in the new development; and for such new facilities
and infrastructure to be added without creating costs or other burdens of any
kind on the existing resident taxpayers. The City Council also finds that it
is appropriate for such infrastructure capacity to be provided as part of,
and in conjunction with, the design and improvement of each new development
when it is created, to replace the existing capacity that has been or will be
consumed as soon as possible, in order to minimize the burden and
inconvenience that new developments impose on existing resident taxpayers.



   (I)   As with all other existing public facilities and
infrastructure, existing public parks and open spaces have a finite capacity
that is usurped by the occupants of new residential developments and that
create needs for additional public open space and parks, both land for such
facilities and for park infrastructure improvements thereto. Therefore, the
City Council finds it reasonable and appropriate for additional public park
and open space facilities and capacities to be provided by each and every new
development, in the same manner that other public infrastructure is required
to be provided in new developments by the subdivision and site plan
ordinances, in order to maintain the existing, adequate level of public open
space and park facilities within the city, and to prevent the residents of
new developments from usurping existing public parks and open spaces from
resident taxpayers.



   (J)   The acquisition of land that is suited for use as public parks
and open space, of sufficient size, shape, character and location, is the
most-critical goal that must be achieved in order to provide an adequate
supply of appropriate public neighborhood parks and open spaces that can meet
the residents of new developments, and mitigate their impacts on existing
facilities and lands. Such land should primarily be within or in close
proximity to the new residential developments that they are intended to
serve, while remaining mindful to the suitability of the available land and
to the ability to provide more and better recreational opportunities on a
single, larger parcel of land than on two or more smaller parcels of the same
cumulative area. Once sufficient land has been obtained, the next goal will
be the construction or installation of improvements to the new park or open
space that will fulfill the most basic recreational and park needs of a broad
spectrum of new users of all ages and abilities, while at the same time
showing a bias towards serving youthful new users in most cases.



   (K)   This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, annul,
impair or interfere with any existing easements, covenants, deed
restrictions, agreements, ordinances, rules, regulations or permits
previously adopted or issued pursuant to law. However, wherever this chapter
imposes greater restrictions or requirements, the provisions of this chapter
shall govern.



   (L)   The provisions of this chapter shall be interpreted and
applied as minimum requirements, shall be liberally construed in favor of the
city, and shall not be deemed a limitation or repeal of any other power
granted by the Code of Iowa.



   (M)   If a section, clause, provision or portion of this chapter is
adjudged unconstitutional, or invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction,
such judgment shall not affect the remainder of this chapter.

§ 156.04  DETERMINATION OF LAND OR INFRASTRUCTURE.



   (A)   Procedure. The procedure for determining whether land is to be
dedicated or park infrastructure improvements is to be constructed, or a
combination thereof, to satisfy the requirements of this chapter shall be as
follows.



      (1)   Development proposal. Prior to filing a preliminary plat
or site plan for a proposed residential development, the developer shall
request the Department of Community Development to schedule a pre-application
conference for the purpose of discussing whether a land dedication should be
proposed to satisfy the requirements of this chapter, or park infrastructure
constructed or installed in lieu of a land dedication, in addition to
discussion of other requirements and procedures pertaining to development of
the property.



      (2)   Parks and Recreation Commission. When a preliminary plat
or site plan is received for study, a copy of said development proposal shall
be forwarded to the Parks and Recreation Commission, together with a request
for said Commission to review same and make recommendations and suggestions
to the City Council with regard to the placement, size, design and location
of a land dedication or the construction of park infrastructure, or a
combination thereof, to satisfy the requirements of this chapter. The Parks
and Recreation Commission shall be allowed not less than 30 days to make said
recommendations and forward same to the City Council with a copy to the
Planning and Zoning Commission. Failure of the Parks and Recreation
Commission to make recommendations and suggestions within the aforementioned
30 days shall in no way serve to delay, postpone or reject the plat or site
plan, nor to waive the requirements of this chapter. However, the City
Council may choose to act upon the plat or site plan after said 30 days
without having received the Commission’s recommendations and suggestions,
and the Commission’s opportunity to recommend and comment shall thereby be
extinguished.



   (B)   City Council.



      (1)   At the time the preliminary plat or site plan is
considered by the City Council, said Council shall determine whether to
require a dedication of land within the subdivision or development,
construction of park infrastructure in lieu of a land dedication, or a
combination thereof.



      (2)   The City Council shall have the sole authority to
determine how the requirements of this chapter are to be satisfied, and the
nature, location and amount of land or infrastructure that is to be dedicated
under the terms of this chapter.



   (C)   Determination.



      (1)   In determining whether the requirements of this chapter
are to be satisfied by a land dedication, construction of park
infrastructure, or a combination thereof, the Parks and Recreation Commission
and Council shall consider the following:



         (a)   The Comprehensive Plan and the Parks and
Recreation Plan, and how the proposed development may relate to any public
parks and open spaces proposed by such plans, compatible with the
Comprehensive Plan;



         (b)   The anticipated character and recreational needs
of the new households that may reasonably be expected to occupy the proposed
development;



         (c)   The suitability, location and configuration of the
proposed land dedication for park and open space purposes, and whether it
will meet the needs of the initial residents of the proposed development, by
reason of topographic and geological conditions, natural vegetation,
location, access, and size and shape;



         (d)   Whether additional, contiguous land may be
dedicated or otherwise acquired at some future date to provide a larger
public neighborhood park or open space that could better satisfy the needs of
the new developments; and



         (e)   Other relevant information.



      (2)   The City Council’s determination of whether the
developer shall dedicate land or construct and dedicate park infrastructure,
or a combination thereof, shall be conclusive and final.



§ 156.05  LAND DEDICATION.



   (A)   When the City Council determines, pursuant to this chapter and
the advice of counsel, that a land dedication for public open space or park
is necessary and appropriate to satisfy the requirements of this chapter, and
that a land dedication is feasible, practical and compliant with the city’s
Comprehensive Plan and Parks and Open Space Plan, the amount of land that is
to be dedicated for such purposes shall be determined by one of the following
methods.



      (1)   The total area of the proposed development shall be
determined by excluding existing public street rights-of-way, whether such
existing rights-of-way are held by deed or easement, and the minimum required
land dedication shall be 10% of said total land area. Such 10% land
dedication may be any combination of developable land that is suited for use
as an active recreation area; primarily suited for passive recreation or
greenbelt; and land that is deemed undevelopable or impractical to develop by
reason of natural conditions; shape or size; or economic factors, and that
accordingly may be suitable only or primarily for use as a public greenbelt
or other open space uses, if the City Council deems that the dedication is
acceptable and satisfies the requirements of this chapter.



      (2)   Alternatively, a developer may request that the minimum
amount of land that is to be dedicated to satisfy the requirements of this
chapter be calculated in accordance with the following.



         (a)   The residential development shall dedicate an
active recreation area that is not less than five acres in size together with
an additional land dedication of two and one-half acres that is suitable for
use as either an active or passive recreation area as defined by this
chapter, for each 1,000 of population that is forecast to live within the
completed development at the time of its initial occupancy. The forecast
population shall be calculated in accordance with the following division
(A)(2)(b) below.



         (b)   The City Council hereby finds and affirms that the
average household size is significantly greater in new residential
developments than it is in established, mature neighborhoods, for reasons
that include, but are not limited to, the socio-economic characteristics of
home-buying households. Historically, household sizes have been found to
decline as the residential development ages over decades, to become smaller
than the city average and then increase moderately to approximate the average
household size. By the time that the household sizes have declined to match
or be less than the city average, the original park infrastructure will have
exceeded its life expectancy, and will be replaced by new infrastructure
funded by public tax revenues, but at all times all land dedicated in
accordance with this chapter will continue to be needed and necessary for
park purposes, as set forth in this chapter.



      Therefore, the population that is forecast to live within the
completed development at the time of its initial occupancy shall be
determined by multiplying the average household size as enumerated in the
most-recent decennial census or other census count for the city for which all
necessary data is available, within a census tract or multiple census blocks
containing the greatest percentage of housing units that were constructed
during the decade immediately preceding the most-recent census. Such tract or
blocks shall be selected and analyzed according to housing type, and average
household sizes determined for each housing type from said census
information. Such average household sizes shall then be multiplied by the
number of housing units of each type that are proposed in the new development
to determine the forecast populations by housing type in the new development
at the time of its initial occupancy. The forecast populations of each
housing type shall then be added together to derive the total forecast
population for the new residential development, to be used in the formula
described in division (A)(2)(a) above.



         (c)   1.   For the 2010 Census, the following average
household sizes shall be used for the calculations of this section:



               a.   Single-family detached dwelling unit:
3.49 persons/occupied unit;



               b.   Single-family attached dwelling unit:
1.92 persons/occupied unit; and



               c.   Multi-family dwelling unit: 1.97
persons/occupied unit.



            2.   The average household sizes that are listed
herein shall be updated to reflect the enumerations of future decennial
censuses or other census counts as such data becomes available.



   (B)   As an option to the two methods set forth in division (A)
above, a developer may submit an alternative proposal that fully complies
with the intent and purposes and of this chapter, but may not fully comply
with the methods of calculation that is set forth in division (A) above. The
developer shall have the burden of demonstrating and proving that the
alternative proposal meets or exceeds this chapter’s prescribed methods of
compliance. Any such proposal shall be first reviewed by city staff and a
report made to the Parks and Recreation Commission, which shall provide a
recommendation for action on the proposal to the City Council.



   (C)   The location and configuration of land that is to be dedicated
to satisfy the minimum requirements of this chapter shall be compliant with
the city’s Comprehensive Plan and Parks and Open Space Plan, as may be
determined and approved by the City Council. The City may require that land
that is to be dedicated under this chapter be located and configured to allow
the dedications of two or more developments, present or future, to be
aggregated to form a single, large park dedication parcel since larger
recreation areas usually allow more and better park facilities to be provided.



   (D)   Land that is intended to provide required storm water
detention or retention shall not be credited towards satisfying any of the
park land dedication requirements of this chapter, unless it is graded and
improved in a manner that makes it satisfactory and suited for use as an
active recreation area. Land or area that is required to be provided as a
buffer yard or to satisfy minimum on-site landscaped open space requirements
of by the zoning, subdivision or site planning codes shall not be counted
towards satisfying the requirements of this chapter.



   (E)   Land dedications shall be conveyed to the city by a properly
executed warranty deed without cost to the city, prior to the recording of a
final subdivision plat or plat of survey, or in the case of a site plan,
prior to the issuance of any building permits.



§ 156.06  PARK INFRASTRUCTURE IMPROVEMENTS IN LIEU OF LAND DEDICATION.



   (A)   (1)   If the City Council determines that a dedication of
land is not feasible or practical within a new development, the developer
shall construct or install park infrastructure improvements that are equal in
value to that of the minimum land dedication, had a land dedication been
accepted, within an existing or proposed city park that can serve the new
development.



      (2)   In all cases where the City Council determines and
directs that park infrastructure is to constructed or provided in lieu of a
land dedication, whether all or in part, the minimum value of the park
infrastructure that is to be provided shall be determined in the following
manner.



         (a)   The Council shall first determine the amount of
land that would be required to be dedicated in accordance with §
156.05(A)(1).



         (b)   The cash value of said land dedication shall be
determined by multiplying the total purchase price or cost of all the land in
the proposed development by 10%; provided, that the total purchase price or
cost is the current fair and reasonable value of the entire property. If the
total purchase price does not reflect the current fair and reasonable value
of the land, the fair value of said land shall be determined by an impartial
appraisal, and in such manner as may be designated by the City Council, cost
for said appraisal to be shared equally between developer and city.



   (B)   A developer may voluntarily choose to pay a fee to the city in
the amount determined under this section, in lieu of constructing park
infrastructure. Any such fee shall be deposited and used only in full accord
with § 156.08.



   (C)   If park infrastructure is being provided in lieu of a land
dedication, it shall be completed prior to the recording of the final plat,
or in the case of a site plan prior to the issuance of any building permits,
unless surety is provided in favor of the city to guarantee that the park
infrastructure will be installed at a later date. If a fee is voluntarily
given in lieu of a dedication or construction of park infrastructure, it
shall be deposited with the city prior to the recording of a plat or issuance
of any building permits.



§ 156.07  PARKLAND DEVELOPMENT AND MAINTENANCE.



   (A)   The city shall be responsible for the development and
maintenance of land and park infrastructure that has been dedicated to
satisfy the requirements of this chapter, for its perpetual use by and
availability to the public recreational purposes or open space. The City
Council shall have the sole discretion and authority to determine the
specific manner and extent of such public utilization and access,
commensurate with the character and composition of such land and its natural
resources.



   (B)   The developer shall not be responsible for its maintenance or
any liability thereon, except for any ground water contamination or hazard
that was caused or knowingly allowed to exist by said person.



§ 156.08  SEPARATE ACCOUNT.



   (A)   Any fees or other funds that are collected by the city for the
purpose of satisfying the requirements of this chapter shall be deposited in
a separate account, and shall be used only to acquire or develop new public
parks, open spaces or park infrastructure that most-directly benefits the
residential development from which the funds were obtained, and as shall be
approved, ordered and directed by the City Council. The City Council may, at
its sole discretion, request or direct the Parks and Recreation Commission to
make a recommendation for the expenditure of said funds.



   (B)   Any and all interest accumulated from such funds shall accrue
to the separate account, and shall be used only for acquisition and
development of public parks and open spaces in the same manner as the funds
that generated the interest to the extent practical, but in all cases to
provide additional public parks, open space and park infrastructure that will
serve and benefit the residents of the developments that provided such funds.



   (C)   No such funds or accumulated interest shall be used to
replace, repair or maintain any park infrastructure that exists or did exist
at any prior time, unless the City Council finds that the previously existing
infrastructure was replaced by other infrastructure that remains in place and
in good condition, or otherwise finds that expenditure of such funds or
interest to re-establish the previously existing infrastructure does in fact
thereby constitute and provide new and additional recreational opportunities
and services to the residents of a new development from which such funds or
interest were generated.



§ 156.09  EXCEPTION FOR PRIVATE COMMON RECREATIONAL FACILITIES.



   In lieu of dedicating public land or providing public park
infrastructure, private common parks, open spaces and park infrastructure may
be dedicated to and owned by a homeowners’ association or like entity if
such land and infrastructure completely meet the needs of the residents it is
intended to serve and satisfies all of the requirements of this chapter. Such
land and improvements shall be permanently reserved, held and maintained for
the park, open space and recreational uses for which they were provided, and
their purposes or use shall not be altered, nor shall they be conveyed,
converted, diminished or eliminated, except by express written consent by the
City Council.

(1999 Code, Title VII, Ch. 12, §5)



§ 157.04  PROCEDURES.



   (A)   Pre-application conference. Whenever a developer proposes a
development, the developer shall contact the Department of Community
Development to schedule a pre-application conference. The pre- application
conference shall include the developer or representatives, representatives
from the Department of Community Development and the Engineering Department,
and such other city departments that express a desire to be included in such
pre-application conferences on a regular basis, or that are deemed to be
helpful or necessary by the Department of Community Development. The purpose
of the pre-application conference shall be to acquaint the city staff with
the proposed development, and to acquaint the developer with the procedures
and requirements of this code and concerns and regulations that pertain to
the development. The developer shall furnish a reasonably specific
description of the property to be developed at the time of requesting the
pre-application conference, and is encouraged to prepare a conceptual site
plan for the proposed development for discussion purposes prior to the
conference.



   (B)   Site plan submittal. Following one or more pre-application
conferences, a standard or minor site plan shall be prepared by the developer
and submitted to the Department of Community Development in accordance with
§ 157.05.



   (C)   Site plan and minor site plan review.



      (1)   Site plan. The Department of Community Development shall
review the site plan and shall promptly convey one copy of it to each of the
Engineering, Building and Fire Departments, Water Utility, Urbandale Sanitary
Sewer District, Urbandale-Windsor Heights Sewer District, and any other
Department or public utility company that has expressed a desire to review
site plans on a regular basis, for their review and recommendations. The
reviewing departments and other entities shall review the site plan for
conformance to all of the city codes, ordinances and specifications that they
customarily enforce, and for conformance to applicable professional
standards, and shall forward their recommendations for action on the Site
Plan to the Department of Community Development for inclusion in a
consolidated, written staff report and recommendation that is to be prepared
by the Department of Community Development and presented to the Planning and
Zoning Commission for consideration and action, and forwarded to the City
Council following the Commission’s action.



      (2)   Minor site plan. The Department of Community Development
shall review the minor site plan and shall promptly convey a copy of it to
each of the Building and Engineering Departments, and to any other
Departments or entities whose review is deemed necessary or appropriate by
the Department of Community Development. The reviewing departments shall
review the minor site plan for conformance to all of the city codes,
ordinances and specifications that they customarily enforce, and for
conformance to applicable professional standards, and shall forward their
recommendations for action on the minor site plan to the Department of
Community Development for preparation of a consolidated, written staff
recommendation that shall be presented to the developer. A minor site plan
may be approved administratively by the Department of Community Development
if it complies with all requirements and recommendations, provided that a
developer may request that the minor site plan be presented to the Planning
and Zoning Commission and City Council for consideration in accordance with
the customary procedures for a site plan, or that the Department of Community
Development may choose to present the minor site plan to the Commission and
Council for their consideration and action.



   (D)   Action on a site plan.



      (1)   The Department of Community Development shall provide a
copy of the written staff report and the consolidated staff recommendations
from all of the city departments and other reviewing entities to the
developer concurrently with or shortly after said staff report and
recommendations have been provided to the Planning and Zoning Commission.
Staff may recommend that the site plan be approved, approved subject to
conditions and revisions or that the site plan application be denied for
reasons that shall be set forth in the written staff recommendation. Site
plans shall be reviewed and presented to the Planning and Zoning Commission
in accordance with the submittal and meeting schedules issued each year by
the Department of Community Development.



      (2)   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall review the
recommendations of city staff and act on the proposed site plan in a timely
manner, and may recommend to the City Council that it approve, approve
subject to conditions or revisions, or deny the site plan application,
whether or not such recommendations are in accordance with the
recommendations of city staff. If the Commission does not act on the site
plan in a timely manner, the developer may request the City Council to
consider the site plan and recommendations of city staff without the
provision of any recommendations by the Planning and Zoning Commission. The
Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council may, at their discretion,
hold public hearings on a site plan and may provide notice to nearby property
owners or tenants in whatever manner or amount of time that the Commission or
Council deems appropriate.



      (3)   Once a site plan has been reviewed and acted on by the
Planning and Zoning Commission, the Department of Community Development shall
forward the Commission’s recommendations and the city staff report and
recommendations to the City Council for consideration at their next available
meeting, subject to any notifications that may be directed by the Commission
or Council and revisions to the site plan to satisfy all recommended
revisions and conditions, if the City Council desires to have all such
revisions completed to city staffs satisfaction prior to the Council’s
consideration of the site plan. The City Council may adopt the
recommendations of city staff; recommendations of the Commission if at
variance with city staff on one or more points; or act freely of their own
volition, provided that the Council shall have no authority to waive any
requirements of the Zoning Code, or of any other city code unless provisions
are expressly set out in the pertinent code to grant the Council the powers
to waive or make exception to or from such code.



      (4)   Upon approval by the City Council and filing of revised
plans and specifications that satisfy all conditions of approval, the
Department of Community Development shall provide a stamped approved copy of
the site plan to each of the reviewing departments, and to the developer if
requested. No permits shall be issued for any single-family attached
residence, multi-family residence, commercial or industrial use, or other
development until the site plan shall have been approved as provided herein.

         (a)   A complete set of plans shall generally consist of
not less than one separate sheet for each of the following: a cover sheet
containing the development’s legal description and other project
information, professional certifications, et al., and a qualifying vicinity
map if there is sufficient space; a vicinity map on a separate sheet, if
there is not sufficient space on the cover sheet; dimension plan; grading
plan; utility plan; erosion control plan; landscaping plan; and construction
details, if detail drawings are necessary to appropriately depict portions of
the development at a larger scale due to complexity, size or other factors.
The submittal does not need to include a full set of specifications; “shop
drawings” or other extensive details; or bid documents or proposed
contracts;



         (b)   The site plan shall be drawn and printed at a

date of preparation, dates of all revisions, north arrow, scale and the legal
description and assigned address for the development lot;



         (c)   The boundaries of the development lot shall be
clearly marked on all of the plan sheets, with bearing and dimension data
provided on the dimension plan for each boundary segment, and with curve data
provided in a table. If the development lot does not consist of one or more
complete platted lots, a plat of survey shall be prepared and included with
the submittal. If a school district boundary runs through the development lot
or any of the properties required to be included on the vicinity map, said
boundary shall be clearly shown and labeled;



         (d)   Floodway and floodway fringe boundaries, and base
flood elevations (“BFE”) shall be accurately and clearly plotted on each
plan sheet from the best available information, as defined and required by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), together with any areas of
localized flooding and wetlands. If no FEMA-determined flood hazard areas,
areas of localized flooding or wetlands exist within the development lot, the
developer shall certify on the plans that none exist; and



         (e)   The vicinity map shall be at a legible scale that
shows the boundaries of all parcels located within 300 feet or one city block
of the boundaries of the property where the development is proposed,
whichever is greater; accurate locations of all buildings and site
improvements on said parcels; land use and zoning of all of said parcels;
legal descriptions, names of owners and others having a propriety interest in
said parcels, and addresses of the parcels and of all those persons having
any proprietary interest, if different from the parcel addresses.



      (2)   Accompanying documents and information shall include:



         (a)   An application fee, in the amount set by this code
or as subsequently set by resolution of the City Council, together with
payment of any other administrative costs and impact fees that may be legally
established by the City Council;



         (b)   A copy of the National Pollutant Discharge
Elimination System (NPDES) permit if required, or completed draft permit as
the case may be, authorizing the direct discharge of runoff from the
development, all to be in accordance with the requirements of the Iowa
Department of Natural Resources (DNR) and U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency (EPA);



         (c)   Two copies of architectural elevations for all
sides of each proposed building with general specifications for the proposed
building materials noted on said elevations; and two copies of the floor
plans for all stories of each building, showing the different areas of use
and the gross floor areas for each use and for the entire building. The
elevations and floor plans shall be drawn to scale and fully dimensioned, but
may be conceptual in nature, provided that they are in substantial
conformance with the final elevations and floor plans that are subsequently
submitted with the application for a building permit. A substantial deviation
between the conceptual and final elevations and floor plans that are
submitted with an application for a building permit, as determined at the
sole discretion of the Director of Community Development, shall be grounds
for declaring an approval of a site plan to be null and void and to require
the development to be resubmitted for site plan approval;



         (d)   A traffic study may be required at the sole
discretion of the City Engineer, for such matters and of such scope that may
be directed by the City Engineer;



         (e)   Soil tests and construction plans for improvements
such as a retaining wall that have been certified by an engineer who is
licensed in the state or other licensed professional, may be required at the
sole discretion of the Community Development or Engineering Departments; and



         (f)   Legal documents using the city’s standard forms
for such purposes if available, to establish easements for shared accesses,
public or common private infrastructure, or similar purposes; to create an

project information; vicinity map; and sufficient sheets to clearly and
legibly show all necessary dimensions, existing topography and proposed
grading, utilities and service lines, erosion control measures and
landscaping.



         (a)   Plans shall be drawn and printed at a scale that
is not smaller than one inch equals 50 feet, and shall include a date of
preparation and dates of all revisions, north arrow and scale. The boundaries
of the development lot shall be clearly marked on all of the plan sheets,
with bearing and dimension data provided on the dimension plan for each

(1999 Code, Title VII, Ch. 12, § 4)  Penalty, see § 157.99



§ 157.06  DESIGN STANDARDS.



   The following design standards shall be construed as minimum
requirements. More stringent standards may be applied due to the unique
characteristics and circumstances of any individual development lot, as the
city unilaterally deems to be appropriate and necessary to ensure that each
and every development produces sound and orderly growth and improves public
health, safety and welfare throughout the city.



   (A)   Development shall conform to the Comprehensive Plan; Zoning
Code, Statewide Urban Design and Specifications (SUDAS) as adopted and
amended by the city; and all other applicable city and state regulations.
Hickman Road, Merle Hay Road and a portion of Douglas Avenue are controlled
access streets to which access is allowed only by city ordinance in
accordance with § 99.053, or by obtaining a permit from the Iowa Department
of Transportation (herein, “IDOT”).



   (B)   Development shall not endanger health, safety or general
welfare of the public or of persons residing or working on nearby properties,
and shall not impair an adequate supply of light and air to nearby properties.



   (C)   Development shall be designed to locate and configure
buildings and other structures, and other site improvements within a
development lot in a manner that will not unduly diminish or impair the use
and enjoyment of nearby properties. Development shall provide and maintain in
perpetuity buffer yards, landscaping, and screening; access controls;
pedestrian, bicycle and mass transit accommodations; turn lanes, medians and
traffic signalization; directional signs and pavement markings; on-site
lighting; adequate drainage and sewage systems; sufficient water supply for
both fire protection and domestic consumption; and all other on- and off-site
improvements that the city finds to be necessary when approving a site plan
in order to implement this code.



   (D)   Vehicle access and circulation shall be designed and
configured to minimize and reduce traffic congestion and safety hazards,
including but not limited to compliance with the following.



      (1)   Driveways and approaches shall conform to all city codes
and specifications, including but not limited to width and configuration;
providing nominal minimum spacing of 600 feet between full movement accesses
and of 300 feet between any access and right-turn only or other
limited-movement accesses to public arterial and collector streets; aligning
with existing drives or designated access points on the opposing frontage;
providing cross-access easements to allow accesses to public streets to be
shared by multiple properties; and by adding right and left turn lanes to the
public street unless such requirement is waived by the City Engineer.



      (2)   Existing drives and approaches that do not fully comply
with current codes or specifications shall be brought into compliance to the
maximum practical extent according to the extent of modification or
redevelopment of existing site improvements, with order of priority for
compliance given to providing a separation of not less than 300 feet from all
street intersections as measured from the centerline of the intersecting
street to the centerline of the closest access point; compliance with a
300-foot minimum spacing between access points, including those located on
other properties; and if the preceding criteria cannot be met, by aligning
with existing drives or designated access points on the opposing frontage and
reducing the total number of accesses by eliminating existing accesses and
creating cross-access easements to allow accesses to be shared by multiple
properties. Be it provided that, the requirements of this division (D)(2)
shall not be applied in a manner that denies a property from retaining a
single existing legally nonconforming access drive on each street frontage.



      (3)   (a)   Driveway approaches for nonresidential and
multi-family residential developments shall be configured to have two exit
lanes with a minimum width of 12 feet and one entrance lane with a minimum
width of 14 feet, separated by a raised median having a minimum width of two
feet that may be of a mountable, half-height curb design, unless the City
Engineer determines that an alternative design is acceptable or required.
Lanes shall be marked and directional arrows and traffic signs provided as
deemed appropriate by the City Engineer, and all traffic direction signs and
markings shall be maintained in perpetuity.



         (b)   Accesses that are restricted to right-turn only or
other limited traffic movements shall incorporate a raised median within the
driveway approach if the public street does not have a raised median or other
physical means of preventing the prohibited traffic movements, or if the City
Engineer deems a raised median or other traffic control installations to be
necessary for such purposes. If the median or other traffic control
provisions do not satisfactorily limit vehicular access in the manner that
was required or intended, the City Engineer may require any such median or
traffic control provision to be modified or replaced with another design or
method of control, or for the access to be eliminated entirely.



         (c)   Gated entrance drives shall be constructed with
sufficient storage capacity to prevent queuing vehicles from encroaching into
a public street right-of-way or from obstructing any sidewalk or bicycle
trail or lane, but in all cases shall have not less than 75 feet of queuing
space between the gate and said points.



      (4)   On-site circulation aisles, drives, drive-up facilities,
delivery and loading berths and maneuvering aisles therefore, and parking
shall be designed and arranged so as to not cause or encourage vehicles to
queue or maneuver into a street right-of-way or a common private access drive.



   (E)   (1)   A continuous raised portland cement concrete
(“PCC”) curb having a minimum height of six inches shall be constructed
on the perimeters of all parking areas, delivery and loading berths,
circulation aisles, access drives and landscape islands to control drainage
and vehicles. Said curbing shall be installed not less than two feet beyond
minimum landscape and buffer yard setbacks to prevent parked vehicles from
encroaching into said minimum landscape setbacks or buffer yards, and said
two feet of overhang width may be counted as part of the minimum depth of
adjoining parking stalls. Landscape islands within parking areas shall have a
minimum dimension of ten feet and a minimum area of 300 square feet. Grades
within parking lot bays shall not exceed a 5% maximum slope.



      (2)   Parking areas, circulation aisles and access drives
shall be maintained free and clear of potholes, spalling, joint failures,
full-depth fracturing or failures and significant surface irregularities or
defects. Paved areas shall be resurfaced or overlaid from time to time as
found to be necessary by the Engineering or Community Development Departments
to maintain a surface that is reasonably smooth and free from tripping
hazards, and that is not unsightly because of repeated patching and repairs.
The Engineering or Community Development Departments may require structural
problems or defects, as may be evidenced by potholes or full-depth failures,
to be repaired by full-depth replacement of pavement.



   (F)   Public sidewalks shall be constructed along the frontages of
all streets and common private access drives. On-site pedestrian and bicycle
circulation systems shall be constructed of PCC or other city-approved
materials in landscaped corridors that connect the development to public
sidewalks and pathways and to mass transit stops, and shall be maintained to
provide safe, convenient and attractive pedestrian and bicycle access. Walks
shall have a minimum width of four feet in all cases, and a minimum width of
six feet when adjacent to parking to provide for vehicle overhang, and shall
be fully compliant with SUDAS standards as adopted and amended by the city.



   (G)   (1)   Development shall be designed with adequate water
mains and fire hydrants, sanitary sewers, storm sewers and surface water
flowage channels, and storm water detention to protect the public health,
safety and welfare and to prevent the overload of any existing public
infrastructure. Development may be required to extend or expand public
infrastructure, or to be delayed until such extension or expansion can be
funded and constructed by the city or other public body, if deemed necessary
by the city.



      (2)   Impervious surfaces shall not be allowed to drain into a
street or common access drive. Driveway approaches shall have sufficient
crown, and a crown of not less than eight inches above the gutter elevation
in any case, to control street drainage and prevent storm runoff from leaving
the right-of-way. Paved areas shall not be designed to sheet-drain into
pervious areas, or to be conveyed by open gutters or channels except in the
case of on-site stormwater management systems such as those that are designed
to facilitate the absorption or infiltration of runoff, or if it is not
possible to collect and pipe runoff from the paving in an on-site storm sewer
system due to the lack of public storm sewer and extraordinarily flat
topography that voids all reasonable alternatives. Provisions shall be made
and maintained for surface passage of runoff from storms that exceed the
design capacity of the storm sewer system, without causing flooding or damage
to public streets or nearby properties. Surface water flowage easements shall
be provided over such areas of flow, using the city’s standard forms of
easement. Storm sewer and surface water flowage easements shall be provided
using the city’s standard forms of easement over any drainageways that
convey any off-site runoff through the lot, of sufficient dimensions to cover
the flow from a storm having a 1% chance of occurrence in any single year.



      (3)   Storm detention shall not be located within minimum
required buffer yards or landscape setbacks, unless the detention is located
within a subsurface structure of sufficient depth below the surface to allow
required landscaping to be planted and maintained over such buried detention.
Storm detention shall not be located within parking areas, loading areas or
drives unless the detention pool’s maximum depth is less than six inches.
Low flows shall be piped through detention basins whenever possible, and a
paved trickle channel shall be provided to convey the low flows if piping is
not practical, to facilitate maintenance of the basin unless the basin is
expressly designed to facilitate the absorption or infiltration of runoff.
Storm detention shall not be located within a FEMA-designated 1 % floodplain.



      (4)   Fire hydrants shall be provided in the number and
locations required by the Water Utility and Fire Department, whether they are
to be added to a public water main or located on the lot. On-site water mains
that supply one or more fire hydrants shall be a minimum of eight inches in
diameter, or larger if increased size is determined to be necessary to
provide necessary fire flows. Hydrants shall be supplied with appropriate
connections as may be specified by the Water Utility and Fire Department. All
hydrants and valves shall be maintained in good working order. Due diligence
shall be taken to prevent on-site mains and appurtenances from leaking, and
any leaks or breaks that occur shall be repaired immediately, wherever they
may be located beyond the public main.



   (H)   (1)   Development shall be designed with regard for
existing topography and drainage patterns, by blending lot grading smoothly
into the land forms on adjoining properties and by controlling runoff. If it
is necessary to discharge surface runoff onto an adjoining property,
provisions shall be made to maintain the general drainage pattern as it
existed prior to development and to dissipate erosive energy from any
concentrations of runoff.



      (2)   An attempt should be made to preserve mature upland
forestation and other natural vegetation and geological features, while
recognizing developments’ need to substantially regrade lots and install
infrastructure to comply with all city codes and regulations, and that the
probability for the survival of trees and other existing vegetation
post-development may be greatly diminished by such necessary site
modifications and disturbances. Where preservation does not appear to be
practical, development landscaping should select overstory tree species that
will create or reestablish the dominant tree species that would be native to
the environ.



      (3)   All soil erosion, whether by wind, water, mechanical or
other means, shall be controlled in accordance with all applicable standards
and regulations.



      (4)   Vegetated areas shall have a 2% minimum slope to
maintain positive drainage throughout the lot, unless subsurface drainage is
provided.



   (I)   Wood, vegetation and other organic materials of any kind shall
not be buried in any portion of a development lot. Debris, junk, and rubbish
of all kinds, whether organic or inorganic, shall not be left or deposited on
any street and shall be completely removed from the development lot prior to
issuance of a final certificate of occupancy and zoning compliance for a
development.



   (J)   (1)   No overhead or exposed wiring shall be allowed, and
all utility services shall be placed underground. The installation or
maintenance of lighting that could be confused with warning or emergency
lights or traffic controls shall be unlawful.



      (2)   All lighting, except warning or emergency lights and
traffic signals, shall consist of cutoff fixtures that are designed and
installed in a manner that prevents light from spilling beyond any property
line, and such fixtures shall also be designed and installed in a manner that
sufficiently obscures the light source to prevent glare into public streets
or nearby residential areas. Lighting shall be designed and maintained to
avoid pockets of very high or low levels of illumination. Lighting fixtures
shall not be mounted on poles, buildings or other structures at a height of
more than 30 feet, as measured from the grade to the top of the fixture,
unless glare and spill can be satisfactorily controlled.



      (3)   Spotlights and floodlights shall not be allowed, except
for architectural highlighting, such as to wash a wall or illuminate
architectural details, and if allowed for such purpose the fixtures shall be
carefully aimed to prevent glare or light spill.



      (4)   A light level of one minimum average maintained
horizontal foot candle, as measured at the average point of illumination
between the brightest and darkest areas and at a height of four to five feet
above the ground surface, may be required within parking areas and
circulation drives, and over walks and trails, if found to be necessary to
preserve public safety or prevent crime.



   (K)   (1)   Dumpsters and refuse containers shall be completely
enclosed by an opaque wall or fence that is fitted with complete gates over
points of access, and the dumpsters and containers shall be kept completely
covered at all times to prevent materials from blowing or washing out of the
enclosure, and from being accessed by birds or other animals.



      (2)   Transformers, air handling and other ground-mounted
mechanical units, power generators, other utility or service areas pedestals
or apparatus, and large storm water detention basins shall be treated with
landscaping, berms, walls or other decorative elements to mitigate their
utilitarian appearance if they are visible from public ways or nearby
residential areas. Building wall extensions or other structural screens may
be required help control noise from loading and unloading operations and to
screen loading and delivery berths, and outdoor storage if allowed by the
Zoning Code, from view from public ways and nearby residential areas.



   (L)   The inclusion of sign information on or as part of a site plan
submittal shall not be construed to grant approval of any sign or to waive
any requirement of the Sign Code.



(1999 Code, Title VII, Ch. 12, § 3)  Penalty, see § 157.99



§ 157.07  VALIDITY OF APPROVAL.



   (A)   A site plan shall become effective upon approval by the City
Council and the complete satisfaction of any revisions or conditions of
approval as required by the City Council and as reviewed by city staff and
determined to have been satisfied, provided that such approval shall be
stayed and not take effect in the event that an appeal is filed, until the
appeal has been decided and no further appeals can or will be made.



   (B)   An approval of a site plan in accordance with the requirements
of this code shall remain valid for two years after the date of the City
Council’s approval except as provided by § 157.05(A)(2)(c), after which
time the site plan approval shall be deemed null and void if actual
construction has not commenced.



(1999 Code, Title VII, Ch. 12, § 6)



§ 157.08  SITE PLAN AMENDMENT.



   An approved site plan may be amended in accordance with all of the
procedures and requirements of this code, including payment of fees as set
forth in this code, except for minor amendments. Minor amendments may be
administratively approved by the Department of Community Development
according to whatever procedures the Director deems appropriate with respect
to submittals and reviews, for no fee or a nominal fee not to exceed $25 or
such greater amount that may be set by resolution of the City Council.



(1999 Code, Title VII, Ch. 12, § 7)



§ 157.09  FEES.



   A fee shall be paid with each application at the time of submittal, in
the amount of $125 for a standard site plan and $75 for a minor site plan, or
such greater fees that may be set by resolution of the City Council from time
to time. Fees shall not be refunded after the submittal has been distributed
to various city departments for review, or other costs have been incurred by
the city.



(1999 Code, Title VII, Ch. 12, § 9)



§ 157.99  PENALTY.



   Any violation of any of the terms or conditions of this chapter, or any
failure to comply with any of its requirements, shall constitute a civil

§ 158.047  EXCEPTIONS AND MODIFICATIONS.



   (A)   Businesses not fronting on a street.  Any retail, office or
industrial business that does not have street frontage shall be permitted one
wall sign on the wall containing the primary public entrance for the
business. The maximum permitted area for any sign shall be calculated in the
same manner as if the wall fronted on a street; provided that the maximum

shall be permitted. The sign shall comply with all city requirements for a
wall sign that apply to the lot.



   (B)   Pole signs.  Pole signs shall be allowed only by conditional
use in accordance with the procedures and requirements of the Zoning
Ordinance, except for interstate signs located in the C-H Highway Commercial
District and fully compliant with this Code. In addition to all other
requirements for approval of a conditional use, the appellant shall submit
evidence showing that a monument sign is not feasible and a pole sign is the
only means of providing reasonable ground sign identification for the lot.



   (C)   Monument signs. A lot with less than 500 feet of street
frontage shall be allowed one monument sign with a maximum copy area of 75
square feet for each street frontage, or a lot with 500 or more feet of
street frontage shall be allowed one monument sign with a maximum copy
display area of 125 square feet for each street frontage. The total size of
the monument shall not exceed two and one-half times the copy area, and the
monument shall utilize the same building materials found in the principal
building. The maximum height of any sign shall be 20 feet. Copy shall be
limited to the name and address of the complex, center or principal tenant,
and comprised of individually mounted letters. Alternatively, the copy area
may be a plastic face encased in the monument and subject to a maximum copy
area of 50 square feet, maximum height of 15 feet, and maximum monument area
of 190 square feet. Both the copy area and monument shall be limited to a
simple geometric shape unless it emulates the building form. No pole sign

or three-dimensional letters except as otherwise permitted by this division
(D).



      (2)   Channel letters may be mounted on a raceway unless
expressly prohibited; provided that all raceways shall be painted or
otherwise finished to closely match the color of the wall or sign structure
to which it is attached. The height of a raceway shall not exceed 33% of the
height of the channel letters attached thereto if the letters are more than
24 inches in height, nor a height, depth or width of eight inches in any
case, unless it can be shown that a greater dimension is necessary to comply
with a requirement of the Electrical Code, Underwriters Laboratories Inc.

thickness of one-eighth inch to provide a uniformly smooth surface with no
buckling or waving, and the sides and backing shall be opaque. Exposed
fasteners shall be minimized and any fasteners on the sign face shall be
flush with the face unless the fasteners are an integral part of the sign
design.



      (4)   Push-through letters also may be used for internally
illuminated trademarks that cannot reasonably be fabricated as a dimensional
letter, if the trademark does not exceed 40% of the total copy area.



      (5)   Three-dimensional letters can be used in the same manner
as push-through letters if the copy will not be illuminated, or if the entire
sign copy is externally illuminated.

conform to the monument sign requirements except as provided by this division
(E).



      (2)   Tenant copy shall be updated within 90 days after any
and all changes in tenant occupancy on the premises to reflect current
occupancies, and any tenant copy remaining after that time that does not
identify a current tenant shall be deemed obsolete and shall cause the entire
sign to be defined as an abandoned or unmaintained sign and as such shall be
removed in its entirety as required by this Code.



      (3)   Not more than one directory sign shall be permitted on
each street frontage unless the premises has 600 or more feet of frontage on
a continuous street, in which case two directory signs separated by a minimum

area or 320 square feet, whichever is less.



         (a)   The copy for each tenant shall be not less than
eight inches nor more than 14 inches in height, unless a height of less than
eight inches is necessary to fully display an individual tenant’s name and
trademark. Calculations for these heights shall be the cap height or ascender
height as measured from the copy baseline to the top of the ascenders or
capital letters and disregarding the descender height of lower case
letters’ stems.



         (b)   All copy shall be fabricated from channel letters,
reverse channel letters or push-through letters.



         (c)   Tenant copy shall limited to names and logos

or similar events (hereafter “events”) subject to full compliance with
the following and all other requirements of this Code.



         (a)   A sign permit shall be obtained and all pertinent
fees paid prior to installing or displaying any temporary sign for any event,
and each permit shall be valid for a maximum of 25 days. If the city issues a
sticker or tag in conjunction with the permit, the sticker or tag shall be
valid only for the duration of the permit and for the temporary sign
permitted, and shall be firmly affixed to the temporary sign by the
permittee. Failure to obtain a sign permit prior to installation or display,
or failure to affix the sticker or tag to the temporary sign, shall render
the temporary sign unlawful. Copying or emulating the sticker or tag shall be
a violation of this Code and subject to any and all penalties allowed by law.
Any and all unlawful temporary signs shall be subject to confiscation and
destruction, together with civil citations and any and all other penalties
allowed by law.



         (b)   A temporary sign shall not be displayed for more

dead loads, and prevent any and all motion.



         (e)   Temporary ground signs shall be restricted to
A-frame signs molded from ultra-violet protected polyethylene or polyvinyl
chloride plastic or other rigid, non-metal or non-wood material approved by
the Zoning Administrator and having a maximum combined background and copy
area of six square feet, and a maximum height of four feet. All copy shall be

with all other prohibitions of this Code.



         (f)   Temporary ground signs shall be displayed only
between the hours of 7:00 a.m. and 8:00 p.m. each day or while the business
is open to the public, whichever is less, and shall be displayed only during
mild weather conditions when winds or other conditions are incapable of
tipping or transporting the sign. At all other times the sign shall be stored
in a location that is not visible from any street or public way.



         (g)   Temporary ground signs shall be set back a minimum
of five feet from all property lines; shall not be located on public property
under any circumstances; shall not be attached to trees, shrubs or other
landscaping, or to fire hydrants, light poles or other utility appurtenances;
and shall not be allowed to create an unsafe situation for the public. The
signs shall manufactured or incorporate internal ballast sufficient to cause
the sign to weigh not less than 15 pounds. In addition, the signs shall be
sufficiently weighted or ballasted to withstand continuous wind speeds of not
less than 15 mph; to withstand wind gusts or bursts of not less than 25 mph;
and the signs shall not be displayed at any time when wind strength or other
conditions may reasonably be expected of being capable of tipping, collapsing
or transporting the sign around or off the premises, and may be confiscated
by the city and a citation issued if the permittee does not remove or
otherwise continuously and satisfactorily remedy the situation for the
duration of any and all wind incidents or other inclement weather conditions
potentially capable of making the sign dangerous.



      (2)   Temporary signs promoting a civic event, celebration or
festival that is recognized by the City Council are permissible for no more
than 45 days prior to the first day of the event, celebration or festival,
and shall be removed immediately upon completion of the event, celebration or
festival. Each sign allowed by this division (F) shall not exceed 32 square
feet in area or a height of eight feet; shall be located only on private
property or on public property for which permission has been obtained from
the appropriate governing body owning or controlling the public property, or
their authorized Administrator; and shall be weighted or ballasted to resist
wind, and be removed during inclement conditions, in the same manner that is
required by this section for temporary ground signs.

display an interstate-oriented wall sign that is comprised of individually
mounted letters in accordance with division (D) above. Interstate wall signs
may be mounted on two opposing walls that are perpendicular to the interstate
as if the building was a sign monument, or on a wall that faces the
interstate in the customary manner for a wall sign, but shall not erect
interstate wall signs under both options.



         (a)   The maximum area of an interstate wall sign shall
not exceed 300 square feet or two square feet for each lineal foot of
building frontage on the interstate, whichever is less, regardless of whether
such interstate sign is placed on a wall that faces the interstate or is on a
wall that is perpendicular to the interstate.



         (b)   Interstate wall signs shall not be placed or
erected above the sixth floor, parapet line or eave of any building, except
within a gable at a height that is not more than 15 feet above the

nonresidential tenant or business that does not erect, maintain or display
any copy on an interstate wall sign or interstate high-rise sign may be
identified on an interstate monument sign, if the tenant is located on a
parcel of land that complies with the following minimum criteria:



         (a)   The parcel shall be zoned for commercial or
industrial use, unless the tenant has obtained a conditional use permit to
locate in a residential or agricultural zoning district in accordance with
the requirements of the Zoning Ordinance.



         (b)   The parcel shall have a minimum of 300 feet of
frontage on the interstate, or two or more adjoining parcels may be combined
to satisfy such minimum frontage requirement and share a single interstate
identification sign provided that they shall enter into a development
agreement that is satisfactory in form to the Zoning Administrator, setting
out arrangements to apportion the permitted copy area, for maintenance of the
sign and similar matters that may be prescribed by the Zoning
Administrator.  Any such shared sign is hereby deemed to be an on-premise
sign for the purposes of this Code, even though some of the copy may identify
tenants that are not located on the sign premises.



         (c)   Nonresidential tenants of parcels that do not have
interstate frontage, but that front on a public street that provides access
to parcels having interstate frontage, may be allowed to share and be
identified on an interstate monument sign on a parcel that has interstate
frontage, provided that the owners of such parcels shall enter into a
development agreement that is satisfactory in form to the Zoning
Administrator, setting out arrangements to apportion the permitted copy area,
for maintenance of the sign and similar matters that may be prescribed by the
Zoning Administrator. Any such shared sign is hereby deemed to be an
on-premise sign for the purposes of this Code, even though some of copy may
identify tenants that are not located on the sign premises.



      (3)   Regulations for an interstate monument sign. Interstate
monument signs shall comply with all of the following regulations:



         (a)   The sign faces shall be perpendicular to, or in
the case of a curve radial to, the closest point of interstate right-of-way.



         (b)   Sign monuments shall not exceed a maximum height
of thirty feet as measured from the height of the Interstate roadway surface
that is most-proximate to the sign location, or 20 feet as measured from the
average grade within 100 feet of the base of the sign, whichever is greater.
The maximum monument width shall be 24 feet. The maximum area of the monument
shall be 300 square feet, computed as a single rectangle that encloses the
monument’s outer-most points.



         (c)   The monument shall be constructed with the same
building materials and colors used in the principal building on the parcel
where the sign is located.  The copy area and monument shall both be limited
to a simple geometric shape unless the monument form emulates the building
form.



         (d)   Signs shall be set back a minimum of twenty feet
but not more than 75 feet from the interstate right-of-way line, and shall be
set back a minimum of 125 feet from all other property lines or located at
the midpoint of the parcel’s interstate frontage if a parcel is less than
250 feet in width.



         (e)   Each parcel shall be limited to one interstate
monument sign unless the parcel has more than 900 feet of interstate
frontage, in which case a second interstate monument sign may be allowed
subject to providing a minimum separation of 500 feet between said two signs.



         (f)   No tenant shall display copy on more than one
interstate identification sign.



         (g)   1.   An interstate monument sign may be a
directory sign displaying copy for a maximum of six tenants, subject to all
copy being comprised of individually mounted letters or trademarks and being
in full compliance with the Sign Ordinance’s requirements for directory
signs having individually mounted letters, except that:



               a.   The copy for each tenant shall not
exceed a maximum of 18 inches in height, and all other minimum and maximum
copy and background dimensions shall be scaled upward accordingly from the
14-inch maximum copy height prescribed by division (E) above;



               b.   The background and copy colors are
encouraged, but not required, to be a single, identical color for all tenants.



            2.   In all other respects the directory sign
shall comply with all requirements of the Sign Ordinance for individually
mounted letters and directory signs.



         (h)   The total copy area shall not exceed 210 square
feet, whether the sign is a directory sign or identifies a single tenant, and
copy shall be limited to tenant names and trademarks; the name of a
development; and the street address of the parcel where the sign is located.



         (i)   The area around the base of the interstate sign
monument shall be landscaped with not less than 12 shrubs or six trees or a
combination thereof, in locations and of mature heights that will mitigate
and minimize the overall mass of the sign, while not obscuring any sign copy.



      (4)   Eligibility for an interstate high-rise sign. One
interstate high-rise sign may be allowed on any buildable parcel that
conforms to all of the following criteria:



         (a)   The property is zoned “C-H” Highway Commercial
District;



         (b)   The principal use of the property is retail sales
of food, lodging or fuel, or providing repairs or services that are essential
to normal operation and maintenance of motor vehicles; and



         (c)   It is not separated from the Interstate by any
property that is zoned or designated by the Comprehensive Plan for any
residential or office use, on either side of the route of access; and is
located within a maximum travel distance of 2,600 lineal feet from the
interstate highway, said distance being calculated by beginning at the center
point of the interstate median at the nearest interchange, and thence
measuring along the centerlines of streets traveled to reach the property’s
primary access, to the closest point on the lot.



      (5)   Regulations for an interstate high-rise sign. Interstate
high-rise signs shall comply with all of the following regulations.

the sign location, or 35 feet as measured from the natural grade at the base
of the sign, whichever is greater.



         (e)   If the interstate high-rise sign is not a monument
sign, it shall be designed to be supported by two pylons placed at the outer
edges of the sign face and having rectangular sections, in order to emulate a
monument sign to a reasonable extent.



   (H)   Planned unit development or special sign districts.  Planned
unit developments or other developments are encouraged to set up special
districts establishing separate design-oriented regulations which promote
better design and higher quality of signs, in lieu of the provisions of this
Code. These special provisions shall be submitted for consideration by the
Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council, and if approved shall be
binding and have the same force and effect as this Code. If no special
provisions are approved the provisions of this Code shall apply.



   (I)   Motor fuel price signs.



      (1)   Gasoline service stations, convenience stores and
similar retail businesses selling gasoline or similar fuels for use in motor
vehicles as a major part of their business, shall be allowed sign area in
addition to that customarily permitted by this Code, to display manually
changeable price information for fuel. The copy on each price sign shall be
limited to the type of fuel, such as “unleaded” or “diesel” and price
per unit of measure therefor. The maximum copy area for any one fuel price
and type shall be eight square feet, and the maximum total additional sign
area shall not exceed 16 square feet. The signage may be placed on a ground
sign, wall sign or canopy support if the sign types are customarily
permitted, but shall not be placed on a separate sign structure or portable
sign.



      (2)   These businesses which are eligible for an interstate
sign in accordance with the criteria and regulations specified by division
(B) above, shall be allowed to place sign area on the permitted interstate
sign in addition to that customarily allowed by this Code, to display fuel
price information. Copy shall be limited as stated above. The maximum copy
area of any one fuel price and type shall be 25 square feet, and the maximum
total additional sign area shall not exceed 50 square feet. Because of the
nature of the signage, the price copy may be displayed in a single color in
the manner found in an electronic message center, or may utilize mechanical
means of altering the copy. The copy message shall not be changed more than
six times in any 24-hour period, and only to reflect changes in the sales
price of the fuels and communicate same to the traveling public. Flashing,
scintillation, chasing, animation, occultation or similar effects are
expressly prohibited.



   (J)   Automobile dealerships.  Businesses which sell new cars as a
principal business shall be allowed one ground sign in addition to the number
customarily allowed by this Code, with a maximum area of 40 square feet and
maximum height of 20 feet, to identify a sales area for used cars.



   (K)   Off-premises signs.



      (1)   Where permitted.



         (a)   Off-premises signs shall not be located within 660
feet of the interstate right-of-way, irrespective of zoning. Not more than
one off-premises sign shall be located on any one lot or parcel. Off-premises
signs are a permitted use in the M-2 Business Park District, and may be
permitted as a conditional use on a limited basis in the C-H Highway
Commercial District and M-1 Planned Industrial District, subject to all of
the requirements of this Code, the Zoning Ordinance and other applicable
regulations.



         (b)   Where permitted subject to conditional use
approval, the following conditions shall be met, together with all other
customary standards for a conditional use.



            1.   It is the intent of the city to promote
removal of existing legally nonconforming off-premises signs, particularly
those within zoning districts where they are no longer permitted, by
providing an opportunity for a limited number of signs to be erected in the
C-H and M-1 Districts to replace nonconforming signs, if it can be found that
the new signs would not be detrimental to the public health, safety and
welfare, nor to property values or aesthetics. In addition, no sign shall be
permitted in the C-H or M-1 District unless and until an existing legally
nonconforming off-premises sign in a residential district, PUD, C-N, C-G, C-H
or  M-1 District within the city is voluntarily removed by the appellant
without compensation being paid for the sign by a governmental body or
agency, and without being required to do so by the owner or lessee of the
property, prior to or concurrently with erection of the proposed sign. The
appellant shall provide satisfactory evidence showing how and when the
removal will be accomplished.



            2.   In the M-2 District, the area of a permitted
sign may be increased to not more than 675 square feet, and the height to not
more than 35 feet, after obtaining a conditional use permit and
satisfactorily showing that buildings and lot sizes in the vicinity of the
sign generally are of a size that the increased area and/or height of the
sign will be in keeping with the scale of the area, and that the sign will
not overwhelm or dominate the street and vicinity. Evidence shall be required
to show that the majority of the buildings are generally 30 feet or more in
height, with floor areas of 75,000 square feet or more; and that lot or
parcel sizes are generally five acres or more in size.



      (2)   Bulk regulations.



         (a)   Height.  The maximum height shall be 25 feet in
the case of a sign having an area of 300 square feet or less, and not more
than 35 feet in height if the sign is permitted to have an area of more than
300 square feet.



         (b)   Setback.  The minimum setback from each property
line shall not be less than the height of the sign, and the minimum setback
from any and all streets shall not be less than the average setback of the
principal buildings located on adjoining lots. The maximum setback shall be
75 feet. If no building is located within 300 feet of the lot where the
off-premises sign is located in one or both directions, then the minimum
front setback required for the district shall be used for the vacant property
in computing the street setback requirement. Setbacks shall be measured to
the closest point of the sign, including any walkways or similar
appurtenances to the sign or sign structure that extend more than four feet
from the sign face.



         (c)   Size.  The maximum area shall be 300 square feet
except as otherwise permitted. A maximum area of 675 square feet may be
allowed by conditional use in the M-2 Business Park District; if so allowed,
the signs may also have extensions not exceeding 15% of the sign area.



         (d)   Spacing.  Off-premises signs shall be located a
minimum of 1,000 feet in any direction from any other off-premises sign or
any electronic message center, and not less than 500 feet in any direction
from the property line of any public park or building, or the boundary of a
zoning district in which off-premises signs are not permitted, unless the
sign will not be visible from that public property or zoning district.



         (e)   Orientation.  The faces shall be perpendicular
to, or in the case of a curve radial to, the street right-of-way.



   (L)   Electronic message centers.  Electronic message centers may
be allowed in lieu of an interstate sign otherwise permitted by division (B)
above, but only by special permit granted by the City Council and subject to
all of the requirements of this section, including the payment of fees, and
any additional stipulations adopted by the City Council as conditions for
granting the permit. The City Council finds that message centers create
special concerns for the safety of the motoring public and aesthetics of the
community which necessitate additional regulations and additional penalties
to ensure compliance with the city’s regulations.



      (1)   Eligibility for an electronic message center.



         (a)   Permits shall be issued only to
interstate-oriented retail businesses providing food, lodging or fuel or
repair services essential to normal operation and maintenance of motor
vehicles. The lot on which the business is located shall have a minimum of
500 feet of frontage on an interstate highway, shall be zoned C-H Highway
Commercial District, and located within a travel distance of 2,600 feet from
the interstate highway as defined by division (B) above.



         (b)   These business shall further demonstrate that: a
competing interstate business within the Des Moines Metropolitan Area with
the same principal use has lawfully erected an electronic message center; and
the message center will not obstruct the view of or distract attention from
official governmental signs or become a public nuisance.



         (c)   Any and all variances granted for ground signs
shall be voluntarily vacated and declared null and void. Existing interstate
signs shall be removed concurrently with erection of the electronic message
center, and all other existing ground signs, except directional signs, shall
be removed within five years after erection of the electronic message center.
No new on-premises ground signs shall hereafter be erected or used by these
business unless the electronic message center is first removed; the existing
ground signs shall be considered fully amortized upon erection of the
electronic message center, and shall be treated as legally nonconforming
signs thereafter.



      (2)   Bulk regulations.



         (a)   Height.  The maximum height of any sign which
includes an electronic message center shall be 50 feet above the roadway
grade of the interstate highway at that point closest to the sign.



         (b)   Setback.  An electronic message center shall be
setback a minimum of 50 feet from the interstate right-of-way but not more
than 200 feet from the right-of-way; shall be sufficiently setback from any
public street right-of-way other than an interstate or interstate frontage
road so as to be located a minimum of 350 feet from the centerline of the
streets; and 50 feet from any other property line.



         (c)   Size.  Maximum total area of any sign containing
an electronic message center shall be 300 square feet, and the maximum
dimensions of an electronic message center shall be four feet, eight inch
vertically and 40 feet horizontally; the sign shall not be eligible for
additional sign area under division (E) above.



         (d)   Operation.  Electronic message centers shall not
utilize animation, chasing, flashing, scintillation, scrolling or running
messages, fade or any other effect which depicts movement or is intended to
draw attention to the sign. Each copy display, whether or not in a sequential
message, shall be totally extinguished a minimum of one second before a new
copy display appears, and each copy display shall remain lit a minimum of
five seconds. These signs shall not display off-premises advertising. Other
limitations may be imposed by the City Council if found to be necessary to
protect the public health, safety and welfare.



         (e)   Spacing.  Electronic message centers shall be
located a minimum of 1,000 feet from any other electronic message center or
any off-premises sign.



         (f)   Orientation.  The faces shall be perpendicular
to, or in the case of a curve radial to, the right-of-way of the nearest
section of interstate.



      (3)   Special permit requirements.



         (a)   Application.  Application shall be made to the
City Council on a form prescribed by the city, and shall be accompanied by a
contract with a licensed sign company for the maintenance of all electrical
components and the sign structure; fees; and surety to guarantee compliance
with all regulations. The permittee shall provide the name and address of a
person who will be responsible for operation of the sign, and in making
application acknowledges that violation of these regulations shall result in
forfeiture of surety and constitutes grounds for nonrenewal of the permit.



         (b)   Fee.  An annual fee set by City Council
resolution shall be paid to the city to cover the costs of monitoring the
sign and enforcing these regulations; an additional fee for the initial
permit shall be paid in the amount of the engineering fee for the services
required by division (M)(2)(b) above.



         (c)   Surety.  The permittee shall deposit a cash bond
or other acceptable surety in the amount of $5,000 with the city to ensure
compliance with these regulations. The surety shall be forfeited to the city
if the number of violations in any one year exceed the number allowed herein,
or if the permittee fails to file for a renewal of the license within 60 days
after the date of expiration. The city may use the proceeds of the bond to
remove the sign or for any other purpose, and if choosing to remove the sign
may assess any costs including legal fees in excess of the surety amount
against the property.



         (d)   Violations.  If any one or more of the
restrictions on operation on a message center, as specified in division
(M)(2)(d) above, are violated on more than three separate occasions in any
license year, the surety required herein shall be forfeited unless the City
Council directs otherwise, and these violations shall be grounds for denying
a renewal of the permit. The City Council shall hold a public hearing on the
matter and provide a minimum of seven days’ notice. The Zoning
Administrator or other official charged with enforcing this Code shall
document each violation and send notice of same to the person and address
identified on the permit application as being responsible for the message
center. The permittee shall be responsible for informing the city in writing
of any changes in the name or address of the responsible party. Violations
shall be promptly corrected, and if not corrected within seven days after
notification shall constitute a separate violation.



         (e)   Hold-harmless.  The permittee shall hold the city
harmless and indemnify it against any and all costs or judgments arising from
erection and operation of the sign.



         (f)   Renewal.  Permits may be renewed each year at the
City Council’s discretion upon payment of the prescribed fee and providing
all information and the surety required herein, and upon demonstrating
continued compliance with all of the requirements of this and all other
ordinances.



   (M)   Public buildings and churches.  Publicly-owned or leased
buildings and churches shall be allowed to erect wall signs and monument
signs regardless of the zoning district in which the lot is located in
accordance with the following.

copy area shall be two square feet for each lineal foot of building frontage
and not more than 200 square feet, whichever is less, on each building

§ 159.01 PURPOSE AND TITLE.



   (A)   This chapter shall be known as the “Subdivision Code” and
may be cited as such, and may be referred to herein as “chapter” or
“Code.” The city has adopted this Code in accordance with the provisions
of Iowa Code Chapters 18B and 354 and amendatory acts thereto, governing the
subdivision of all lands within the corporate limits of the city.



   (B)   The purpose and intent of this Code is to establish minimum
standards for the design and construction of all subdivisions within the City
of Urbandale (herein “city”), and an area of review within the nearby
unincorporated territory, to provide for:



      (1)   Accurate, clear and concise legal descriptions of real
estate in order to prevent land boundary disputes or real estate title
problems, wherever possible;



      (2)   A balance between the land use rights of individual
landowners and the economic, social and environmental concerns of the public
while enforcing land use regulations;



      (3)   Uniform procedures and standards for subdivisions while
allowing the widest possible latitude for the establishment and enforcement
of regulations pertaining to subdivisions within the scope of Iowa Code
Chapters 18B, 331, 354, 364 and 414;



      (4)   Control of subdivision design so as to encourage orderly
community development that is consistent with the city’s Comprehensive
Plan; and



      (5)   Regulation and control of the improvement of land and
the extension of public improvements, services and utilities.



   (C)   The City Council finds that the parcel and street patterns
that result from subdivisions substantially impact the city’s ability to
implement its Comprehensive Plan and planning for orderly and rational
growth.  Therefore, in accordance with the purpose and intent of this Code,
subdivisions shall be designed and developed in a manner that protects the
public health, safety and general welfare, and that preserves property
values, by following sound, professional design practices and developers
shall provide adequate and quality infrastructure to fully mitigate all of
the impacts created by each and every subdivision to the fullest extent
allowed and authorized by Iowa Code Chapters 18B and 354, and all other
relevant codes, ordinances and regulations. 



   (D)   The City Council finds that full mitigation of all impacts
created by new subdivisions includes the developer’s provision of or
funding for certain infrastructure that may be located outside of the
boundaries of a subdivision, or the reservation of a site or space within a
subdivision that may serve new subdivisions in addition to the subdivision in
which it is located, to the extent that the requirements for providing or
funding for off-site infrastructure, or reserving a site or space, are
rational and do not exceed the proportionality of the new impacts created by
each individual subdivision, and to the extent that the requirements are
allowed by the Code of Iowa, whether expressly or by application of
unreserved powers that may be commonly referred to as “home rule.”



   (E)   Such off-site mitigation requirements may include, but are not
limited to, sewage treatment plants and sanitary sewer trunks; water
treatment plants and supply storage; parks and open space; schools; fire
stations and firefighting equipment; and similar infrastructure or equipment
that cannot be reasonably provided within or by a single subdivision, whether
by reason of:



      (1)   Incremental nature of an impact, such as additional
traffic capacity within the arterial street system that is made necessary by
the cumulative additional traffic generated by a number of subdivisions;



      (2)   Specific characteristics that need to be present in
order for a site or parcel to be an appropriate location for any given type
of new infrastructure whose need is created or increased by new subdivisions,
such as slope gradients for athletic recreational facilities or soil types
and other environmental considerations for a solid waste disposal facility;



      (3)   Cost-effectiveness for the public and collective
subdivisions that new infrastructure serves; or



      (4)   Other reasons that may be found in the city’s
Comprehensive Plan, or that are consistent with sound fiscal planning and
management, and professional practices.



(Title VII, Ch. 3, § 1.1)

manner as a plat of survey, regardless of the number or new parcels of land
or other corporal real property that are created by the subdivision, if all
of the new parcels or interests will be held in public ownership by the city
or other governmental entity, or by other persons having the power of eminent
domain for the purpose of acquiring such corporal real property.



   (D)   Auditor’s plat. An Auditor’s plat shall comply with all of
the submittals and procedures that are required for a proprietor’s plat.



§ 159.05  PROCEDURES.



   (A)   Major proprietor’s plat.



      (1)   Pre-application conference. Whenever a developer
proposes a proprietor’s plat, the developer shall contact the Department of
Community Development to schedule a pre-application conference. The
pre-application conference shall include the Developer and representatives,
representatives from the Department of Community Development and the
Engineering Department, and such other city departments that express a desire
to be included in such pre-application conferences on a regular basis, or
that are deemed to be helpful or necessary by the Department of Community
Development. The purpose of the pre-application conference shall be to
acquaint the city staff with the proposed subdivision, and to acquaint the
developer with the procedures and requirements of this Code and concerns and
regulations that pertain to the subdivision. The developer shall furnish a
reasonably specific description of the property to be subdivided at the time
of requesting the pre-application conference, and is encouraged to prepare
and submit a conceptual plat for the proposed subdivision prior to the
conference, in order to facilitate the pre-application conference discussion.



      (2)   Filing for approval of preliminary plat.



         (a)   Following one or more pre-application conferences
as determined to be necessary by the Department of Community Development or
as requested by the developer, a preliminary subdivision plat (“preliminary
plat”) shall be prepared by the developer and submitted to the Department
of Community Development in accordance with § 159.06.



         (b)   The Department of Community Development shall
review the preliminary plat and shall promptly convey one copy of it to each
of the Engineering, Building and Fire Departments, Water Utility, Urbandale
Sanitary Sewer District, Urbandale-Windsor Heights Sanitary Sewer District
and any other department or public utility company that has expressed a
desire to review subdivision plats on a regular basis, for their review and
recommendations. The reviewing departments and other entities shall review
the preliminary plat for conformance to all of the city codes, ordinances and
specifications that they customarily enforce, and for conformance to
applicable professional standards, and shall forward their recommendations
for action on the preliminary plat to the Department of Community Development
for inclusion in a consolidated, written staff report and recommendation that
is to be prepared by the Department of Community Development and presented to
the Planning and Zoning Commission for consideration and action, and
forwarded to the City Council following the Commission’s action.



      (3)   Action on a preliminary plat.



         (a)   The Department of Community Development shall
provide a copy of the written staff report and the consolidated staff
recommendations from all of the city departments and other reviewing entities
to the developer concurrently with or shortly after said staff report and
recommendations have been provided to the Planning and Zoning Commission.
Staff may recommend that the plat be approved, approved subject to conditions
and revisions, or that the preliminary plat application be denied for reasons
that shall be set forth in the written staff recommendation. Plats shall be
reviewed and presented to the Planning and Zoning Commission in accordance
with the submittal and meeting schedules issued each year by the Department
of Community Development.



         (b)   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall review
the recommendations of city staff and act on the proposed preliminary plat in
a timely manner, and may recommend  to the City Council that it approve,
approve subject to conditions or revisions, or deny the preliminary plat
application, whether or not such recommendations are in accordance with the
recommendations of city staff. If the Commission does not act on the
preliminary plat in a timely manner, the developer may request the City
Council to consider the preliminary plat and recommendations of city staff
without the provision of any recommendations by the Planning and Zoning
Commission. The Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council may, at their
discretion, hold public hearings on a preliminary plat and may provide notice
to nearby property owners or tenants in whatever manner or amount of time
that the Commission or Council deems appropriate.



         (c)   Once a preliminary plat has been reviewed and
acted on by the Planning and Zoning Commission, the Department of Community
Development shall forward the Commission’s recommendations and the city
staff report and recommendations to the City Council for consideration at its
next available meeting, subject to any notifications that may be directed by
the Commission or Council and revisions to the preliminary plat to satisfy
all recommended revisions and conditions, if the City Council desires to have
all such revisions completed to city staff’s satisfaction prior to the
Council’s consideration of the preliminary plat. The City Council may adopt
the recommendations of city staff; recommendations of the Commission if at
variance with city staff on one or more points; or act freely of their own
volition, provided that, the Council shall have no authority to waive any
requirements of the Zoning Code, or of any other city code unless provisions
are expressly set out in the pertinent code to grant the Council the powers
to waive or make exceptions to or from such code.



         (d)   Upon approval by the City Council and filing of a
revised preliminary plat and specifications that satisfy all conditions of
approval, the Department of Community Development shall provide a stamped
approved copy of the preliminary plat to each of the reviewing departments,
and to the developer if requested.



(Title VII, Ch. 3, § 1.4.2)



      (4)   Subdivision improvement plans and specifications.



         (a)   Following approval of the preliminary plat and
during such time that the plat remains valid, the developer shall cause
detailed subdivision improvement plans and specifications to be prepared by a
professional civil engineer who is licensed in the State of Iowa (herein
“developer’s engineer”) and submitted for review and approval by the
City Engineer. The developer’s engineer shall incorporate all of the
subdivision improvements that are required by this Code and other applicable
regulations, and any that may be required by the City Council as a condition
of approval of the subdivision, in the Subdivision improvement plans and
specifications and shall certify said plans and specifications as being fully
compliant with this Code and all other applicable regulations.



         (b)   Said plans and specifications shall be fully
compliant with the valid preliminary plat and the conceptual design of the
improvements as depicted therein. If the improvement plans and specifications
deviate substantially from the valid preliminary plat, the plans and
specifications shall be revised to conform, or the preliminary plat shall be
revised and resubmitted for review and approval by the Planning and Zoning
Commission and City Council, in full compliance with the requirements of this
Code.



         (c)   Any Improvement that is proposed to be constructed
in accordance with special provisions that are in variance with or from the
city’s standard specifications shall first be reviewed and approved by the
City Engineer as part of the full and complete set of subdivision improvement
plans and specifications, and the City Engineer may require any such variance
to be submitted for review and approval by the Planning and Zoning Commission
and City Council in accordance with § 159.14.



         (d)   No improvement or development, or work preparatory
thereto except clearing, grubbing and grading, shall be done prior to the
City Engineer’s finding that the subdivision improvement plans and
specifications are complete and in full compliance and have been properly
certified by the developer’s engineer, and are therefore approved; and that
all required permits have been issued by the City Engineer and all other
applicable regulatory agencies. Grading may be commenced at developer’s
sole risk if the City Engineer concurs with conceptual grading plans that
have been prepared by the developer’s engineer.



         (e)   The developer’s engineer shall be solely
responsible and liable for ensuring that the subdivision improvement plans
and specification are fully compliant with the requirements of this Code and
all other applicable requirements and permits. The City Engineer’s approval
of the subdivision improvement plans and specifications, or concurrence with
conceptual grading plans, shall only be deemed to allow the developer to
commence work on the correlating subdivision improvements or grading, in
accordance with the approved plans and specifications and all requirements of
this Code. The City Engineer’s approval or concurrence shall not be found
to assume, alleviate, or relieve the developer or developer’s engineer from
any liability or responsibility for said plans or grading plans and the
requirement to construct the Improvements in full compliance with this Code;
to create any vested right to proceed with any development or improvement
that is not in full compliance with this Code by reason of oversight, error
or other reason; to waive any requirement of this Code unless this Code
expressly allows a waiver to be made and any said waiver is made in writing;
or to in any way create or assume any liability by or for the city or any of
its employees and agents.



(Title VII, Ch. 3, § 1.8.6)



      (5)   Filing for approval of final plat.



         (a)   Following the approval of a preliminary plat;
approval of the subdivision improvement plans and specifications and
acquisition of all required permits; and while the preliminary plat remains
valid, the developer shall cause a final subdivision plat (“final plat”)
to be prepared for all of the preliminary plat or for a phase thereof as
previously identified on the valid preliminary plat, and submitted to the
Department of Community Development in accordance with § 159.06.



         (b)   The Department of Community Development shall
review the final plat and shall promptly convey one copy of it to each of the
Engineering, Building and Fire Departments, Water Utility, Urbandale Sanitary
Sewer District, Urbandale-Windsor Heights Sanitary Sewer District and any
other department or public utility company that has expressed a desire to
review subdivision plats on a regular basis, for their review and
recommendations. The reviewing departments and other entities shall review
the final plat for conformance to all of the city codes, ordinances and
specifications that they customarily enforce; conformance to the valid
preliminary plat; conformance to the approved subdivision improvement plans
and specifications; and for conformance to applicable professional standards.
Upon completion of their reviews, all shall forward their recommendations for
action on the final plat to the Department of Community Development for
inclusion in a consolidated, written staff report and recommendation that is
to be prepared by the Department of Community Development and presented to
the Planning and Zoning Commission for consideration and action, and
forwarded to the City Council following the Commission’s action.



      (6)   Action on a final plat.



         (a)   The Department of Community Development shall
provide a copy of the written staff report and the consolidated staff
recommendations from all of the city departments and other reviewing entities
to the developer concurrently with or shortly after said staff report and
recommendations have been provided to the Planning and Zoning Commission.
Staff may recommend that the plat be approved, approved subject to conditions
and revisions, or that the final plat application be denied for reasons that
shall be set forth in the written staff recommendation. Plats shall be
reviewed and presented to the Planning and Zoning Commission in accordance
with the submittal and meeting schedules issued each year by the Department
of Community Development.



         (b)   The Planning and Zoning Commission shall review
the recommendations of city staff and act on the proposed final plat in a
timely manner, and may recommend  to the City Council that it approve,
approve subject to conditions or revisions, or deny the final plat
application, whether or not such recommendations are in accordance with the
recommendations of city staff. If the Commission does not act on the final
plat in a timely manner, the developer may request the City Council to
consider the final plat and recommendations of city staff without the
provision of any recommendations by the Planning and Zoning Commission.



         (c)   Once a final plat has been reviewed and acted on
by the Planning and Zoning Commission, the Department of Community
Development shall forward the Commission’s recommendations and the city
staff report and recommendations to the City Council for consideration at its
next available meeting, after the completion of revisions to the final plat
to satisfy all recommended revisions and conditions, if the City Council
desires to have all such revisions completed to city staff’s satisfaction
prior to the Council’s consideration of the final plat. The City Council
may adopt the recommendations of City staff; recommendations of the
Commission if at variance with City staff on one or more points; or act
freely of their own volition, provided that the Council shall have no
authority to waive any requirements of the Zoning Code, or of any other city
code unless provisions are expressly set out in the pertinent code to grant
the Council the powers to waive or make exceptions to or from such code.



         (d)   Upon approval by the City Council and filing of a
revised final plat that satisfies all conditions of approval, the Department
of Community Development shall provide a stamped approved copy of the final
plat to each of the reviewing departments, and to the developer if requested.



      (7)   Recording of final plat to become an official plat.

record in the offices of the appropriate County Recorder, Auditor and
Assessor; officially recognized by the city; improvements within a
subdivision shall not be accepted for public ownership and maintenance;
building permits shall not be applied for; and public funds shall not be
expended or services provided within a subdivision, until all provisions set
forth in this Code have been satisfied in full and all approvals required by
this Code have been obtained and remain valid.



         (b)   No final plat shall be released for filing of
record unless and until:

Community Development;



            6.   All conditions of approval of the final plat
by the City Council have been satisfied in full;



            7.   The final acceptance of the plat shall not be
deemed to constitute final acceptance by the city of any improvements or
dedications except as expressly set forth in a City Council resolution. The
Improvements shall only be expressly accepted by separate action by the City
Council after the City Engineer submits a statement advising the Council that
all of the improvements have been inspected and found to have been completed
in conformance with city specifications and the approved subdivision
improvement plans.



         (c)   Upon finding by the Community Development and
Engineering Department’s that all requirements of this Code and of the Code
of Iowa have been satisfied, the Department of Community Development shall
release the final plat and all necessary documents for recording to the
developer, and the developer shall promptly submit same for filing of record
in the offices of the appropriate County Recorder, Auditor and Assessor. Be
it also provided that, the city may choose to file any and all deeds and
easements for the plat itself, to ensure that they are in fact promptly and

   (C)   Plat of survey.



      (1)   A plat of survey may be reviewed and approved by the
Community Development and Engineering Departments for compliance with this
Code. The city staffs of said departments may recommend that the plat of
survey be approved, approved subject to conditions and revisions, or that the
plat application be denied for reasons that shall be set forth in a written
staff recommendation.



      (2)   Alternatively, said city staffs may require the plat of

§ 159.07  DESIGN STANDARDS.



   The following design standards shall be construed as minimum
requirements. More stringent standards may be applied due to the unique
characteristics and circumstances of any individual subdivision, as the city
unilaterally deems to be appropriate and necessary to ensure that each and
every subdivision produces sound and orderly growth and improves public
health, safety and welfare throughout the city.



   (A)   General requirements.



      (1)   Subdivisions and all subdivision improvements shall
conform to the Comprehensive Plan; Zoning Code, Statewide Urban Design and
Specifications (SUDAS) as adopted and amended by the city; Parkland Code; and
all other applicable city and state regulations. All lots in proprietor’s
plats shall be served by public sanitary sewers; water mains; storm sewers
and other drainage improvements; streets; sidewalks and trails; parks and
park infrastructure; to be designed and constructed by the developer as
subdivision improvements in full accordance with this Code and particularly
as set forth in this section.



      (2)   Preliminary plats shall be submitted for entire
subdivisions whenever practical, and at a minimum for multiple final plat
phases within boundaries as prescribed by the Engineering and Community
Development Departments for parcels that are more than 100 acres in area or
that have unique characteristics. By this requirement the city intends to
ensure that every subdivision will, in its entirety, be optimized in all
respects to protect and increase property values and public health, safety
and welfare presently and in the future, particularly by optimizing vehicular
and pedestrian circulation systems; the extension of infrastructure to
establish connectivity at an early date, and facilitate the subdivision and
development of other properties; and the locations and improvement of parks
and open spaces, to efficiently serve and satisfy the needs of the
subdivision and of the public as a whole.



      (3)   Subdivisions shall not endanger health, safety or
general welfare of the public or of persons residing or working on nearby
properties, and shall not impair an adequate supply of light and air to
nearby properties.



      (4)   Subdivisions shall be designed to locate and configure
subdivision improvements in a manner that will not unduly diminish or impair
the use and enjoyment of nearby properties. No subdivision shall be designed
or improved in a manner that impedes or appears to impede the development of
nearby properties that are within the city or the designated area of review.



      (5)   Proprietors’ plats shall be improved by the developer
to provide all lots within the subdivision with adequate water mains and fire
hydrants, sanitary sewers, storm sewers and surface water flowage channels,
and storm water detention to protect the public health, safety and welfare,
and to prevent the overload of any existing public infrastructure. A
developer may be required to extend or expand existing off-site public
infrastructure as necessary to fully improve a proposed subdivision, or the
City Council may, at its sole discretion, require a proposed subdivision to
be delayed until such extension or expansion can be funded and constructed by
the city or other governmental entity.



      (6)   Developers shall provide for the perpetual maintenance
of any and all subdivision improvements that are not dedicated to the city or
other governmental entity, by establishing an owner’s association or other
person, whether an individual or individuals, in a manner and form that is
acceptable to the city. Such improvements may include but are not limited to
storm water detention and infiltration basins; buffer yards, landscaping,
fencing or walls, and other screening; subdivision signs, directional signs,
traffic signs and pavement markings; and on-site lighting.



      (7)   Every subdivision shall be designed with regard for
existing and proposed topography and drainage patterns, by blending grading
for the subdivision smoothly into the land forms on adjoining properties;
considering and providing for drainage into and through the subdivision, both
existing conditions and at full development of the drainage basin; and by
controlling runoff.



      (8)   (a)   An attempt should be made to preserve mature
upland forestation and other natural vegetation and geological features,
while recognizing that the developer is required to substantially grade and
contour a subdivision to construct the required subdivision improvements and
properly grade streets, alleys, and lots to comply with this and other city
codes and regulations, and state and federal regulations, and recognizing
that the probability of post-development survival of trees and other existing
vegetation may be greatly diminished by such necessary site modifications and
disturbances.



         (b)   Where preservation does not appear to be
practical, subdivision and development landscaping should select overstory
tree species that will create or reestablish the dominant tree species that
would be native to the environ when possible, or alternatively to create
subdivision character that is in keeping with the city as a whole, or that
will uniquely identify the subdivision.



   (B)   Streets. The City Engineer shall have the sole authority to
establish the classification of a street as an arterial, collector or local
street for the purposes of this Code.



      (1)   Connectivity and general design. Public streets in all
proprietor’s plats shall be designed and configured to provide connectivity
between adjoining properties and subdivisions to facilitate access and
circulation within neighborhoods, to thereby minimize and reduce traffic
congestion, improve the efficiency of providing municipal services and
enhance public health, safety and welfare together with protecting and
increasing property values. Subdivisions of large parcels shall be designed
and phased accordingly, to establish such connectivity at the earliest
reasonable date.



      (2)   Warranty deeds. All new street rights-of-way shall be
conveyed by warranty deed and without any conditions or limitations, in
accordance with the following:



         (a)   Arterial street rights-of-way shall be designed to
have a total minimum right-of-way width of 120 feet, or wider if so required
by the City Engineer or City Council, and subdivisions on each side of the
centerlines thereof shall dedicate one-half of such width;



         (b)   Collector street rights-of-way for residential
subdivisions shall be designed to have a total minimum right-of-way width of
60 feet, and local street rights-of-way for nonresidential subdivisions shall
be designed to have a total minimum right-of-way width of 80 feet, or wider
if so required by the City Engineer or City Council.



         (c)   Local street rights-of-way for residential
subdivisions shall be designed to have a total minimum right-of-way width of
50 feet, and local street rights-of-way for nonresidential subdivisions shall
be designed to have a total minimum right-of-way width of 80 feet, or wider
if so required by the City Engineer or City Council.



         (d)   Additional street rights-of-way widths may be
required to be dedicated at the intersections of streets and access points,
in order to accommodate turn lanes and sidewalks within the rights-of-way.



      (3)   Costs; responsibilities. Developers shall be fully
responsible for the entire costs of improving all collector and local streets
within a subdivision, and for the costs of paving a width of not less than
15.5 feet of roadway along all arterial street frontages by providing a cash
escrow to be held in a city account or by posting surety therefore, and turn
lanes that serve or will serve the subdivision whether located within the
subdivision or on an arterial street.



      (4)   Continuation of existing and planned streets.
Subdivisions shall be designed to provide for the continuation of existing
and planned public streets, and those in valid preliminary plats, in whatever
manner is deemed appropriate by the City Engineer. Streets shall be designed
and configured to conveniently channel local traffic onto collector and
arterial streets and to discourage through traffic, being that which does not
have an origin or destination within the subdivision or nearby area, from
utilizing collector or local streets as a means of traveling from arterial
street to arterial street.



      (5)   Right angles. Street intersections shall be at right
angles wherever possible. The minimum off-set between street intersections on
local and collector streets shall be 300 feet, and the minimum on an arterial
street shall be 1,200 feet.



      (6)   Turnarounds; improved design. Streets that are temporary
dead-ends shall be provided with a turnaround and an improved roadway of a
design that is satisfactory to the City Engineer. Permanent dead-ends other
than cul-de-sacs are prohibited, and no lots shall take their access from a
dead-end other than a cul-de-sac, permanent or temporary.



      (7)   Improvement and dedication. Streets shall be so located
and designed as to be improved and dedicated to the full rights-of-way and
roadway widths as required by this Code. No street shall be designed or
accepted for half-width paving or right-of-way dedication unless recommended
by the Director and the City Engineer.



      (8)   Limited access to arterial streets.



         (a)   Streets and other vehicular accesses shall be
designed to intersect or otherwise connect to arterial streets at points
measuring not less than a nominal minimum distance of 600 feet between full
movement accesses and of 300 feet between any access and right-turn only or
other limited-movement accesses to said arterial street.



         (b)   Single-family lots in proprietor’s plats shall
not be allowed to have vehicular access to an arterial street, except in the
“A-1” Agricultural Reserve and “A-2” Estate Residential Districts
where no other streets are reasonably available to provide access and subject
to the locations of any such accesses being shown on the plat and approved by
the City Council. Such access restriction shall be noted on the final plat.



         (c)   Hickman Road, Merle Hay Road and a portion of
Douglas Avenue are controlled access streets to which access is allowed only
by city ordinance in accordance with § 99.053, or by obtaining a permit from
the Iowa Department of Transportation (herein “IDOT”).



      (9)   Turn lanes and traffic-control devices.



         (a)   Right and left turn lanes shall be provided at all
points that provide or are intended to provide access to an arterial street
from existing or proposed nonresidential or multi-family residential
development, unless such requirement is waived by the City Engineer, and the
City Engineer may require said turn lanes to be provided for said access to a
collector street.



         (b)   The City Engineer may require traffic
signalization or other traffic control devices to be included in the
subdivision improvements for any proprietor’s plat that is zoned or planned
for nonresidential or multi-family development.



      (10)   Shared access and alignment. Streets and other
vehicular accesses shall be designed to align with existing or proposed,
approved streets and other vehicular access points on the opposing frontage
of arterial and collector streets. Cross-access easements shall be provided,
in whatever configuration, dimension, and manner that the City Engineer deems
necessary and appropriate, to allow and facilitate the sharing of access to
public streets by multiple properties, whether the properties are within or
outside of the subdivision boundaries, in order to reduce traffic conflicts
and congestion, and improve safety.



      (11)   Cul-de-sacs.



         (a)   Cul-de-sacs shall not exceed a length of 600 feet
as measured from the centerline of the intersecting street to the center of
the turnaround, and shall not serve more than 40 dwelling units, unless a
longer length or larger numbers of units is approved by the City Council in
accordance with § 159.14.



         (b)   A permanent turn around shall be provided at the
end of each cul-de-sac in accordance with SUDAS, including increased radii in
nonresidential subdivisions, except that the transition radii between the
cul-de-sac turnaround and approach street shall be a minimum of 92.5 feet as
measured at the back of curb of the roadway, and a minimum of 80.0 feet as
measured at the street right-of-way.



      (12)   Planting islands and subdivision signs.



         (a)   Cul-de-sacs may include a circular planting island
having a 15-foot maximum radius; islands within roundabouts may include
plantings; and medians may include plantings outside of vision clearance
zones, subject to the requirements of this section; and subdivision
identification signs may be installed on private property within a
proprietor’s plat, all subject to an owner’s association being
established by the developer to maintain such islands and signs in perpetuity.



         (b)   The plantings in any such islands and medians
shall predominately be understory and overstory trees that are selected on
the basis of being generally able to withstand salts, heat, dry conditions
and the otherwise stressful conditions that are characteristic of such
islands and medians. The islands and medians shall be mulched with rock,
brick or other ground cover materials that are more or less permanent in
nature, or designed to facilitate mowing and other operations if vegetative
ground cover is allowed. The design of the islands, medians and subdivision
signs as a whole shall be such that minimal maintenance will be required, and
subject to review and approval by the Engineering and Community Development
Departments.



      (13)   Gated streets and entrance drives. Gated streets and
entrance drives shall be constructed with sufficient storage capacity to
prevent queuing vehicles from encroaching into a public street right-of-way
or from obstructing any sidewalk or bicycle trail or lane, but in all cases
shall have not less than 75 feet of queuing space between the gate and said
points.



      (14)   Paved. All proposed public streets shall be paved with
portland cement concrete (PCC), unless the City Engineer expressly approves
an alternative paving material.



(Title VII, Ch. 3, §§ 1.8.2 and 1.8.3)



   (C)   Sanitary sewers. The subdivision improvements for
proprietor’s plat shall include the extension of sanitary sewers and
appurtenances thereto to serve every lot within the subdivision, and to the
Subdivision’s outermost boundaries as deemed necessary by the City
Engineer, or the Urbandale Sanitary Sewer District or Urbandale/Windsor
Heights Sewer District as the case may be for a trunk sewer, to facilitate
the service and development of adjoining and nearby properties within the
city and its designated area of review.



   (D)   Storm sewers, surface water flowage, stormwater detention and
other stormwater management requirements. Storm sewers and appurtenances
thereto shall be extended to Subdivision boundaries as deemed necessary by
the City Engineer, for the purposes of both picking up and discharging runoff
at the boundaries of the subdivision.



      (1)   Erosion control. Storm sewers and appurtenances thereto,
drainage ways and other surface water flows, and storm water detention shall
be designed in accordance with SUDAS specifications as amended and adopted by
the city, and in addition thereto erosion control improvements shall be
installed in and along all surface drainage channels to reduce flow
velocities and protect channel bottoms and banks from scouring and cutting,
and at storm sewer outfalls and discharge points, in whatever matter and
extent that the City Engineer finds necessary to prevent channel and sheet
erosion to a reasonable extent. Such improvements may include, but are not
limited to, drop structures, check dams, placement of rip-rap and weirs.



      (2)   Footing drain sewers. All lots that are zoned or planned
for single-family residential development shall be provided with a storm
sewer that is capable of collecting and conveying footing drain discharges to
an appropriate outlet.



      (3)   Surface flowage provisions for large-storm events.
Provisions shall be made and maintained for surface passage of runoff from
storms that exceed the design capacity of the storm sewer system, without
causing flooding or damage to public streets or nearby properties. Surface
water flowage easements shall be provided over any and all such areas of flow
that convey any off-site runoff through a lot, of sufficient dimensions to
cover the runoff resulting from a storm having a 1% chance of occurrence in
any single year.



      (4)   Off-site discharge. If it is necessary to discharge a
concentration of surface runoff onto an adjoining property, provisions shall
be made to dissipate the erosive energy from said concentration of runoff and
to maintain the general drainage pattern as it existed prior to construction
of the Improvement.



      (5)   Storm detention.



         (a)   Storm detention shall not be located within a
FEMA-designated 1% floodplain. Storm detention shall not be located within
minimum required buffer yards or landscape setbacks unless the detention is
located within a subsurface structure of sufficient depth below the surface
to allow required landscaping to be planted and maintained over such buried
detention.



         (b)   Low flows shall be piped through detention basins
whenever possible, and a paved trickle channel shall be provided to convey
the low flows if piping is not practical, to facilitate maintenance of the
basin unless the basin is expressly designed to facilitate the absorption or
infiltration of runoff storm detention.



      (6)   Subsurface drainage. Vegetated areas shall have a 2%
minimum slope to maintain positive drainage throughout each lot and the
subdivision as a whole. Subsurface drainage shall be provided in such
locations and manner as may be required by the City Engineer, which may
include but is not limited to the rear lot lines of any or all lots.



   (E)   Water mains and appurtenances.



      (1)   Water mains shall be a minimum of eight inches in
diameter, or larger if increased size is determined to be necessary to
provide domestic and fire flows as determined to be satisfactory and
necessary by the Urbandale Water Utility. Fire hydrants shall be provided in
the number and locations required by the Water Utility and Fire Department,
and shall be supplied with appropriate connections as may be specified by the
Water Utility and Fire Department. Developers shall be fully responsible for
the costs of all mains that are 12 inches or less in diameter, together with
all hydrants, valves and other appurtenances thereto, and as may be otherwise
required to be in full accordance with the requirements of the Water Utility.



      (2)   No lot shall have more than one service line, whether or
not in actual use, unless expressly approved by the Water Utility. No
connections shall be made or allowed to exist between the public water system
and any external water source, whether a private water system, well, storm
runoff, recycling system, tank, vehicle or other source or method.



   (F)   Lot design.



      (1)   Minimum lot width and frontage, and setback lines.



         (a)   A subdivision may establish setback lines that are
greater than the minimum requirements of the Zoning Code or other city
requirements for any or all lots, by so drawing or designating such setback
lines on the plat, and such setback lines shall thereafter be the minimum
setback requirements for said lots. However, be it further provided that such
increased setbacks shall not be used to circumvent minimum lot width or
frontage requirements, which shall continue to be measured respectively at
the minimum front setback line as specified by the Zoning Code and at the
street right-of-way line.



         (b)   Setback lines shall parallel the street
right-of-way. Minimum lot widths and frontage shall be measured parallel or
radial to the right-of-way line respectively for straight or curved segments.



         (c)   All lots shall front onto a street and obtain
vehicular access from a street. Lots that front onto a public street shall
have a minimum of 45 feet of frontage, or 75% of the minimum lot width
required by the Zoning Code if the minimum lot width requirement is less than
70 feet for the zoning district in which the lot is located, except for lots
that front on cul-de-sac turnarounds. The frontage of lots on cul-de-sac
turnarounds shall be not less than 65% of the minimum lot width required by
the Zoning Code for the zoning district. In all cases, minimum frontages
shall be as measured within a single segment of right-of-way, in the case of
intermittent or multiple frontages.



      (2)   Lots with frontage on arterial or collector streets.



         (a)   The minimum setback along an arterial street shall
be 50 feet or the minimum required by the Zoning Code, whichever is more. The
minimum setback along a collector street shall be 35 feet or the minimum
required by the Zoning Code, whichever is more. Said minimum setbacks shall
apply regardless of whether the adjoining yard is a front, side or rear yard.



         (b)   Corner lots that have a side yard on an arterial
street shall be a minimum of 40 feet wider than the minimum lot width
required by the zoning district. In all other cases, corner lots shall be a
minimum of 20 feet wider than the minimum lot width required by the zoning
district.



         (c)   Lots that front on or back up to an arterial
street shall have a minimum lot depth of 175 feet, and in all other cases the
minimum lot depth shall be 120 feet. Lot depths shall be measured at the
shallowest point of the lot, perpendicular or radial to the right-of-way line
respectively for straight or curved segments.



      (3)   Buffer yards. Buffer yards and improvements thereto
shall be provided by the developer along arterial streets in accordance with
the minimum requirements of the Zoning Code, or such additional requirements
that the City Council may be stipulate as a condition of approval of a plat.
All fences, berms and buffer yard plantings and improvements shall conform to
the Zoning Code.



      (4)   Grading.



         (a)   All lots in proprietor’s plats shall be graded
to be entirely one foot or more above the base flood elevation as determined
by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) for a regulatory flood
having a one percent or less chance of occurring in any one year, or any such
higher standard that may hereafter be adopted by FEMA, and to allow basements
that will be not less than one foot above the base flood elevation of the
regulatory flood to be included in single-family detached residential and any
and all other development that customarily is constructed with basements or
other low enclosed building areas, on all lots. The developer shall cause
minimum floor elevations (MFE) that are fully compliant with city and FEMA
regulations to be noted on the final plat for all lots that fall all or in
part within a flood hazard area as it existed prior to any improvement or
development, and by restrictive covenant or other means cause all basements
and all other sub-grade structures to be constructed and remain in perpetual
compliance with said minimum floor elevations (MFE) , regardless of whether a
letter of map revision based on fill (LOMR-F) is approved by FEMA for any or
all of the lots following improvement.



         (b)   Minimum opening elevation (MOE) requirements are
intended to protect property only from localized storm runoff or shallow
flooding, and shall not be allowed or construed to satisfy or comply with
FEMA requirements or city code requirements and intent to protect persons and
property from the dangers and adverse effects of flooding, regardless of
whether a LOMR-F has been obtained for a property. MOE requirements shall be
construed to apply to an entire lot and all portions of every building unless
an exception is expressly noted and approved with whatever conditions and
limitations that are deemed appropriate for any such exception, including,
but not limited to, a case where MOE protection is necessary for surface
water flowage or stormwater management that is contained within a public
easement on a portion of a lot, and does not affect the entire lot. Such
exception may be noted on a plat and approved by the City Council, or may be
administratively approved in writing by the City Engineer and Director of
Community Development.



   (G)   Sidewalks and trails. Public sidewalks with a minimum width of
five feet shall be constructed from portland cement concrete (“PCC”)
along the frontages of all public streets and along not less than one side of
all common private access drives, unless alternative routing such as a rear
lot walkway or open space trail system is approved by the City Council in
lieu thereof. Pedestrian and bicycle trail systems shall have a minimum width
of eight feet when located within a park or open space corridor, and ten feet
when located within or in proximity to a street right-of-way, and shall be
constructed of PCC unless an alternative material is approved by the City
Engineer. Base preparation and all other construction specifications shall be
fully compliant with SUDAS standards as adopted and amended by the city.



   (H)   Miscellaneous requirements.



      (1)   Extension of improvements to boundaries. Subdivision
developers shall extend all subdivision improvements to the boundaries of the
subdivision at the developer’s expense, in such locations and manners as
the City Engineer and City Council, Urbandale or Urbandale/Windsor Heights
Sanitary Sewer District or Water Utility determine to be necessary and
appropriate to serve or facilitate other development or subdivisions.



      (2)   Street names.



         (a)   Street names shall conform to the names of
existing Urbandale streets that align, more or less. Numeric designations
shall be used to name streets with generally north-south orientations and
following the existing numbering pattern, unless an alphabetical name is
already in use or block configurations prevent the use of a numbered street.
Alphabetical name designations shall be used on streets with generally
east-west orientations.



         (b)   If an existing street name has not been
established, or an existing name is deemed to be inappropriate because of
potential confusion;, undesirable slang usage or other association; or some
other reason, a street name shall be assigned by the city. In no case shall
new street names be selected or assigned that are closely associated with a
specific subdivision, and to thereby possibly be deemed undesirable for
repeated use in other subdivisions.



      (3)   Street and traffic-control signs. Street name and
traffic-control signs and pavement markings shall be installed by the
developer as required subdivision improvements. Street name signs shall be at
all new intersections within and bordering the subdivision, and traffic
control signs and pavement markings including parking prohibitions and
restrictions shall be installed and provided along all streets in the
subdivision, all in accordance with SUDAS and the Uniform Traffic Manual.



      (4)   Street lights. The developer shall cause plans and
specifications to be prepared for street lighting on all new public streets
within the subdivision, for approval by the City Engineer and MidAmerican
Energy or its successor in interest. Upon approval of said plans and
specifications the developer shall cause the lights to be installed in
accordance with said plans and specifications, as part of the required
subdivision improvements along all streets in the subdivision, all in
accordance with SUDAS and the Manual on Uniform Traffic-Control Devices
(MUTCD). Wooden poles and overhead wiring shall be prohibited.



      (5)   Reserve strips.



         (a)   Proprietor’s plats shall not create or
perpetuate outlots that are intended to prevent adjoining properties from
having access to subdivision improvements that are or will be dedicated to
the city unless such outlot is expressly approved by the City Council at the
time of preliminary plat.



         (b)   If such an outlot is approved, the approval shall
be conditioned upon agreement by the developer to convey the outlot to the
city within not more than ten years following the date of final plat
approval, and that it shall thereafter become city right-of-way without any
restriction of access to, over, and across such right-of-way by reason of the
aging and reduced life expectancy of the dedicated subdivision improvements,
and the continual investment of public funds to maintain, preserve and
reconstruct such improvements. If such conditions are not acceptable to the
developer, or challenged as an unconstitutional taking by the developer or a
successor in interest, the Council’s approval of the plat shall be deemed
null and void and the city may take action in accordance with Iowa Code §
354.20 to annul the plat.



      (6)   Disposal of waste materials. No wood, vegetation,
debris, junk, rubbish, garbage or other waste materials of any kind, whether
organic or inorganic, shall be left, deposited or buried on any portion of a
lot or in any parcel that is to be dedicated to the city or other
governmental entity, or to an owners’ association, and shall be completely
removed from the subdivision prior to releasing of the subdivision plat for
recording, unless an alternative to complete removal is expressly approved by
the City Council.



      (7)   Public utility lines. All public utility lines and
appurtenances thereto, including, but not limited to, electrical and
telecommunication lines, shall be buried underground within easements
provided for said public utilities in accordance with § 159.09. The
developer shall be responsible for making the necessary arrangements with
each of the serving utilities to comply with this requirement, including
payment of any construction or installation charges or fees by any utility

(Title VII, Ch. 3, § 1.8.13)



§ 159.10  SURETY AND MAINTENANCE BONDS.



   No building permit shall be issued for any development or building on
any lot within a subdivision, unless and until the City Engineer inspects and
determines that all of the subdivisions improvements have been satisfactorily
completed, except for sidewalks along the street frontages of lots that will
remain in private ownership and that are guaranteed to be installed at some
future date by surety that conforms to the requirements of this Code.



   (A)   Surety.



      (1)   All subdivision improvements shall be completed to the
full satisfaction of the City Engineer before a final plat may be released
for recording, unless the developer posts surety with the city to guarantee
that the uncompleted subdivision improvements will be satisfactorily
completed within not more than one calendar year after the date of the City
Council’s approval of the final plat. The posting of surety shall not be
deemed to constitute or ensure the city’s acceptance of any improvements,
either upon posting of the surety or at any future date; approve the issuance
of building permits, or of certificates of zoning compliance or occupancy; or
approve the expenditure of city funds within any part of the subdivision.



      (2)   Surety shall be provided in the form of a bond, letter
of credit, cash escrow held in city trust account or other collateral that is
acceptable to City Legal Counsel and approved by the City Council, and shall
be of an amount that the City Engineer determines to be necessary and
sufficient to cover all of the city’s costs for constructing the
uncompleted subdivision improvements, including inspections and tests that
customarily would be conducted by the city, at some future date.



      (3)   The surety shall remain in full force and effect until
the subdivision improvements have been completed to the satisfaction of the
City Engineer, and have been accepted by the City Council, provided that
surety may be called by the city for any subdivision improvements that have
not been completed within six years after the date of City Council approval
of a final plat without any further finding beyond the factual passing of
such date, and further provided that surety that is not called at such time
shall not be deemed to have been released or voided. Maintenance bonds shall
remain in force for not less than four years as provided by division (B)
below, after the date of acceptance of the improvements by City Council.



      (4)   Surety for sidewalks along arterial streets shall be
100% of the total cost of installation, including inspection and testing.
Surety for sidewalks along arterial streets shall be in the form of cash
escrow only. Surety for sidewalks along collector and local street frontages
of lots being platted shall be calculated at 15% of the total cost of
installation, including inspection and testing. The 15% surety shall remain
in place until the value of the uncompleted sidewalks is reduced to the value
of the surety.  At that point, the value of the surety can be reduced as
sidewalks are completed.  Sidewalk surety shall not be totally released
until all sidewalks in the plat are completed.



   (B)   Maintenance bonds.



      (1)   The developer shall warrant the design, material,
workmanship, installation and construction of all of the subdivision
improvements for a minimum of four years from and after satisfactory
completion and City Council acceptance of roadway payment, sanitary sewers,
storm sewers and other improvements that are related to drainage, and park
infrastructure, and shall cause the warranty to be ensured by independent
bond or by other collateral that is found to be acceptable by City Legal
Counsel (herein “bond”). The bond shall specifically ensure the expedient
repair or replacement of any and all improvements that the City Engineer
finds to be defective following completion and acceptance, and shall
indemnify and hold the city harmless from any and all costs or losses
resulting from, attributed to or otherwise arising from the defective
improvements.



      (2)   The City Engineer may, at the Engineer’s discretion,
require any bond to run for a duration of more than four years, and to be
posted in a greater amount, in lieu of immediate replacement and
reconstruction of any improvement that is not fully compliant.

§ 159.11  PRIVATE SEWAGE TREATMENT, WATER SUPPLY AND OTHER INFRASTRUCTURE.



   (A)   Septic systems and other private facilities for treatment of
sewage, and wells or other potable water supply and distribution systems,
shall be only be allowed for agricultural uses and residences associated with
a farm as defined by the Zoning Code, or if service cannot be obtained from
public infrastructure for such purposes, by reason of being more than 660
feet distant, or for other reasons even if available within said distance.
All such facilities shall be restricted to personal household and
agricultural uses, and shall be subject to approval by the relevant County
Board of Health or to certification by an independent professional engineer
and qualified testing laboratory if not subject to county regulation or if
the county lacks the ability to perform the necessary testing and approval of
the facility’s design and construction.



   (B)   Any such facilities or systems that exist and are operational,
whether at the time of adoption of this Code or having been subsequently
established and maintained in full and continual compliance, shall be
eliminated and such service obtained by connecting to the appropriate public
infrastructure, except that private wells and other potable water supplies
may continue to be used indefinitely by a farm. Such connection shall be made

the city, or other district according to the dictates of the Comprehensive
Plan, as to lot and block dimensions, and street configurations; and



      (2)   Using the right-of-way and lot lines of said subdivision
as lot boundaries, such conceptual lot and rights-of-way parcels shall be
combined into lots that are not less than ten acres in area and not less 300

pay fees for inspections of  the subdivision improvements and may be
required for the review of subdivision improvement plans and specifications,
said fees to consist of the total hourly cost to the city including, but not
limited to, the costs for supervision, overhead, equipment and hourly wages
and fringe benefits of the employees involved. Fees shall not be refunded

§ 159.14  VARIANCES AND EXCEPTIONS.



   (A)   If a subdivision is proposed for a parcel of land or other
corporal real property that is characterized by unique and unusual
topography; parcel configuration or dimensions; adjacency of highly irregular
land ownership patterns; or other unique and unusual conditions that
grievously affect a developer’s ability to do a subdivision that fully
complies with this Code; and the strict application of  this Code’s design
standards for subdivision improvements would result in substantial hardships
or injustices that are not self-created by the developer or to have been
created by a prior subdivision that created the subject parcel of real
property without giving due consideration to the requirements of this Code,
the City Council may approve a variance or exception from the design
standards of this Code.



   (B)   Any such variance or exception shall be limited to the minimum
relief that is necessary for a subdivision that creates lots for reasonable
development of the real property, while at the same time fully protecting and
preserving the public welfare, health and safety and property values.



   (C)   Any such variance or exception shall be allowed only if the
City Council finds the variance or exception to be consistent with the spirit
and intent of this Code and other city codes and regulations, and in
accordance with the Comprehensive Plan. This section shall not be construed
to empower the City Council to grant variances from the Zoning Code, or from
any other Code unless the Council is expressly enabled by such other code or
other provisions of law.



   (D)   The request for such variance or exception shall be filed with
the Department of Community Development prior to or concurrently with the
filing of a preliminary plat. The request shall be reviewed by the Community
Development and Engineering Departments, and a joint recommendation made to
the Planning and Zoning Commission as part of the staff report for action on
the preliminary plat, or in similar manner if filed separately from the plat.



   (E)   The Commission shall act on the request concurrently with the
preliminary plat or in like manner, and the Commission and staff
recommendations shall be forwarded to the City Council for consideration and

      (2)   A final plat submittal shall not be deemed to be
properly filed unless the City Engineer has first approved subdivision
improvement plans and specifications for the real property that is included

necessary to attain full compliance with all applicable requirements and
approval by the City Engineer.



   (C)   Time extension for a preliminary plat.

to all codes, regulations, requirements and specifications that have been
revised or adopted since the original date of approval of the preliminary
plat.



   (D)   Expiration of final plat. Upon approval of a final plat by
resolution of the City Council, the developer shall fully satisfy any and all
conditions of such approval and all provisions of this Code, and shall cause
the final plat to be properly submitted for filing of record in the offices
of the appropriate County Recorder, Auditor and Assessor, within one calendar
year of the date of the City Council’s resolution; noncompliance shall

§ 160.12  “O-R” TRANSITIONAL OFFICE/RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT.



   (A)   Purpose.



      (1)   The purpose of this district to provide areas where both
low-intensity, professional offices and medium density residential
development may locate to serve as a buffer or transitional zone. It will
include older, established areas where conditions are changing due to
proximity to commercial or other nonresidential activities. It may also
include areas along major thoroughfares which would be suited to a mixture of
office and residential uses, but which are not desirable for certain types of
nonresidential development due to parcel size, potential for traffic
congestion due to lack of access control or inadequate carrying capacity,
adverse impact on nearby residential areas, or other constraints. It is
intended that this district generally not be mapped on interior streets but
rather be confined to major arterials and along intersecting streets as a
transitional area between residential and nonresidential development.



      (2)   It is further intended that new development or
conversion of existing buildings be compatible with neighboring residences by
means of landscaping, open space, and architectural treatment as provided by
the district standards.

permitted, provided that existing dwellings shall be allowed to remain and to
expand if such expansion is in conformance with the height and setback
standards of this district;



      (2)   Conversions of existing single-family detached dwellings
into two attached single-family dwellings subject to compliance with all

accordance with the Comprehensive Plan of the city:



      (1)   Conversion of an existing single-family dwelling
structure into a use other than two attached single-family uses. Such
conversion shall be subject to the following requirements in addition to all
other requirements, and in no case shall a detached accessory structure be
converted to any use other than a permitted accessory use:



         (a)   The location of the structure shall not serve as
justification for a variance from the requirements for off-street parking,
required outdoor space, buffering, landscaping or the performance standards;

commercial uses will be fully separated from and will not intrude upon the
residential uses, as may be possible when commercial usage occurs in the
front portion of the lot and residence in the rear; in no case shall
commercial uses be located on a level above residential uses;



         (c)   Parking shall be calculated on the basis of

the following:



         (a)   Whether said business will comply with division
(C)(2) above;



         (b)   That the width and area of the lot approximates
that required for a commercial or a mixed use, or that the nature of the
business or the duties of the proposed employees are such that the additional
employees will not generate a significant increase in the number of customers
and clients; and

necessary to accommodate the increased employees, that may impair the ability
of the property to comply with the requirements of this Code pertaining to
conversions of existing dwellings and to mixed use buildings.



      (4)   Public utility facilities, including transmission and
distribution equipment, substations, regulator stations and buildings

create a zone of transition between commercial and single-family residential
areas, the architectural design shall facilitate this transition by using
facade materials common to residential structures such as wood, face brick,
stone or stucco, and generally not metal or concrete or unfinished surfaces;
shall have a pitched roof with a minimum 4/12 slope as opposed to a flat
roof; attempt to break up large building masses by use of staggered offsets
in the front facade, and size and locate windows and doors so the scale will
be as residential in character as reasonably practical without substantially
compromising commercial needs; screen the parking from view and provide
landscaping to further enhance the residential character and reduce the
apparent extent of impervious surface and building area; and similar design
techniques to enhance the living environment and inhibit the spread of the
adverse and blighting effects of more intensive land uses into adjoining
residential areas.



      (12)   Stairs shall be enclosed or architecturally integrated,

§ 160.14  “C-N” NEIGHBORHOOD CONVENIENCE DISTRICT.



   (A)   Purpose.



      (1)   It is the purpose of this district to provide areas for
convenient shopping by residents of the adjacent neighborhood, but not of
such size and variety as to attract substantial volumes of traffic from
outside of the neighborhood. Such areas typically will include a food
supermarket as the principal tenant, and other establishments supplying
commodities or performing personal services for the daily living needs of the
residents of the neighborhood.



      (2)   It is not intended that any area be mapped of such size
as to allow all or a substantial number of the permitted uses to locate
within it, but rather to establish a range of individual uses which supply
appropriate commodities and services and thereby provide an opportunity to
create a suitable mix of specialty shops which will facilitate the economic
success of the shopping area, and through normal interaction of the
combination allow it to be more successful than might otherwise be probable.
Accordingly, it is intended that such areas be mapped in location and of
limited size to reflect the neighborhood scale, to encourage a compact design
which is oriented to pedestrian as well as vehicular traffic, and further
intended to avoid linear retail strips by separating such areas with other
types of development.



   (B)   Permitted principal uses. Only those uses listed below shall
be permitted, in accordance with all of the provisions of this district:



      (1)   Uses permitted in the “C-O” District;

      (7)   Maximum floor area ratio: (F.A.R.): 0.50.



§ 160.17  “C-P” PLANNED COMMERCE PARK DISTRICT.



   (A)   Purpose.



      (1)   It is recognized that certain businesses require a
restful, pleasant work environment similar in many respects to that found in
a residential environment, and would suffer from traffic congestion,
nuisances and hazards in much the same manner. Accordingly, it is the intent
of this district to provide land in a park-like setting for the orderly and
logical development of such management, research, design, marking and other
administrative or professional offices and services, and certain limited
production, all of which exhibit a high quality of architectural and design
quality appropriate to a pleasant, park-like setting. No use is intended to
be permitted which exhibits any obnoxious or nuisance characteristics, such
as hazard, noise, vibration, smoke or other emissions, odors, glare,
congestion or overtaxing of utility systems. Since the primary emphasis is on
design such development will incorporate high-quality materials in unique
architectural designs and substantial plantings of trees, shrubs and other
plant materials. Production uses, when permitted, shall not require
substantial volumes of truck or rail shipping as would be common to
industrial developments.



      (2)   Such areas will generally be employment centers, as
opposed to providing products or services to the general public. It is
intended that such areas be mapped to include not less than 15 acres.



   (B)   Permitted principal uses.



      (1)   In accordance with the purpose of this district, it is
the intent of this section to permit any use which complies with the
performance standards and bulk requirements of the district, the general and
special provisions of this code, and all other city codes or policies, unless
expressly prohibited or classified as a conditional use. It is recognized
that proper control of design and methods of operation will reduce the
importance of what the use is, that spacious site layout with substantial
amounts of landscaping; aesthetically pleasing architectural design and
materials; non-combustible construction, proper building
compartmentalization, and installation of fire sprinklers and other
appropriate safety or warning equipment; pollution control; access control
and limitations on trucks and other unnecessary traffic; proper subdivision
layout; and other considerations will eliminate or substantially mitigate
nuisance aspects or hazards of many uses.



      (2)   Uses considered to have certain inherent characteristics
which are incompatible with the purposes and intent of this district, and
which are hereby expressly prohibited shall include the following:



         (a)   Uses traditionally supplying goods or services to
the traveling public, including but not limited to gasoline service stations,
car washes, tire stores and other automotive supply and service, hotels and
motels, off-premise advertising signs;



         (b)   Car, truck, mobile home and trailer rental, lease,
repair or sales;



         (c)   Repair services, except for business machine
repair services catering primarily to the offices in the district;



         (d)   Recreational, health and entertainment services,
except as an accessory use as restricted by division (C) above;



         (e)   Transmitting towers or receiving antennas which
cannot be screened from observation by adjoining properties or by normal
traffic on public thoroughfares within 1,000 feet of the property;



         (f)   Wholesaling or warehousing;



         (g)   Schools, hospitals;



         (h)   Uses generating outgoing shipping in excess of
four trucks in any 24-hour period; and



         (i)   Uses creating an identifiable nuisance or hazard,
including violation of any of the provisions of this district.



      (3)   The above prohibited uses shall not be construed to
include restaurants, nor establishments selling office equipment, stationery
and similar supplies, or services primarily to the businesses within the
district if they are in compliance with the provisions of this district.



      (4)   The city shall have broad discretionary powers in the
interpretation and administration of this district in determining whether all
criteria have been properly complied with. Any use which is not specifically
listed as prohibited but is interpreted as such by reason of similarity to a
listed prohibited use in the application of such powers is hereby defined to
be a conditional use, subject to the same procedures and requirements
elsewhere defined.



   (C)   Accessory uses.



      (1)   Uses that are clearly subordinate and customarily
incidental to the principal use, including storage of merchandise and
preparation of certain products, may be permitted subject to the standards
set forth in division (E) below; and



      (2)   Restaurants and cafeterias, cocktail lounges, gift
shops, florists, apparel stores, tobacco, candy, barber shops and beauty
salons, convenience stores, books and stationery, health clubs or
recreational facilities, apothecaries, optical shops and similar uses may be
permitted where it can be demonstrated that the number of employees or
clientele of the principal uses on the lot are sufficient to support such
uses, subject to the following criteria in addition to all other requirements
of this code.



         (a)   Such incidental or accessory uses may be separate
tenants but shall be incorporated within the principal building, and designed
to serve the employees of the principal building or complex or their
clientele. Such uses shall not have any direct public access from the
exterior, but shall access through a principal use or from a common mall or
courtyard.



         (b)   Total area of all accessory uses shall not exceed
25% of the gross leasable floor area of the building or complex occupied by
office uses.



         (c)   No signage or merchandise shall be displayed as to
be visible to the general public from off the premises.



         (d)   Properties which choose not to exercise their
right to all or any part of the 25% may transfer such development rights by
recorded instrument upon approval by the City Council after recommendation by
the Planning and Zoning Commission in order to permit development of a larger
aggregation of such accessory use, provided that it can be demonstrated that
such aggregation will primarily serve the district and will not draw the
general public or otherwise violate the purposes of this district.



   (D)   Conditional uses. The following conditional uses may be
allowed by the Board of Adjustment subject to § 160.63, provided such use
complies with the requirements of this and all other city codes and is in
accordance with the Comprehensive Plan of the city:



      (1)   Except as permitted accessory uses as defined and
limited by division (C) above, retail sales or services which normally cater
to the general public or residential households shall be permitted only by
conditional use approval subject to the following conditions in addition to
all other requirements of the district. Such retail sales and services
include but are not limited to convenience stores, food, apparel, appliances,
television and music, beauty salons and barber shops, furniture, department
stores, dry cleaning, tailors, sporting goods, hobby shops, candy, gifts,
florists and similar uses.



         (a)   If the city has zoned or planned an area for
retail development within one mile of the subject property, as measured by
the shortest travel route, wherein a similar business exists or reasonably
may be located in the future by virtue of undeveloped or unoccupied building
sites, such conditional use shall generally not be permitted unless found to
be in the public’s best interest by reason of a possible monopolistic
situation or other extenuating factors.



         (b)   A market study shall be conducted by the applicant
and filed with the city identifying the projected trade area, which shall not
include a significant amount of residential area; enumerate and locate the
projected clientele, and projected capture percentage or market penetration
rate; expected sales volume; and a comparison of the projected expenditure
per capita to relevant data available from the U.S. Census of Retail Trade,
Consumer Expenditure Survey as published by the Bureau of Labor Statistics,
or similar indexes.



         (c)   The market study shall demonstrate that sufficient
demand exists within the District to support such use; that it will not
generate significant traffic from outside the district by virtue of its trade
area; and that no existing or planned retail district can reasonably be
expected to provide such use.



      (2)   Child day care services;



      (3)   Outpatient care facilities;

flood damage shall be prohibited, or restricted and regulated by requiring
such development or uses to be designed and constructed to be protected from
flood damage, including public utilities and infrastructure that serves such
development uses, and to be properly and perpetually maintained to provide
such protection for as long as threats from or by flooding continue to exist.



      (5)   Property that is located within any flood hazard area
shall be regulated to prevent its use or development that in any manner that
may cause loss of property value or be detrimental to public health, safety
and welfare because of hazards from flooding.



      (6)   Measures shall be taken and continued to assure that
property owners in the city are eligible to purchase flood insurance through
the National Flood Insurance Program.



   (B)   The standards required by this district shall be deemed
reasonable for regulatory purposes, but the adoption and enforcement thereof
shall not be deemed to represent or imply that any property will be free from
flooding or flood damages, whether located within or outside of the areas
that the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has determined to be
subject to the hazards of flooding.  This chapter shall not create liability
on the part of the city or any officer or employee thereof for any flood
damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative
decision lawfully made there under.



   (C)   Lands to which this district applies. The provisions of this

§ 160.22  “FF” FLOODWAY FRINGE (OVERLAY) DISTRICT.



   (A)   Lands to which this district applies.



      (1)   The provisions of this Overlay District shall apply to
all lands within the jurisdiction of the City of Urbandale which are
designated as FLOODWAY FRINGE.



      (2)   Parcels that at any time are or have been required to
comply with minimum floor elevation requirements, whether by location within
the Floodway Fringe of a Flood Insurance Rate Map; localized flooding
conditions; or otherwise required by the city as a condition of subdivision
approval or of the issuance of a building permit, shall continue to comply
with such minimum floor elevation requirements regardless of whether such
parcel or property may be all or in part removed from the flood hazard area
as identified by FEMA by reason of approval of a Letter of Map Revision based
on Fill (LOMR-F). The city finds that flood hazards continue to exist for
such properties, including but not limited to reasons expressly identified by
FEMA, and continued and perpetual compliance with the minimum floor elevation
requirements is reasonable and necessary to protect public health, safety and
welfare, and to protect and preserve property values.



   (B)   Permitted uses. All uses within the Floodway Fringe District
shall be permitted to the extent that they are permitted by any underlying
zoning district and provided they meet applicable performance standards of
the Floodway Fringe Districts as set forth in division (C) C below.



   (C)   Performance standards. All uses shall be consistent with the

buildings, manufactured dwelling units and accessory buildings thereto shall
have the lowest floor thereof, including basements, elevated a minimum of one
foot above the elevation of the base flood. Construction or placement of all
such buildings shall be upon compacted fill that is at all points a minimum
of one foot above the base flood elevation, for a minimum distance of 18 feet
beyond the limits of any building.



         (b)   Alternate methods of elevating (such as piers) may
be allowed, but only if topographic conditions, existing street grades or
other factors preclude elevating by fill to the extent of being deemed
confiscatory. In such cases, a professional engineer registered in the State
of Iowa shall design and certify that the proposed construction will be
adequate to support the structure as well as withstand the various forces and
hazards associated with flooding. Not more than 40% of the perimeter of the
area below the lowest floor shall be enclosed by supports, walls, screens,
louvers or other devices. Such area shall be unfinished and shall not be used
for any purpose, except parking of vehicles and access to the building from
the exterior. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot
above grade and shall allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to
automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces. All materials shall be
impervious to water damage.

      (5)   Flammable, explosive or injurious materials. Storage of
materials and equipment that are flammable, explosive or injurious to human,
animal or plant life is prohibited unless elevated a minimum of one foot
above the base flood elevation. Other material and equipment shall either be
similarly elevated or not be subject to major flood damage and be anchored to
prevent movement due to flood waters.



      (6)   Minimum protections. Flood control structural works such
as levees, floodwalls and the like shall provide, at a minimum, protection
from the base flood with a minimum of three feet of design freeboard and
shall provide for adequate interior drainage. In addition, structural flood
control works shall be approved by the Department of Natural Resources.



      (7)   No impeding qualities. No use shall impede or reduce the
capacity or conveyance of the channel or floodway of any tributary to the
main stream, drainage ditch or other drainage facility or system.



      (8)   Subdivisions. Subdivisions shall be designed to minimize
flood damages and shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to
flood damages. Development associated with subdivision proposals (including
the installation of public utilities) shall meet the applicable performance
standards of this chapter. Subdivision improvements shall meet all applicable
performance standards, including but not limited to streets and all other
means of vehicular access to lots being designed to be at all points a
minimum of one foot above the elevation of the base flood. All subdivision
proposals, regardless of size or number of lots, shall include base flood
elevation data for those areas located within the Floodway Fringe Overlay
District.



      (9)   Manufactured dwelling units; anchoring. Manufactured
dwelling units that are located in a manufactured dwelling unit park and that
are subject to the stresses of flooding shall be anchored to resist
flotation, collapse or lateral movement by providing over-the-top and frame
ties to ground anchors. Specific requirements are that:



         (a)   Over-the-top ties be provided at each of the four
corners of the factory-built dwelling unit with two additional ties per side
at intermediate locations for factory-built dwelling units 50 feet or more in
length or one such tie for factory-built dwelling units less than 50 feet in
length;



         (b)   Frame ties be provided at each corner of the
factory-built dwelling units with five additional ties per side at
intermediate points for factory-built dwelling units 50 feet or more in
length or four such ties for said dwelling units less than 50 feet in length;



         (c)   All components of the anchoring system be capable
of carrying a force of 4,800 pounds; and



         (d)   Any additions to the factory-built dwelling units
shall be similarly anchored.



      (10)   Manufacture dwelling units; reinforcement. Manufactured
dwelling units that are located in a manufactured dwelling park shall be
elevated by means of compacted fill or permanently placed reinforced piers or
other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength such that the
lowest floor of the unit and any addition thereto is a minimum of one foot
above the base flood elevation. At a minimum, reinforced piers shall include
a footing extending below the frost depth and designed to support the weight
of the dwelling under saturated soil conditions, and shall be designed and
certified by a professional engineer registered in the State of Iowa as being
adequate to withstand the stresses caused by flooding.

estimated cost of improvements and market value of the building prior to the
improvements; and



         (g)   Such other information as the Administrator deems
reasonably necessary for the purpose of this Code.



      (3)   Action on permit application. The Administrator shall,
within a reasonable time, make a determination as to whether the proposed
floodplain development meets the applicable provisions and standards of this
Code and shall approve or disapprove the application. For disapprovals, the
applicant shall be informed, in writing, of the specific reasons therefore.
The Administrator shall not issue permits for conditional uses or variances
except as directed by the Board of Adjustment.



      (4)   Construction and use to comply with approved application
and plans.



         (a)   Floodplain development permits issued on the basis
of approved plans and applications shall be construed to authorize only the
use, arrangement and construction set forth in such approved plans and
applications, and no other use, arrangement or construction shall be allowed.
Any use, arrangement or construction at variance with that authorized shall
be deemed a violation of this Code and shall be punishable as provided in §
160.61.



         (b)   The applicant may be required to submit
certification by a professional engineer or land surveyor, as appropriate,
registered in the State of Iowa, that the finished fill, building floor
elevations, floodproofing or other flood protection measures were
accomplished in compliance with the provisions of this Code, prior to the use
or occupancy of any structure.



   (C)   Conditional uses and variances.



      (1)   Conditional uses. Requests for conditional uses shall be
submitted to the Administrator, who shall forward such to the Board of
Adjustment for consideration in accordance with § 160.63 of this Code.



      (2)   Variances. The Board of Adjustment may authorize
variances requested from the terms of the “F-M” Floodplain Management
District in specific cases that will not be contrary to the public interest,
where owing to special conditions a literal enforcement of the provisions of
this Code will result in unnecessary hardship. Variances granted shall meet
the following applicable standards in addition to all customary standards for
the granting of a variance.



         (a)   No variance shall be granted for any development
within the Floodway District which would result in any increase in floods
during the occurrence of the base flood.



         (b)   Variances shall only be granted upon:



            1.   A showing of good and sufficient cause;



            2.   A determination that failure to grant the
variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and



            3.   A determination that the granting of the
variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to
public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on
or victimization of the public.



         (c)   Variances shall only be granted upon a
determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the
flood hazard, to afford relief.



         (d)   In cases where the variance involves a lower level
of flood protection for buildings than what is ordinarily required by this
code, the applicant shall be notified in writing over the signature of the
Administrator that:



            1.   The issuance of a variance will result in
substantially increased premium rates for flood insurance which may be as
high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage; and



            2.   Such construction increases risks to life and
property.



         (e)   Notification of all variances filed for relief
from the requirements of the “F-M” Floodplain Management District shall
be forwarded by the Administrator to the Department of Natural Resources
within a reasonable time prior to the hearing for approval or concurrence;
notification of all such variances granted shall be forwarded by the
Administrator to the Department of Natural Resources within ten days after
the date of the Board's action.



      (3)   Decisions by the Board of Adjustment. In granting a
conditional use or variance, the Board shall consider such factors as
contained in this section and all other relevant sections of this Code and
may require the appellant or applicant to provide such information as is
reasonably deemed necessary and may request the technical assistance and/or
evaluation of a professional engineer or other expert person or agency,
including the Department of Natural Resources.



      (4)   Factors upon which the decision of the Board shall be
based. In passing upon applications for conditional uses or requests for
variances, the Board shall consider all relevant factors specified in other
sections of this Code and all of the following:



         (a)   The danger to life and property due to increased
flood height or velocities caused by encroachments;



         (b)   The danger that materials may be swept on to other
lands or downstream to the injury of others;



         (c)   The proposed water supply and sanitation systems
and the ability of these systems to prevent disease, contamination and
unsanitary conditions;



         (d)   The susceptibility of the proposed facility and
its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual
owner;



         (e)   The importance of the services provided by the
proposed facility to the community;



         (f)   The requirements of the facility for a floodplain
location;



         (g)   The availability of alternative locations not
subject to flooding for the proposed use;



         (h)   The compatibility of the proposed use with
existing development and development anticipated in the foreseeable future;



         (i)   The relationship of the proposed use to the
comprehensive plan and floodplain management program;



         (j)   The safety of access to the property in times of
flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; and



         (k)   The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of
rise and sediment transport of the flood water expected at the site.



      (5)   Conditions attached to conditional uses or variances.
Upon consideration of the factors listed above, the Board may attach such
conditions to the granting of conditional uses or variances as it deems
necessary to further the purpose of this Code. Such conditions may include,
but not necessarily be limited to:



         (a)   Modifications of waste disposal and water supply
facilities;



         (b)   Limitation on periods of use and operation;



         (c)   Imposition of operational controls, sureties and
deed restrictions;



         (d)   Requirements for construction of channel
modification, dikes, levees and other protective measures, provided such are
approved by the Department of Natural Resources and are deemed the only
practical alternative to achieving the purposes of this Code; and



         (e)   Provision of floodproofing measures of such design
as is consistent with the flood protection elevation for the particular area,
flood velocities, durations, rate of rise, hydrostatic and hydrodynamic
forces, and other factors associated with the regulatory flood. The Board of
Adjustment shall require that the applicant submit a plan or document
certified by a registered professional engineer that the floodproofing
measures are consistent with the regulatory flood protection elevation and
associated flood factors for the particular area.



   (D)   Penalties for violations. Violations of the provisions of this
chapter or failure to comply with any of the requirements shall constitute a
municipal infraction.  Nothing herein contained prevent the city from taking
such other lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy violation.

§ 160.24  “P.U.D.” PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT.



   (A)   Purpose. The purpose of this district is to promote and
encourage development or redevelopment of tracts of land on a planned,
unified basis by allowing greater flexibility and diversification than is
normally permitted by conventional single lot development in other zoning
districts, because of the substantial public advantages of planned
development. Although Planned Unit Developments (P.U.D.s) may appear to
deviate in certain respects from a literal interpretation of the
Comprehensive Plan, regulations adapted to such unified planning and
development are intended both to accomplish the purposes of zoning and other
applicable regulations to an equivalent or higher degree than where such
regulations are designed to control unscheduled development on individual
lots, and to promote economical and efficient land use, an improved level of
amenities, appropriate and harmonious variety, creative design and a better
living environment.



   (B)   Where permitted. Planned Unit Developments shall be a minimum
of two acres in area, and may allow any use regardless of the prior zoning
classification of the property.



   (C)   Procedure.



      (1)   Pre-application conference. Whenever a developer
proposes a rezoning for a planned unit development, the developer shall
contact the Department of Community Development to schedule a pre-
application conference. The pre-application conference shall include the
Developer and representatives, representatives from the Department of
Community Development and the Engineering Department, and such other city
departments that express a desire to be included in such pre-application
conferences on a regular basis, or that are deemed to be helpful or necessary
by the Department of Community Development. The purpose of the
pre-application conference shall be to acquaint the city staff with the
proposed development, and to acquaint the developer with the procedures and
requirements of this Code and concerns and regulations that pertain to the
proposed planned unit development. The developer shall furnish a reasonably
specific description of the property to be rezoned at the time of requesting
the pre- application conference, and is encouraged to prepare and submit a
conceptual master plan for the proposed development prior to the conference,
in order to facilitate the pre-application conference discussion.



      (2)   Application for rezoning.



         (a)   Following the pre-application conference the
developer shall submit a petition for rezoning in accordance with standard
city procedures for rezoning, accompanied by a Master Plan and related
documents containing the information required by this section, and required
fees.



         (b)   The petition and Master Plan shall be referred to
the Planning and Zoning Commission for public hearing as required by this
Code for rezoning. The Commission shall review the Master Plan for conformity
to the standards of this section, and may approve the Plan as submitted;
require the petitioner to modify, alter, adjust or amend the Plan as deemed
necessary; or recommend that it be denied. The action of the Planning and
Zoning Commission shall be reported to the City Council, where upon the
Council may approve or disapprove the petition and Master Plan as reported or
may require such changes thereto as deemed necessary to effectuate the intent
and purpose of this Code.



         (c)   The Department of Community Development shall
schedule all required public hearings as soon as possible after all required
information has been submitted. The Planning and Zoning Commission shall
report their findings to the City Council in a timely manner.



      (3)   Final plans.



         (a)   Final plans for the Planned Unit Development shall
be comprised of site plans or preliminary and final subdivision plats as
appropriate to the situation and as required by the Site Planning and
Subdivision Codes or specific provisions of the Master Plan. Such site plans
and plats shall contain all information and be processed in the manner set
forth in said Codes, in addition to complying with any specific provisions of
the Master Plan, and shall generally comply with the development concepts
outlined in the Master Plan. No public notice or hearing shall be required
for final plans unless required by the Master Plan or caused to be required
by the Commission or Council. Deviations from the Master Plan may be
permitted as refinements to the design and planning if not defined by this
Code as a substantial modification requiring amendment to the Master Plan.
Such deviations shall be expressly set out and shall be approved by the
Planning and Zoning Commission and City Council.



         (b)   Final plans may cover all or part of the Planned
Unit Development, provided that a final plan covering only a part of a P.U.D.
is hereby defined as a phase irrespective of contrary provisions by the
Master Plan and shall demonstrate the ability to be self-sustaining in terms
of access, services, utilities, open space, economic viability and other
major considerations.



         (c)   The developer may seek to obtain preliminary plat
and/or final site plan approval concurrently with approval of the Master Plan
by expressly declaring such intent and filing all information required by the
Subdivision and Site Planning Codes. Final site plan approval shall not be
granted for an unplatted parcel unless an accurate property survey is also
filed as part of the preliminary plat if a plat is required, or as a
certified property survey in the event a plat is not required.



         (d)   Upon approval of final plans, building permits
shall be issued in the same manner as for building permits generally. In any
event where platting is required, no building permits shall be issued until
the final plat is approved and recorded and all other requirements complied
with. Final plans shall be binding on the petitioner and any and all
successors in title so long as P.U.D. zoning applies to the land, unless
amended in accordance with the procedures set forth.



      (4)   Amendments or modifications.



         (a)   Substantial modifications to the Master Plan shall
be processed in the same manner as a rezoning and additionally shall comply
with the provisions of division (C)(2) above. Notice and public hearing
requirements, and the effect of a denial shall be the same as for rezoning,
provided that the notification area shall be those property owners proximate
to the parcel covered by the amendment, as opposed to the entire P.U.D.
Further provided that in the event a requested amendment for a portion of the
entire P.U.D. is denied, such action shall not be deemed to limit or prohibit
the filing of an amendment to another portion of the P.U.D. having a
substantially different notification area. Any ambiguities or disputes
between this section and procedures for rezoning shall be resolved in favor
of the more restrictive requirements.



         (b)   Substantial modifications are hereby defined to
include, but are not limited to, the following: increased density;
intensification of use by changing to a lower classification, with
conventional single-family being the highest classification and progressing
to attached single-family, multiple family, commercial offices, retail,
warehousing and light industry, to heavy industry; addition of uses, or
elimination of conditions or restrictions on a use or uses; increased floor
area ratios, or other modifications considered probable to generate increased
traffic, sewage, waste consumption or other detrimental conditions;
significant modifications to peripheral buffering or screening, setbacks,
height, locations of buildings, drives or other improvements, which were
intended for protection of proximate properties, provided that substitution
of equivalent screening materials shall not be considered a substantial
modification; modifications to the street pattern, such as that of major
streets or continuations of existing streets, which will have a demonstrable
impact on traffic flow such as to effectively change the functional
classification of the street; modifications to access which may lead to
increased congestion, or to additional commercial or industrial traffic on a
local residential street; or other changes deemed substantial by the Director
of Community Development.



         (c)   Modifications to final plans shall follow the
procedures of the Site Planning or Subdivision Codes, as appropriate, except
in the case of a substantial modification as defined above.



   (D)   Information required on master plan. Applications for rezoning
to Planned Unit Development shall include a Master Plan consisting of all
narrative standards and information, and maps, architectural elevations and
other graphical materials and that are listed on the most-recent application
checklist that has been issued by the Department of Community Development for
this purpose, submitted in the number of copies and format set forth in said
checklist, and shall at a minimum include the following:



      (1)   Sufficient information about adjacent properties and
improvements thereto, to indicate relationships to the proposed development,
including such information as property lines, pedestrian and vehicular
circulation, significant natural features or physical improvements, and
existing and proposed public infrastructure;



      (2)   General locations of proposed land uses and significant
structures, and common open space and recreational facilities; delineating
areas with different uses or building types, and lot sizes, gross density per
acre or floor area ratios as appropriate to the proposed development;



      (3)   General location and size of areas to be dedicated or
reserved for common open space and parks, schools and similar uses;



      (4)   Existing and proposed circulation systems, including
proposed arterial and collector streets, major points of access;
pedestrianways, and in the case of nonresidential developments, off-street
parking and loading areas, and truck circulation and travel routes;



      (5)   Existing and proposed sanitary and storm sewer systems,
water mains and drainageways, in a conceptual nature;



      (6)   Proposed bulk regulations, architectural standards, land
uses, density, floor area ratios for nonresidential developments, and
exceptions or variances from general requirements of zoning and other codes;



      (7)   Sewer usage computations in accordance with the criteria
of the applicable sanitary sewer district;



      (8)   Proposed mitigation along the perimeter of the project
for protection of adjoining properties, such as larger setbacks, and buffer
yards, landscaping, walls, fences or other screening, height limitations,
architectural or site design, or other provisions;



      (9)   A narrative or graphical explanation of how the unified
planning and design concepts, objectives and alternative criteria proposed by
the planned unit development make certain conventional controls and
regulations unnecessary; will result in a development that is superior to
that which could reasonably result from conventional controls and
regulations, as measured by public welfare and benefit; or are necessary due
to unique conditions or characteristics of the property. Such explanation
should describe the character of the proposed development in a way that can
be understood by the lay person; the rationale behind the assumptions,
choices and designs that are the basis for the proposed unified plans; the
compatibility with the surrounding area; and design considerations for
architecture, engineering, landscaping, open space and so forth;



      (10)   Proposed phasing and timetable.



         (a)   The Director may require any additional
information which may be needed to evaluate the proposed P.U.D., or may waive
some submittal items if they do not appear to be necessary or relevant to the
situation.



         (b)   The above information should be shown in a clear
and logical manner in a legible scale. Generally, existing conditions should
be illustrated on a separate sheet for sake of clarity, although existing
topography, access, utility and sewer lines and other items that are
appropriate for understanding the proposal should also appear on the proposed
development plan. It is strongly recommended that an architect, landscape
architect and civil engineer be employed to prepare the plans.



   (E)   Development controls. Although P.U.D.s are intended to promote
and permit flexibility of design and thereby may involve modifications of
conventional regulations or standards, certain requirements which are set
forth below shall be applied to ensure that the development is compatible
with the intent of this Code.



      (1)   Only those uses that are approved and made a part of the
Master Plan, and subject to any conditions attached thereto, shall be
permitted.



      (2)   Height, setback, bulk and other requirements set out in
the Master Plan shall constitute the basis for and become the zoning
requirements , provided that refinements may be made through final plan
approval if not defined as a substantial modification; in lack of any special
provisions set out in the Master Plan, the requirements of the most proximate
zoning district, as defined by use, shall be applied; communication towers
may be allowed on nonresidential properties, as either a permitted or
conditional use, in accordance with the regulations for the district which
the P.U.D. most closely approximates, as determined by the uses permitted and
strictly construed to be a conditional use under the more restrictive
district in the event of any question as to applicable regulations.



      (3)   Project phases shall be substantially and functionally
self-contained and self-sustaining with regard to access, parking, utilities,
required open space, screening and transitional elements and other support
features, and be capable of supporting required operation and maintenance
activities; temporary provisions, such as turnarounds or access easements,
may be required for this purpose; the initial phases generally should not be
comprised of the most intensive portions of the P.U.D., unless the city
concurs this is the most feasible means of developing the property in terms
of access, sewer service or similar physical constraints, or will permit
earlier development of common amenities.



      (4)   Attention shall be given to mitigation of existing or
potential land use conflicts through proper orientation, open space setbacks,
landscaping and screening, grading, traffic circulation and architectural
compatibility. It is the intent of this Code to recognize that appropriate
use of design techniques will provide the required mitigation, and thereby
eliminate the need for certain conventional regulations or standards. As
examples and not requirements: orienting views, access, and principal
activities away from the land use needing protection, placing those least
compatible activities farthest from the common boundary and those most
compatible nearest, can create an effective buffer; setbacks in conjunction
with landscaping can mitigate conflicts by providing a visual buffer,
controlling pedestrian access, softening visual contrast by subduing the
differences in architecture and bulk, and reducing heat, and dense
landscaping can reduce the width of physical separation needed for such
purposes; proper grading will control drainage, can alter views and subdue
sound, and channel access; fences, walls and berms will channel access and
control visual, sound and light pollution; proper architectural use of color,
bulk, materials and shape will enhance compatibility and reduce contrast,
although details added to the building for aesthetic purpose without
consideration to form and surroundings may be detrimental rather than
helpful; and proper design of pedestrianways, streets and points of access
and proper location of parking areas, will reduce congestion and safety
hazards, and help prevent introduction of noise, pollutants and other
conflicts into areas with less intensive land use. Other techniques may also
be used.



      (5)   There shall be a minimum setback of 20 feet for any
garage whose vehicular access faces the street.



      (6)   Permanent care and maintenance of open space, recreation
amenities and other common elements shall be provided in a legally binding
form. If the common elements are to be maintained by a homeowners’
association, the applicant shall file the proposed documents governing the
association for review by legal counsel for compliance with the following
requirements at the time the final plat or site plan is filed.



         (a)   Membership shall be mandatory for each home buyer
and any successive buyer.



         (b)   The open space restrictions shall be in
perpetuity, or automatically renewable, and shall not terminate, except by
approval of both the homeowners’ association and the City of Urbandale.



         (c)   The homeowners’ association shall be responsible
for liability insurance, local taxes and the maintenance of recreational and
other facilities.



         (d)   Home owners shall pay their pro rata share of the
cost or the assessment levied by the association shall become a lien on the
property.



         (e)   The association shall be able to adjust the
assessment to meet changes needed.



         (f)   No change in open space use or dissolution of
homeowners’ association shall occur without approval by the City of
Urbandale.



      (7)   Private open space shall be provided adjacent and
accessible to each dwelling consisting of balconies, deck or yard. Required
open space on the ground level shall generally have a minimum dimension of 15
feet and minimum area of 400 square feet, and one-half of the required area
shall not exceed a slope of five (5) percent. Private open space for dwelling
units located entirely above the ground floor shall generally have a minimum
dimension of six feet and minimum area of 60 square feet.



      (8)   Surety may be required to ensure completion of
recreational amenities provided in lieu of public facilities, or for
mitigating elements such as screening or public improvements.



      (9)   Except where the city agrees to other arrangements, a
P.U.D. shall be comprised of a single owner, or a group of owners acting as a
partnership or corporation with each agreeing in advance to be bound by the
conditions which will be effective in the P.U.D.



   (F)   Validity.



      (1)   In the event the first development phase has not
commenced within two years after the date of rezoning, or if subsequent
phases are delayed more than two years beyond the indicated development
schedule, the developer shall file appropriate information detailing the
reasons for the delay with the Department of Community Development. The
Director shall review the circumstances and prepare a report recommending
appropriate action to be taken concerning the P.U.D. The Planning and Zoning
Commission and City Council shall review the matter, and may continue the
P.U.D. zoning with revised time limits; require that appropriate amendments
be made or action taken, such amendments to comply with the procedures of
this section if deemed substantial; continue the P.U.D. zoning for part of
the area, with or without revised time limits, and initiate rezoning of the
remainder to an appropriate district; or initiate rezoning of the entire
parcel to an appropriate district, provided that the rezoning shall not be to
a zone more restrictive than the applied immediately prior to the rezoning to
P.U.D., except after comprehensive planning analysis. The Commission and
Council may schedule such public hearings as deemed appropriate.



      (2)   Approval of a final site plan or preliminary plat shall
be deemed to commence development, provided that the permanent placement of
construction materials shall have started and be proceeding without delay
within two years after the date of site plan approval, and a final plat
approved within one year after the date of preliminary plat approval in the
event a site plan is not required. Failure to comply with this provision
shall void the site plan and preliminary plat approvals, and make the P.U.D.
subject to review as provided above.



      (3)   The developer shall be responsible for compliance with
all prescribed time limits without notice from the city.



§ 160.25  GENERAL REGULATIONS FOR LAND AND STRUCTURES.



   (A)   Accessory buildings. No accessory building shall be
constructed upon a lot until the construction of the principal building has
been actually commenced, and no accessory building shall be used unless the
principal building is also being used.



      (1)   Detached accessory buildings.



         (a)   No detached accessory building shall be erected
within the minimum setback required along any street, or within the minimum
side yard setback required for a principal structure. Accessory buildings
shall be located a minimum of ten feet from any other building or structure
other than a fence on the same property unless fire protection is installed
within the accessory building in accordance with the provisions of the
Urbandale Building Code for an attached garage, in which case such minimum
separation may be reduced to six feet. An accessory building shall not exceed
12 feet in height, except as provided herein.



         (b)   Detached accessory buildings for a single-family
residence shall not occupy more than 30% of the dwelling’s rear yard; shall
have minimum setbacks of three feet from all property lines if the
building’s main floor is 720 square feet or less in area; minimum setback
of ten feet from the rear property line and comply with the minimum side yard
setbacks for the principal structure if the building’s main floor area is
more than 720 square feet but less than 1,000 square feet, or if a detached
accessory building exceeds 12 feet but is not more than 14 feet in height;
and shall comply with all setback requirements for a principal structure if
the building’s main floor area exceeds 1,000 square feet of floor area or
if a detached accessory building has a height of more than 14 feet.



         (c)   Detached accessory buildings for multi-family or
nonresidential uses shall have minimum setbacks of ten feet from all property
lines if the building’s main floor has less than 1,000 square feet of area;
and shall have minimum setbacks of 25 feet from all property lines if the
building’s main floor area exceeds 1,000 square feet or if the building has
a height of more than 12 feet.



         (d)   No detached accessory building shall exceed a
height of 25 feet in any case.



      (2)   Attached accessory buildings. Accessory buildings except
structures used to house urban or other livestock may be attached to the
principal building provided that the accessory building complies with all
yard requirements for a principal building, regardless of whether the
connection consists of a common wall or a connection by a breezeway or open
porch. If the connection is by breezeway or porch, a separation shall be
maintained between the principal and accessory structures in accordance with
division (A)(1) above.



      (3)   Additions creating nonconformity.



         (a)   In the event that a legally existing detached
accessory building will be made nonconforming by reason of being placed in a
side yard by an addition to a principal building, such existing accessory
building may be retained as a legal nonconforming structure provided the
following conditions have been met.



            1.   The existing accessory building and the
addition to the principal building comply with all other zoning regulations
and the Urbandale Building and Fire Codes including but not limited to
separation between principal and accessory structures and other regulations
specified by divisions (A)(1) and (A)(2) above.



            2.   The location and design of the addition to
the principal building is determined by the Zoning Administrator to be the
only reasonable and practical location for the addition.



            3.   The accessory building has been in existence
for a minimum of three years as determined by the date of the certificate of
occupancy or other verifiable means.



            4.   The Zoning Administrator determines that the
nonconformity created does not alter the character of the neighborhood nor
impair health, safety or general welfare.



         (b)   Such nonconforming accessory building shall not be
constructed as part of the principal building nor attached thereto by a
breezeway or similar structure.



         (c)   Such nonconforming accessory building shall be
subject to the provisions of § 160.59 and shall not be extended, enlarged,
reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except when required to do so
by law or order or so as to be in full compliance with divisions (A)(1),
(A)(2) and (A)(3) above and other applicable regulations and requirements of
this and other applicable codes, and if damaged to the extent of more than
50% of its assessed value, or is abandoned or becomes obsolete, it shall not
be restored except as to comply with the provisions of divisions (A)(1),
(A)(2) and (A)(3) above and all other applicable regulations and requirements.



         (d)   If a building permit is denied by the Zoning
Administrator because of failure to meet divisions (A)(3)(a)1. through
(A)(3)(a)4. above or for other reasons specified by this Code, the applicant
may appeal the decision to the Board of Adjustment.



      (4)   Providing area for accessory structures. Area should be
provided for accessory buildings on properties zoned for detached
single-family residences by preserving an area upon which a 22 feet by 22
feet detached structure or a 12 by 22 feet attached accessory structure can
be located in compliance with all applicable regulations. Such area and
access thereto shall have a slope of 5% or less and be suited for the
intended purpose. Failure to include such provisions shall be grounds for
rejecting plans for a principal structure or additions thereto.



   (B)   Fences and walls.



      (1)   Residential, fences may be placed on the property line
unless limited by easements and except as restricted herein. Fences or walls
shall not exceed a height of six feet if located in the minimum rear or
sideyard setback; shall not exceed a height of four feet in any front yard;
and shall not exceed a height of eight feet in any case. Fences and walls
shall be setback a minimum of two feet from any public right-of-way. Fences
shall not be placed in the minimum setback along any street of any lot
created after July 1, 2000.



      (2)   Security fences are permitted in nonresidential
districts other than the “A-1,” “A-2,” “FW” and “FF”
Districts but shall not exceed ten feet in height and shall be of woven wire,
wrought iron or similar type of non-opaque fencing. Razor wire and other
sharp or dangerous fencing shall not be allowed.



      (3)   Farm Fences of any height shall be permitted in
connection with any farm use, except that the vision clearance triangles
shall be maintained at all intersections.



   (C)   Lot required for each principal structure. All principal
structures shall be located on a zoning lot; and only one principal structure
shall be located, erected or moved onto a zoning lot.



   (D)   Corner lots.



      (1)   Corner lots created after July 1, 2000 shall be a
minimum of twenty feet wider than the minimum lot width required by the
zoning district the lot is located in, and corner lots with side yards
adjoining a municipal arterial or other street carrying higher traffic
volumes shall be a minimum of 40 feet wider than the minimum lot width
required by the district.



      (2)   For corner lots made of record after September 26, 1974,
the minimum setback along the longer street frontage shall be equal to or
greater than the minimum front yard setback required for that district or
classification, depending on divisions (F) below and other requirements of
this section.



      (3)   For corner lots made of record on or before September
26, 1974, the minimum side yard setback shall apply to the longer street
frontage of the lot except in the case of reverse frontage lot, defined as a
corner lot whose side yard adjoins the street that the lot to the rear fronts
on. The minimum setback on the longer street frontage on reverse frontage
lots shall be one-half of the minimum front setback required for the lot to
the rear of the reverse frontage lot, and accessory buildings on the reverse
frontage lot shall not project beyond the minimum front setback of the lot to
the rear. However, the setback on the longer street frontage of reverse
frontage lots of record on or before September 26, 1974 shall be reduced to
the minimum extent necessary to provide a minimum buildable width of 28 feet
on said lot, and if necessary so erection of an accessory building is
possible.



   (E)   Vision clearance triangle. A vision clearance triangle shall
be provided and maintained in every quadrant of every street intersection,
said triangle being bounded by the street right-of-way lines and a line
connecting points on said rights-of-way lines that are located not less than
25 feet from their point of intersection. No vegetation or structure shall be
allowed to exist within said vision clearance triangle that is more than two
and one-half feet and less ten feet above the elevations of said street
right-of-way lines, except traffic control signs, street lights and public
utility poles or appurtenances that by need and function cannot reasonably be
located outside of said vision clearance triangle.



   (F)   Increased setbacks required.



      (1)   Arterial and collector streets. For lots created after
July 1, 2000 in the “A-1,” “A-2,” “R-1L,” “R-1I,” “R-1S,”
“R-2,” “R-3” and “R-4” Districts, the minimum setback along a
collector street shall be the minimum required by the zoning district or 35
feet, whichever is more. The minimum setback in said districts along an
arterial street shall be the minimum required by the zoning district or 50
feet, whichever is more. The increased setback requirement shall apply
regardless of whether the adjoining yard is a front, side or rear yard.



      (2)   Platted setback. If a plat of record is drawn with a
setback that is greater than the minimum setback otherwise required by this
Code, the platted setback shall be enforced as the minimum requirement.



      (3)   Average front yard. In the “A-1,” “A-2,”
“R-1L,” “R-1I,” “R-1S,” “R-2,” “R-3” and “R-4”
Districts, the required front setback shall be increased to the average of
the existing front yards of the abutting principal buildings on each side of
any lot, to a maximum setback of 50 feet on a local or collector street and
maximum of 75 feet on an arterial street. Additions in the front yards of
existing buildings shall not project beyond the average existing setbacks of
the principal buildings on the abutting lots.



      (4)   Planned full right-of-way width not existing. If the
entire minimum right-of-way width as set out in the Subdivision Code has not
been acquired for a public street according to its classification, the
minimum setbacks along the side of the street where additional right-of-way
is to be acquired shall be increased in the amount specified herein, and the
minimum setbacks shall be measured from the centerline of said street. The
amount of increase shall be in accordance with the classification of the
street by the City Engineer, Comprehensive Plan and Subdivision Code, as
follows: local street, 25 feet; collector street, 30 feet; arterial street,
60 feet.



      (5)   Lot adjoining a more restrictive district. If a lot line
is the boundary of a more restrictive zoning district, the minimum width of
the side yard or rear yard on that side directly abutting the more
restrictive district shall equal or exceed the minimum setback of the
adjoining yard of the lot in the more restrictive district. If the minimum
setback along the street in the less restrictive district is smaller than
that of a more restrictive district, said setback shall be increased to equal
or exceed the average of the minimum setbacks required along the street in
the two districts, for a minimum of 150 feet from the district boundary line.



   (G)   Minimum lot depth. The minimum lot depth shall be 115 feet as
measured at the shallowest point unless the lot backs up to an arterial
street, in which case the minimum lot depth shall be 175 feet.



   (H)   Street frontage required. All lots shall have frontage on a
street and obtain vehicular access from a street. Lots that front onto a
public street shall have a minimum of 45 feet of frontage, or 75% of the
minimum lot width required by the zoning district in which the lot is located
if the minimum lot width requirement is less than 70 feet, except for lots
that front on cul-de-sac turnarounds. The minimum frontage of lots on
cul-de-sac turnarounds shall be not less than 65% of the minimum lot width
required by the zoning district. In all cases, minimum frontages shall be as
measured within a single segment of right-of-way, in the case of intermittent
or multiple frontages.



   (I)   Impervious surface in front yard. Not more than 35% of the
front yard of any single- family dwelling unit shall be paved, provided that
this shall not be construed to prohibit a two-car driveway together with a
paved apron leading to parking spaces located behind the minimum setback line.



   (J)   Landscaping and vegetation exempted. Landscaping and other
vegetation is exempt from the setback requirements of this Code, except as
follows: no hedge, landscape planting or other vegetation shall be allowed to
materially impede vision across a front or street side yard between the
heights of four feet and ten feet; or obstruct a sidewalk by reason of having
branches or foliage that is less than two feet from or less than ten feet
above any public right-of-way.



   (K)   Dish antennas, wind towers and solar arrays.



      (1)   Dish antennas that exceed 40 inches in diameter shall
not be placed in a front yard or a street side yard unless it can be shown
that such size is essential to the reception of transmissions, and that no
other viable location exists.



      (2)   Antennas, wind towers and solar arrays shall conform to
the minimum setbacks and maximum height regulations for accessory structures.



   (L)   Private sewage and water systems. If public sewage service is
not reasonably available, as determined by the City Engineer, the minimum lot
width and area shall be 150 feet and one acre respectively, or larger if
greater width or area is found to be necessary by the County Health
Department or City Engineer to maintain safe and healthy conditions for a
private well for domestic water supply or an on-site sewage disposal system.



   (M)   Hazardous site conditions. No land shall be used or structure
erected if the Zoning Administrator determines that the lot or site is
unsuitable for such use or structure by reason of flooding, concentrated
runoff, inadequate drainage, adverse soil or rock formation, unfavorable
topography, low percolation rate, low bearing strength, to erosion, or any
other condition that appears likely to be detrimental to health, safety or
general welfare. The Zoning Administrator, in applying the provisions of this
section, shall in writing recite the particular facts upon which he bases his
conclusion that the land is not suitable for certain uses.



§ 160.26  GENERAL USE RESTRICTIONS AND RULES OF INTERPRETATION.



   (A)   Principal permitted uses.



      (1)   No building, structure, land or water shall be used for
any use that is not listed as a principal permitted use in the zoning
district in which it is located, except for a use that is accessory to and
customarily incidental and clearly subordinate to a principal permitted use
on the same lot, and except for any conditional use that is listed in the
district and that has been approved by the Board of Adjustment. All other
uses shall be expressly prohibited unless judged by the Zoning Administrator
to be substantially similar to a listed permitted use.



      (2)   For the purposes of determining whether a use is
allowed, the permitted, accessory and conditional are listed in terminology
intended to be consistent with the Standard Industrial Classification Manual,
1972 and the 1977 Supplement thereto, as issued by the U.S. Department of
Commerce and on file in the office of the Department of Community Development
(herein “SIC”), said SIC having subsequently been replaced by the North
American Industry Classification System (herein “NAICS” which may hereby
be utilized by the Zoning Administrator to supplement and interpret SIC codes
according to conversions and revisions made in subsequent releases of the
NAICS. The SIC and NAICS classify uses according to major groups designated
by two-digit numbers, whose characteristics are described. Such group or
industry code numbers are listed in parenthesis as appropriate for ease of
reference to the SIC, and shall have no other purpose. Where a group or
subgroup is listed as a permitted use it is intended that all individual uses
listed by the SIC within such group or subgroup be permitted unless otherwise
stated, subject to all requirements of this Code. It is further intended that
where an individual use is listed as a permitted use only that use shall be
permitted and all other uses within the SIC or NAICS group or subgroup are
expressly prohibited.



   (B)   Accessory use or structure. An accessory use or structure
shall not be allowed until the principal use or structure is present or under
construction. Residential accessory uses shall not involve the conduct of any
business, trade or industry except for the home occupations that are
expressly permitted by this Code.



   (C)   Conditional use. A conditional use and any accessory use
thereto shall not be allowed unless an application therefor is approved by
the Board of Adjustment in accordance with § 160.63 and all other
requirements of this Code, and subject to any and all conditions placed upon
it by this Code or the Board of Adjustment. An approved conditional use shall
be constrained according to its extent and conditions at set forth in the
application that was approved, and shall not be expanded, amended, modified
or altered in any way unless any such deviation from the approved application
is first reviewed as approved by the Board.



   (D)   Reduction or joint use. No lot, yard, parking area, building
area or other space shall at any time be reduced in area or dimension to less
than the minimum required by this Code, whether temporarily or on a permanent
basis. No part of any lot, yard, parking area or other space required for a
structure or use shall be credited towards meeting the minimum requirements
for any other structure or use.



§ 160.27  BUFFER YARDS.



   (A)   Purpose, application and use. It shall be recognized that the
creation of zoning districts does not in itself sufficiently protect persons
and properties from possible harm or detrimental influences that are or may
be present on an adjoining property, and that the special buffer yards as set
forth in this section are necessary to more fully achieve the purposes and
intent of this Code. A buffer yard shall consist of a setback together with
plant materials and may also be required to include a berm, fence, wall or
combination thereof according to the requirements of this Code. Use thereof
shall be restricted to landscaped open space to create and maintain a
necessary transition and physical barrier between contrasting land uses. Each
buffer yard setback shall be designed, constructed and perpetually maintained
with plantings, topography and fences, walls or other barriers to screen,
separate and eliminate or substantially mitigate existing or potential
nuisances such as dirt, litter, noise, glare of lights, odor, intrusion of
privacy, danger from fires or explosions, and other adverse influences.



   (B)   Location and use. Buffer yards shall be located on the entire
common perimeter of the contrasting uses, and extend to the lot lines. No
part of any buffer yard shall be used for any building or other structure,
parking, storage, display, loading, active recreation, as a location for
refuse containers, or for any other use or activity which may create a
nuisance or be otherwise detrimental to the adjoining property.



   (C)   Provision of buffer yard. Buffer yards shall be provided and
maintained in accordance with the following.



      (1)   (a)   If adjoining properties in different zoning
districts were improved prior to the enactment of buffer yard requirements,
any existing partial or total noncompliance with the buffer yard requirements
of this section shall be deemed a legal nonconformity. Should a buffer yard
be desired where a conforming buffer does not exist, or if the buffer yard
requirements are increased because of a zoning change or other amendment to
this Code, or other reason, the establishment or increase of a buffer shall
be by mutual agreement between property owners, by conditions of rezoning, or
as otherwise provided by law. However, if an existing improved property is
redeveloped, the legal nonconformity for that portion of such property being
redeveloped shall be considered to be extinguished, and the land to be vacant
land and subject to the buffer requirements.



         (b)   If a buffer yard exists all or in part, even if
not required at the time of initial development, it shall not be reduced or
otherwise modified in a manner that creates or increases nonconformity with
this Code.



      (2)   New nonresidential developments shall be responsible for
providing and maintaining buffer yards adjacent to existing or planned
residential development.



   (D)   Buffer yard design options.



      (1)   Any of the following buffer yard options may be
utilized, unless a specific requirement is established by agreement with
neighboring property owners; is required by the Board of Adjustment for a
conditional use; or is required by the City Council as a condition of zoning
or site plan approval. Buffer areas shall be seeded or sodded with turf
grass, planted with other approved ground cover, or satisfactorily mulched.



      (2)   No buffer yard shall be less than ten feet in width.



      (3)   An existing buffer yard shall not at any time be
eliminated or reduced to a lower standard except after public hearing and
approval by the City Council in accordance with the procedures for a
rezoning, and a finding that conditions have changed to such extent that they
can be satisfactorily mitigated by lesser, alternative measures. For the
purposes hereof, option (a) of (4) and (5) shall be considered to be a lower
standard than option (b), and likewise option (b) to be a lower standard than
option (c) by reason of greater circulation control, noise attenuation,
reduced maintenance, and other mitigation.



      (4)   Buffer yards shall be provided by churches and other
religious organizations located in the “A-2,” “R-1L,” “R-1I,”
“R-1S,” “R-3” and “R-4” Districts, commercial “O-R” uses, and
properties zoned “C-O,” “C-N” or “C-G” that adjoin properties
zoned for any residential use, and properties zoned “C-H” that adjoin any
properties zoned “O-R”, in accordance with any one or approved
combination of the following options:



         (a)   A buffer yard of 26 feet or more in width; and
nine coniferous overstory trees, ten understory trees and 20 shrubs for each
100 lineal feet;



         (b)   A buffer yard of 25 feet or less in width; a
five-foot high earth berm or six-foot high opaque wood fence; and three
overstory trees, six understory trees and nine shrubs for each 100 lineal
feet; or



         (c)   A six-foot high masonry wall, to be designed with
face brick, stucco or similar finished surface facing towards the residential
district.



      (5)   Buffer yards shall be provided by properties zoned
“C-H”, “M-1” or “M-2” that adjoin properties zoned for any
residential use, in accordance with any one or approved combination of the
following options:



         (a)   A buffer yard 35 feet or more in width; four-foot
high earth berm or opaque wood fence; and four deciduous overstory trees, six
understory trees, six coniferous overstory trees and 15 shrubs for each 100
lineal feet;



         (b)   A buffer yard with a minimum width of 25 feet;
five-foot high earth berm or six-foot high opaque wood fence; and nine
coniferous trees, ten understory trees and 20 shrubs for each 100 lineal
feet; or



         (c)   A six-foot high masonry wall, to be designed with
face brick, stucco or similar finished surface facing towards the residential
district; and six coniferous trees for each 100 lineal feet.



   (E)   Buffer yard exceptions and substitutions.



      (1)   Blank wall. Berms or fences otherwise required need not
extend along the building, and planting requirements may be reduced by 10%,
if the building is designed to have no windows, or entrances other than
minimum required emergency exits, and does not have any other potential
source of noise, light, hazard or other nuisance orienting onto or affecting
the buffer yard; provided that this shall not be construed to reduce buffer
requirements along parking or loading areas and similar areas of activity.



      (2)   Existing trees. Existing trees that satisfy the
landscaping requirements of this section may be counted toward satisfying
such requirements on a one to one ratio, except that oaks, maples, lindens,
and similar high quality trees with a diameter of four inches or more,
measured at a height of four feet, may be credited at a ratio of two existing
trees for three required.



      (3)   Coniferous species. Coniferous trees or shrubs may be
substituted without limitation for deciduous material.



      (4)   Solar access. Where solar access is required to be
protected on an adjoining property, understory trees may be substituted for
overstory trees where overstory trees would destroy such access.



   (F)   Minimum size and distribution.



      (1)   Buffer yards shall be designed, and plant material
distributed, in the manner that the Department of Community Development deems
to be the most appropriate for the protection of adjoining properties.
Consideration may be given to topography, prevention of prohibited use of the
buffer area, preservation of solar access, privacy and similar considerations.



      (2)   (a)   Plant materials shall not be pruned or
otherwise prevented from growing to sufficient size to perform the intended
purpose, and shall be so sized at planting to provide the desired buffering
within a reasonable time period.



         (b)   Generally, overstory trees shall be eight feet or
taller; understory and coniferous trees five feet or taller; and shrubs 18
inches or taller when planted.



      (3)   Plant materials shall be properly branched, and shall be
of such type as may be approved by the Department of Community Development.
Balled in burlap or container stock is preferred, and a maintenance bond
shall be provided for a period of one year to guarantee survival of bare-root
stock. Performance bonds may also be required in the event buffers have not
been completed prior to occupancy.



      (4)   Buffer yards shall be properly maintained so as to
satisfy the intended purpose in perpetuity.



   (G)   Contractual reduction. Where desired, the owner of an existing
residence may waive any or all right to protection by buffers required of a
proposed commercial development, or to substitute such alternative provisions
as may be agreeable to all parties, including the City Council. Such
agreement will be kept on file with the city, and may be recorded if deemed
appropriate.



§ 160.28  REQUIRED OPEN SPACE AND LANDSCAPING.



   (A)   Open space that is required by this Code shall be not be used
for or encumbered by any structure or impervious material except for
permitted pedestrian walks and courts, and shall be landscaped and
well-maintained with grass or other acceptable ground cover, trees and shrubs.



   (B)   Trees and shrubs shall be provided at a minimum ratio of two
trees and six shrubs for every 2,500 square feet of required open space
excluding required buffer yards and landscaped setbacks, with a minimum of
two trees and six shrubs, and shall be maintained in perpetuity.



   (C)   Plantings that are required for buffer yards, landscaped
setbacks or other screening shall not be counted towards compliance with
these requirements.



   (D)   Plant materials that die due to third-party vandalism,
disease, storm damage or natural causes shall be replaced in accordance with
this section, whether required for general landscaping, buffer yard or
landscaped setback. Plant materials that are removed, or that die because of
lack of care or maintenance, neglect or willful damage shall be replaced with
new plant materials that are equivalent in caliper inches. It shall be the
duty of the property owner to provide reasonable proof of death due to
vandalism, disease, storm damage or natural causes.



   (E)   Plant material species and minimum sizes shall comply with §
160.27(F)(2) and (F)(3).



§ 160.29  OFF-STREET PARKING.



   (A)   General parking requirements.



      (1)   Off-street parking areas, consisting of parking spaces
and maneuvering aisles or other spaces for traffic circulation, shall be
provided for all uses and development in accordance with this Code. Such
parking shall be provided at the time the use or development is established
or enlarged or increased in any way, and shall be provided in the same zoning
district as the principal use and on the same zoning lot.



      (2)   The minimum number of parking spaces required by
divisions (B) and (C) below shall be provided and maintained for operable
vehicles owned by residents of the premises and visitors in the case of
residential uses, and by employees, visitors or customers in the case of
nonresidential uses, and shall not be occupied by commercial vehicles or
inoperable vehicles nor used for storage of any kind.



   (B)   Residential uses.



      (1)   Each parking space shall have a minimum depth of 18
feet, and a minimum width of nine feet in the case of multi-family dwellings
and a minimum width of eight feet in the case of single-family dwellings.



      (2)   Required parking spaces for single-family dwelling units
may be located in driveways or other maneuvering aisles on the same lot, even
though they may obstruct direct access to other parking spaces provided for
the same dwelling unit, if said parking does not in any manner obstruct
access to any other property and if all other Code requirements are satisfied.



      (3)   All parking spaces shall be located in a carport,
garage, or shall be paved with portland cement (PCC) or asphaltic cement
concrete (ACC) having a minimum nominal depth of four inches, except that
parking spaces provided for the sole use of recreational vehicles may be
surfaced with crushed limestone or other material of such quantity, depth and
size as is appropriate to the size and type of said vehicle in lieu of PCC or
ACC paving, provided that such surface is maintained as a reasonably smooth
and level surface.



      (4)   A required parking space may be temporarily obstructed
by or used to park a recreational vehicle, if sufficient on-site parking
spaces are provided for all vehicles owned by or associated with the resident
household, including frequent visitors, and if the parked recreational
vehicle conforms to § 160.34. This exception may be revoked if the household
appears to frequently utilize on-street parking for its vehicles.



      (5)   (a)   Single-family detached dwelling units.



            1.   A minimum of three off-street parking spaces
shall be provided for each single- family detached dwelling unit. In addition
thereto, an additional parking space shall be provided for each commercial
and recreational vehicle in accordance with this section and §§ 160.34 and
160.35, if a total of more than three vehicles are customarily kept at the
premises by the residents thereof.



            2.   A minimum of two parking spaces shall be
located behind the minimum front setback line, except that an exception may
be allowed for single-family detached dwellings that existed prior to January
1, 1997, to allow such properties have a minimum of one parking space located
behind the front setback line, if it can be shown that the number of vehicles
utilized by all persons residing on the property does not exceed the number
of available on-site parking spaces.



         (b)   Single-family attached dwelling units. A minimum
of two off-street parking spaces shall be provided for each single-family

or otherwise marked as to provide for orderly and safe parking, storage and
maneuvering. Raised curbing shall be installed and maintained along the
entire perimeter of all parking, storage and display areas. Access drives
shall not be located in any residential district except where serving a use
that is permitted in said district.



      (3)   Parking area lighting shall not be allowed spill
illumination into, and no glare allowed to be visible from, any residential
district or public street.

all public streets for parking areas accessory to multi-family residential
and nonresidential uses, and for parking which is a principal use. No part of
any parking, display or storage space for vehicles, maneuvering aisles or
parked vehicle shall be allowed encroach upon or into any public
right-of-way, street or pedestrian way easement, landscaped setback or
interior landscaping, or buffer yard: curbs shall inset into parking spaces a
minimum of two feet to prevent any said encroachment.



         (b)   If the lot or parcel on which said parking is
located was created after January 1, 1997, said setback shall have a minimum
width of 20 feet. In all other cases said setback shall have a minimum width
of ten feet, provided that:



            1.   Nothing in this section shall be construed to
be a waiver or reduction of a larger setback required by an existing
condition of zoning, Planned Unit Development Master Plan or urban renewal
requirement or redevelopment agreement; and



            2.   Said setback may be reduced to a minimum of
seven feet for existing legally nonconforming parking areas that were
developed with an existing parking setback that is less than ten feet, if
this exception is found to be necessary to facilitate an additions to the
existing parking area, or in the case of redevelopment of existing
nonresidential or multi-family properties, to maintain conformance with
minimum parking requirements or to increase the conformance of a legally
nonconforming parking area.



         (c)   A three and one-half foot high berm, or a
continuous hedge of plant materials that attain a minimum mature height of
three and one-half feet, shall be provided in the landscaped setback to
screen the lower portions of parked vehicles from view from the adjoining
street, provided that this requirement may be waived or reduced if the
parking area is three or more feet lower than the street.



      (5)   Parking areas for church, commercial or industrial uses
shall be set back and screened from residential properties, and parking areas
for multi-family residences from any property zoned for attached or detached
single-family residences, by a buffer yard having a minimum width of ten feet
and improved in accordance with § 160.27.



      (6)   Parking areas shall be landscaped as follows, in
addition to landscaped setback and buffer yard planting requirements.



         (a)   Not less than 5% of the total parking area shall
be landscaped and continuously maintained as open landscaped space.



         (b)   Planting beds or islands provided to satisfy the
5% landscaping requirement shall be evenly distributed throughout the parking
area. The entire 5% interior landscaping shall not be placed in one large
planting bed or concentrated in only portions of the parking area.



         (c)   Planting beds or islands shall have a minimum
width of eight feet, and shall be protected from vehicular traffic by curbs
not less than six inches in height.



         (d)   Plantings shall be predominately overstory trees
and shrubs, and shall not be limited to ground covers and shrubs alone. Plant
materials shall be selected for suitability in regard to eventual size and
spread, susceptibility to diseases and pests, and adaptability to climatic
conditions within the parking area. Plantings that are required for
landscaped setbacks, buffer yards or minimum general landscaping
requirements, shall not be credited towards the 5% minimum interior
landscaping requirement.

be paved with either portland concrete or asphaltic concrete cement having a
nominal minimum depth of eight inches, and shall be located and configured in
a manner to prevent all vehicles from projecting into or obstructing traffic
lanes while maneuvering, loading or unloading.



§ 160.31  ACCESS CONTROLS.



   No parcel or lot shall be allowed to construct, maintain or have a
vehicular access to a collector or arterial street unless a permit have been
applied for and approved by the city, county or state jurisdiction having
control over the street or highway, and all such accesses shall comply with
all applicable regulations including but not limited to the following.



   (A)   Nonresidential and multi-family residential uses, except
agricultural uses.



      (1)   All vehicular accesses shall be subject to site plan
approval by the City Council in accordance with the city’s Site Planning
Code. All new vehicular accesses shall align with existing accesses on the
opposite site of the street to the extent practical if they comply with the
separation requirements herein, unless this requirement is waived by the City
Engineer and the City Council approves a site plan with the nonalignment.



      (2)   Vehicular accesses to city arterial and collector
streets shall be located a minimum of 300 feet from all street intersections
and other vehicular accesses as measured centerline to centerline, and may be
restricted to only right-turn movements if the separation from centerline to
centerline is less than 600 feet; provided that a lesser distance may be
allowed due to parcel sizes and access locations in existence prior to
January 1, 2009, or if the City Engineer determines that less separation is
appropriate.



      (3)   Vehicular accesses onto local city streets shall be
located 100 feet or more from all street intersections and other vehicular
accesses, subject to the same provisions applicable to arterial and collector
streets that allow the separation distance to be reduced in special
circumstances.



   (B)   Residential uses. Single-family attached and detached
residential parcels shall not have direct access to city arterial streets
except in the “A-1” Agricultural Reserve and “A-2” Estate Residential
Districts where no other streets are reasonably available to provide access
and the location of the access has expressly been approved in writing by the
City Engineer, or within subdivision plats approved by the City Council where
accesses to such streets have expressly been shown and approved by the City
Engineer and City Council.



   (C)   Agricultural uses.



      (1)   Access shall be allowed to agricultural parcels to the
extent necessary to allow access by agricultural equipment and vehicles to
such parcels for planting, cultivation, harvesting and other agricultural
activities, and to access farm residences and agricultural buildings,
provided that the location of such access shall be reviewed and approved by
the City Engineer only after determining that such access will not obstruct
drainage or create traffic hazards that could be avoided with a different
access location. Such agricultural accesses shall be deemed temporary
accesses and shall expire and be removed upon the cessation of the
agricultural uses for which they were approved.



      (2)   The City Engineer shall have the sole authority to
establish the classification of a street as an arterial, collector or local
street for the purpose of this section.



      (3)   The provisions of this section shall be deemed minimum
requirements, and the approval of any access may be subjected to any and all
additional conditions that the City Engineer and City Council find to be
necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare, and such approval
may be revoked if revocation is found necessary to ensure such protection.



§ 160.32  GARAGE SALES.



   (A)   Casual sales of tangible household goods and personal property
to the public, generally known as a “garage sale,” “yard sale,”
“rummage sale” or “flea market sale” shall not be conducted on any
residentially-zoned property more than twice each calendar year, and each
such event shall be limited to not more than three consecutive days, unless
such sale is being conducted pursuant to an order or process of a court of
competent jurisdiction or by persons acting in accordance with their powers
and duties as public officials.



   (B)   Such sales shall occur only between the hours of 8:00 a.m. and
8:00 p.m. and shall not include new merchandise, consignment items, property
acquired for the purpose of resale, motor vehicles or firearms.



§ 160.33  HOME OCCUPATIONS.



   The regulations of this Code are designed to protect and maintain the
residential character of established neighborhoods while recognizing that
certain professional and limited business activities, when properly limited
and regulated, can take place in a residential structure without changing the
character of either the neighborhood or the residential structure. Any
question of whether a particular home occupation is permitted shall be
determined by the Zoning Administrator pursuant to the provisions of this
Code.



   (A)   Performance standards. In addition to complying with setbacks,
height restrictions, parking requirements and all other regulations of the
district in which it is located, no home occupation shall be permitted unless
it complies with the following standards and criteria.



      (1)   No person other than members of the immediate family
occupying the dwelling unit shall be engaged in the home occupation.



      (2)   The use of the dwelling unit for the home occupation
shall be clearly incidental and subordinate to its use for residential
purposes by its occupants, and not more than 25% of the floor area of the
dwelling unit or 500 square feet, whichever is less, shall be used in the
conduct of the home occupation.



      (3)   No products, stock or goods shall be displayed or sold
on the premises.



      (4)   There shall be no change in the outside appearance of
the dwelling or premises or other visible evidence of the conduct of a home
occupation to adjoining residences or to any street other than the display of
one non-illuminated sign, not exceeding two square feet in area and mounted
flat against the wall of the principal building.



      (5)   No home occupation shall be conducted in any accessory
building except an attached garage.



      (6)   Equipment and materials used in a home occupation shall
not be stored outdoors.



      (7)   The traffic generated by a home occupation shall not
exceed the volume, type and peaking that would normally be expected in a
residential neighborhood.



      (8)   Any need for parking generated by the conduct of a home
occupation shall be met on-site and in a manner that does not create a
nonresidential appearance by reason of excessive paving, especially in the
front yard and the side yard adjoining the street in the case of a corner
lot. It thereby is the intent of this Code that not more than one additional
parking space generally be permitted in the front yard or street side yard,
provided that the Zoning Administrator may allow up to three spaces to be
provided in the case of exceptionally large properties that substantially
exceed the customary lot size in the neighborhood, or if the property is set
back from the street by 40 feet or more. Inability to meet this criterion
shall be deemed a finding that the home occupation is too large or unsuited
for that specific residential property.



      (9)   The home occupation shall not cause, involve or result
in the use of commercial vehicles for deliveries to or from the premises,
excluding a vehicle not to exceed three-quarter (3/4) ton capacity registered
to the operator of the home occupation.



      (10)   No equipment or process shall be used in a home
occupation that creates noise, vibration, glare, heat, humidity, fumes,
smoke, dust or other particulate matter, or odorous matter that is detectable
to the normal senses off the lot if the occupation is conducted in a detached
single-family residence, or outside the dwelling unit if conducted in other
than a detached single-family residence.



      (11)   Mechanical, electrical or other equipment used in the
home occupation shall not be permitted to cause visual, electrical, magnetic
or audible interference, or fluctuations in line voltage, to affect any
radio, television, computer or telecommunication equipment on other premises.



   (B)   Permitted home occupations. The following home occupations
shall be permitted subject to the limitations set forth by this Code:



      (1)   Care for six or fewer children by a resident of the
dwelling unit who is not the parent, guardian or custodian of the children,
for periods of less than 24 hours per day per child on a regular basis,
usually for compensation and that is not required to be licensed by the State
of Iowa;



      (2)   Providing instruction to not more than four students at
a time. In the case of swimming instruction, instructions may be only given

a.m. through 4:00 p.m. on Saturdays, and not more than four students may be
on the premises at any one time with a maximum of eight students per hour;



      (3)   Office facilities for accountants, architects, brokers,
engineers, lawyers, physician, surgeon, dentists, engineers, lawyers and
similar professionals including incidental emergency consultation or
treatment by medical professionals but not general on-site client services,

that the professional will meet clients or deliver services at the clients’
place of business or some other off-site location and not at the residence;



      (4)   Office facilities for individual insurance and real
estate agents but not general on-site client services, reception or meetings,
it being the intent of this Code that the agent will meet clients or deliver
services at the clients’ residence, place of business or some other
off-site location and not at the agent’s residence;



      (5)   Office facilities for ministers, priests, rabbis and
other clergy including incidental counseling but not for group sessions or
general counseling practice on-site;



      (6)   Office facilities for salespeople, sales representatives
and manufacturer’s representatives when no retail or wholesale sales are
made or transacted on the premises, and not including display or storage of
any products, stock or goods;



      (7)   Studio of an artist, sculptor, writer or composer;



      (8)   Dressmaker or tailor; and



      (9)   Any use that is found by the Zoning Administrator to be
a use similar to one of the named uses and to conform to the intent of this
section.



   (C)   Prohibited home occupations. The following uses are
specifically prohibited as home occupations:



      (1)   Child care centers for seven or more children or
otherwise requiring licensing by the state;



      (2)   Beautician, hair stylist or barber;

motorcycles, lawn mowers or garden equipment, snow blowers, small engines,
radios, televisions or other electronics. Rebuilding, repair or
reconstruction of more than two vehicles per year, whether owned by the
occupant or not, shall be construed to be an illegal home occupation;



      (5)   Brokerages or offices for multiple insurance and real
estate agents, or any office engaging employees who are not family members,
that hold meetings on premise, have clients come to the premises or display
or store products, stock or goods on the premises;



      (6)   Dance instruction; and



      (7)   Photographic studios.



§ 160.34  RECREATIONAL VEHICLES.



   (A)   (1)   Not more than two recreational vehicles shall be
parked on any single-family residential lot having an area of one acre or
less.



      (2)   No recreational vehicle owned by persons not residing on
the property shall be parked on any residential property at any time except
for visitors.



   (B)   Recreational vehicles shall not occupy or obstruct access to
any required parking space at any time, except that required for another
recreational vehicle and except as otherwise allowed by § 160.29.



   (C)   Vehicles may be parked in a front yard if such vehicle is
parked on a driveway or on a hard surface having a depth of four inches
located adjacent to and parallel with the driveway; and in a required side
yard subject to compliance with the following.



      (1)   A minimum separation of ten feet, including the side
yard setback of the adjoining property, shall be maintained between the
closest point of the vehicle and any other like vehicle or principal building
(including attached accessory structures) on an adjoining premises.



      (2)   There shall not be an adverse impact upon the passage of
air or availability of light to adjoining properties, or drainage, according
to a finding by the Department of Community Development.



      (3)   (a)   The adjoining property owner does not file a
written objection to such parking in the required side yard, in which case
such proposal shall be referred to the Board of Adjustment for a
determination. The adjoining property owner shall be notified of such
proposal and permitted not less than ten days nor more than 20 days to appeal
any approval by staff for hearing by the Board of Adjustment.



         (b)   In determining whether the vehicle may adversely
affect the passage of wind and air, the Department or Board shall give
consideration to whether increased snow drifting or wind velocity may result
to the detriment of adjoining properties to an extent greater than would
occur from other activities permitted in the side yard. In determining
whether the availability of light will be adversely affected, the presence of
doors or windows on adjoining side walls for living or family rooms, kitchen
or bedrooms; and porches or organized outdoor living space such as that
provided by a deck or patio, shall be considered together with building
orientation, topography and similar factors.



   (D)   No recreational vehicle shall be used as a permanent
residence, except in a conforming recreational vehicle park or campground.



   (E)   (1)   Residents owning recreational vehicles on September
30, 1996 shall not be required to conform to the parking provisions of this
section for their place of residency on September 30, 1996 for the duration
that the resident owns a recreational vehicle or any replacement therefore,
provided that no nonconformity shall be created; no exception is permitted
for more than two such vehicles; and a surface conforming to this Code shall
be provided for the vehicles.



      (2)   Such exemption shall be terminated if the nonconformity
is discontinued or ownership is terminated for a period of one year, or upon
cessation of residency at said premises.

§ 160.37  ACCESSORY DWELLING UNIT (ADU).



   An owner-occupied single-family detached dwelling unit may be allowed

Board of Adjustment makes the required findings for the granting of a
conditional use permit, which permit shall be subject to the following
requirements together with any additional conditions of approval that the
Board may find to be necessary and appropriate.



   (A)   For the purpose of this section, the following definitions

records and as evidenced by voter registration, vehicle registration,
contract of sale or similar documentation.



      PRIMARY DWELLING UNIT. The largest dwelling unit on the lot, and
that is fully compliant with minimum floor area requirements of city codes
and all applicable restrictive covenants.



   (B)   Occupancy of both the primary dwelling unit and the ADU shall
be restricted to the property owner and persons who are related to the
property owner by blood, marriage or adoption, or who provide nursing care or
assisted living services exclusively to said property owner or contract
purchaser in exchange for lodging and other compensation. The total number of
persons occupying the primary dwelling unit and the ADU shall in sum not
exceed the maximum number of persons that constitute a single-family or
household, as defined by this Code.



   (C)   The property owner shall not at any time receive rent or other
compensation or consideration for either or both units. No ADU shall be sold,

porches, decks or other accessory structures or space.



   (E)   The building as a whole and the ADU specifically, shall be
designed in such manner that to the degree reasonably feasible, the building
appears to be a single-family detached dwelling unit in keeping with the
neighborhood. No ADU shall be located in and be a part of a guest house,
detached garage or other detached building.



   (F)   A minimum of two off-street parking spaces shall be provided
for the ADU in addition to the off-street parking spaces that are required
for the primary dwelling unit, which spaces may be in tandem, unless the
occupants of either the primary dwelling unit are unable to legally operate a
motor vehicle by reason of physical infirmity.



   (G)   Not more than one ADU shall be allowed on any lot. Home
occupations and guest homes shall be prohibited on lots having an ADU.



   (H)   (1)   The property owner shall provide a covenant or other
form of deed restriction in a form acceptable to City Legal Counsel and
suitable for official recording with the county, providing notice to
prospective future buyers or owners of the property that the ADU is
restricted as set forth herein, and providing for the ADU to be eliminated
and said floor area to become part of the primary dwelling unit and to
restore the lot and building to a single-family detached dwelling unit.



      (2)   Said covenant shall also provide for restoration of the
property and building to be a single- family dwelling unit by complete
removal of the ADU, in the event that any requirement of this Code or
condition of approval of the conditional use permit is violated.



   (I)   The property owner shall file an owner’s certificate of
occupancy in a form acceptable to City Legal Counsel, evidencing continued
legal residency of both the primary dwelling unit and ADU, each calendar year

permitted or conditional use within a given zoning district may be allowed on
a temporary and limited basis upon issuance of a permit by the Zoning
Administrator, subject to the regulations and conditions prescribed by this
section and to any additional conditions imposed on the permit by the Zoning
Administrator. Said regulations and conditions shall be the minimum standards
deemed necessary to ensure that the public health, safety, welfare, property
values and essential esthetics will be preserved, and no temporary use shall
be permitted that may adversely affect any such public interest. This section
shall not apply to any use that is accessory to a residential dwelling unit.



   (A)   Permit required.



      (1)   A temporary use permit shall be obtained prior to
advertising, commencement or operation of any temporary use allowed by this
section. Applicants are encouraged, but not required, to submit such
application at least 30 days prior to the intended date for any temporary
use. An application for such permit shall be submitted to the Zoning
Administrator on the city form created for such purpose, together with an
application fee and all information and documents required to accompany such
application. The Zoning Administrator shall distribute copies of such permit
and accompanying information to all relevant city departments for review and
comment.



      (2)   Temporary uses may be subject to additional permits or
inspections as required by any applicable law or regulation, including but

and regulations:



      (1)   Seasonal retail sales expressly limited to Christmas
trees; pumpkins; and fruits, vegetables, and other food products being sold
by a single vendor, as opposed to the multiple vendors and broader range of
merchandise that is characteristic of a farmer’s market (hereafter

other provisions of this Code or the Urbandale Municipal Code, but not
administratively under this section;



      (2)   Outdoor display and sales of merchandise customarily
offered by a retail business on an ongoing basis, generally known as a tent,

section);



      (3)   Real estate administrative and marketing offices;
construction field offices, shelters for construction materials and

      (4)   Events hosted by or for the benefit of nonprofit or
charitable organizations that will not have more than 300 persons in
attendance at any point in time, and expressly excluding gambling or gaming,
or the sale or consumption of alcohol or other intoxicants (hereafter
“charitable events” in this section). The Zoning Administrator shall have
discretion in determining whether a charitable event adequately benefits a
qualifying nonprofit or charitable organization, by referring any event or
organization that may be in question to the City Council for a legislative
determination of whether said event or organization complies with the
Council’s intent to support bonafide nonprofit or charitable organizations
that provide substantial benefits to the public or needy, or alleviate
suffering.



   (C)   Duration. The duration and frequency of the permitted
temporary uses listed in division (B) above shall be restricted as follows.

      (2)   Sales promotions shall not exceed four consecutive days
for each event, and not more than two events in any calendar year.



      (3)   (a)   Real estate administrative and marketing

months and to only on-site sales or marketing, “on-site” defined for this
temporary use to be only those lots or dwelling units located within the same
approved preliminary subdivision plat as said office or model home site or
within a specific final plat if so restricted by the Zoning Administrator.
Such offices shall not be permitted prior to the approval of a final plat or
site plan by the City Council as required to allow construction of a
development, and model homes shall not be established until all public and
common private infrastructure has been completed to the satisfaction of the
City Engineer and Fire Chief.



         (b)   Construction offices, staging yards and other
permitted temporary construction uses shall only be utilized for construction
projects on the same premises; shall not be located on the premises more than
45 days prior to commencement or more than 60 days after completion of the
construction for which they were permitted; and only be on the premises for
the duration of such construction or a maximum of 24 months, whichever is
less. The Zoning Administrator can impose a shorter maximum duration or other
limitations at the Administrator’s discretion, or allow renewal of a permit
for up to one additional year for construction projects of extraordinary size
or complexity.



      (4)   Charitable events permitted under this section shall not
exceed three consecutive calendar days for each event, and not more than two

section shall comply with the following requirements.



      (1)   No temporary use shall be located or conducted on public
property or right-of-way unless expressly approved by the City Council;
within common access easements or drives essential to traffic circulation on
public or private property unless approved in writing by all affected

obstruct or impede pedestrian or customer access to other businesses or
properties unless approved in writing by all affected properties.



      (2)   Seasonal sales and sales promotions shall not be
permitted on any residentially-zoned property. Charitable events shall not be
located on any property whose principal use is residential.



      (3)   No temporary use shall be located or conducted within a
required landscape setback or buffer yard, nor shall it be located in any
handicapped parking space or obstruct handicapped access in any way.



      (4)   Suitable and adequate sanitary facilities, either
portable or permanent, shall be made continuously available to all employees,
customers and participants during its hours of operation. If such requirement
is proposed to be satisfied by permanent facilities that are not owned or
directly controlled by the business or operator of the temporary use, written
authorization shall be obtained from the facilities’ owner specifically
stating that the facilities will be available as required herein.



      (5)   All temporary structures, except fences and similar
enclosures and except tents and canopies that are less than 100 square feet
in area; trailers having a bed that is more than ten feet in length; and
commercial vehicles used for or by the temporary use, shall conform to the
setbacks required for a principal structure.



      (6)   Everything associated with the temporary use, including
but not limited to temporary structures, vehicles, fixtures and
appurtenances, equipment, stands and signs shall be completely removed and
the site restored to its pre-existing condition, and all trash and debris
cleaned up, within five days after expiration of the temporary use permit.



   (E)   Regulations for specific temporary uses. Temporary uses
allowed by this section shall comply with the following requirements as
applicable to the use.



      (1)   (a)   Seasonal sales vendors for fruits, vegetables
and other food products shall post information identifying the general city
or county in Iowa where each food item being offered for sale was grown or
prepared, or if not Iowa-grown or produced shall identify the wholesaler or
retailer that is supplying such products to the vendor. Such information
shall be displayed in English in legible, uniform printed lettering that is
between two and five inches in height, in proximity to the pay station and in
clear view of all customers during all hours of operation. Providing false or
misleading information shall be grounds for revocation of the temporary
permit allowing operation of the seasonal sales.



         (b)   All evidence of seasonal sales of fruits,
vegetables and other food products shall be removed from public view between
the hours of 8:00 p.m. and 7:00 a.m. the following day or during the time
when the vendor is not open for business, whichever is more restrictive.



      (2)   Sales promotions that are located on or within a parking
area shall not occupy more than five parking spaces or 20% of parking spaces
for the business, whichever is less; provided that the Zoning Administrator
may allow a larger area to be occupied by such temporary use if the total
number of parking spaces located on the property exceeds the minimum
requirement of this Code or the property contains more than 300 total parking
spaces, and the Zoning Administrator determines that adequate parking will
remain. In no case shall any such temporary use occupy more than 3,200 square
feet.



      (3)   Marketing and field offices, model homes and
construction staging yards and other permitted temporary construction uses
shall be located and configured to be compatible with adjacent uses and to
mitigate noise, dust, traffic, odor and other nuisances. Model homes and
marketing offices for residential developments shall be located on a
collector street and on the periphery of the neighborhood to minimize impacts
on the neighborhood, unless it can be shown that an alternative location is
superior in terms of minimizing neighborhood impacts.



   (F)   Application for temporary use permit. Applications shall be
made in writing on the form provided for such purpose by the Zoning
Administrator and accompanied by the following documents and information in
addition to any listed on the application form. Issuance of a permit shall
not be construed to be a waiver of any requirement of this Code or of any
permit required by another code:



      (1)   A written description of all aspects of the proposed
temporary use, including but not limited to proposed dates and hours of
operation;



      (2)   A site plan depicting the proposed layout of the
proposed temporary use and its relationship to existing site improvements and
conditions. Depending on the nature of the proposed use the Zoning
Administrator may allow such site plan to be hand-drawn to scale, more or
less, or may require it to be professionally prepared and to include all of
the information customarily required for a site plan filed in accordance with
the Urbandale Site Planning Code; and



      (3)   Proof of ownership or property owner’s written consent
to the proposed temporary use; written consent allowing use of sanitary

Administrator that the use complies with all regulations and requirements at
the time of commencement and on a continual basis.



      (2)   A permit may be suspended or revoked by the Zoning
Administrator if the Zoning Administrator finds that the permit appears to
have been obtained through fraud or misrepresentation, or is in violation of
any regulation or requirement, by providing written notice to the applicant
at the address provided on the permit application and setting forth the
reasons for such suspension or revocation.

District may be allowed to offer or provide live entertainment performances
if the Board of Adjustment makes the required findings for the granting of a
conditional use permit, which permit shall be subject to the following
conditions together with any additional conditions of approval that the Board
may find to be necessary and appropriate.



   (A)   Nothing in this section shall be construed to allow live
entertainment in any drinking place, or the exposure of specified anatomical
areas or the conduct of adult entertainment of any kind, as either a
principal use or as an accessory to a restaurant use, at any time or in any
location.



   (B)   The entertainment shall be provided concurrently with or upon
completion of the serving of restaurant meals to the restaurant’s
customers, as opposed to entertainment being provided to an audience that is
generally separate and distinct from customers who consumed a restaurant meal
or in a portion of the premises where the consumption of restaurant meals is
not the primary use of the space.



   (C)   (1)   An application for a conditional use permit to
provide live entertainment shall include a description of the general nature
and type of the restaurant and the entertainment. Such description shall
become a binding set of conditions on the permit, and shall not be altered or
deviated from, except for adjustments to menu offerings or prices that may be
necessary from time to time to cover customary restaurant expenses or to
respond to customer tastes and preferences.



      (2)   The application for a permit shall at a minimum include
a description of the following.



         (a)   The restaurant proprietor’s certification that
the business will in fact be operated as a standard restaurant, herein
defined and distinguished from a drinking place as being an operation that
will at all times receive not less than 60% of its net operating revenues
from the sale of meals that are prepared and consumed on the premises, along
with non-alcoholic beverages served in conjunction with the meals, as opposed
to alcoholic beverages or any other legal intoxicants or stimulants.



         (b)   Days of the week and the daily starting and ending
times when entertainment will be provided; and the general duration of any
single performance if more than one show or session will be provided in any
single day.



         (c)   Type of entertainment, whether instrumental music,
individual singer, singing group or band, dance, comedy, theatrical,
readings, talk or speech, performance art or some other specified type; the
usual number of performers in any individual session or offering; and whether
the performers are in-house, expected to visit repeatedly at some regular
frequency, or are short-stay performers who may or may not perform again at
the restaurant on another occasion.



         (d)   Whether the restaurant customers will be required
to pay a charge or fee of any sort, regardless of whether the charge or fee
is separate or is levied through increased prices for food or drinks on days
when live entertainment is being provided, and including a description of any
alterations or deviations from the restaurant’s customary menu and pricing
that may be instituted relative to the times when entertainment is being
offered, together with any other information that may be necessary to
determine fees or charges related to the provision of live entertainment.



         (e)   Any additional information that the Department of
Community Development may find necessary to adequately evaluate the
application and advise the Board as to its merits.



   (D)   (1)   A permit shall run only with the person who is the
proprietor of the restaurant at the time of application for a permit, and
shall not run with the land or the operation of a restaurant under a
succession of proprietors. Such permit shall not be transferable to another
proprietor, and shall immediately expire with any change to the restaurant
proprietor changes or substantial alteration of the restaurant operations.
Each permit shall be valid for not more than five years after the date of the
Board’s approval, provided that the permit may be administratively extended
by the Department of Community Development for an additional five years if
the restaurant’s provision of live entertainment has been in full
compliance with all requirements and regulations for the duration of the
initial five years of validity.



      (2)   This provision shall not be construed to prohibit a
proprietor from applying for a new permit or further extension of an existing
permit, nor to prohibit a new proprietor or substantially altered restaurant
operation from applying for its own first-time permit in accordance with all
of the requirements of this section.



   (E)   The entertainment performance and all sounds emanating from or
related to the performance shall be limited to and contained within the
interior of the restaurant building or tenancy, as the case may be. Sound
from or associated with the performance shall not be intentionally
transmitted to any outdoor areas, nor allowed to be of such volume,
character, or nature that it is discernable at the boundaries of the parcel
on which the restaurant is located, whether intentional or unintentional. All
windows and doors shall remain closed at all times during performances, and
during preparations before and after performances, to minimize the incidental
transmission of sound.



   (F)   (1)   A permit shall immediately be suspended on a
temporary basis, to be followed by a public hearing before the Board at its
next regularly scheduled meeting following publication and notice in
accordance with the requirements for a new permit application, upon a
determination by city staff that any of the following appears to have
occurred:



         (a)   Misrepresentation of any material fact in an
application for a permit;



         (b)   Any change in the ownership, proprietorship or
interest in the business which was not reported to the Department of
Community Development; or



         (c)   Any event which would have resulted in
disqualification from receiving the permit when originally issued.



      (2)   Following its public hearing and a finding that any of
the above are factual, the Board may thereafter revoke the conditional permit
either temporarily or permanently.



   (G)   (1)   Habitual violations of any one or combination of the
following, habitual being defined for the purpose of this section as more
than two incidents in any calendar month or more than six in any calendar
year, as substantiated by city staff, shall be grounds for immediate
suspension of the permit on a temporary basis, to be followed by a public
hearing before the Board at its next regularly scheduled meeting following
publication and notice in accordance with the requirements for a new permit
application:



         (a)   Habitual noise or other nuisance disturbances
originating from the restaurant or its patrons;



         (b)   Habitual violation of the restaurant’s maximum
capacity as established by the Zoning, Building or Fire Codes, or limitations
placed on the permit by the Board of Adjustment;



         (c)   Inadequate parking, as evidenced by vehicles being
parked in landscaping areas; in circulation aisles or fire lanes; on the
street; or on adjoining properties for which no formal arrangements exist
with the owners thereof to allow such parking;



         (d)   Illicit drug use or sales, vandalism, unlawful

Adjustment. All towers, except those designed as an architecturally
compatible element in terms of material, design, and height to the existing
or proposed use of the property, shall be set back 200 feet from any property
which is zoned for residential development, including Planned Unit
Developments, or designated for such use by the Comprehensive Plan. Provided,
however, that the distance may be reduced or waived by the Board of
Adjustment if the residentially zoned land is used for a nonresidential use
or for residential buildings having four or more stories.



         (b)   Notwithstanding the setbacks provided for in this
division (H)(2), when a residence is located on an adjacent parcel, the
minimum side setback from the lot line for a new tower must be equal to the
height of the proposed tower, unless:



            1.   The setback is waived by the owner of the
residence and approved by the Board of Adjustment; or



            2.   The tower is constructed with breakpoint
design technology. If the tower has been constructed using breakpoint design
technology, the minimum setback distance may, at the city’s discretion, be
equal to 110% of the distance from the top of the structure to the breakpoint
level of the structure, or the applicable zone’s minimum side setback
requirements, whichever is greater. (For example, on a 100-foot tall monopole
with a breakpoint at 80 feet, the minimum setback distance would be 22 feet
(110% of 20 feet, the distance from the top of the monopole to the
breakpoint) or the minimum side yard setback requirements for that zone,
whichever is greater.)



      (3)   Separation requirements. Towers, except small cells and
those designed as an architecturally compatible element of the existing or
proposed use of the property in terms of material, design, and height, shall
comply with the following separation requirements, with the separation
between towers of differing heights to conform to the requirement for the
taller tower:



 


Tower Height

 

Conform to District Maximum

 

More than District, Less than 60 ft.

 

60 ft. to 99 ft.

 

100 ft. or more



Spacing
 
As Applicable
 
650 ft.
 
1,300 ft.
 
2,600 ft.



 



      (4)   Landscaping. A landscaping plan shall be provided, and
all plant materials shall conform to § 160.28. If located in any residential
zoning district or area designated for residential use by the Comprehensive
Plan or a Planned Unit Development, a continuous landscaped area with a width
of not less than 25 feet shall be provided around the perimeter of the tower
and any accessory buildings or security fencing or walls and planted with a
row of coniferous overstory trees at not more than 13-foot spacing between
individual trees with a minimum eight-foot height at the time of planting,
together with other plant materials as may be required to effectively screen
the installation. Where the visual impact of the tower and any accessory
structures would be minimal because of existing vegetation or structures, the
landscaping requirement may be reduced or waived by the Board of Adjustment
or City Council.



      (5)   Fencing or screening. The base of the tower shall be
screened from view with a solid screening fence a minimum of six feet in
height, unless waived by the City Council. The City Council shall have the
ability to waive the required screening where the design of the accessory
building is architecturally compatible with the primary use of the property;
the installation is adequately screened by landscaping; or the building and
tower base are not visible from other properties or public streets.



      (6)   Visual impact. All WCFs in residential zones and within
200 feet of residential zones, including equipment enclosures, shall be sited
and designed to minimize adverse visual impacts on surrounding properties and
the traveling public to the greatest extent reasonably possible, consistent
with the proper functioning of the WCF. Such WCFs and equipment enclosures
shall be integrated through location and design to blend in with the existing
characteristics of the site. Such WCFs shall also be designed to either
resemble the surrounding landscape and other natural features where located
in proximity to natural surroundings, or be compatible with the urban, built
environment, through matching and complimentary existing structures and
specific design considerations such as architectural designs, height, scale,
color and texture or be consistent with other uses and improvements permitted
in the relevant zone.



      (7)   Use of stealth design/technology. The applicant shall
make an affirmative showing as to why they are not employing stealth
technology.  More specifically: Stealth design is required in residential
zones, and concealment techniques must be appropriate given the proposed
location, design, visual environment, and nearby uses, structures, and
natural features.  Stealth design shall be designed and constructed to
substantially conform to surrounding building designs or natural settings, so
as to be visually unobtrusive. Stealth design that relies on screening
wireless communication facilities in order to reduce visual impact must
screen all substantial portions of the facility from view.  Stealth and
concealment techniques do not include incorporating faux-tree designs of a
kind that are not native to the state.



      (8)   Lighting. No lights shall be mounted on a tower or
antenna, and the tower and antennas shall not be illuminated, unless required
by the Commission or the Federal Aviation Administration or expressly
permitted by the Board of Adjustment, as may be the case for a multiple-use
installation such as a tower that is also used as a light standard for an
athletic complex. Security lighting may be provided around the base of a
tower if zero cut-off luminaries with a maximum mounting height of 12 feet
are used to limit such lighting to the tower site.



      (9)   Color. All towers shall maintain a galvanized finish or
light gray color, unless otherwise required by the Federal Aviation
Administration, Commission, Board of Adjustment or City Council, and shall
not be painted in a manner which conveys a company identity. All antennas
shall be of a color that matches the tower, poles or building unless
otherwise required by the Federal Aviation Administration, Commission, Board
of Adjustment or City Council, and shall not be painted in a manner which
conveys a company identity.



      (10)   Signage. No signage shall be permitted except for
directional or warning signs, as regulated by the Sign Code. No facilities
may bear any signage or advertisement(s) other than signage required by law
or expressly permitted/required by the city.



      (11)   Code compliance. All facilities shall at all times
comply with all applicable federal, state and local building codes,
electrical codes, fire codes and any other code related to public health and
safety.



      (12)   Building-mounted WCFs.



         (a)   In residential zones, all transmission equipment
shall be concealed within existing architectural features to the maximum
extent feasible.  Any new architectural features proposed to conceal the
transmission equipment shall be designed to mimic the existing underlying
structure, shall be proportional to the existing underlying structure or
conform to the underlying use and shall use materials in similar quality,
finish, color and texture as the existing underlying structure.



         (b)   In residential zones, all roof-mounted
transmission equipment shall be set back from all roof edges to the maximum
extent feasible consistent with the need for “line-of-sight” transmission
and reception of signals.



         (c)   In all other zones, antenna arrays and supporting
transmission equipment shall be installed so as to camouflage, disguise or
conceal them to make them closely compatible with and blend into the setting
and/or host structure.



      (13)   WCFs in the public rights-of-way.



         (a)   Preferred locations. Facilities shall be located
as far from residential uses as feasible, and on main corridors and arterials
to the extent feasible.



         (b)   Tower-mounted equipment. All tower-mounted
transmission equipment shall be mounted as close as possible to the tower so
as to reduce the overall visual profile to the maximum extent feasible. All
tower-mounted transmission equipment shall be painted with flat,
non-reflective colors that blend with the visual environment.



         (c)   For all WCFs to be located within the
right-of-way, prior to submitting for a building permit, the applicant must
have a valid municipal permit, municipal franchise, or exemption otherwise
granted by applicable law.



      (14)   Accessory uses.



         (a)   Accessory uses shall be limited to such structures
and equipment that are necessary for transmission functions, and shall not
include broadcast studios, offices, vehicles or equipment storage, or other
uses not essential to the transmission function.



         (b)   All accessory buildings shall be constructed of
building materials equal to or better than those of the primary building on
the site and shall be subject to site plan approval. Where there is no
primary use other than the tower, the building materials for the accessory
building shall be subject to the review and approval of the City Council.



         (c)   No equipment shall be stored or parked on the site
of the tower, unless used in direct support of the antennas or the tower or
antennas are being repaired.



      (15)   Accessory equipment. In residential zones, all
accessory equipment located at the base of a WCF shall be located or placed
(at the applicant’s choice) in an existing building, underground, or in an
equipment shelter that is:



         (a)   Designed to blend in with existing surroundings,
using architecturally compatible construction and colors; and



         (b)   Located so as to be unobtrusive as possible
consistent with the proper functioning of the WCF.



      (16)   Parking areas. All parking areas and drives shall
comply with § 160.29.



      (17)   Site design flexibility. Individual WCF sites vary in
the location of adjacent buildings, existing trees, topography and other
local variables. By mandating certain design standards, there may result a
project that could have been less intrusive if the location of the various
elements of the project could have been placed in more appropriate locations
within a given site. Therefore, the WCF and supporting equipment may be
installed so as to best camouflage, disguise them, or conceal them, to make
the WCF more closely compatible with and blend into the setting and/or host
structure, upon approval by the city.  A formal exception from standards
under division (J) below is not required for proposals meeting this division
(H)(17) by being a less intrusive design option.



      (18)   Structural assessment. The owner of a proposed tower
shall have a structural assessment of the tower conducted by a professional
engineer, licensed in the State of Iowa, which shall be submitted with the
application for building permit.



      (19)   Exceptions. The Board of Adjustment may grant a
variance from the height, setback and separation standards set forth in the
zoning district or in this division (H), if the applicant submits a technical
study acceptable to the city which confirms that the variance is essential to
the provision of service and that no alternative is available which conforms
to the requirements.



      (20)   Utility poles.  The city shall not mandate, require,
or regulate the installation, location, or use of transmission equipment on a
utility pole, unless allowed by applicable law.



      (21)   Distributed antenna systems or small cells. Although
the city cannot dictate the type of transmission equipment or technology to
be used by an applicant or discriminate between different types of
infrastructure or technology, the city encourages applicants to consider
distributed antenna systems (“DAS”) or small cells because they mitigate
visual impacts.



   (I)   Public notice . Applicants for all conditional use permits
must provide notification to the city, upon submitting an application with
the following:  Names and mailing addresses of all surrounding property
owners (for towers, provide names and addresses within 300 feet of the
property but not more than 1,300 feet from the tower site). An abstractor
must certify accuracy of the ownership list within 30 days of the application
date. After city staff receives a complete application, the item will be
placed on the agenda for the next available Board of Adjustment meeting.
Notice shall be given no less than seven days and no more than 20 days prior
to the meeting. Notice will be published in the local newspaper in accordance
with Iowa Code §§ 362.3 and 414.4. Affected surrounding property owners
will be mailed a copy of the notice by the city. Prior to the meeting, the
meeting agenda will also be posted.



   (J)   Exception from standards.



      (1)   Applicability. Except as otherwise provided, no WCF
shall be used or developed contrary to any applicable development standard
unless an exception has been granted pursuant to this section.



      (2)   Submittal requirements. In addition to the general
submittal requirements for an application, an application for a wireless
communication facility exception shall include:



         (a)   A written statement demonstrating how the
exception would meet the criteria.



         (b)   A site plan that includes:



            1.   Description of the proposed facility's design
and dimensions, as it would appear with and without the exception.



            2.   Elevations showing all components of the
wireless communication facility as it would appear with and without the
exception.



            3.   Color simulations of the wireless
communication facility after construction demonstrating compatibility with
the vicinity, as it would appear with and without the exception.



      (3)   Criteria. An application for a wireless communication
facility exception shall be granted if the following criteria are met:



         (a)   The exception is consistent with the purpose of
the development standard for which the exception is sought.



         (b)   Based on a visual analysis, the design minimizes
the visual impacts through mitigating measures, including, but not limited
to, building heights, bulk, color, and landscaping.



   (K)   Final inspection.



      (1)   A certificate of occupancy will only be granted upon
satisfactory evidence that the WCF was installed in substantial compliance
with the approved plans and photo simulations.



      (2)   Failure to comply. If it is found that the WCF
installation does not substantially comply with the approved plans and photo
simulations, the applicant shall make any and all such changes required to
bring the WCF installation into compliance promptly and in any event prior to
putting the WCF in operation.



   (L)   Maintenance.



      (1)   All wireless communication facilities must comply with
all standards and regulations of the FCC and any other state or federal
government agency with the authority to regulate wireless communication
facilities.



      (2)   The site and the wireless communication facilities,
including all landscaping, fencing and related transmission equipment must be
maintained at all times in a neat and clean manner and in accordance with all
approved plans.



      (3)   All graffiti on wireless communication facilities must
be removed at the sole expense of the permittee after notification by the
city to the owner/operator of the WCF.



      (4)   If any FCC, state or other governmental license or any
other governmental approval to provide communication services is ever revoked
as to any site permitted or authorized by the city, the permittee must inform
the city of the revocation within 30 days of receiving notice of such
revocation.



   (M)   Discontinuation of use.



      (1)   Any tower or transmission equipment that is no longer
needed and its use is discontinued shall be reported immediately by the
service provider to the city.



      (2)   There shall be a rebuttable presumption that any tower
or transmission equipment that is regulated by this section and that is not
operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned.
This presumption may be rebutted by a showing that such transmission
equipment is an auxiliary back-up or emergency utility or device not subject
to regular use or that the transmission equipment is otherwise not abandoned.
For those towers and transmission equipment deemed abandoned, all related
equipment shall be removed within 90 days of the cessation of operation.
Irrespective of any agreement among them to the contrary, the owner or
operator of such unused facility and the owner of a building or land upon
which the tower or transmission equipment is located, shall be jointly and
severally responsible for the removal of abandoned WCFs. If the tower or
transmission equipment is not thereafter removed within 90 days of written
notice from the city, the city may remove the WCF at the owner of the
property’s expense or at the owner of the WCF’s expense, including all
costs and attorneys’ fees. If there are two or more wireless communications
providers collocated on a single support structure, this provision shall not
become effective until all providers cease using the WCF.



   (N)   Independent technical review.



      (1)   Although the city intends for city staff to review
administrative matters to the extent feasible, the city may retain the
services of a third-party entity of its choice to provide technical
evaluation of permit applications for WCFs, including administrative and
conditional use permits. The third party review may include, but is not
limited to:



         (a)   The accuracy and completeness of the items
submitted with the application;



         (b)   The applicability of analysis and techniques and
methodologies proposed by the applicant;



         (c)   The validity of conclusions reached by the
applicant; and



         (d)   Whether the proposed WCF complies with the
applicable approval criteria set forth in this section.



      (2)   Fees imposed by the city or by a third-party entity
providing review or technical consultation to the city shall be based on
actual, direct, and reasonable administrative costs incurred for the review,
processing, and approval of an application. In no case shall total charges
and fees exceed those provided pursuant to Iowa law.



   (O)   Exempt facilities. The following are exempt from this section:



      (1)   FCC licensed amateur (ham) radio facilities;



      (2)   Satellite earth stations, dishes and/or antennas used
for private television reception not exceeding one meter in diameter;



      (3)   A government-owned WCF installed upon the declaration of
a state of emergency by the federal, state or local government, or a written
determination of public necessity by the city; except that such facility must
comply with all federal and state requirements.  The WCF shall be exempt
from the provisions of this section for up to one month after the duration of
the state of emergency;



      (4)   A temporary, commercial WCF installed for providing
coverage of a special event such as news coverage or sporting event, subject
to administrative approval by the city. The WCF shall be exempt from the
provisions of this section for up to one week before and after the duration
of the special event; and



      (5)   Eligible facilities requests, except as provided for
under division (Q) below.



   (P)   Indemnification. Each permit issued shall have as a condition
of the permit a requirement that the applicant defend, indemnify and hold
harmless the city and its officers, agents, employees, volunteers, and
contractors from any and all liability, damages, or charges (including
attorneys’ fees and expenses) arising out of claims, suits, demands, or
causes of action as a result of the permit process, granted permit,
construction, erection, location, performance, operation, maintenance,
repair, installation, replacement, removal, or restoration of the WCF.



   (Q)   Eligible facilities request applications.



      (1)   Purpose. This division (Q) implements § 6409(a) of the
Spectrum Act, as interpreted by the Commission in its report and order, which
requires a state or local government to approve any eligible facilities
request for a modification of an existing tower or base station that does not
result in a substantial change to the physical dimensions of such tower or
base station. Eligible facilities requests shall be governed solely by the
provisions in this division (Q) and federal law.



      (2)   Application review.



         (a)   Application. The city shall prepare and make
publicly available an application form which shall be limited to the
information necessary for the city to consider whether an application is an
eligible facilities request. The city may not require an applicant to submit
any other documentation intended to illustrate the need for any such wireless
facilities or to justify the business decision to modify such wireless
facilities.



         (b)   Review. Upon receipt of a complete application for
an eligible facilities request pursuant to this division (Q), the city shall
review such application, make its final decision to approve or disapprove the
application, and advise the applicant in writing of its final decision.



         (c)   Timeframe for review. Within 60 days of the date
on which an applicant submits a complete application seeking approval of an
eligible facilities request under this division (Q), the city shall review
and act upon the application, subject to the tolling provisions below.



         (d)   Tolling of the timeframe for review. The 60-day
review period begins to run when the application is filed, and may be tolled
only by mutual agreement between the city and the applicant, or in cases
where the city determines that the application is incomplete. The timeframe
for review is not tolled by a moratorium on the review of applications.



            1.   To toll the timeframe for incompleteness, the
city must provide written notice to the applicant within 30 days of receipt
of the application, specifically delineating all missing documents or
information required in the application.



            2.   The timeframe for review begins running again
when the applicant makes a supplemental submission in response to the
city’s notice of incompleteness.



            3.   Following a supplemental submission, the city
will notify the applicant within ten days that the supplemental submission
did not provide the information identified in the original notice delineating
missing information. The timeframe is tolled in the case of second or
subsequent notices pursuant to the procedures identified in this division
(Q). Second or subsequent notices of incompleteness may not specify missing
documents or information that were not delineated in the original notice of
incompleteness.



         (e)   Failure to act.  In the event the city fails to
approve or deny a complete application under this division (Q) within the
timeframe for review (accounting for any tolling), the request shall be
deemed granted provided the applicant notifies the city in writing after the
review period has expired (accounting for any tolling) indicating the basis
for its belief that the application must be deemed granted.



(Ord. 2016-09, passed 8-16-2016)



§ 160.48  SMALL WIND ENERGY CONVERSION SYSTEM (SWECS).



   (A)   Conditional use permit required. Only SWECS shall be allowed
under any circumstances, and it shall be unlawful to construct, erect,
install, alter or locate any SWECS within the city unless a conditional use
permit has first been granted by the Board of Adjustment in accordance with
§ 160.63 and this section. As part of the application for a conditional use
permit, the applicant shall submit the following evidence and documentation.



      (1)   Utility notification. The property owner shall show that
the public electrical utility has been notified of the proposed installation
of an interconnected customer-owned generator, or alternatively shall state
in the application that the owner intends to operate the SWECS and principal
use without connecting the SWECS and principal use of the lot, or any
building or structure located thereon, to the public electrical utility’s
distribution and transmission facilities (herein, “off-grid”).



      (2)   Utility interconnection. The property owner shall
provide copy of an executed interconnection agreement to the city prior to
the issuance of any permit for a SWECS, and the SWECS shall comply with the
requirements for interconnection and operation as set forth by the public
electrical utility and the Iowa Utilities Board, except in the case of an
off-grid lot and SWECS.



      (3)   Feasibility study.



         (a)   Actual wind speeds shall be measured at the
proposed site for a minimum of a three-month period for the specific SWECS
design and mounting height at the proposed SWECS location. Said data together
with resources available from the Iowa Energy Center or similar public source
shall be used to calculate the projected annual electrical generation of the
proposed SWECS based upon the average annual wind speed at the proposed SWECS
site, and the percentage of the principal use’s annual electrical
consumption that it may supply.



         (b)   The conditional use permit may be revoked by the
Board at any time upon finding that a SWECS is not compliant with this Code
or with any of the conditions stipulated or required by the Board in granting
the conditional use permit.



         (c)   The property owner shall be responsible for
obtaining and complying with all other permits that may be required by
federal, state and local agencies or departments, prior to installing or
operating any SWECS.



   (B)   Restricted to accessory use. A SWECS shall be allowed only as
an accessory use and shall supply electrical power solely for consumption by
the principal use on the lot, except that excess electrical power generated
and not presently needed by the principal use may be sold to a public
electrical utility company that provides electrical power to the principal
use, in accordance with the Code of Iowa and § 199, Chapter 15.11(5) of the
Iowa Administrative Code as they may be amended from time to time.



   (C)   Minimum lot size. The minimum lot size for a SWECS shall be
one acre, regardless of zoning district or principal use of the lot, and
regardless of whether the SWECS is free-standing or building-mounted.



   (D)   Performance standards.



      (1)   Minimum annual average wind speed. Measurements at the
proposed site and the mounting height for the SWECS shall show that the
actual annual average wind speed is reasonably expected to be greater than
nine mph under the existing conditions, unless the specific SWECS design can
be shown to function efficiently at a lower annual average wind speed.



      (2)   Number of SWECS on a lot.



         (a)   Residential use. Each residential lot shall be
restricted to a maximum of one SWECS.



         (b)   Nonresidential use. Each nonresidential use shall
be restricted to a maximum of one free-standing SWECS that is equal to or
taller than the tallest existing principal building that is located on the
lot, exclusive of towers, spires, penthouses or other architectural
projections.



            1.   Additional roof-mounted SWECS, and
free-standing SWECS that are shorter than said principal building, may be
allowed provided that the total aggregate annual generating capacity rating
of all SWECS shall not exceed the annual electrical consumption of the
principal use.



            2.   For the purposes of this section, any lot
that is legally used for both residential and commercial purposes shall be
considered to be a commercial use.



      (3)   Location and clearance.



         (a)   All freestanding SWECS shall be restricted to the
rear yard of the lot.



         (b)   No part of any SWECS shall encroach into or over
any public easement, or any public utility easement that has been obtained
for distribution lines, whether electrical, natural gas or telecommunications.



         (c)   The lowest point along the outer-most arc of the
blades of a horizontal axis SWECS shall be a minimum of 30 feet above the
highest ground elevation. No portion of the blades, rotor or other moving
parts of a vertical axis SWECS shall be less than 15 feet above the highest
ground elevation. No blades of any SWEC shall extend over any property line,
walkway, parking space or driveway. All blades shall at all time, now or in
the future, have a minimum clearance of 20 feet in all directions from all
trees and other vegetation, structures and wires and other inanimate physical
objects.



      (4)   Tower design. Any tower that is used for or is part of
WECS shall be restricted to a monopole design that does not necessitate guy
wires, ground anchors or other external supports, whether the WECS is
free-standing or building-mounted. Lattice, guyed and all other types of
towers are expressly prohibited



      (5)   General design.



         (a)   Safety.



            1.   Every SWECS shall be equipped with both
automatic and manual braking, governing or feathering systems to prevent

approved for the purpose of the antenna, shall not require approval by the
Board of Adjustment.



      (2)   Communication antennas may be mounted directly on an
existing structure on a nonresidential property, and shall not require
approval by the Board of Adjustment if the installation conforms to the
height and setback requirements for buildings permitted in the zoning
district.



      (3)   Communication towers that are designed as an
architecturally compatible element may be added to an existing nonresidential
use, such as a school or church, without approval by the Board of Adjustment,
subject to the same height and setback requirements as for other structures
permitted in this District, and to the performance standards in § 160.47
except those pertaining to landscaping, fencing or screening.



      (4)   The maximum height of the tower shall be three times the
setback from the nearest property line, unless otherwise limited by the
maximum height requirement of the specific zoning district. No use shall be
permitted inside of the perimeter of the guys, if the tower is guyed, or in
the fall zone as certified by a licenses engineer, that is not directly
accessory to the tower. The fall zone of the tower shall be completely within
the boundaries of the subject property.



      (5)   Water towers, treatment plants, electrical substations,
regulator stations and similar utility installations, except communication
towers and facilities for maintenance or general operations, may exceed the
maximum allowable height of a zoning district, provided that evidence shall
be provided to show that the additional height is essential to service the
public; that no reasonable alternative exists; and that all negative impacts,
including esthetics, have been mitigated to the extent possible. Such
mitigation may include, but are not limited to, requirements for increased
setbacks; screening with landscaping, berms, fences or walls; and
architectural treatments.



      (6)   Overhead utility transmission lines are exempt from
setback and height regulations.



§ 160.59  LEGALLY NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES.



   (A)   Legal nonconformities.



      (1)   A use of a property and improvements thereto that
lawfully existed prior to the adoption of this Code or a subsequent
amendment, that does not fully conform to newly adopted Code requirements,
shall be deemed to be legally nonconforming with respect to said new
requirements and shall allowed to retain and continue such legal
nonconformities, subject to compliance with the provisions of this Code as
they pertain to legal nonconformities.



      (2)   Similarly, a structure that lawfully existed prior to
the adoption of this Code or a subsequent amendment, that does not fully
conform to newly adopted Code requirements, shall be deemed to be legally
nonconforming with respect to said new requirements and shall be allowed to
retain and continue such legal nonconformities, subject to compliance with
the provisions of this Code as they pertain to legal nonconformities.



      (3)   Said provisions shall also apply to legal
nonconformities that were created by the adoption of any previous Zoning Code
or amendment thereto, subject to the same restrictions and requirements that
are required for a legal nonconformity that is newly created by the adoption
of this Code.



      (4)   All legally nonconforming uses and structures shall be
subject to the following restrictions and requirements.



         (a)   Only that portion of the property and other
improvements, or structure, that existed on the date that the legal
nonconformity was created by adoption of a code or amendment thereto may be
continued or operated without complying with this Code in its entirety. A
legally nonconforming use or structure shall not be extended, enlarged,
moved, altered or reestablished or reconstructed, except when required to do
so by law or to become compliant with this Code. Nothing shall prevent the
continuance of a nonconforming use or structure as hereinbefore authorized,
unless a discontinuance is necessary for the safety of life or property.



         (b)   Total lifetime structural repairs and alterations
to structures and property improvements utilized for a legally nonconforming
use, or to a legally nonconforming structure, shall not exceed 50% of the
assessed value of the property improvements utilized for the legally
nonconforming use, or of the legally nonconforming structure, at the time
that the use or structure became legally nonconforming, except to make the
legally nonconforming use, improvements or structure fully compliant with
this Code.



         (c)   Existing fixtures and equipment shall not be
replaced except to reduce or eliminate the legal nonconformity.



   (B)   Abolishment or replacement. If a legally nonconforming use is
discontinued or terminated for a period of 12 consecutive months, all future
use of the property and improvements thereto shall thereafter fully comply
with this Code. If a legally nonconforming structure, or a structure used for
a legally nonconforming use, is damaged or destroyed by fire, explosion,
flood, the public enemy or other calamity, to the extent of more than 50% of
its assessed value on the date that it first became legally nonconforming, it
shall not be repaired, restored or rebuilt except in full compliance with
this Code.



   (C)   Changes and substitutions. If a legally nonconforming use or
structure becomes more conforming or fully compliant, whether by alteration,
discontinuance or expiration, damage or destruction, or otherwise, it shall
not revert back to any kind of nonconformity. If a use that is more
conforming is substituted for or replaces an existing legal nonconforming
use, the nonconformity shall thereafter be limited to the level of
nonconformity of the substituted or replaced use.



   (D)   Record keeping. The Zoning Administrator shall maintain
records for all legally nonconforming uses and structures from the time of
becoming aware of the legally nonconformity until such date that it ceases to
exist. Said city records should list the nature and extent of the
nonconforming use of the property and improvements thereto; the date and
Zoning Code or amendment thereto which caused it to become nonconforming; its
assessed value on the date that the property became non-conforming; any and
all modifications to the property or code that caused to become more
conforming; any damages, deterioration, or other loss in value suffered by
the property for any reason, to the extent relevant to the nonconformity; and
any other information that may be relevant to the nonconformity.



§ 160.60  SUBSTANDARD LOTS.



   (A)   A single-family detached dwelling and accessory structures
thereto may be erected or enlarged on any residentially-zoned parcel that was
of official record in the County Recorder’s office as of September 26,
1974, irrespective of its area or width; provided, however, that if such
substandard lot is combined with abutting lands into single ownership the
substandard lot or parcel shall not be sold or used except in full compliance
with the provisions of this Code.



   (B)   Substandard lots shall comply with all Code requirements
insofar as practical, but in any case shall comply with the following minimum
standards:



      (1)   Building height: maximum of 30 feet;



      (2)   Rear yard: minimum of 25 feet;



      (3)   Front yard: as required by district regulations; and



      (4)   Side yards: the street side yard on corner lots shall
not be less than ten feet; each interior side yard shall be 10% of the lot
frontage; but not less than eight feet.



§ 160.61  ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT.



   (A)   Compliance. No structure, land or water shall hereafter be
used and no structure or part thereof shall hereafter be located, erected,
moved, reconstructed, extended, enlarged, converted or structurally altered
without a zoning permit and or, a certificate of occupancy and without full
compliance with the provisions of this Code and all other applicable local,
county and state regulations.



   (B)   Duty of Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator shall
enforce the provisions of this Code and shall have the following powers and
duties in connection therewith:



      (1)   To issue all permits and certificates required by this
Code;



      (2)   To cause any building, structure, land, place or
premises to be inspected and examined and to order in writing the remedying
of any condition found to exist therein in violation of any provision of this
Code;



      (3)   To act as Secretary of the Board of Adjustment and to
carry out and enforce any decisions or determinations of such Board; and



      (4)   It is the intent of this Code that all questions of
interpretation and enforcement shall be first presented to the administrative
official, and that such questions shall be presented to the Board of
Adjustment only on appeal from the decision of the administrative official,
and that recourse from the decisions of the Board of Adjustment shall be in
the courts as provided by law and particularly by statute.



   (C)   Violations. It shall be unlawful to construct any structure or
buildings or to use any structure, building, land or water in violation of
any of the provisions of this Code. In case of any violation, the City
Council, the Zoning Administrator, the Board of Adjustment, the City Planning
and Zoning Commission or any property owner who would specifically be damaged
by such violation may institute appropriate action or proceedings to enjoin a
violation of this Code.



   (D)   Penalties. Any violation of any of the terms or conditions of
this Code, or any failure to comply with any of its requirements, shall
constitute a civil infraction or misdemeanor and the person responsible
therefor shall be subject to fines or imprisonment in accordance with the
provisions of the Code of Iowa. Each day a violation exists may be considered
to be a new and separate infraction or misdemeanor.



   (E)   Zoning permit.



      (1)   No structure shall hereafter be erected, reconstructed,
structurally altered, enlarged, added to or removed, nor shall an excavation
for any such structure be commenced until and unless a zoning permit
therefore shall have been issued by the Zoning Administrator, except that no
permit is required for an accessory structure less than $100 in value
provided that all other provisions of this Code are complied with.



      (2)   An application for a zoning permit shall be filed with
the Zoning Administrator and shall be accompanied by a drawing or plat, in
duplicate drawn to scale and showing: the lot and the proposed building and
their dimensions; the exact location of the proposed building on the lot and
the use for which such building and any existing building is designed or
intended; location, dimension and present use of any existing building on the
same lot; and such other information as the Zoning Administrator shall
require for the proper enforcement of this Code.



      (3)   All zoning permits issued under this Code shall expire
and be null and void 12 months after the date of issuance, unless work shall
have been commenced prior to such date and to have diligently progressed
towards completion.



   (F)   Certificate of zoning compliance.



      (1)   No land shall be occupied or used, and no building
hereafter erected or structurally altered, shall be occupied or used in whole
or in part for any purpose whatsoever, until a certificate is issued by the
Zoning Administrator, stating that the building and use comply with the
provisions of this Code. No change of use shall be made in any building or
part thereof, now or hereafter erected or structurally altered, without a
permit being issued therefore by the Zoning Administrator. No permit shall be
issued to make a change unless the change is in conformity with the
provisions of this Code.



      (2)   Certificates of occupancy and compliance shall be
applied for coincidentally with the application for a zoning permit, and
shall be issued within 30 days after the lawful erection or alteration of the
building is completed. A record of all certificates shall be kept on file in
the office of the Zoning Administrator, and copies shall be furnished on
request to any person having a proprietary or tenancy interest in the
building affected.



      (3)   No permits for excavation for, or the erection or
alteration of any building shall be issued before the application has been
made for certificate of zoning compliance and no building or premises shall
be occupied until said certificate and permit have been approved and issued.



   (G)   Temporary certificate. A temporary certificate of zoning
compliance may be issued by the administrative official for a period not
exceeding six months during alterations or partial occupancy of a building
pending its completion, provided that such temporary certificate may require
such conditions and safeguards as will protect the safety of the occupants
and the public.



§ 160.62  BOARD OF ADJUSTMENT.



   (A)   Board created. A Board of Adjustment is hereby established

   (C)   Jurisdiction. The Board of Adjustment shall have the following
powers:



      (1)   To hear and decide an appeal by a property owner where
it is alleged that due to unique conditions a literal enforcement of the
provisions of this or the Sign Code will result in unnecessary hardship; it
can be shown any hardship is not self-created; that the spirit and intent of
the Code will be served and substantial justice done by the granting of the

made by the Zoning Administrator in the enforcement of this Code or the Sign
Code. Any such appeal shall be filed within ten days of the alleged error by
the Zoning Administrator, by filing the appeal with the Zoning Administrator
and with the Board, a notice of appeal specifying the grounds thereof. The
Zoning Administrator shall forthwith transmit to the Board all of the
documents and information that constitutes the complete record upon which the
appeal is based.



   (D)   Effect of appeal. An appeal shall stay all proceedings in
furtherance of the action appealed from, unless the Zoning Administrator
certifies to the Board after the notice of appeal has been filed with him or
her that by reason of facts stated in the certificate a stay would, in the
Administrator’s opinion, cause imminent peril to life or property. In such
case, proceedings shall not be stayed otherwise than by a restraining order
which may be granted by the Board of Adjustment or by a court of record on
application and notice to the Zoning Administrator.

in person, or may be represented by legal counsel or an authorized agent. The
Board shall decide each appeal in a diligent and timely manner. The Board
may, in conformance with the provisions of law, grant an appeal from the
provisions of this or the Sign Code; grant a conditional use permit in
accordance with the provisions of this Code and any additional requirements
or limitations that the Board may find to be necessary; and reverse or
affirm, wholly or partly, or may modify the order, requirement, decision or
determination of the Zoning Administrator that is appealed from and may make
such order, requirement, decision or determination as ought to be made and to
that end shall have all the powers of the Zoning Administrator from whom the
appeal is taken.



   (H)   Vote required. The affirmative vote of three members of the
Board shall be necessary to reverse any order, requirement, decision or
determination of any such administrative officer, or to decide in favor of
the applicant on any matter upon which it is required to pass under any such
Code or to effect any variance in such Code; provided, however, that the
action of the Board, setting forth the full reason of its decision and the
vote of each member participating therein, has been spread upon the minutes
and a copy of said minutes has been received by the City Council. Such
resolution, immediately following the Board’s final decision, shall be
filed in the office of the Board and shall be open to public inspection.
Every variance and exception granted or denied by the Board shall be
supported by a written testimony or evidence submitted therewith.



§ 160.63  CONDITIONAL USES.



   (A)   Permit required. The Board of Adjustment may authorize the
Zoning Administrator to issue a permit for a use that is listed as a
conditional use in a zoning district upon finding that such conditional use

be include all of the information required by division (E) below.



   (C)   Public hearing required. A public hearing shall be held, and
notice of the public hearing shall be provided in accordance with the
requirements of the Code of Iowa for a conditional use permit or change in
zoning, whichever provides the greatest notice. The applicant shall provide a
list of all surrounding property owners in the manner required for a
rezoning, and the Zoning Administrator shall use such list to notify such
property owners of the application and public hearing.



   (D)   Findings and conditions of approval.



      (1)   No conditional use shall be granted by the Board of

of the following, and to any specific requirements of this Code as set forth
for certain conditional uses.



         (a)   The establishment, maintenance or operation of the
conditional use shall not be detrimental to or endanger the public health,
safety, morals, comfort or general welfare.



         (b)   The conditional use shall not be injurious to the
use and enjoyment of other property in the immediate vicinity for the
purposes already permitted, and will not substantially diminish and impair
property values within the neighborhood.



         (c)   The establishment of the conditional use shall not
impede the normal and orderly development and improvement of the surrounding
property for uses permitted in the district.



         (d)   Adequate sewer, water, streets, storm drainage and
other public or private common infrastructure, and public services are or
will be provided.



         (e)   The proposed conditional use shall not unduly
burden the public infrastructure or services.



         (f)   Adequate measures shall be taken to control street
access, and to provide increased capacity or traffic control measures, to
minimize traffic congestion on the public streets.



         (g)   The conditional use shall, in all respects,
conform to the applicable regulations of the zoning district in which it is
located.



         (h)   The proposed use shall be consistent with the
Comprehensive Plan.



      (2)   The Board may require whatever conditions, requirements
or limitations that it finds to be are necessary to fulfill the purpose and
intent of this Code in granting a conditional use permit, including but not
limited to access controls, traffic-control devices and turn lanes or other
street capacity improvements, buffer yards, sidewalks and other pedestrian or
bicycle facilities, provisions for public transit, landscaping, architectural
design, type of construction for fire resistance or other necessity, dates
for commencing and completing construction, lighting, fencing, hours of
operation or other controls, deed restrictions, increased setbacks or
parking, height restrictions requirements and provision of surety.



   (E)   Additional filing requirements for a communication tower. In
addition to the customary filing requirements for a conditional use, the
following shall be submitted with any and all conditional use permit
applications for a communication tower:



      (1)   A list of the property owners, and their mailing
addresses, of all properties within 300 feet of the property where the tower
is proposed to be located but not more than 1,300 feet from the tower site,
which shall be the notice area for the conditional use application.
Preparation of the list shall conform to the procedures required for a
rezoning;



      (2)   Site plan, prepared by a qualified professional such as
a civil engineer, architect, landscape architect or urban designer;



      (3)   A report and certification from a qualified licensed
engineer for the tower’s structural design, how it is designed to
accommodate antennas; perform in the event of structural failure; and
appropriate safety precautions such as a collapse zone;



      (4)   A report from a qualified certified engineer which
describes the intended function of the antennas to be located on the tower;
capacity of the tower both initially and at full use, if different, expressed
in the number and type of antennas that can be accommodated by the tower and
the maximum capacity of each antenna in terms of channel elements or similar
measures as may be appropriate to the technology; technically feasible
alternatives; and any other information necessary to determine that the
installation is essential to the provision of service, and that the tower is
the minimum size necessary;



      (5)   A study comparing all potential host sites within an
approximate one-half mile radius of the subject site. Potential sites shall
include existing buildings and towers in excess of 40 feet in height;
properties where towers are currently permitted by-right or by conditional
use permit; and signs or light standards for which a tower might reasonably

Adjustment may require the review of additional sites pending review of the
initial study. The study shall include a description of the surrounding
sites, a discussion of the ability or inability of the site/tower to host a
communications facility and the reasons why the site/tower was excluded from
consideration. The applicant must demonstrate to the city’s satisfaction

following reasons:



         (a)   Unwillingness of the owner to entertain a
communications facility proposal;



         (b)   Topographic limitations of the site;



         (c)   Adjacent impediments that would obstruct adequate
communication tower transmission;



         (d)   Physical site constraints that would preclude the
construction of a communication tower;



         (e)   Technical limitations of the system, specifically
set forth by a qualified engineer;



         (f)   The planned equipment would exceed the structural
capacity of existing and approved towers and facilities, considering existing
and planned uses for those facilities;



         (g)   The planned equipment would cause radio frequency
interference with other existing or planned equipment, which cannot be
reasonably prevented;



         (h)   Existing or approved towers or facilities do not
have space on which proposed equipment can be placed so it can function
effectively and reasonably;



         (i)   The applicant demonstrates that there are other
limiting factors that render existing towers and structures unsuitable; and/or



         (j)   That an existing tower cannot feasibly be replaced
with a new tower which can accommodate co-location.



      (6)   A representative photo simulation of the proposed
facility from affected residential properties and public rights-of-way, as
coordinated with the staff of the Department of Community Development. The
simulation shall avoid the use of perspective or other photographic
techniques, such as the inclusion of tall objects in the foreground, that
distort the perceived size and impact of the facility;



      (7)   An explanation of the need for the facility to maintain
the integrity of the system. A map showing the service area of the proposed
tower and of existing towers, with the proposed service area distinguished
from the existing service area, shall be made available to the staff and the
Board of Adjustment;



      (8)   A signed statement from the applicant indicating their
good faith intent to share space on the tower with other providers; and



      (9)   A copy of a memorandum of lease between the applicant
and the landowner containing the following provisions, or an affidavit signed
by the applicant and landowner attesting that the lease contains these
provisions:



         (a)   The landowner and the applicant shall have the
ability to enter into leases with other carriers for co-location; and



         (b)   The landowner shall be responsible for the removal
of the communications tower or facility in the event the lessee fails to
remove it upon abandonment.



§ 160.64  FEE SCHEDULE.



   (A)   The City Council shall from time to time establish by
resolution a schedule of fees and charges for any approximate costs and
expenses that may arise from reviewing, processing, and issuing permits,

other matters or actions pertaining to this Code and for which the city may
legally impose fees, taxes or other charges. All such legally-imposed fees,
taxes and charges shall be paid in full by the applicant at the time of
