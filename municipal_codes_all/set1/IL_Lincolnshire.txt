village with respect to the use of any other form of borrowing or the

accomplished by such borrowing and in such Bond Ordinance shall

necessary for the welfare of the government and affairs of the Village, is
for a proper public purpose or purposes and is in the public interest,

not exceed eight percent (8%) per annum payable semiannually. The
bonds shall be sold in such manner and at such time as may be
determined by the President and Board of Trustees. If the bonds are
sold to bear interest at the maximum rate, they shall be sold at a price
of not less than par. If the bonds are sold to bear interest at a rate less
than the maximum interest rate, they may be sold at a price of less

the subsequent sale of the bonds therein authorized. In the event of
such subsequent sale and bonds are sold bearing interest at a rate or
rates less than that authorized in the Bond Ordinance, prior to the

abated by that amount representing the savings resulting from the sale
of said bonds at a lower rate of interest than authorized in the Bond
Ordinance.

authorized on behalf of the Village by the signatures of the Mayor and
the Village Clerk, shall require the Seal of the Village to be affixed to
such bonds, shall determine whether such bonds to be issued shall be
registered in the name of the owner as to principal only or whether the
same shall be fully registered as to both principal and interest, shall
indicate the place or places of payment of the principal and interest
maturing on said bonds and shall set forth the form of bonds.
D. Upon the adoption of any Bond Ordinance by the Village and its approval
by the Mayor, the same shall, within ten (10) days after passage, be
published in a newspaper published and of general circulation in the
Village if there be one and if there is no such newspaper then in a
newspaper with a general circulation within the Village, and said
ordinance shall become effective ten (10) days after the date of such
publication.

taxes for collection against all the taxable property situated within the
Village. The taxes so levied for the payment of principal of and interest on
the bonds shall be extended annually by the several County Clerks
without limitation as to rate or amount and such taxes shall be in addition
to and in excess of all other taxes levied or authorized to be levied by the
Village. Except as provided herein, such taxes so levied shall not be
subject to repeal or abatement in any manner whatsoever until such time
as all the bonds authorized and issued under the terms of said Bond
Ordinance shall have been paid in full, both principal thereof and interest
thereon up to and including the date of maturity: provided, however, that
if the Village of Lincolnshire has other funds available, the Village Board
may appropriate such funds and deposit them in trust with the paying
agent for the purpose of the payment of any of the maturities of bonds or
interest thereon, in which event the taxes so levied to pay such principal
or interest may be abated by the amount so deposited, such abatement
to be directed by ordinance of the Village of Lincolnshire, duly adopted
and placed on file with the respective County Clerks at any time prior to
the extension of such taxes for collection.

the amounts required as therein referred to and described, and upon the
delivery of the bonds therein authorized the proceeds thereof shall be
used solely and only for the purpose or purposes for which the bonds
were authorized.

Ordinance adopted pursuant to the provisions hereof, and also any

hereunder shall file an application for such grant with the Village Manager or
his/her designee on a form to be provided to the Village by December 31 of
the year after the year of the applicable real estate property tax levy (e.g.
December 31, 2018 for a grant to apply against the 2017 real estate
property tax levy). Such application shall be accompanied by a signed copy
of the applicant's real estate property tax bill for the year for which the grant
is sought and the applicant's completed personal U.S. Income Tax Return
for the taxable year (2017 Personal Income Tax Return if seeking a grant
against the 2017 real estate property tax levy), and such accompanying
documents as may be requested by the Village to prove entitlement to the
grant, including, but not necessarily limited to, a personal affidavit regarding
income received by the senior citizen and his or her spouse which is not
reported on said personal Income Tax Return. If the senior citizen and his or
her spouse file separate Income Tax Returns, both such returns shall
accompany the application and both may be required to submit additional
information as aforesaid.
The right to file an application and receive a grant hereunder shall be
personal to the applicant and shall not survive the applicant's death, but
such right may be exercised on behalf of the applicant by the applicant's
legal guardian or custodian or attorney-in-fact; provided, however, if an
applicant dies after having filed a timely claim, and said applicant is survived
by his or her spouse, then the grant shall be paid to such spouse if such
spouse is also a senior citizen.
Only one member of a household may file an application and receive a
grant hereunder. While both members of a household are otherwise entitled
to a grant, they must agree as to which of them will file an application.
1-9-4: DECISION ON AWARD OF GRANT: Upon receipt of a timely filed
application and all accompanying documentation as may be required, the
Village Manager or his/her designee shall, as soon as practical thereafter,
determine whether the applicant is a person entitled to a grant under this
Section. If the Village Manager determines that the applicant is entitled to a
grant hereunder, he/she shall submit his recommendation that the grant be
made to the Village Board for final approval and payment.
If the Village Manager determines that the applicant is not so entitled to
receive a grant hereunder, he/she shall so notify the applicant in writing and
the applicant shall have ten (10) days after receipt of such notice to appeal
such determination to the Village Board. Such appeal shall be deemed
properly made by filing a written statement with the Village Clerk within said
ten (10) day period, which statement shall include a statement of the
reasons upon which the appeal is based, including a statement of any errors
alleged to have been made by the Village Manager. As soon as practicable
after such appeal is filed, the Village Board shall consider such appeal and
VILLAGE OF LINCOLNSHIRE TITLE 1-9 SENIOR CITIZEN PROPERTY TAX RELIEF
Revised 12/10/2018 Page 4
make a final determination based upon the written documents submitted by
the Village Manager and the applicant. There shall be no oral presentation
of such appeal except as may be permitted by the Village Board. If an oral
presentation is permitted, both the Village Manager and the applicant will be
entitled to participate therein.
The decision of the Village Board shall be final, and there shall be no
recourse in either a court of law or otherwise. The decision of the Village
Board shall be non-reviewable, and no applicant shall be entitled to a grant
hereunder if the applicant or his/her spouse files a lawsuit to obtain a grant
hereunder, or to claim any other violation of this Section, it being specifically
the intent of the Village Board that this Section would not have been
adopted if such prohibition against review of the decision of the Village
Board in a court of law is unconstitutional or void, such prohibition being
non-severable.
1-9-5: CONFIDENTIALITY OF RECORDS: All records and documents filed with
the Village under this Section, or obtained from any investigation conducted
hereunder, shall be confidential, except for use for official Village purposes
or as may be provided by any law specifically applicable to home rule
municipalities as a limit on such home rule municipality's authority.
Nothing contained herein shall prevent the Village from publishing or making
available reasonable, in the discretion of the Village, statistics concerning
the operation of this grant program provided that it is published or made
available in a manner so that no individual grant or claim is disclosed.
1-9-6: RECOVERY OF FALSE CLAIMS; INTEREST: The Village may recover
from any claimant any amount paid under this Section on account of an
erroneous, false or fraudulent claim, together with interest thereon at twelve
percent (12%). (Ord. 79-561-8)
1-9-7: SUNSET CLAUSE: Any person not already enrolled or having submitted a
grant application by December 31, 2018 shall not be eligible to submit future
grant applications nor receive grants within the definitions of this program.
For the purpose of this sunset provision, any person who has not filed a
grant application within the preceding two (2) years shall not be considered
enrolled in the grant program or eligible to apply for a new grant.
Furthermore, if a senior citizen skips an application year, such senior citizen
shall no longer be eligible to apply for a new grant.

CONNECTION FEE ESTABLISHED
In order for the Village to collect a fair and reasonable charge for connection to the water and
sanitary sewer systems of this Village, the parcels as set forth in Exhibit A shall pay to the
Village, prior to connecting to the system of the Village, the sums as set forth in Exhibit B for
each such parcel. Such sums shall be in addition to, and not as a credit against, all other
connection or hook-on fees as may be imposed by other rule, regulation, resolution or ordinance
of this Village, or shown by its fee schedule, the connection fee hereby imposed being directly
related to the costs to the Village of constructing, expanding and extending the existing systems
to accommodate the parcels as set forth in Exhibit A.
ADJUSTMENT FOR FUTURE COSTS AND EXPENSES
The allocation of connection fees as set forth in Exhibit B is based upon actually incurred as well
as estimated future costs to the Village of constructing, expanding and extending the water and
sewer systems as determined as of the date of this ordinance. In the event costs as actually
incurred by the Village vary from those estimated, the Village reserves the right, for any parcel for
which payment in full of connection fees has not been received, to modify, alter or amend the
allocation of connection fees to such parcel to reflect the actual costs to the Village of
constructing, expanding and extending the waterworks and sewerage systems. The Village
further reserves the right to increase such connection fees to reflect any financing and interest
costs or other changes which the Village reasonably determines are to be allocated to the
construction, expansion and extension of said water and sewer systems.
The allocation of connection fees (Exhibit B) is further based upon the presently existing or
anticipated future zoning of such parcels and the anticipated water and sewer requirements
related thereto. In the event any such parcel is zoned differently than anticipated at the time of
request for connection to the Village water or sanitary sewer system, the Village reserves the right
to alter or amend the connection fees for such parcel in order to reflect such change in zoning
and water or sewer requirements.
This ordinance shall further serve as notice to affected property owners of the additional
TITLE 1-VILLAGE OF LINCOLNSHIRE 15: COMPREHENSIVE FEE SCHEDULE
Revised 11/25/2019 Page 20
connection fees associated with connection of their parcels to the Village water and sewer
systems. Affected property owners must contact the Village in order to determine the adjustment,
if any, to the connection fee figures as set forth herein which will be applicable to any specific
parcel and arising out of changes in costs, allocation of interest or other charges, charges in
zoning, or other similar costs related to the construction, expansion and extension of the systems.

filed. However, if the taxpayer incorrectly determined and underpaid the amount of tax
due, the taxpayer is liable for the underpaid tax along with applicable interest on the

taxpayer, in which case the application shall be deemed invalid and void. The payment
of tax and interest must be made by no later than ninety (90) days after the filing of the
voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to by the local tax administrator.

change in liquor license classification results in a lower fee, the licensee shall not
be entitled to a refund of the difference.
C. When a licensee is selling or has sold the premises for which the license was
issued, and the buyer applies for a liquor license from the Village, if the Mayor and
Board of Trustees find that said application conforms to the requirements of local
and State law, they may authorize the reissuance of the current license to such
buyer, upon the buyers payment to the Village as established in the
Comprehensive Fee Schedule set forth in Chapter 15 of Title 1 of this Code.
3-3-4-9: Change in Personnel:

beneficially more than five percent (5%) of the stock or ownership interest, or
managers of establishments licensed under this Chapter, shall be reported in
writing to the Liquor Commissioner within ten (10) days of the change. A change in
on-site manager requires completion of a new manager/agent form, and that
person must also submit to a fingerprint background check. All new personnel shall
meet all the standards of this Chapter and must otherwise qualify to hold a liquor
license. All such changes in personnel shall be subject to review by the Liquor

the subject of taxation by municipalities in this State. To prevent actual
multi-municipal taxation of the act or privilege that is subject to taxation
under this Chapter, any taxpayer, upon proof that the taxpayer has paid a
tax in another municipality on that event, shall be allowed a credit against
any tax enacted pursuant to or authorized by this Section to the extent of
the amount of the tax properly due and paid in the municipality that was not
previously allowed as a credit against any other municipal tax. However,

owed by the retailer to the State. Retailers shall collect the tax from the
taxpayer by adding the tax to the gross charge for the act or privilege of
originating or receiving telecommunications when sold for use, in the manner
prescribed by the Department. The tax authorized by this Act shall constitutea
debt of the taxpayer to the retailer until paid, and if unpaid, is recoverable at

(1979), and on studies in other cities including the Report of the Attorney
General=sWorking Group on the Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses
(Minnesota, 1989); Memorandum re: Adult Entertainment Ordinance, of the
Assistant Chief of Police of the Tucson, Arizona (May 1, 1990); Hecht, Peter
R., Ph.D., Report to the American Center for Law and Justice on the
Secondary Impacts of Sex Oriented Businesses (March 31, 1996); Adult
Entertainment Businesses in Indianapolis, An Analysis (1984) and McCleary,
Richard, Ph.D. and Meeker, James W., Ph.D., Final Report to the City of
Garden Grove: The Relationship Between Crime and Adult Business
Operations on Garden Grove Boulevard, (Garden Grove, CA, October 23,
1991), this Legislative body finds:
1. SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES lend themselves to ancillary
unlawful and unhealthy activities.
2. Sexual acts, including masturbation, oral sex and anal sex, occur at
SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES, especially those which provide
private or semi-private booths or rooms for viewing films, videos, or live
sexually oriented entertainment. Such activities may result in spreading
communicable diseases such as syphilis, gonorrhea, and human
immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
3. Offering sexually oriented entertainment under conditions that encourage
such activities creates unhealthy conditions.
4. Sanitary conditions in some SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES are
unhealthy, in part because of the failure of owners and OPERATORS to
regulate those activities and maintain their facilities.

Revised 02/20/2006 Page 3
5. Numerous studies and reports have determined that semen is found in the
areas of SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES where PERSONS view
sexually oriented films concealed from public view.
D. The findings noted in Section 3-12-1(C), subparagraphs number 1 through 5
raise compelling and substantial governmental concerns for protecting the
public health, safety, and welfare.
E. SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES have operational characteristics which
should be reasonably regulated in order to protect the compelling and
substantial governmental interest in protecting the public health, safety, and
welfare.
F. A reasonable licensing procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the
burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and OPERATORS of
SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES. Further, such a licensing procedure
will place a heretofore nonexistent incentive on OPERATORS to see that
SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES are run in amanner consistent with the
health, safety and welfare of PATRONS and EMPLOYEES, as well as the
citizens of the MUNICIPALITY. It is appropriate to require reasonable
assurances that the LICENSEE is the actual OPERATOR of the SEXUALLY
ORIENTED BUSINESS, and fully in possession and control of the premises
and activities occurring therein.
G. The regulation of NUDITY, SEMI-NUDITY, and physical contact between
EMPLOYEES and PATRONS in SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES will
further the compelling and substantial governmental interests in preventing
prostitution and other sex-related crimes, including illegal sex acts, and
protecting the public health, safety, and welfare.
H. Requiring open sight lines in SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES and
requiring sufficient lighting will advance the compelling and substantial
governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity
occurring in SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES and will facilitate
enforcement of the provisions of this Ordinance and other federal, state and
local laws, thereby furthering the compelling and substantial governmental
interest in protecting the public health, safety, and welfare.
I. The disclosure of certain information by those PERSONS ultimately
responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of SEXUALLY
ORIENTED BUSINESSES, and by EMPLOYEES of such businesses, will
facilitate the enforcement of the provisions of this Ordinance and other federal,
state and local laws, and will thereby further the compelling and substantial
government interest in protecting the public health, safety, and welfare.

J. A PERSON who recently has been convicted of a sexually related crime is not
an appropriate individual to operate or be employed in a SEXUALLY
ORIENTED BUSINESS.
K. Barring such individuals from the management of and employment in
SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES for a period of years serves as a
deterrent to and prevents the commission of sexually related criminal acts,
including conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted
diseases.
L. A reasonable licensing procedure for SEXUALLY ORIENTED BUSINESSES
assists the MUNICIPALITY in preventing the adverse secondary effects of
such businesses on property values, the prevention of crime, and the public
health.

4-1-4: EXCAVATIONS:
A. When any person makes an excavation within the Village to be used in the
construction of a building, it shall be unlawful for such person to allow such
excavation to remain open for a period of time in excess of that time necessary
or reasonably required to accomplish the construction of said building.
B. In the event that such unlawful excavation, as defined above, is made, the
continued existence of such excavation in violation hereof is declared to be a
nuisance.
C. It shall be unlawful for any person to make any excavation within the Village for
the purposes of constructing a building without providing adequate safeguards
and precautions to protect the health, safety and lives of all members of the
community and, in particular, of minor children who might be attracted to or
have occasion to go upon the property where such excavation exists. The
continued existence of any such excavation without such adequate safeguards
and precautions is declared a nuisance.
4-1-5: ABATEMENT BY VILLAGE: Imposition of any penalty for a violation of this
Chapter shall not be construed as a waiver of the right of the Village to collect
the costs of removal of any nuisance or nuisances as defined by the provisions
of this Chapter. (1971 Code, '73-311-22)
4-1-6: FAILURE TO REMOVE OR DESTROY: In the event that any owner shall
neglect or refuse to abate a nuisance as indicated above, the Village shall
notify the owner, or his agent, in writing of the failure. Failure of the Village to
give notice shall not, however, constitute a defense to any action to enforce the
payment of any penalty provided for under this Code. In case any owner or
agent shall refuse to or neglect to abate the nuisance after receipt of two
notices; the first which shall provide seven calendar days for abatement
followed immediately by a second which shall provide five calendar days for
abatement, the Village Manager, or his designee, shall be authorized to enter
upon the land and to abate the nuisance. If the same owner or agent has
previously been notified to abate a similar nuisance under similar
circumstances anytime in the past twenty four months, then one notice
providing five calendar days for abatement shall be all that is necessary. In
addition to any other duties or obligations set forth in this Article A, any owner
who shall refuse or neglect to abate such nuisance, shall be subject to a fine
set forth in the Comprehensive Fine Schedule of the Code described in Section
17-1. Each day such nuisance remains shall constitute a separate offense.

4-4-1: BACKGROUND; PURPOSE
A. Smoking creates the hazard of injury to the personal health of those in the environment of such
smoke as well as the potential of damage to property that may result from the incendiary nature of
such activity. It has been determined that breathing ambient smoke is a health hazard to both
smokers and nonsmokers. Smoking produces several substances that are considered hazardous to
health including carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide, nitrous oxide and formaldehyde. Secondhand
smoke affects the health of the bystander, interfering with respiratory tract defenses, often causing
nonsmokers to have allergic or irritative reactions, and is a known cause of lung cancer. Because the
hazards of smoking have a potentially harmful effect, material and direct, on the public health,
safety, welfare, comfort, and property of residents of the Village, it is necessary and desirable to
establish regulations that regulate smoking in enclosed Public Places, in enclosed Places of
Employment, in Open Air Dining Areas and near entrances to such Public Places and Places of
Employment. (Amd. Ord. 16-3404-131, eff. 07/01/16)
B. This Chapter may be cited as the LINCOLNSHIRE SMOKE FREE AIR ORDINANCE , the purpose of
which is to protect the public health, comfort and environment by regulating smoking in enclosed
Public Places, Places of Employment and Open Air Dining Areas.
4-4-2: DEFINITIONS
In the interpretation of this Chapter the following definitions shall apply:
BUSINESS Any sole proprietorship, partnership, joint venture, corporation, association

violations of this Section 5 and any consequences of or penalties for
such a violation. This joint and several liability shall apply irrespective
of which party actually committed the violation and whether or not all of
the parties were aware of the violation. (Ord. Amd. 99-1691-75, eff.

5-1-4: SEPARABILITY: It is hereby declared to be the intention of the Mayor and
Board of Trustees of the Village that the several provisions of this Code are

1220 ILCS 5/1-101
VILLAGE OF LINCOLNSHIRE TITLE 5-1: ADMINISTRATION & ENFORCEMENT
Revised 10/27/2014 Page 3
will be required for the building with respect to the provision of such facilities.
B. Underground telephone, electric and gas service facilities, including conduits

utilities underground on a parcel by parcel basis, the developer will have the
option of submitting a cash deposit to pay for the construction costs of placing
the overhead utilities underground at a future time. The cash deposit must be
in the amount of one hundred ten percent (110%) of a certified cost estimate
for placing the existing overhead utilities underground. The cash deposit will be
held in an escrow fund by the Village which will be used for placing utilities
underground in a comprehensive manner as the properties in the area
develop. The developer will be entitled to a refund of the deposit if the funds
are not expended within seven (7) years of receipt. (Ord. 90-1173-57)

In addition, it is the intent of this Section to preserve, and protect and promote
the enhancement of property and taxable values, as well as the general
welfare of the residents of the Village.
One very important means by which this goal can be achieved is the
installation of exterior equipment in a manner that is pleasing to the eye and in
harmony with the predominantly residential character of the Village, and which
will contribute to those qualities that bring lasting value to our community and
raise the level of community expectations for the quality of its total

5-3-4: WATER AND SEWER CONNECTION CHARGES
A. Basis for Connection Charge: Water and sewer connection charges within the Village corporate limits
shall be calculated on the basis of equivalent dwelling units (EDUs). Each dwelling unit, as defined
by the Zoning Definitions as set forth in Chapter 2 of Title 7 of this Code, is considered one EDU.
EDUs for all nonresidential buildings are determined according to a schedule based upon the
type/use of building.
B. Formula for Determining Annual Water and Sewer Connection Charges: Annually, prior to the start
of each fiscal year, the present value of the combined water and sewer system of the Village shall be
reviewed and set for the upcoming fiscal year. The Village Engineer, in consultation with the Finance
Director, shall determine the total value of the combined water and sewer system at such time based
upon the following:
Current replacement value of all accepted water and sanitary sewer improvements less accumulated
depreciation and less outstanding indebtedness (hereinafter referred to as CRV). For developments
under construction, the value of the public improvements shall be prorated based upon the
LINCOLNSHIRE VILLAGE CODE
TITLE 5: BUILDING REGULATIONS
CHAPTER 3: BUILDING FEES AND CHARGES
Page 3 of 11
Revised 11/11/2019
percentage of developed land.
The current replacement value of all improvements to the system shall be determined by the Village
Engineer by estimating the current construction costs and shall include all ancillary costs such as
engineering, land financing, legal, and all other costs of any kind. Such current construction costs
shall be estimated in accordance with the generally accepted standards in the engineering profession
for estimating costs of proposed projects (Ord. 89-1116-83).
C. Water Connection Charge: The connection charge for connecting to the water system of the Village
within its corporate limits shall be in accordance with the fees as established in the Comprehensive
Fee Schedule set forth in Chapter 15 of Title 1 of this Code (Ord. 90-1134-18; Amd. Ord. 92-1245-23;
Amd. Ord. 93-1283-13, eff. 5/10/93).
The minimum fee shall be the cost for one equivalent dwelling unit (Ord. 90-1161-45).
D. Sewer Connection Charge: The connection charge for connecting to the sewer system of the Village
within its corporate limits shall be in accordance with the fees as established in the Comprehensive
Fee Schedule set forth in Chapter 15 of Title 1 of this Code (Ord. 90-1134-18; Amd. Ord. 92-1245-23;
Amd. Ord. 93-1283-13, eff 5/10/93).
The minimum fee shall be the cost for one equivalent dwelling unit (Ord. 90-1161-45).
E. Equivalent Dwelling Units:
1. Basis for Mean Annual Expected Usage Coefficients: The number of equivalent dwelling
units used to determine water and sewer connection charges for nonresidential buildings
shall be based upon "A System of Computerized Models for Calculating and Evaluating
Municipal Water Requirements and Forecasting Municipal Water Requirements" prepared
by Hittman Associates, Inc. for the Office of Water Resources Research, United States
Department of the Interior. The Commercial and Industrial Categories and Usage
Coefficient Values for the Library of Water Usage Parameters, tables AIII.2 through AIII.6,
delineate the expected usage coefficients for the mean annual water usage expected in
commercial and industrial categories. These values shall be used in the formula to determine
EDUs. Due to the length of the documents referred to above, three (3) copies of said
documents shall remain on file for public inspection in the Lincolnshire Village Hall. These
documents are hereby adopted by reference.
2. Average Daily Water Usage for Residential Users: Annually, prior to the start of each fiscal
year, the average daily water usage for residential users for the previous five (5) calendar
years shall be determined by the Village Engineer. This shall be accomplished by dividing the
total volume of residential water metered for each of the previous five (5) calendar years by
the total number of residential customers at each of the five (5) calendar years' end. The five
(5) year average shall then be determined by adding the results of the five (5) individual
calendar year's averages and dividing by five (5).
3. Equivalent Dwelling Unit Formula: The equivalent dwelling units for each non-residential
building shall be determined by using the following formula:
Category parameter multiplied by the planned annual expected usage divided by the average
daily water use for residential users equals the equivalent dwelling units.
LINCOLNSHIRE VILLAGE CODE
TITLE 5: BUILDING REGULATIONS
CHAPTER 3: BUILDING FEES AND CHARGES
Page 4 of 11
Revised 11/11/2019
For the purpose of determining fees, calculated EDUs shall be rounded to the nearest whole
EDU.
For example, for a new one hundred thousand (100,000) square foot office building, the
formula would be as follows assuming three hundred (300) gallons per day is the average
daily water usage for a single-family dwelling unit:
100,000 square feet X 0.093 / 300 = 31 EDUs (Ord. 89-1116-83)
4. In the case where a proposed use is not shown in The Commercial and Industrial Categories
and Usage Coefficient Values for the Library of Water Usage Parameters, tables AIII.2
through AIII.6, the Village Manager may, at his or her sole discretion, authorize the use of
other empirical data to determine the usage parameter. Such data may consist of engineering
studies completed by a licensed Illinois Professional Engineer, data from similar facilities, or
other data as determined to be acceptable. The Village may also rely on the data for
substantially similar uses which share a common North American Industry Classification
System code.
The Village reserves the right to adjust the parameters within two and one-half (2.5) full
years of occupancy of any nonresidential building so that the computed equivalent dwelling
units equals the actual equivalent dwelling units as determined from actual water usage. The
connection charges may then be adjusted based upon the revised computed equivalent
dwelling units and the connection charge as set forth in the Lincolnshire Village Code at the
time the original connection charges were computed (Ord. 00-1730-38, eff. 8/14/00).
F. Time of Payment: Water and sewer connection charges shall be due and payable at time of building
permit issuance for any building. If the category or parameter of any nonresidential building shall
change, at any time, the number of equivalent dwelling units shall be recalculated. If said new
category increases the number of EDUs, the difference between the original connection charges paid
and the new charges owed will be charged to the new user (Ord. 92-1245-23). The Village bears no
obligation to reimburse a new user if the new category decreases the number of EDUs from the
previous or original use.
G. The following information has been taken from the Commercial and Industrial Categories and
Usage Coefficient Values for the Library of Water Usage Parameters and shall be used in calculating
connection fees:

of the charge or fee paid for a connection of like nature within the corporate limits; provided,
however, public schools. public libraries, forest preserve districts and other public, governmental
agencies serving the Village shall be required to pay only that amount which would be charged to a
public school or similar public body for a similar connection within the corporate limits of the
Village.
Anyone desiring to connect either to the Village's water or to the sanitary sewer system outside the
corporate limits shall file an application on a form provided by the Village. If the owner of record of
said territory is a land trust, the applicant will comply with the Land Trust Disclosure Ordinance of
the Village by filing concurrently with the application an appropriate land trust disclosure statement.
No such application shall be accepted for filing unless accompanied by a filing fee as established in
the Comprehensive Fee Schedule set forth in Chapter 15 of Title 1 of this Code. The Village will then
review the application and all matters contained therein to determine the sufficiency and accuracy
thereof, and if in proper form and containing all required information the Village will then cause to
be prepared a contract providing for said sewer and water connection and the supplying of water and
sewer service to said real estate. Said contract must then be approved by the Board of Trustees, by
ordinance or resolution authorizing the execution of said contract. Such approval shall be at the
discretion of the Board of Trustees based upon the best interests of the Village at the time of said
application. (Ord. 89-1116-83)

parcel. Such sums shall be in addition to, and not as a credit against, all other connection or hook-on
fees as may be imposed by other rule, regulation, resolution or ordinance of this Village, or shown by
its fee schedule, the connection fee hereby imposed being directly related to the costs to the Village of
constructing, expanding, and extending the existing systems to accommodate the parcels as set forth
in Exhibit "A". (amd. Ord. 94-1369-53 12/12/94)

The allocation of connection fees as set forth in Exhibit "B" is based upon actually incurred as well as
estimated future costs to the Village of constructing, expanding, and extending the water and sewer
systems as determined as of the date of this ordinance. In the event costs as actually incurred by the
Village vary from those estimated, the Village reserves the right, for any parcel for which payment in
full of connection fees has not been received, to modify, alter or amend the allocation of connection
fees to such parcel to reflect the actual costs to the Village of constructing, expanding, and extending
the waterworks and sewerage systems. The Village further reserves the right to increase such
connection fees to reflect any financing and interest costs or other changes which the Village
reasonably determines are to be allocated to the construction, expansion, and extension of said water
and sewer systems.(amd. Ord. 94-1369-53 12/12/94)
The allocation of connection fees (Exhibit "B") is further based upon the presently existing or
anticipated future zoning of such parcels and the anticipated water and sewer requirements related
thereto. In the event any such parcel is zoned differently than anticipated at the time of request for
connection to the Village water or sanitary sewer system, the Village reserves the right to alter or
amend the connection fees for such parcel in order to reflect such change in zoning and water or
sewer requirements. (amd. Ord. 94-1369-53 12/12/94)
This ordinance shall further serve as notice to affected property owners of the additional connection
fees associated with connection of their parcels to the Village water and sewer systems. Affected
property owners must contact the Village in order to determine the adjustment, if any, to the
connection fee figures as set for the herein which will be applicable to any specific parcel, and arising
out of changes in costs, allocation of interest or other charges, changes in zoning, or other similar
costs related to the construction, expansion and extension of the systems.(amd. Ord. 94-1369-53

Revised 07/30/2018
including this section, nor does it preclude any of the actions the Village is

building. A new registration is required for any change in
ownership whatsoever. There shall be no charge for an amended
registration.
c. Once a building is registered as a vacant building, there shall be a

building is involved in illegal or improper use or occupancy under such
conditions that boarding and securing the building are insufficient to
prevent the actual or threatened harm.
E. Other Enforcement: The registration of a vacant building shall not preclude
action by the Village to demolish or to take other action against the building
pursuant to other provisions of this Code or other applicable legislation,
including the activities authorized by Subsection F.

subsection 5-4F-2.F. The Village shall send a bill for the cost to the
property owner, his agent, legal representative, or occupant in legal
possession or control of the premises.
3. Traditional Lien Procedure. If a bill sent pursuant to paragraph 2 is not

authority to file and record a lien against the property, pursuant to
Section 11-20-15 of the Illinois Municipal Code, 65 ILCS 5/11-20-15. If,
for any one property, the Village engaged in any nuisance abatement
activity described in paragraph 1 on more than one occasion during the
course of one year, then the Village may combine any or all of the costs
of those activities into a single notice of lien, provided no costs may be
set forth on more than one notice of lien. The lien must be filed in
accordance with the lien procedure established by the specific Code
provision of which the property is alleged to be in violation or, if no such
procedure exists, then the following procedure shall apply:
a. Notice of Lien. The Village or the person performing the service by
authority of the Village, in its, his or her own name, may file a notice
of lien in the office of the Lake County Recorder of Deeds. The

expense is incurred. If, for any one property, the Village engaged in
any nuisance abatement activity described in Paragraph 2 on more
than one occasion during the course of one year, then the Village
may combine any or all of the costs of those activities into a single
notice of lien, provided no costs may be set forth on more than one
notice of lien. The notice of lien shall consist of a sworn statement
setting forth:

parcel;
ii. The amount of the cost and expense incurred or payable for
the activities; and
iii. The date or dates when such cost and expense was incurred
by the Village or someone working on behalf of the Village.
After recording, the notice of lien shall be sent by certified mail
to the property owner, his agent or legal representative or
occupant in legal possession or control of the premises and, if
different, to the person who received the tax bill for the
preceding year.

c. Foreclosure of Lien. Subsequent to the filing of the abovedescribed
lien, the Village may cause to be filed a complaint for
foreclosure of such lien, or upon becoming a defendant in a
pending lawsuit affecting the premises or real estate, by answer to
the complaint or in the nature of an intervening petition or crosscomplaint
the Village may proceed in its corporate name to
foreclose such lien. An action to foreclose a lien under this Section
must be commenced within two years after the date of filing notice

expense is incurred. If, for any one property, the Village engaged in
any nuisance abatement activity described in paragraph 2 on more

The Village may not file a lien if the lender has provided notice
to the Village that the lender has performed, or will perform,
remedial actions; provided, however, that the remedial actions
must be performed or initiated in good faith within 30 days of
the lenders notice to the Village.

the Village and payment in full of all fees imposed pursuant to this section 5-
4F-2 are required prior to any occupancy of a vacant building and the

1 See Titles 5, 6 and 7 of this Village Code
Village of Lincolnshire Page 2 Title 5-7
Revised 07/08/2013
Chapter, an applicant shall comply with the requirements set forth in other applicable
ordinances with respect to the submission and approval of preliminary and final
subdivision pats, improvement plans, building and zoning permits, inspections, appeals
and similar matters, along with those set forth in this Chapter and as may be required by
Federal or State laws and the regulations of any department of the State of Illinois.
Where provisions of this Chapter are more restrictive than other requirements, this
Chapter shall apply.
5-7-4: DEFINITIONS: For the purposes of this Chapter, the following definitions are
adopted:
AREA OF SPECIAL The land which is subject to a one percent (1%)
FLOOD HAZARD chance of flooding annually. This area may also be
identified as that which is subject to the 100-year
flood. The area is designated as Zone A, A1-99, AH,
or AO on the maps provided by the Federal Insurance
Administration.
BASE FLOOD The flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being
equaled or exceeded in any given year. The base
flood is also known as the 100-year flood. If the 100-
year flood information is not available, the base flood
shall be the flood of record.
BASE FLOOD AREA The land area subject to inundation by waters of the
base flood.
BASE FLOOD ELEVATION The highest water surface elevation of the base flood.
COMPENSATORY STORAGE An artificially excavated volume of storage within the
base flood area used to balance the loss of natural
flood storage capacity when artificial fill or structures
are placed within the floodplain. The uncompensated
loss of natural floodplain storage can increase off-site
floodwater elevations and flows.
DEVELOPMENT Any manmade change to improved or unimproved
real estate, including but not limited to construction of
or substantial improvements to buildings or other
structures, the placement of mobile homes, mining,
dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling
operations.
FLOOD The condition existing when the waters of any
Village of Lincolnshire Page 3 Title 5-7
Revised 07/08/2013
watercourse, pond, or depression temporarily rise to a
height above their normal levels and overflow the
boundaries within which they are ordinarily contained.
It also includes the unusual rapid accumulation or
runoff of surface waters.
FLOOD FREQUENCY A period of years, based on a statistical analysis,
during which a flood of a stated magnitude may be
expected to be equaled or exceeded.
FLOOD FRINGE The higher portion of the floodplain, immediately
adjacent to and on either side of the floodway,
occupied by quiescent or slow-moving waters during
floods.
FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY An official map of the Village, issued or approved by
the MAP (FHBM) Administrator of the Federal
Insurance Administration, on which the areas having
special flood hazards have been drawn and
designated as Zone A.
FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY An examination and evaluation of hydro- (FIS) logic
and hydraulic data sponsored by the Federal
Insurance Administration to determine base flood
flows, elevations, areas and floodways. The FIS also
determines flows, elevations and areas of floods
having lesser and greater frequencies of occurrence.
FLOOD OF RECORD An actual historical flood event for which sufficient
records are available to establish its extent. No
uniform probability of occurrence is associated with
floods of record. However, the probability of
occurrence may be determined for the event at
specific locations.
FLOOD PROFILE Graphical representations of the elevations of the
water surface of the 100-year flood along the
watercourses of the Village.
FLOOD PROTECTION The elevation to which uses regulated by this Chapter
ELEVATION are required to be elevated or floodproofed.
FLOOD RETURN PERIOD Same as Flood Frequency.
FLOODPLAlN The special flood hazard lands adjoining
Village of Lincolnshire Page 4 Title 5-7
Revised 07/08/2013
a water course, whose surface elevation is lower than
the base flood elevation, that are subject to periodic
inundation during floods.
FLOODPROOFING Modifications to structures made to reduce flood
damages. These changes may be made to existing
structures or incorporated in the design of new
structures. In all instances, flood-proofing must be
watertight and must be adequate without the need for
human intervention.
FLOODWAY The channel of a watercourse and those portions of
the adjoining floodplains which are required to carry
and discharge the 100-year flood with no significant
increase in the base flood elevation.
FLOODWAY The lateral boundaries of the floodway which
ENCROACHMENT LINES separate it from the flood fringes.
FREEB0ARD An increment of elevation added to the base flood
elevation to provide a factor of safety for uncertainties
in calculations, unknown localized conditions, wave
actions and unpredictable effects such as may be
caused by ice or debris jams.
HYDROSTATlC PRESSURE The upward pressure exerted on floodslabs or an
entire structure by standing water or groundwater,
which tends to float a structure or crack the floor. It is
based on the difference in elevation between the
surface level of the water. Hydrostatic pressure may
also be horizontal, imposing forces on walls causing
them to crack or fail.
MOBILE HOME A structure transportable in one or more sections,
which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to
be used with or without a permanent foundation when
connected to the required utilities. It does not include
recreational vehicles or travel trailers.
MOBILE HOME PARK A parcel or contiguous parcels of land which has been
so designated and improved that it contains two (2) or
more mobile home lots available to the general public
for sale or rent and the placement thereon of mobile
Village of Lincolnshire Page 5 Title 5-7
Revised 07/08/2013
homes for occupancy.
ONE HUNDRED YEAR FLOOD A flood magnitude with a one percent (1%) statistical
of being equaled or exceeded during any year. A flood
this large would be reached once during a 100-year
period, on the average. However, the occurrence of
such an event does not diminish the chance of its
recurring again at any time.
RISK PREMIUM RATE ZONE Flood hazard areas designated according to the
degree of flooding they would experience during the
base flood. The symbols used to designate these
zones are as follows:
A Area of special flood hazard without water
surface elevations determined.
Al-99 Area of special flood hazard with water surface
elevations deter-mined.
AH Area of special flood hazards having a level
water surface (ponding) with water depths
between 1 and 3 feet.
AO Area of special flood hazards having a sloping
water surface (sheet runoff) with water depths
between 1 and 3 feet.
VO Area of special flood hazards having shallow
water depths and/or unpredictable flow paths
between 1 and 3 feet and with velocity.
B Area of moderate flood hazards.
C Area of minimal hazards.
RIVERINE Relating to, formed by, or resembling a river
(including tributaries), stream, creek or brook.
STRUCTURE A walled and roofed building, including a gas or liquid
storage tank,that is principally above ground, as well
as a mobile home.
Village of Lincolnshire Page 6 Title 5-7
Revised 07/08/2013
SUBSTANTIAL Any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a
IMPROVEMENT structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty
percent (50%) of the market value of the structure
either before the improvement or repair is started, or if
the structure has been damaged, and is being
restored, before the damage occurred. The term does
not, however, include either:
A. Any project for improvement of a structure to
comply with existing State or local health,
sanitary, or safety code specifications which
are solely necessary to assure safe living
conditions, or
B. Any alteration of a structure or site
documented as deserving preservation by the
Illinois Department of Conservation or listed on
the National Register of Historic Places.
WATERCOURSE Any river, stream, creek, brook, branch or other
drainageway in or into which stormwater runoff and
floodwaters flow either regularly or intermittently.
5-7-5: GENERAL CONDITIONS: General conditions which shall apply in Articles A, B,
and C of this Chapter include:
A. Floodways: In floodways which have been identified in Section 5-7-6 of this
Chapter as elements of floodplains associated with the flood having a 100-year
recurrence interval, fill, encroachments, and new construction and substantial
improvements of existing structures, which would result in any one-tenth foot
(0.1') increase in flood heights, shall be prohibited. The location of any portion
of a new mobile home park, of any expansion to an existing mobile home park,
and of any mobile home not in a mobile home park shall be prohibited in the
floodway (nothing herein shall be construed to permit mobile homes or mobile
home parks within the Village of Lincolnshire).
B. Flood Fringes: In flood fringes which have been identified in Section 5-7-6 of
this Chapter as elements of the floodplains associated with floods having a 100-
year recurrence interval, construction, filling or use of those low-lying lands may
be permitted under the conditions specified in Articles A, B and C of this
Chapter.
C. Compensatory Storage: Whenever any portion of a floodplain is authorized for
use, the volume of space which will be occupied by the authorized fill or
Village of Lincolnshire Page 7 Title 5-7
Revised 07/08/2013
structure below the base flood elevation shall be compensated for and balanced
by at least an equal volume of excavation taken from below the base flood
elevation. All floodplain storage lost below the existing 10-year flood elevation
shall be replaced below the 10-year flood elevation. All floodplain storage lost
above the existing 10-year flood elevation but below the base flood elevation
must be replaced above the existing 10-year flood elevation and below the base
flood elevation. In the case of streams or watercourses, such excavation shall
be made opposite or immediately adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied.
All such excavations should be constructed to drain freely and openly to the
watercourse.
D. Watercourse Alteration: The Village shall notify the Illinois Division of Water
Resources and the Federal Insurance Administration prior to any alteration or
relocation of a watercourse within the Municipality's jurisdiction by any person
or agencies. The Village shall assure that the flood carrying capacity within the
altered or relocated portion of any watercourse be maintained.
E. Freeboard: All structures located in base flood areas shall be required to be so
sited on fill or be otherwise designed and constructed so as to include a
freeboard of at least two feet (2') between the lowest floor and the base flood
elevation, except as provided for in Section 5-7D-3 of this Chapter.(Ord. 03-
1834-11, eff. 4/14/03)
F. Base Flood: Wherever the areas expected to be inundated by the base flood
have been specifically identified, it is the intention of this Chapter to provide
protection in those areas against the high waters of that flood.
G. Historical Flood of Record: In the absence of specific information pertaining to
the base flood, it is the intention of this Chapter to provide protection in the lowlying
areas of this community against the high waters of the historical flood of
record.
H. Land Use Controls: This Chapter is not intended to reduce or eliminate existing
flooding, nor is it intended to impose a complete prohibition of construction in
base flood areas. On the contrary, these regulations are designed to guide and
control development in such a manner as to lessen the damaging effects of
floods on developments proposed for the low-lying areas of this community.

information depicted by the official Village floodplain maps and the official
Village of Lincolnshire Page 9 Title 5-7
Revised 07/08/2013
Village profiles, and in the absence of any overriding information to the contrary,
the data prescribed by the profiles will govern.
J. Source Documents: Information pertaining to the base flood incorporated in this
Chapter, including maps and profiles, has been extracted from and is based on
the studies and reports prepared by the Federal Emergency Management
Agency.
K. Official Elevations: The system of official bench marks and elevations already
established in the area by the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey (first order level
network) or the U.S. Geological Survey shall hereafter be taken by engineers,
surveyors, architects, and contractors when making topographical surveys and
maps, and when setting grades and elevations of buildings, pavements,
drainage facilities, and other structures or works publicly constructed or
regulated by the Village.
L. Determination of Base Flood Area, Location and Elevations: The official maps
described in this Section shall be used as an aid in determining whether a
specific parcel of land lies within the base flood area. The final decision,
however, shall be based on the relation of the surveyed ground elevation and
the base flood elevation. For the purposes of this Chapter, the base flood
elevation applicable to a specific parcel of land, if not otherwise depicted by the
official maps and profiles described above, shall be that elevation established
for the adjoining stream or channel measured at right angles to the general
direction of flow in that stream or channel. In riverine situations where a bend in
the stream exists and more than one line can be placed at right angles to the
parcel of land, the highest base flood elevation determined shall prevail.
5-7-7: VARIANCES: The Village Board may grant variances from the regulatory
standards of this Chapter in accordance with the following requirements:
A. All Variance Requests: No variance shall be granted unless the applicant for
the variance can demonstrate that:
1. An exceptional economic hardship would result without the variance.
2. The relief granted is the minimum necessary.
3. There will be no additional threat to public safety or creation of nuisance.
4. No additional public expense will result.
Village of Lincolnshire
Title 5-7
Page 10
Revised 07/08/13
B. Variances to Lower Protection Levels: In addition to the requirements of
subsection A above, a variance from the requirements of Section 5-7D -3 of
this Chapter that would result in a structure not being protected to the elevation
of the base flood shall also meet the following requirements:
1. The structure is to be located on a lot of one-half (1/2) acre or less in size
contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed
below the base flood level.
2. The Village Board notifies the applicant in writing that the variance will
result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as
high as twenty five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of
insurance coverage.
3. The Village Board notifies the applicant in writing that such construction
below the base flood level will increase the risks to life and property and
that the applicant proceeds with knowledge of these risks.
4. The Village Board notifies the applicant that if the variance is issued, it is
contingent upon the applicant obtaining approval from other agencies,
having jurisdiction, when the variance violates the requirements of such
agencies.
C. Variances to Increase Flood Heights: In addition to the requirements of
subsection A above, a variance from the requirements of Section 5-7A-1 or 5-
7A-2 of this Chapter that would significantly impede or increase the flow and
passage of floodwaters shall also meet the following requirements, except that
no variance will be granted that would result in an increased flood height
greater than one-tenth foot (0.1') within the designated regulatory floodway:
1. The resulting increase in the base flood elevation will not affect any
existing structures or utilities.
2. The owners of the properties affected by the increased base flood elevation
are compensated for the resulting effect on property values and give their
written agreement to granting the variance.
3. The resulting increased flood elevations will not affect any flood protection
structures.
D. Variances to Compensatory Storage Requirements: In addition to the
requirements of subsection A above, no variance from the compensatory
Village of Lincolnshire Page 11 Title 5-7
Revised 07/08/2013
floodplain storage provisions of this Chapter shall be granted which would
reduce the required volume of compensatory excavation to less than the
volume of space occupied by that portion of the authorized fill or structure
below the base flood elevation.
E. Historical Structures: Variances requested in connection with the
reconstruction, rehabilitation, or restoration of structures listed on the National
Register of Historical Places or documented as worthy of preservation by the
Illinois Department of Conservation may be granted using criteria more
permissive than the requirements of subsections A or B above.
5-7-8: NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES AND USES:
A. Nonconforming Structures: Nonconforming structures may remain in use
subject to the following regulations:
1. Alterations: A nonconforming structure shall not be enlarged, replaced or
structurally altered. A nonconforming structure accidentally damaged may
be restored unless the damage exceeds fifty percent (50%) of its
replacement value in which case it must thereafter conform to this Chapter.
The Building Commissioner shall determine the amount of damage.
2. Building Permit Issued Prior to Adoption or Amendment of the Zoning
Code: Proposed structures for which building permits have been issued
prior to their designation as nonconforming by adoption or amendment of
the Zoning Code1 may be completed and used as originally intended
subject to the nonconforming provisions of this Chapter.
B. Nonconforming Uses: Nonconforming uses may be continued subject to the
following regulations:
1. Extensions: A nonconforming use shall not be expanded or moved to
occupy any portion of the premises, either land or structure, which was not
originally occupied by the nonconforming use.
2. Discontinuance: Whenever a nonconforming use of any premises has been
discontinued for a period of twelve (12) months, it may not be reestablished.
3. Changes: A nonconforming use shall not be changed to another or different
nonconforming use.

5-7B -2: SUBDIVISION DESIGN: The following rules shall govern the design of land
improvements with respect to the floodplain fringe:
A. General: All proposed subdivision and other developments within the base flood
area shall be reviewed to assure that the proposed developments are consistent
with the need to minimize flood damage, that all public utilities and facilities (such as
sewer, gas, electrical and water systems) are located and constructed to minimize
or eliminate flood damage and that adequate drainage is provided.
B. Design: Streets, blocks, depths of lots, parks and other public grounds shall be
located and laid out in such a manner whenever possible as to preserve and utilize
natural streams, channels, and detention basins. Wherever possible, the larger
streams and floodplains shall be included within parks or other public grounds.
C. Channel Straightening: Sharply meandering streams or channels may be partially
straightened and minor changes made in other channels, subject to the approval of
the Village Board, provided: (1) the Hydraulic capacity of the floodway is
maintained, (2) provision is made to stabilize the banks of the modified channel to
control erosion, and (3) any permits for this work that are required by the Illinois
Department of Transportation and the Corps of Engineers are obtained.
D. Lots in Base Flood Area: Land lying wholly or partially in the base flood area may be
laid out and platted as building lots or parcels, provided that a building site not lower
than the base flood elevation (see Section 5-7D-2) plus one foot (1'): (1) exists on
the high part of the lot or parcel, or (2) will be built up during execution of the
subdivision improvement plan through general excavation or filling, or (3) can be
provided with excavation taken from within the area of the lot or parcel.
E. Compensatory Storage: Such filling as may be required or permitted by this Chapter
Village of Lincolnshire Page 18 Title 5-7
Revised 07/08/2013
for a building site, or as may otherwise be done in a floodplain shall be
compensated for and balanced by at least an equal volume of excavation taken
from below the highwater elevation. In the case of streams and channels, such
excavation shall be made opposite or immediately adjacent to the areas so filled or
occupied and shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse.
F. Streets and Roads: When failure or interruption of service of streets or roads would
endanger public health or safety, streets and roads shall be protected to one foot
(1') above the base flood elevation. In other instances, protection shall be provided
to the extent practical.
G. Drainageways: Whenever the plans call for the passage and/or storage of surface
runoff or excess stormwater on lots, the grading of all such lots shall be prescribed
and established as part of the subdivision plat, The areas so designated for the
passage and/or storage of such waters shall not be obstructed. The horizontal limits
of the high water levels resulting from the passage and/or storage of surface runoff
or excess stormwater on lots shall be recorded on the plat of record and shall be
covered by an easement.
H. Manholes: All sanitary sewer manholes constructed in a floodplain must have a rim
elevation of a minimum of one foot (1') above the base flood elevation or be
provided with a locking, watertight manhole cover. (Ord. 80-623-30)

substantial improvements, or other development, including the placement of
mobile homes, within floodplain areas having special flood hazards. Such permits shall
assure that all other necessary permits have been received from those governmental
agencies from which approval is required by Federal or State law. The building permit
applications will be reviewed to assure that any proposed construction is:
A. Designed and anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the
structure.
B. Constructed with materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage.
C. Constructed by methods and practices that minimize flood damage. At the time of
issuing a building permit, the following information will be noted and recorded by the
Village:
1. Elevation of the lowest floor (including basement).
2. Where the elevation of the lowest floor is below grade on one or more sides,
the elevation of the floor immediately above.
3. Where a structure has been floodproofed, the elevation to which the structure
was floodproofed.
5-7D-2: BUILDING SITE: Each main building or structure that is built on fill shall have
or shall be provided with a site, area, or yard that is not lower than the established base
flood elevation plus one foot (1') and which shall extend beyond the outside walls for a
distance of at least five feet (5'). The finished grade or surface of this area beyond the
aforesaid five foot (5') distance shall be graded or surfaced so as to drain away from the
walls over a distance of not less than five (5) additional feet.
Village of Lincolnshire Page 21 Title 5-7
Revised 07/08/2013
5-7D-3: DESIGN CRITERIA: The following general design criteria shall apply to all
new construction and substantial improvements which may be authorized in floodplains:
A. Residential Structures: The lowest floor, including the basement, of residential
structures must be at an elevation not less than that of the Flood Protection
Elevation, unless they are adequately floodproofed and the Village has been
granted an exception from the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) for placing
the lowest floor of the structures at a lower elevation. Within any A, AE, or AO
Zone, all new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures
shall have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the crown of the
nearest street to or above the depth number specified on the Village's FIRM.
B. Nonresidential Structures: The lowest floor, including the basement, of
nonresidential structures must be elevated or floodproofed to an elevation not less
than that of the Flood Protection Elevation. Within any AO Zone, all new
construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures shall: (1)
have the lowest floor (including basement) elevated above the crown of the
nearest street to or above the depth number specified on the FIRM, or (2)
together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities shall be completely
floodproofed to or above that level to Federal Insurance Administration (FIA)
standards.
C. Walls: The walls, foundations, and other features which may be authorized for
construction or installation at an elevation below that of the Flood Protection
Elevation must be designed to resist appropriate hydrostatic pressures.
D. Anchoring: All authorized structures, including underground and aboveground
tanks, shall be firmly anchored to prevent flotation. Anchoring materials should be
rust resistant.
E. Service Facilities: To the maximum extent feasible, all service facilities, such as
electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing, and air conditioning equipment, shall be
located at or above the Flood Protection Elevation. Water supply and wastewater
collection and treatment systems shall be designed and constructed so as to
prevent the entrance of floodwaters.
F. Floodproofing: Where the lowest floor elevation (including basement) is below the
Flood Protection Elevation, the structure, with the attendant utility and sanitary
facilities, shall be floodproofed to the Flood Protection Elevation. Where
floodproofing is required, a registered professional engineer or structural engineer
shall certify that the floodproofing methods employed are adequate to withstand
the flood depths, pressures, velocities, impact and uplift forces and other factors
associated with the base flood and a record of such certificates indicating the
specific elevation to which such structures are floodproofed shall be maintained
by the Village. (Ord. 03-1834-11, eff. 4/14/03)

6-3-13: CONSTRUCTION AND INSTALLATION OF EXTERIOR SATELLITE EARTH
STATION ANTENNAS
A. Village Policy: It is the stated policy of the Village that installation of satellite earth station
antennas (SESA) and equipment can, unless controlled, adversely affect health, safety and
aesthetic values and objectives of the Village and its residents in all zoning districts. The Village
considers the rural ambience and residential character to be an extremely important aspect of
the community's quality of life. Great care is taken to protect these aesthetic values through
preservation of natural resources and protection of the visual environment. One of the very
important means by which this goal can be achieved is by recognizing that satellite earth station
antennas of all sizes, shapes, varieties and uses constitute physical additions and potential
hazards to the Village of such character that their construction, placement, installation and use
requires close examination and constant review by the Village. Satellite earth station antennas
are structures quite different in appearance from typical structures anticipated by the Codes of
the Village and the installation of satellite earth station antennas may not be compatible with
existing structures and land uses in the Village. The appearance of this SESA from neighboring
properties and the removal of desirable vegetation to allow placement of the SESA are major
negative consequences of such systems. In addition, it is extremely important that all safety
aspects be addressed to protect persons and property including wind loads, attractive nuisances
to children, site lines on roadways and other factors.
In every case the entire installation must be compatible with the character of the surrounding
area of the Village and shall not have an adverse impact on the health, safety or aesthetic values
and planning objectives of the area.
In view of the foregoing, in order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the Village and to
provide for reasonable regulation, all exterior satellite earth station antennas, including all
forms of receivers of satellite transmissions, shall be considered structures subject to the terms
of the Village Code and shall be subject to all ordinances relating to structures.

6-5B-7: ENVIRONMENTAL AND COMPREHENSIVE POLICIES PLAN
CRITERIA: The following criteria shall be used in evaluating the zoning site
plan, preliminary plat and lot development plan for each tract within the
R2A Zone. The purpose of these criteria is to promote the preservation of
trees and natural vegetation, to preserve unique natural features, to
prevent flooding and drainage problems, to maintain vistas, to provide for
open space, park and recreation areas and to promote the implementation
of the Official Comprehensive Policies Plan of the Village. The Zoning
Board and Village development staff shall utilize this criteria in its review of
the zoning site plan, preliminary plats and lot development plans. Final site
Village of Lincolnshire Page 17 Title 6-5
Revised 11/09/2015
density shall depend upon the extent to which each development proposal
satisfies the environmental criteria and promotes policy objectives of the
Comprehensive Policies Plan. In utilizing these criteria the Zoning Board
shall give consideration to the unique environmental and locational
characteristics of the tract of land.
A. Environmental Criteria:
1. Maximum tree preservation in forested areas including design treatment
to minimize tree damage and removal, the location of open space to
protect tree and tree rehabilitation commitments where unavoidable
damage is likely to occur.
2. The amount and location of open space, dedicated or otherwise
reserved, and the extent to which it is used to protect unique natural
features and vistas. At a minimum, five percent (5%) of the site shall be
dedicated open space at one-half (2) unit per acre; ten percent (10%)
at one unit per acre and fifteen percent (15%) for densities above one
unit per acre. However the Zoning Board can recommend and the
Village Board can approve a cash donation in lieu of the required open
space or a portion thereof. Park land should abut existing parks or open
space wherever possible.
3. Forested areas and areas containing unique natural features or
constituting important natural habitats should be protected by deed
restrictions wherever possible keeping such lands in a natural
undisturbed state.
4. Areas of poor visual impact due to exposure to major roads or
disharmonious land uses should be screened by the use of berming
and landscaped with natural vegetative materials.
5. A variety of site design techniques including variable yards, moderate
clustering and variable lot size should be used to create large
undeveloped areas within the development.
6. Ponds, streams and wetlands should be preserved in their natural
condition and included as part of dedicated open space wherever
feasible and advisable.
7. Steep slopes should be protected from development.
Village of Lincolnshire Page 18 Title 6-5
Revised 11/09/2015
8. In forested areas, drainage improvements should be designed so as to
minimize any change in the existing groundwater level.
9. In forested areas, engineering improvements should be concentrated
into as narrow a corridor as is consistent with current engineering
standards so that clearing of wooded rights of way can be minimized.
B. Comprehensive Policies Plan Objectives:
1. For subdivisions of forty (40) acres or more in total area, the density
should decrease as the distance from major State or County collector or
arterial highways increases.
2. All aspects of the development proposal, including site design, street
layout and design, engineering, land use, housing character, landscape
treatment, conservation measures and the treatment of community
facilities such as parks and schools, should be consistent with and
advance the objectives contained within the Official Comprehensive
Policies Plan of the Village. Particular emphasis should be placed on
advancing the plan's open space strategy and upon the following:
The preservation in a natural state of forested land.
The provision of bikeway and pedestrian ways linked to the Village's
system.
Property lines of lots to be subdivided should be substantially set back
from all major roads. While minimum setbacks are required, additional
setbacks should be included wherever possible.
The preservation of semirural vistas of open meadows and woodlots
should be given design consideration.
The provision for park improvements in addition to dedicated or
otherwise reserved open space.
Open space in the form of nature preserves as well as parks should be
included as integral parts of residential neighborhoods.
Conformance with the transportation and road plan elements.
Maintaining the visual character of Village and County roads.
Village of Lincolnshire Page 19 Title 6-5
Revised 11/09/2015
The coordination of development with School Districts 103 and 125,
expansion and program objectives.

6-5C-1: INTENT AND SCOPE OF REGULATIONS: The R4 District is intended to
provide low to moderate density multi-family residential options in areas
adjacent to commercial districts, other moderate density residential
districts, public or non-residential land uses. This district is meant to be
occupied primarily by attached single-family swellings in structures of a
size that are compatible with the single-family character of Lincolnshire.
Density of projects for attached single-family dwellings are meant to be low
for developments of this type. Density for multiple-family dwellings are
meant to be moderate and should be based on the degree to which the
development fulfills the objectives of the Official Comprehensive Plan.

Areas containing unique natural features, transition areas adjacent to
residential districts and areas at or near major intersections are identified
as being of significant impact to the Village. This is due to the need to
protect valued natural resources, the integrity and environment of the
Village's residential neighborhoods, traffic safety conditions and the land
use character of key intersections. Therefore, all development proposed
within this District shall be subject to site plan review and approved as
specified in Section 6-14-7 of this Code.

1. Purpose and Description of a Continuing Care Retirement Campus:
Village of Lincolnshire Page 3 Title 6-5
Revised 11/09/2015
The continuing care retirement campus provisions of this section are
intended to provide for age-restricted planned unit developments to
serve the needs of elderly residents and to keep them as independent
as the status of their respective health will permit from time to time.
These developments shall be intended to provide, through common
management or by contractual agreement, housing needs and services
that aid the elderly in maintaining an independent lifestyle.
Services provided by the continuing care retirement campus may
include, but are not limited to, health care maintenance, nursing service
facilities, congregate dining facilities and food services, housekeeping,
social and recreational programs, administrative offices, chapels, park
facilities, security stations, transportation services, community buildings,
and any other services, activities and accessory uses integral to the
operation and maintenance of a residential community intended
primarily for the use of the elderly residents and the employees of the
continuing care retirement campus.
2. Definitions.
For the purpose of this type of Planned Unit Development:
a. Independent Living Units are dwelling units within the Continuing
Care Retirement Campus which are unrestricted except that at least
one person occupying each dwelling unit shall be 62 years of age or
older and may contain in addition to an individual living area,
comprised of one or more rooms, a kitchen and bath area, while
receiving equal benefits, such as meals and recreation, with others
within the community.
b. Assisted Living Units are self-contained units within an assisted
living facility licensed by the Illinois Department of Public Health to
assure compliance with the Assisted Living and Shared Housing
Establishment Code (77Ill. Adm. Code 295). The Assisted Living
Unit is intended to provide twenty-four hour a day support for
personal and health services for residents in need of this care.
Assisted Living Units shall include accessory uses such as dining
rooms, bathing areas, common areas, staff offices and any other
incidental space necessary to provide the above care.
c. Skilled Care Nursing Units are beds located within a nursing facility
that is licensed by the Illinois Department of Public Health for
residents who require twenty-four or more consecutive hours of care
because of physical or mental conditions.

d. Continuing Care Retirement Campus Accessory Uses or
Structures are accessory facilities, functions, and structures which
are to be used primarily by the residents of the retirement campus
and their respective visitors and the staff servicing the retirement
campus, except as may otherwise be authorized.
3. Purpose: The Continuing Care Retirement Campus development
provisions of this Section are intended to provide the following:

recreational areas and facilities;
c. A land use plan which permits preservation of green space, natural
vegetation, topographic and geological features and historic
resources;
d. A creative approach to the use of land and related physical facilities
which results in better urban design, higher quality construction and
the provision of aesthetic amenities;
e. The efficient use of land, so as to promote economies in the
provision of utilities, streets, schools, public grounds and buildings,
and other facilities;
f. Innovations in development so that the growing needs and demands
of the population may be met by a greater variety in type, design,
and layout of buildings, and by conservation and more efficient use
of open space ancillary to said buildings, all in a manner so as to be
consistent with the character of the zoning district in which the
planned unit development is located;
g. A land use which promotes the public health, safety, comfort, morals
and welfare in general, and the health, safety, comfort, morals and
welfare of the elderly in particular.
4. Procedure: A Continuing Care Retirement Campus may be granted as
a Special Use only in those districts in which it is provided for, and
application for said special use shall be made and considered according
to the procedures and standards set forth in Chapter 14 of this Title;

standing with, the Illinois Department of Public Health.
5. The development for which an application is made for a Continuing
Care Retirement Campus special use shall either:
a. be intended to have 90% of its units occupied by at least one person
62 years of age or older and provide significant facilities designed to
meet the physical or social needs of such older residents; or

Village Green and Milwaukee Avenue, to allow flexibility in land use and design of multiple structures
on a single lot; to encourage opportunities for mixed-use development; to facilitate the creation of
convenient, attractive, and harmonious context of buildings and streets, and pedestrian ways; and to
encourage public and private investment that will promote vitality, activity, and safety in the District.

6-5E-1: PURPOSE: It is declared to be the policy and intent of the Board of Trustees of
the Village to assure that there are adequate available sites for community residences
within the Village. In order to attain this goal, the Board of Trustees has done and has
taken into consideration the following:
A. In accordance with the Plan for Compliance with the Community Residence
Location Planning Act that the Mayor and Board of Trustees approved at the
June 11, 1990 regular Village Board meeting, the Village is demonstrating that
adequate provisions are being made to provide for sites for community
residential homes serving people with disabilities in areas zoned primarily for
single-family residential use and to comply with the Federal Fair Housing Act of
1988.
B. That the established spacing requirements for community residential homes will
foster the integration of such residences into the residential nature of
single-family residential neighborhoods.
C. That the established density standards are necessary to preserve the Village's
ability to protect the public safety and to provide for adequate public facilities.
D. That the Village is fully committed to ensure that persons with disabilities are
able to live in appropriate community residential homes which operate to
promote their safety residing within all residentially zoned areas of the
community.
Village of Lincolnshire Page 47 Title 6-5
Revised 08/25/2014
E. That the Village desires to promote the State and local public policy of
deinstitutionalization of persons with disabilities which benefit both the
individual and the community as a whole, because it enhances the individual
lives of all disabled persons and improves society through the integration of
persons with disabilities into the mainstream of their community.
F. That the Village finds that the dispersal of community residential homes will
directly encourage and facilitate the implementation of the residential setting
intent of the State statute.
G. That it is necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the residents of
the community residential homes by requiring compliance with all applicable
State statutes, regulations and licensing requirements as well as all building,
fire and safety ordinances and regulations of the Village.
H. That community residential homes of seven (7) or more persons with
disabilities pose sufficient different and unique problems relating to the health
and safety of the residents as well as the appearance of "institutionalization"
and the Village shall require that such community residential homes apply for
and receive a special use permit prior to occupancy.
I. That the maximum number of six (6) unrelated persons who are permitted to
reside in a residential zoning district as a right through an administrative
occupancy permit was arrived at by taking the current average household size
in the Village of two and ninety five-hundredths (2.95) persons, rounded to
three (3), multiplied by two (2).
J. That the maximum number of twelve (12) unrelated persons who are permitted
to reside in a residential zoning district upon the issuance of a special use
permit was arrived at by taking the current average household size in the
Village of two and ninety five-hundredths (2.95) persons, rounded to three (3),
multiplied by four (4).
6-5E-2: CRITERIA FOR THE ISSUANCE OF AN ADMINISTRATIVE OCCUPANCY
PERMIT: Any community residential home consisting of four (4) or more residents shall
not be occupied by any resident unless the sponsor shall have first obtained from the
Village Manager or his designee an administrative occupancy permit authorizing the use
of the dwelling unit as a community residential home.
All community residential homes shall be licensed in accordance with the "Standards
and Licensure Requirements for Community-Integrated Living Arrangements" as
established by the Department of Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities or the
Department of Public Health.
Village of Lincolnshire Page 48 Title 6-5
Revised 08/25/2014
All administrative occupancy permits shall be issued upon written application upon forms
furnished by the Village Manager or his designee. The application shall be under oath
and shall state the following:
A. The date of application;
B. The name and address of the applicant, and if a corporation the name and
address of the registered agent, president, secretary and treasurer, and if a
partnership, the name and address of all partners, including limited partners;
C. The proposed location of the community residential home;
D. The number of residents to be housed in the community residential home;
E. The proposed date of occupancy by residents;
F. The number of other persons that will reside within the dwelling unit, classified
according to their respective duties;
G. The number of other persons that will work at the home or provide support
services at the home to its residents, classified according to their respective
duties; and
H. Any other information that the Village Manager may reasonably require.
The application shall be accompanied by reliable evidence that the sponsor is licensed
or similarly authorized by an agency of the State of Illinois of competent jurisdiction to
operate the proposed community residential home in the proposed location. The
absence of such evidence shall constitute sufficient grounds to deny the administrative
occupancy permit.
The application shall also be accompanied by a certificate or affidavit of the sponsor that
the residents to be housed in the community residential home have been evaluated and
screened as required under applicable statutes and administrative regulations and that
the residents are capable of community living if provided with an appropriate level of
supervision, assistance, and support
services. The applicant or sponsor shall be responsible for updating the application
within fourteen (14) days of any change and at a minimum of once a year.
No administrative occupancy permit shall be issued for a community residential home
that does not comply with any ordinance of the Village or applicable regulation of the
State of Illinois or its agencies.
Village of Lincolnshire Page 49 Title 6-5
Revised 08/25/2014
No administrative occupancy permit shall be issued for a community residential home
that does not comply with the provisions of this Article.
An administrative occupancy shall not be required to operate a community residential
home consisting of three (3) or fewer residents.
The Village Manager may revoke an administrative occupancy permit on the following
grounds:
A. The permit was obtained by fraudulent means, material misrepresentation or by
submitting false information;
B. The sponsor is no longer licensed or authorized by an agency of the State of
Illinois of competent jurisdiction to operate a community residential home at the
location specified in the permit;
C. The sponsor has unlawfully refused to permit an inspection of the home by an
authorized official of the Village; or
D. The dwelling unit has been determined by an appropriate official of the Village
to be unsafe for human habitation.
Prior to the revocation of an administrative occupancy permit, the Village Manager or his
designee shall investigate whether probable cause for revocation may exist and, if so,
shall notify the sponsor in writing of reasons for the proposed revocation and grant the
sponsor the opportunity to appear before the Village Manager or his designee at a time
and place specified within such notice. Such hearing shall be held not less than ten (10)
days after the notice is received by the sponsor. Hearings shall be conducted under
rules issued by the Village Manager. Such rules shall be consistent with the nature of the
proceedings and shall ensure that each party may present evidence, cross examine
witnesses and be represented by legal counsel. If after the hearing the Village Manager
or his designee determines that the permit should be revoked, a written order revoking
the permit shall be issued.
An administrative occupancy permit is not transferable to any other person.
6-5E-3: STANDARDS FOR THE ISSUANCE OF A SPECIAL USE PERMIT: Any
community residential home consisting of seven (7) or more residents shall not be
occupied by any residents unless and until the sponsor has first obtained a special use
permit as provided for in this Section.
Village of Lincolnshire Page 50 Title 6-5
Revised 08/25/2014
No special use permit shall be recommended by the Zoning Board for any community
residential home, unless it shall find that each and every one of the following criteria are
met:
A. That the design, location and operation of the community residential home will
not be detrimental to or endanger the public health, safety and welfare;
B. That the community residential home will not substantially diminish the
economic value of properties in the vicinity of the proposed home;
C. That the granting of the permit would not result in the concentration of
community residential homes or of such other facilities for service dependent
populations such that the nature and character of the area would be
substantially altered; and
D. That the proposed use of the affected property complies with all the applicable
ordinances of the Village.
In addition to supplying all of the information required for an administrative occupancy
permit, the party seeking issuance of a special use permit shall submit such evidence as
may be requested by the Mayor and Board of Trustees to make the findings required by
this Section.
The issuance of a special use permit for a community residential home shall also be in
accordance with the provisions of Section 6-14-14, subsections I, J, K and L of this Title
6, provided, however, that the references to subsections H in I1 and J2 shall, solely for
purposes of this Section, be amended to read Section 6-5E-2.
6-5E-4: SPACING AND DENSITY REQUIREMENTS: In order to avoid a
saturation/concentration effect in the siting of community residential homes, spacing
requirements have been established to regulate the siting and operation of community
residential homes in the Village.
Due to the unique character of street configuration within the Village, a standard for the
appropriate number of community residential homes related to the size of a block is not
appropriate. Therefore, this Section includes a minimum spacing distance established
according to a simple formula; Required lot frontage in the zoning district x 10 (an
average number of homes per block in a residential area laid out on the typical grid
system). These numbers establish a distance that is comparable to one community
residential home per block.
The spacing requirements would assume that saturation/concentration would not occur
in any one area of the Village. It is the intent of these requirements to assimilate
Village of Lincolnshire Page 51 Title 6-5
Revised 08/25/2014
residents of community residential homes into the entire community rather than
establishing concentrations of community residential homes in any one neighborhood.

6-5F-1: PURPOSE: The Mixed Use Estate District is established to permit an
owner of a residence on a larger residential parcel to maintain a separate
building that may house limited business uses while providing protection to
surrounding uses by requiring restrictions on the operator of the business
and sufficient setbacks for all buildings. The district may be of particular
significance after the Village annexes property in previously unincorporated
areas that may contain planned or existing mixed uses. It is recognized
that the benefit in annexing such properties may outweigh any detriment to
the Village by permitting such mixed uses.
6-5F-2: PERMITTED USES:
A. Single Family detached dwellings.
B. Business uses as regulated in Section 6-5F-7.

6-6A-1: Intent and Scope of Regulations
This District is intended to provide a location suitable to accommodate a combination of retail,
service and office uses in an intensive commercial core area. Permitted and special uses can
be placed on relatively small zoning lots reflecting the historic development pattern of Half Day
Road and to encourage a pedestrian environment in retail shopping areas.
As the village relies almost exclusively on retail sales generated from properties located in the
village to fund its municipal services, this Article is also intended to regulate the conversion or
elimination of retail sales establishments through the preservation and enhancement of sales
tax generating uses, while also working with the property owners to maintain a viable tenant mix
on various properties within this District.
6-6A-2: General Requirements
A. Outdoor Business and Storage: All business, service, storage, merchandise display and
repair processing, where allowed, shall be conducted only within a completely enclosed
building except for off-street parking, off-street loading, open sales lots, automobile service
facilities, and drive-thru facilities where such uses are allowed.
B. Production of Goods: The production of any goods on the premises shall be associated with
a Permitted and/or Special Use and incidental to the principal use, unless otherwise
specifically provided herein.
C. Performance Criteria: The use of equipment and goods processed or produced in the
premises shall not be objectionable by reason of odor, dust, smoke, cinders, gas, noise,
vibration, refuse matter or water-carried waste.

The intent of the B2 District is to accommodate those uses which require substantial land area,
are major travel destinations, require substantial support parking and draw their clientele or
employees from the regional market. Often times such uses require a high degree of access
and roadside visibility or exposure from major thoroughfares.
As the village relies almost exclusively on retail sales generated from properties located in the
village to fund its municipal services, this Article is also intended to regulate the conversion or
elimination of retail sales establishments through the preservation and enhancement of sales
tax generating uses, while also working with the property owners to maintain a viable tenant mix

6-7-2: PERFORMANCE STANDARDS:
Any use established in a manufacturing district which involves the
manufacturing, fabricating, assembly, disassembly, repairing, storing, cleaning,
servicing, or testing of materials, goods, or products, shall be operated in such
a manner as to comply with applicable performance standards as hereinafter
set forth governing noise, smoke, particle matter, toxic or noxious matter,
odors, fire and explosive hazards, or vibration, or glare or heat for the district in
which use shall be located; and no use, already established on the effective
date of this Zoning Code shall be so altered or modified as to conflict with, or
further conflict with such applicable performance standards for the district in
which such use is located.
A. Noise: Sound levels shall be measured with a sound level meter and
associated octave band filter manufactured according to standards prescribed
by the American Standards Association. Measurements shall be made using
the flat network of the sound level meter. Impulsive type noises shall be subject
to the performance standards hereinafter prescribed, provided that such noises
shall be capable of being accurately measured with such equipment. Noises
capable of being so measured, for the purpose of this Zoning Code, shall be
those noises which cause rapid fluctuations of the needle of the sound level
meter, with a variation of no more than plus or minus two (+/-2) decibels.
VILLAGE OF LINCOLNSHIRE TITLE 06-07: MANUFACTURING DISTRICTS
Revised 08/22/2006 Page 4
Noises incapable of being so measured, such as those of an irregular and/or
intermittent nature, shall be controlled so as not to become a nuisance to
adjacent uses.
At no point on the boundary of a residence or business district shall the sound
intensity level of any individual operation or plant (other than the operation of
motor vehicles or other transportation facilities) exceed the decibel levels in the
designated octave bands shown in the following table:

B. Smoke and Particle Matter: The emission of smoke or particle matter in such
manner or quantity as to endanger or to be detrimental to the public health,
safety, comfort, or welfare, is hereby declared to be a public nuisance, and
shall henceforth be unlawful.
For the purpose of grading the density of smoke, the Ringelmann Chart,
published and used by the United States Bureau of Mines, shall be employed.
The emission of smoke or particle matter of a density greater than No. 2 on the

Revised 08/22/2006 Page 16
6-7B-2. FINDINGS:
Based on evidence concerning the adverse secondary effects of sexually
oriented businesses presented to the municipality from findings incorporated in
the cases of City of Erie v. Pap=s A.M., 529 U.S. 277, 120 S.Ct. 1382 (2000);
Barnes v. Glen Theatre, Inc., 501 U.S. 560 (1991), City of Renton v. Playtime
Theaters, Inc., 475 U.S. 41 (1986) Young v. American Mini Theaters, 426 U.S.
50 (1976), Berg v. Health and Hospital Corporation, 865 F.2d 797 (7th Cir
1989); Ellwest Stereo Theaters v. Wenner, 681 F.2d 1243 (9th Cir. 1982);
Bamon Corp v. City of Dayton, 730 F.Supp 80 (S.D. Ohio, 1990) and EWAP
Inc. v. City of Los Angeles, 97 Cal. App 3d 179, 158 Cal. Rptr. (1979), and on
studies in other cities including the Report of the Attorney General=s Working
Group on the Regulation of Sexually Oriented Businesses (Minnesota, 1989);
Memorandum re: Adult Entertainment Ordinance, of the Assistant Chief of
Police of the Tucson, Arizona (May 1, 1990); Hecht, Peter R., Ph.D., Report to
the American Center for Law and Justice on the Secondary Impacts of Sex
Oriented Businesses (March 31, 1996); Adult Entertainment Businesses in
Indianapolis, An Analysis (1984) and McCleary, Richard, Ph.D. and Meeker,
James W., Ph.D., Final Report to the City of Garden Grove: The Relationship
Between Crime and Adult Business Operations on Garden Grove Boulevard,
(Garden Grove, CA, October 23, 1991), this Legislative body finds:
A. Sexually oriented businesses lend themselves to ancillary unlawful and
unhealthy activities.
B. Sexual acts, including masturbation, oral sex and anal sex, occur at sexually
oriented businesses, especially those which provide private or semi-private
booths or rooms for viewing films, videos, or live sexually oriented
entertainment. Such activities may result in spreading communicable diseases
such as syphilis, gonorrhea, and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV).
C. Studies conducted in other cities have demonstrated a correlation between
sexually oriented business and a decrease in the residential and commercial
property values that surround them, especially those properties within 1,000
feet of such businesses.
D. Studies conducted in other cities have demonstrated a correlation between
sexually oriented businesses and increased crime in the neighborhood,
including sex-related crimes like prostitution, obscenity, and sexual assault.
This correlation is especially acute when more than one sexually oriented
VILLAGE OF LINCOLNSHIRE TITLE 06-07: MANUFACTURING DISTRICTS
Revised 08/22/2006 Page 17
business is located in a neighborhood, and when a sexually oriented business
is located near a public open space such as a park, cemetery or school.
E. Studies conducted in other cities have demonstrated a correlation between
sexually oriented businesses and increased harassment and propositioning of
women, children and the elderly in the neighborhood.
F. Studies conducted in other cities have demonstrated a correlation between
sexually oriented businesses and offensive material such as pornographic
magazines and used condoms being discarded in the surrounding
neighborhood, making them available to children.
G. Location of sexually oriented business in a neighborhood can create a Asex for
sale@ reputation in a neighborhood.
H. The foregoing findings raise substantial governmental interests and concerns.
I. The municipality cannot entirely prohibit sexually oriented businesses which
are not obscene from locating within the municipality.
J. The municipality can effect reasonable locational regulations which it believes
will ameliorate these deleterious secondary effects associated with sexually
oriented businesses.
K. Locating sexually oriented businesses in the Manufacturing zone will
ameliorate these deleterious secondary effects associated with sexually
oriented businesses.
L. Requiring sexually oriented businesses to be located 1,000 feet from any other
sexually oriented businesses will ameliorate these deleterious secondary
effects associated with sexually oriented businesses.
M. Requiring sexually oriented businesses to be located 1,000 feet from any
school, day care center, cemetery, public park including any lineal recreational
area like a bike path, public housing, place of religious worship, lot zoned for
residential purposes and lot used for residential purposes, complies with the
requirements of state law, 65 ILCS 5/11-5-1.5, and will ameliorate these
deleterious secondary effects associated with sexually oriented businesses.
N. Aptakisic Road is one of the main thoroughfares in the municipality, and
therefore reflects on the economic status of the municipality.
VILLAGE OF LINCOLNSHIRE TITLE 06-07: MANUFACTURING DISTRICTS
Revised 08/22/2006 Page 18
O. Accordingly, a decrease in the property values and an increase in visible crime
along Aptakisic Road will affect the property values of the municipality as a
whole in a way that other locations would not.
P. Preventing sexually oriented businesses from locating directly on, or within 500
feet of Aptakisic Road will help to conserve property values in the municipality
as a whole, while still providing an adequate number of sites and acreage
available for the location of sexually oriented businesses.
Q. At the time this Article was approved, the regulations set forth herein permitted
approximately eight (8) acres and approximately two (2) sites available for
sexually oriented businesses in the municipality.

6-8-1: INTENT AND PURPOSE
The O/I (Office/Industrial) District is intended to accommodate office buildings, highly
restrictive industrial and warehousing uses, and limited commercial activities in a mutually
compatible environment which necessitate suitable separation from residential development.
Uses permitted in the O/I District shall be restricted to those which require a pleasant, hazardand-
nuisance-free environment and do not create either an appreciable nuisance or hazard to
other property, individuals, or the public in general.
6-8-2: SUBDISTRICTS ESTABLISHED
The District is divided into four (4) subdistricts for the purpose of accommodating officeindustrial
developments of different bulk character.
A. The O/Ia, a subdistrict, is intended to be located along State Highways 21 and 22 and shall be
for office use with no industrial or warehousing uses or activities whatsoever permitted.
B. The O/Ib subdistrict is intended primarily to accommodate office dominant uses where
combinations of office/restricted light industrial or office-warehousing uses are to be
accommodated as long as twenty five percent (25%) of the gross floor area of the original
principal structure on the zoning lot is devoted to office activities.
C. The O/Ic subdistrict is a restricted light industrial district. It is meant to be located off of
secondary roads which are within industrial park developments. Uses permitted in the O/Ia and
O/Ib subdistricts are encouraged in the O/Ic subdistrict.
D. The O/Id subdistrict is designed to accommodate uses similar in character to those permitted in
the O/Ic, and in addition, to industrial users who require rail service, which requires a special
use permit, while maintaining a controlled structural and activity environment which meets the
criteria of bulk regulations, performance standards and other design standards and regulations
LINCOLNSHIRE VILLAGE CODE
TITLE 6: ZONING

as contained herein. It is further intended to permit such uses to occur on smaller lots than
those permitted in the O/Ic subdistrict. O/Id subdistrict is appropriate for areas along and
adjacent to railroad lines which offer rail access to industrial users. Uses permitted in the O/Ia,
O/Ib, and O/Ic subdistricts are also encouraged in the O/Id subdistrict.
6-8-3: GENERAL REQUIREMENTS AND RESTRICTIONS
A. No building or zoning lot shall be devoted to any use other than uses permitted hereinafter in
the zoning district in which such building or zoning lot shall be located, with the exception of the
following:
1. Uses lawfully established on the effective date of this Chapter.
2. Special uses allowed in accordance with the provisions hereof.
3. Uses established prior to the effective date of this Chapter shall be rendered
nonconforming and subject to the regulations of Chapter 13 of this Title.
B. Dwelling units are not permitted, unless otherwise permitted in this Chapter.
C. Special uses shall be permitted in the zoning districts indicated, subject to procedures outlined
in Section 6-14-11 of this Title.
D. All activities including manufacturing, storage, merchandise display, business operations and
service or maintenance shall be conducted within completely enclosed buildings, except areas
specifically set aside for refuse collection or pick-up. All refuse collection or pick-up areas shall
be completely screened by permanent construction material on all sides, as regulated in Section
6-15-3(B)(4).
All loading berths on zoning lots in the O/Ib District shall be within completely enclosed
buildings. All utilities shall be placed underground. (Ord. 80-632-89)
E. All drives, loading dock aprons, parking areas, and walkways throughout the site shall be paved
with asphalt or concrete material. Areas not covered by impervious materials shall be fully
landscaped and maintained with grass, groundcover, trees and shrubs.
F. To the extent of any conflict between the provisions of this Chapter and the provisions of any
applicable Village building, subdivision or fire codes, the most strict provision shall prevail and
be applicable. (Ord. 80-632-89; and. Ord. 82-742-49)
6-8-4: PERFORMANCE STANDARDS
Any use established in an Office/Industrial District after the effective date of this Chapter shall
be so operated as to comply with the performance standards established hereafter. Any use
already established on the effective date of this Chapter shall be permitted to be altered,
enlarged, expanded, or modified, providing that the addition conforms to the performance
standards established hereinafter for the district in which such use is located. In any event,
every use of land or structure shall be operated in compliance with all applicable local, State,
and Federal regulations including the State of Illinois Pollution Control Board rules and
regulations hereby incorporated by reference.
Every application for a building permit or occupancy permit within an Office/Industrial District
shall have affixed to it the certificate of a licensed architect or a registered professional engineer
licensed by the State of Illinois certifying that the building or structure, and the proposed use
thereof, complies with all of the provisions of this Zoning Code respecting performance

standards for industrial and similar uses. The Director of Building and Zoning shall, upon
receipt and upon complete review (either by said Director and/or any outside technical review
agency selected by the Village) of such application, approve and authorize the issuance of a
building permit or occupancy permit as the case may be, provided the applicant has complied
with all other relevant provisions of this Code. If the Director of Building and Zoning determines
it desirable to have some outside technical agency review the plans and application, then the
applicant shall pay to the Village in advance a sum sufficient to reimburse the Village for such
technical reviews. The Director of Building and Zoning may, however, withhold issuance of a
building permit or occupancy permit as a result of examination of the plans or on the basis of
other evidence if he determines that the proposed activity will not in fact comply with the
performance standards and he shall so advise the architect or engineer in writing of such denial.
The Director of Building and Zoning may also obtain an injunction or other appropriate legal or
equitable relief, including but not limited to specific performance, writ of mandamus or
mandatory injunction, to prevent, remedy, or abate any violations which occur after a building
or occupancy permit is issued, which relief shall be in addition to any ordinance prosecutions for

6-8-4-2: VIBRATION
A. Definitions
Amplitude The maximum displacement of the earth from the normal rest position. Displacement
is usually reported as inches per mils.
Discrete Impulses A ground transmitted vibration stemming from a source where specific pulses do not
exceed sixty (60) per minute (or one per second).
Frequency The number of times that a displacement completely repeats itself in one second of
time. Frequency may be designated in cycles per second (cps) or Hertz (Hz).
Impact An earthborne vibration generally produced by two (2) or more objects striking each
other so as to cause separate and distinct pulses.
Particle Velocity A characteristic of vibration that depends on both displacement and frequency. If not
directly measured, it can be computed by multiplying the frequency by the amplitude
times the factor 6.28. The particle velocity will be in inches per second, when the
frequency is expressed in cycles per second and the amplitude in inches.
Seismograph An instrument which measures vibration characteristics simultaneously in three (3)
mutually perpendicular planes. The seismograph may measure displacement and
frequency, particle velocity, or acceleration.
Steady State A vibration which is continuous, as from a fan, compressor, or motor.
LINCOLNSHIRE VILLAGE CODE
TITLE 6: ZONING
CHAPTER 8: OFFICE/INDUSTRIAL DISTRICT
Page 8 of 19
Revised 11/25/2019
Vibration A reciprocating motion transmitted through the earth, both in horizontal and vertical
planes.
B. Instrumentation: Ground-transmitted vibration shall be measured with a seismograph or
complement of instruments capable of recording vibration displacement, particle velocity, or
acceleration and frequency simultaneously in three (3) mutually perpendicular directions.
C. Maximum Permitted Vibration Levels: Table 1 designates the applicable lines of Table 2 that
apply on or beyond adjacent lot lines within the district, and on or beyond appropriate district
boundaries. Vibration shall not exceed the maximum permitted particle velocities in Table 2.
Where more than one set of vibration levels apply, the most restrictive shall govern. Readings
may be made at points of maximum vibration intensity.

0.03 0.01
Nighttime limits shall be considered to prevail from seven o'clock (7:00) P.M.to seven o'clock
(7:00) A.M., local time.
The maximum particle velocity shall be the maximum vector sum of three (3) mutually
perpendicular components recorded simultaneously. Particle velocity may also be expressed as
6.28 times the displacement in inches multiplied by the frequency in Hertz (cycles per second).
For purposes of this regulation, steady-state vibrations are vibrations which are continuous, or
vibrations in discrete impulses more frequent than sixty (60) per minute. Discrete impulses
which do not exceed sixty (60) per minute, shall be considered impact vibrations.
The values presented in Table 1 shall be doubled for impact vibrations.

CHAPTER 11: Off-Street Parking and Loading
Sections:
6-11-1: General Requirements
6-11-2: Off-Street Parking Facilities
6-11-3: Off-Street Loading Facilities
6-11-1: General Requirements
A. General Applicability: Off-street parking and loading facilities for all existing and new
structures and uses of land within the Village of Lincolnshire shall be in accordance with the
provisions of this Chapter.
B. Increase in Intensity: Whenever the intensity of use of any structure, or premises is
increased through the addition of dwelling units, gross floor area, seating capacity, or other
units of measurement specified herein for required parking or loading facilities, parking and
loading facilities shall be required for such increases in intensity.
C. Change in Use: Whenever a use existing on the effective date of this Chapter is changed to
a new use, parking or loading facilities shall be provided as required herein for such new
use.
D. Responsibility: The duty to provide and maintain off-street parking spaces and/or loading
facilities shall be the joint and several responsibility of the operator and/or owner of the use
and/or owner of the land for which off-street parking spaces and/or loading facilities are
required to be provided and maintained hereunder.
E. Design Plan: Parking and loading facilities shall be illustrated on a site plan to be submitted
with all applications for Building Permits or Certificates of Occupancy in accordance with the
provisions of this Chapter.
F. Snow Removal: Accommodations shall be made for the storage and/or removal of snow

A. General Requirements
1. Use: Required off-street parking facilities shall be solely for the parking of vehicles
used for the transportation of occupants, patrons, employees or materials of the uses
to which they are accessory. Each required parking space shall be kept available at all
times for parking of such vehicles. No required parking space shall be rented, leased
or used for any purpose other than that for which said space is required.
2. Access: Off-street parking facilities shall be designed and located to provide
appropriate means of vehicular access to adjacent streets or alley ways in a manner
VILLAGE OF LINCOLNSHIRE TITLE 6-11
OFF-STREET PARKING & LOADING
Revised 10/15/2019 Page 2
which will least interfere with traffic movements. Parking spaces shall open directly
upon an aisle or driveway of such width and designed to provide safe and efficient
means of vehicular access to such parking space at all times.
3. Computation: When the number of parking spaces required herein results in a
fractional space, any fraction shall require one (1) additional parking space. Parking
spaces required on a square footage basis shall be based on the gross square footage
of the structure/leasable space. Parking spaces required on an employee basis shall
be based on the maximum number of employees on duty or residing on the premises
at any one time.
4. Shared Parking Facilities: Parking spaces required for separate structures and uses
may be provided collectively on the same lot, provided use of such spaces shall not
occur at the same time based on the operations of the uses they are serving. The
minimum number of required parking spaces shall be established by the primary use
or the highest parking generating use, whichever is more.
5. Land Banking: The Zoning Administrator may authorize a reduction in the total number
of off-street parking spaces required herein, subject to the following:
a. No more than 50% of the required parking spaces shall be landbanked.
b. Prior to authorization of landbanked spaces, the lot owner or tenant must
demonstrate that required parking spaces are excessive as applied to the use of
the zoning lot, including but not limited to employee counts, lack of public
customers, or similar scenarios.
c. Every request for landbanking of required parking spaces shall be accompanied by
a detailed parking plan identifying the area(s) reserved for future parking and the
landscape treatment of such open space.
d. The property owner shall file with the Zoning Administrator his/her unconditional
agreement in form and substance satisfactory to the Village Attorney that the
area(s) reserved for future parking shall be maintained as landscaped open space
until and unless required to be used for off-street parking in compliance with this
Chapter. Such agreement shall be recorded with the Lake County Recorders
Office.
e. The Zoning Administrator, in his/her sole discretion, shall have the authority to
require the property owner or successor, at any time, to increase the number of
parking spaces required by this Chapter.
B. Location:
1. All parking facilities shall be located in the same zoning lot as the structure or use to
which they serve. Parking facilities of ten (10) or more parking spaces may be located
on a separate lot provided said parking spaces are located within the development in
which such parking spaces are serving.
2. Parking facilities solely for employees, may be located on a separate lot provided no
such parking spaces shall be located in excess of six hundred feet (600') measured
along a paved pedestrian circulation route to the nearest building entrance.

provided in the O/I districts a fully landscaped and maintained strip of at least fifteen
feet (15') in the O/Ia and O/lb subdistricts or eight feet (8') in the O/Ic and O/Id
subdistricts is installed and maintained continuously along the perimeter of the
applicable rear and interior side yards (excluding driveway or sidewalk entrances, or
railroad track frontage).
C. Size: Every parking space shall conform to the parking dimensions identified on the Offstreet
Parking Chart found at the end of this Chapter, exclusive of access drive aisles,
ramps, etc., and have a minimum vertical clearance of seven (7) feet. For parking spaces
adjacent to a curb, the parking space length shall be shortened by two (2) feet to provide
sufficient vehicle overhang (see Figure 1). For parking spaces where vehicle overhang is
adjacent to a pedestrian walkway, the walkway width shall be a minimum of seven (7) feet to

dustless material. Any portion of a parking facility containing parking
spaces in excess of 10% of the minimum number required herein shall implement
innovative stormwater management features (commonly identified as Best
Management Practice techniques, BMP), including but not limited to alternate
paving surface materials, use of light colored concrete, recycled asphalt permeable
pavement materials, bioretention areas, swales, or similar techniques approved by
the Village of Lincolnshire; unless it can be demonstrated no further increases in
impervious surface coverage will be produced.
2. Drainage: All parking facilities shall be designed to prevent the drainage of stormwater
onto adjoining property and to effectively manage stormwater and snowmelt on-site in
accordance with Village Codes and the Lake County Watershed Development
Ordinance (WDO), including the use of stormwater BMP techniques.
3. Screening and Landscaping: Parking facilities shall be landscaped in accordance with
Section 13-2-4 of Title 13.
4. Illumination: Illumination of off-street parking facilities shall be in accordance with
Section 6-3-15 of this Title. All lighting should create an identity for parking facilities
and be appropriately designed for the location, context, and scale of the areas being
illuminated.

VILLAGE OF LINCOLNSHIRE TITLE 06-13: NON-CONFORMING USES, STRUCTURES AND LOTS
Revised 12/10/2012 Page 1
CHAPTER 13
NON-CONFORMING USES, STRUCTURES AND LOTS
SECTION:
6-13-1: General Provisions
6-13-2: Non-Conforming Uses
6-13-3: Non-Conforming Structures
6-13-4: Non-Conforming Lots
6-13-5: Variances
6-13-1: GENERAL PROVISIONS
A. Purpose: The purpose of this Chapter is to provide for the regulation,
maintenance and gradual amortization of uses, structures and lots that were
lawfully established, but are no longer in compliance with the amended
Village Zoning Code (i.e. Non-conforming Structures, Lots and Uses).
Non-conforming structures, lots and uses can substantially and adversely
affect the orderly development and taxable value of other conforming
property in each district. This Chapter provides for the gradual elimination of
non-conforming structures, lots and uses by specifying the circumstances
and conditions under which non-conforming structures, uses and lots shall
be permitted, repaired, replaced or amortized. The goal of this Chapter is to
promote the health, safety and welfare of the public by organizing and
protecting compatible, related uses in appropriate zoning districts.
B. Application and Scope: The provisions in this Chapter apply to nonconforming
uses, structures and lots that were lawfully established, but are
no longer in compliance with the amended Zoning Code. This Chapter does
not authorize the continuation of any use, structure or lot that is or was
initiated, constructed or established in violation of the then-existing Code
(i.e. Unlawful Use, Structure or Lot).
6-13-2: NON-CONFORMING USES
A. Authority to Continue: Non-conforming uses may be continued, subject to
the conditions and limitations set forth in this Section. Non-conforming uses
that fail to comply with the terms and provisions of this Section shall be
deemed unlawful and subject to elimination.
B. Alteration or Expansion of Use: A non-conforming use of a structure or lot
shall not be altered or expanded in any way designed to increase the scope
VILLAGE OF LINCOLNSHIRE TITLE 06-13: NON-CONFORMING USES, STRUCTURES AND LOTS
Revised 12/10/2012 Page 2
or intensity of the existing non-conforming use or to introduce new unlawful
uses on the property.
C. Relocation: A non-conforming use shall not be moved in whole or in part to
another location on the same lot or any other lot, unless such use shall
thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which it is
located after relocation.
D. Abandonment:
1. Non-conforming use of a lot: When a non-conforming use of a lot, not
involving a structure, is abandoned for a period of one hundred twenty
(120) consecutive days, such use shall not thereafter be re-established
or resumed. Any subsequent use or occupancy of such a lot shall
comply with the regulations of the zoning district in which such a lot is
located.
2. Non-conforming use of a structure: The abandonment of any nonconforming
use of a lawful structure for a period of twelve (12)
consecutive months shall terminate any rights conferred by this Section
to continue such non-conforming use. Any subsequent use or
occupancy of such structure shall comply with the regulations of the
zoning district in which such a lot is located.
3. Non-conforming accessory uses: No use, which is accessory to a
principal non-conforming use, shall continue after such principal nonconforming
use shall have been ceased or terminated.
E. Termination of Use:
1. The following nonconforming uses shall be terminated no later than five
(5) years after the effective date of this Chapter, after such use is
annexed into the Village, or any amendment to the Zoning Code creating
such nonconforming use, whichever is later:
a. Non-conforming commercial and industrial uses in all Residential
Zoning Districts.
b. Non-conforming industrial uses in all Commercial/Business Zoning
districts.
c. Non-conforming commercial uses in all Industrial Zoning Districts.
2. All non-conforming residential uses in Commercial/Business and
Industrial Zoning Districts shall be eliminated upon any change in
ownership. Changes in ownership include any transfer of a legal or
VILLAGE OF LINCOLNSHIRE TITLE 06-13: NON-CONFORMING USES, STRUCTURES AND LOTS
Revised 12/10/2012 Page 3
beneficial interest, or tenancy in a lease for a term exceeding 35 years,
either by reason of a voluntary transaction, judicial order or by action of
law. The Village may withhold the issuance of transfer tax stamps
subject to the written commitment by the successor owner to eliminate
the non-conforming residential use upon the transfer of title.
6-13-3: NON-CONFORMING STRUCTURES
A. Authority to Continue: Non-conforming structures may be preserved,
maintained and used, subject to the conditions and limitations set forth in
this Section. Non-conforming structures that fail to comply with the terms
and provisions of this Section shall be deemed unlawful and subject to
elimination. Non-conforming garages constructed in unincorporated Lake
County and annexed to the Village, shall not be subject to elimination but be
subject to all other restrictions in this Section. In addition, detached garages
located within the Stonegate Circle Subdivision, as defined in Ordinance No.
62-000-70, shall be permitted to make such repairs and alterations as are
allowed under applicable floodplain and floodway regulations, except for
those that will increase the existing garage floor area.
B. Alteration or Expansion of Non-conforming Structures: Any non-conforming
structure may be altered or remodeled to the extent permitted in this
Chapter, provided, however, that no such alteration or remodeling shall
either create any additional non-conformity or increase the degree of the
existing non-conformity of all or part of the structure without a variance
approved under the Village Zoning Code.
Illustration for 6-13-3-B
Permitted Alteration or Expansion of Non-Conforming Structures
C. Maintenance and Repair of Non-Conforming Structures: Normal
VILLAGE OF LINCOLNSHIRE TITLE 06-13: NON-CONFORMING USES, STRUCTURES AND LOTS
Revised 12/10/2012 Page 4
maintenance and incidental repair or replacement of lawful fencing, nonbearing
walls and partitions, fixtures, wiring, plumbing, parking, landscaping,
roofing and mechanical equipment may be performed on any nonconforming
principal structure. Subject to paragraph D, nothing in this
Section shall be deemed to prevent the Owner from taking actions
necessary to address an unsafe condition in accordance with any order of a
public official charged with protecting public safety, and who finds such
structure is unsafe in its then-present condition.
D. Restoration and Reconstruction: All non-conforming structures that are
damaged or destroyed, by any means whatsoever, willful or negligent, to the
extent that restoration and reconstruction costs exceed fifty percent (50%)
of the cost of replacement of the entire structure, shall be eliminated or
reconstructed in a manner that conforms to all regulations of the zoning
district in which it is located. For the purpose of this Chapter, the costs of
restoration or reconstruction shall be cumulative for all damage occurring
within the last ten (10) years and shall be compared to the value of such
structure at the beginning of such ten (10) year period. However, nonconforming
principal structures devoted primarily to Single-Family
Residential and Assembly uses may be replaced if damaged or destroyed,
regardless of the extent.
For the purposes of this Section, the cost of replacement of a structure
destroyed or damaged shall be established by the presentation of a certified
affidavit of a professional, licensed architect or a MAI appraiser.
E. Abandonment: The abandonment of any non-conforming, non-residential
structure for a period of twelve (12) months shall terminate any rights
conferred by this Section to continue the non-conforming use and
occupancy of such non-conforming structure. Any non-conforming structure
abandoned in the manner herein described shall be eliminated or
reconstructed in a manner that conforms to all regulations of the zoning
district in which it is located and permitted.
F. Relocation: A non-conforming structure shall not be moved in whole or in
part to any other location on the same or any other lot unless every portion
of said structure is made to conform to all of the regulations of the district in
which it is to be relocated.
6-13-4: NON-CONFORMING LOTS
A. Authority to Continue: Non-conforming lots that fail to comply with the terms
and provisions of this Section shall be deemed unlawful and the use thereof
shall be subject to elimination under the Zoning Code. Non-conforming lots
may only be used if the following conditions and limitations are satisfied:
VILLAGE OF LINCOLNSHIRE TITLE 06-13: NON-CONFORMING USES, STRUCTURES AND LOTS
Revised 12/10/2012 Page 5
1. SEPARATE OWNERSHIP. The lot has remained in separate or individual
ownership from adjoining tracts of land continuously during the entire
time since such lot became nonconforming. Adjoining lots which have
come under common legal and/or beneficial ownership any time since
either or both of such lots became nonconforming may not be put to
separate, independent uses.
2. Minimum Lot Area; Building Placement: A buildable non-conforming lot
must have a total lot area of at least 75 percent of the minimum lot area
required in the district in which said lot is located.
3. Development Must Comply With Zoning Code; Proportionality: New
principal structures constructed on non-conforming lots shall comply with
all the regulations (except lot area, lot width and/or lot depth, depending
on the specific nonconformity) applicable in the zoning district in which
the lot is located, provided that a building setback (Equation 1) or lot
frontage (Equation 2) shall be reduced (X) from the minimum required
building setback or lot frontage (C) in the same proportion as the nonconforming
lot area (A) is to the minimum required lot area (B). Likewise,
the impervious surface and/or Floor Area Ratio applicable to the subject
property shall be reduced proportionately.

6-13-5: VARIANCES
A. Consideration of Owners Investment: In considering an application for a
variation from any time limitations described in this Chapter for the
continuation of any non-conforming use or structure, the Village shall
consider, in addition to the conditions on the grant of a variation described in
Chapter 14 of this Title, the value of the Owners or Occupants investment
in the subject use or structure. Such investment shall be subject to straightline
depreciation from the date of the owners original investment; provided
in no case shall the amortization period for any structure or use be greater
than double what is otherwise provided in this Chapter.

Revised 12/10/2012 Page 6
B. Evidence: In applying for a variance from any time limitations described in
this Chapter for the continuation of any non-conforming use or structure, it
shall be the duty of the Owner/Occupant to present all data and
documentation regarding the value of the Owner/Occupants investment in
the subject use or structure, any applicable leases and any debt financing
related to the subject property. No agreements, leases, loans, or other
encumbrances entered, incurred or imposed on the subject property after a
structure or use becomes nonconforming shall be considered relevant in the
review of an application for a variance.

in accordance with the standards hereinafter prescribed. Recommendations of the
Zoning Board for approval, approval with conditions, or denial shall be forwarded to
the Village Board of Trustees incorporating the Zoning Board findings of fact for final
action. Any application must receive the approval of four (4) members of the Zoning
Board to be deemed an approval recommendation.
E. Action by the Architectural Review Board: No later than sixty (60) days after the
Preliminary Evaluation Meeting, the Architectural Review Board shall convene a
meeting to consider the application and make recommendations to the Village Board
of Trustees regarding the exterior architectural design of all applicable buildings and
development. Any application must receive the approval of four (4) members of the
Architectural Review Board to be deemed an approval recommendation.
F. Action by the Village Board of Trustees:
1. Recommendations of the Zoning Board for approval, approval with conditions, or
denial shall be forwarded to the Board of Trustees incorporating the Zoning
Board findings of fact for final action.
2. Recommendations of the Architectural Review Board for approval, approval with
Village of Lincolnshire Page 7 Title 6-14
Revised 11/25/2015
conditions, or denial shall be forwarded to the Board of Trustees incorporating
the Architectural Review Board recommendation(s) for final action.
3. The Village Board of Trustees shall act upon the recommendation of the Zoning
Board and/or Architectural Review Board within not more than sixty (60) days
from the last date of the advisory body votes on an application. Without further
public hearing, the Village Board of Trustees shall approve by ordinance, deny
the application, or refer it back to the appropriate advisory board for further
consideration. An application which fails to receive an approval recommendation
of the Zoning Board/Architectural Review Boardmust receive a favorable vote of
two-thirds (2/3) of all the elected members of the Village Board of Trustees to be
approved. An application which receives the approval recommendation of the
Zoning Board/Architectural Review Board may be denied by a majority vote of
the Village Board of Trustees.
4. The ordinance authorizing the application shall contain a specific description of
the request, along with any conditions and restrictions, or appropriate
guarantees upon the establishment, location, and construction of the request as
is deemed necessary for the protection of the public interest and to secure
compliance with the standards and requirements specified herein.
G. Condition of All Applications and Approvals: Any application filed pursuant to this
Chapter shall not be considered complete unless and until all fees and deposits due
pursuant to Comprehensive Fee Schedule have been paid. Any approval granted
pursuant to this Chapter shall, whether or not expressly so conditioned, be deemed
to be conditioned upon payment of fees as required by Section 6-14-14. The failure
to fully pay any such fee or deposit upon request shall be grounds for tolling any
deadlines, rejection in processing an application and for denying or revoking any
approval sought or issued with respect to the land or development to which the
unpaid fee or deposit relates.
6-14-9: VARIANCE
A. Purpose: A variance authorizes a relaxation of the terms of this Title where such
relaxation will not be contrary to the public interest and where, due to practical
difficulties on the property, a literal enforcement of the Code would result in
unnecessary hardship. The Zoning Board may recommend a variance from the
regulations of this Title to the Board of Trustees consistent with the general purpose
and intent of this Title. The Board of Trustees shall make all final decisions on
variance requests.
B. Process: The application process outlined in Section 6-14-8 of this Chapter shall
apply.
C. Findings of Fact: The Zoning Board shall not recommend a variance from the
regulations of this Title unless it shall make findings based upon the evidence
presented to it in each specific case the proposed variance meets each and every
one of the following standards:
1. Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape, or topographical
conditions of the specific property involved, a particular hardship to the owner
Village of Lincolnshire Page 8 Title 6-14
Revised 11/25/2015
would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience if the strict letter of the
regulations were to be carried out;
2. The property in question cannot yield a reasonable return if permitted to be used
only under the conditions allowed by the regulations governing the zoning
district in which it is located;
3. The conditions upon which an application for a variance is based are unique to
the property for which the variance is sought, and are not applicable, generally,
to other property within the same zoning classification;
4. The alleged difficulty or hardship is not based primarily upon a desire by any
persons presently having an interest in the property or to increase financial gain;
5. The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public welfare or
injurious to other property or improvements in the neighborhood in which the
property is located;
6. The granting of the variance will not alter the essential character of the
neighborhood or locality;
7. The proposed variance will not impair an adequate supply of light and air to
adjacent property or substantially increase the congestion of the public streets,
or increase the danger of fire, or impair natural drainage or create drainage
problems on adjacent properties, or endanger the public safety, or substantially
diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood;
8. The proposed variance is consistent with the official Comprehensive Plan of the
Village and other development codes of the Village.
The Zoning Board may recommend and the Village Board of Trustees may
impose such conditions and restrictions upon the premises benefitted by a
variance as may be necessary to comply with the standards established in this
Section and the objectives of this Title.
D. Authorized Variations: Due to their minor nature, an application for the following
variations shall not require a Preliminary Evaluation Meeting as outlined in Section
6-14-8(B), and shall advance directly to Public Hearing by the Zoning Board:
1. Reduction in the Setback required by the applicable zoning regulations of not
more than 25%.
2. Reduction of the Lot Area or Lot Width required by the applicable zoning
regulations of not more than 25%.
3. To permit the same off-street parking space(s) to qualify as space(s) for two (2)
or more separate uses required by Section 6-11-3(A)(5) of this Title, provided
that use of such parking space(s) for each user does not occur at approximately
the same hours of the same days of the week.
4. To increase the maximum distance parking spaces are permitted to be located
Village of Lincolnshire Page 9 Title 6-14
Revised 11/25/2015
from the use served by not more than fifty percent (50%), as required by 6-11-
3(A)(2) of this Title.
5. To permit the deferment of required parking facilities for a specified period of
time.
6. To permit an increase in established grade from which Building Height is
measured a maximum of 2.5 feet above the base floodplain elevation (BFE),
provided the Buildable Area of the subject parcel has an elevation below the
BFE.
An application for variance from the regulations of this Title not contained in this
Subsection (above) may be considered by the Zoning Board at a public hearing,
only after evaluated at Preliminary Evaluation Meeting by the Village Board of
Trustees, as outlined in Section 6-14-8(B).
E. Revocation: Where a variance has been granted pursuant to the provisions of this
Chapter, such approval shall become null and void unless construction thereon is
substantially under way within one (1) year from ordinance approval, unless a onetime
extension is granted by the Village Board of Trustees without an additional
public hearing.
6-14-10: AMENDMENTS (MAP AND TEXT)
A. Purpose: For the purpose of ensuring that the taxable value of land and buildings
throughout the municipality may be conserved; congestion in the public streets may
be lessened or avoided; the public health, safety, comfort, morals, and welfare may
otherwise be promoted; and to ensure and facilitate the preservation of sites, areas,
and structures of historical, architectural and aesthetic importance, the Village Board
of Trustees may, in the manner hereinafter set forth, amend the regulations imposed
in the districts created by this Title or amend district boundary lines. Due allowances
shall be made for existing conditions, the policies, standards, and principles of the
Comprehensive Plan of the Village, the conservation of property values, the
direction of building development to the best advantage of the entire community,
and the uses to which property is devoted at the time of the adoption of such
amendatory ordinance.
B. Process: The application process outlined in Section 6-14-8 of this Chapter shall
apply.
C. Findings of Fact - Text Amendment: At the conclusion of the public hearing, the
Zoning Board shall submit written recommendations to the Village Board of
Trustees. Where the purpose and effect of the proposed amendment is not to
change the zoning classification of particular property, the Zoning Board shall make
findings based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific case with respect
to, but not limited to, the following standards.
1. The request for an amendment shall serve the purpose of promoting the public
health, safety, and general welfare.
Village of Lincolnshire Page 10 Title 6-14
Revised 11/25/2015
2. The request for an amendment shall conserve the value of property throughout
the community.
3. The request for an amendment shall lessen or avoid congestion in the public
streets and highways.
D. Findings of Fact - Map Amendment (Rezoning): At the conclusion of the public
hearing, the Zoning Board shall submit written recommendations to the Village
Board of Trustees. The Zoning Board may recommend the adoption of an
amendment changing the zoning classification of the property in question to any
higher classification than that requested by the applicant. For the purpose of this
paragraph, the R-1 District shall be considered the highest classification and the M-1
District shall be considered the lowest classification. The Zoning Board shall not
recommend the adoption of a proposed amendment if it finds that the adoption of
such amendment is detrimental to the public interest, based on the following
standards:
1. Existing zoning classification of the property.
2. Existing uses of property and existing physical, social or economic factors within
the general area of the property in question.
3. The zoning classification of property within the general area of the property in
question.
4. The suitability of the property in question to the uses permitted under the
existing or proposed zoning classification.
5. The trend of development, if any, in the general area of the property in question,
including changes, if any, which have taken place in its present zoning
classification.
6. The length of time the property has been vacant as zoned.
7. The extent to which the propertys values is diminished by the existing zoning
classification.
8. The impact upon the objectives of the official Comprehensive Plan of the Village,
as amended.
E. Denial of Amendment: Any application for an amendment which has been denied by
the Village Board of Trustees shall not be resubmitted for a period of one year from
the date of the denial, except on the grounds of new evidence or proof of change of
conditions.
6-14-11: SPECIAL USES
A. Purpose: The development and execution of this Title is based upon the division of
the community into zoning districts within which the use of land, buildings and their
bulk and location in relation to the land are substantially uniform. It is recognized,
however, there are certain uses because of their unique characteristics, requires
Village of Lincolnshire Page 11 Title 6-14
Revised 11/25/2015
consideration, in each case, of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land and
of the public need for the particular use in the particular location. Such special uses
fall into two (2) categories:
1. Uses publicly operated or associated with a public interest, and
2. Uses entirely private in character, but of a unique nature that their operation may
give rise to unique problems with respect to their impact upon neighboring
property.
B. Process: The application process outlined in Section 6-14-8 of this Chapter shall
apply.
C. Development Review Team: A meeting of the Development Review Team shall be
conducted to carry out review of all new applications for special use prior to the
holding of a public hearing with the Zoning Board, as outlined in Section 6-14-6 of
this Chapter.
D. Findings of Fact: At the conclusion of the public hearing, the Zoning Board shall
submit written recommendations to the Village Board of Trustees. No special use
shall be recommended by the Zoning Board, unless it shall find that each and every
one of the following standards are met:
1. The special use will not be injurious to the use and enjoyment of other property
in the immediate vicinity of the subject premises for the purposes already
permitted, nor substantially diminish and impair property values within the
neighborhood in which it is to be located.
2. The establishment of the special use will not impede the normal and orderly
development and improvement of the surrounding property for uses permitted in
the district.
3. Adequate utilities, access roads, drainage and/or necessary facilities have been
or will be provided.
4. Adequate measures have been or will be taken to provide ingress and egress so
designed as to minimize traffic congestion in the public streets.
5. The proposed special use is not contrary to the objectives of the Official
Comprehensive Plan of the Village as amended.
6. The special use shall, in all other respects, conform to the applicable regulations
of the district in which it is located, except as such regulations may, in each
instance, be varied pursuant to Section 6-14-9 of this Chapter.
E. Denial of Special Use: Any application for a special use, which has been denied
wholly or in part by the Village Board of Trustees, shall not be resubmitted for a
period of one year from the date of said denial, except on the grounds of new
evidence or proof of change of conditions.
F. Amendments to Special Uses: A special use shall be implemented only in strict
Village of Lincolnshire Page 12 Title 6-14
Revised 11/25/2015
adherence to the authorizing ordinance, along with any conditions and restrictions,
or appropriate guarantees upon the establishment, location, and construction of the
application, which shall be binding on the applicants, their successors, grantees and
assigns. Any request to amend an approved special use shall be subject to the
following:
1. Major Amendments: Major amendments are classified as any change not
categorized as a Minor Amendment, and shall be subject to the requirements of
Section 6-14-8.
2. Minor Amendments: Minor amendments are classified as any change which
does not substantially alter the nature of the approved use(s), increase the
intensity of the approved use(s), or substantially increase the scale of structures
or site improvements associated with the approved special use(s). Upon the
submission of a new application for a minor amendment, the Zoning Board
and/or Architectural Review Board may approve, without the holding of a public
hearing, minor amendments.
G. Revocation: Where a special use has been granted pursuant to the provisions of this
Chapter, such approval shall become null and void unless construction thereon is
substantially under way within three (3) years of the date of granting, unless a onetime
extension is granted by the Village Board of Trustees without an additional
hearing.
6-14-12: Planned Unit Developments (PUD)
A. Purpose and Description: While a Planned Unit Development (PUD) is a special
use, this Section provides a special mechanism to accommodate development
which is in the public interest and would not otherwise be permitted pursuant to this
Title. These provisions are also intended to provide an opportunity to accommodate
developments that involve one or more uses and may be located in more than one
zoning district.
It is anticipated that planned unit developments will offer one or more of the
following advantages:
1. Designs which reflect the historic open character of single-family areas of the
Village.
2. Designs which provide substantial buffers and transitions between areas of
different land use or development densities.
3. Designs which enhance the appearance of neighborhoods by conserving
streams, areas of natural beauty, and natural green spaces.
4. Designs which counteract possible urban monotony and congestion in streets.
5. Designs which promote compatible architecture between adjacent buildings.
6. Designs which will buffer differing types of land use and intensities of
development from each other so as to minimize any adverse impact which new
development may have on existing or zoned development.
B. Intent: A planned unit development is of substantially different character than other
uses described in this Title. Planned unit developments allow for far more flexibility
than those pertaining to other land uses and allows for uses which may not
Village of Lincolnshire Page 13 Title 6-14
Revised 11/25/2015
otherwise be identified in this Title. The maximum use of zoning exceptions for
planned developments will not automatically be granted by the Village Board of
Trustees; rather the intent is to grant only such adjustments or uses which create a
balance with the benefits accruing to the Village as a result of the planned unit
development. Therefore, the Village Board of Trustees may as a condition of
approval require any reasonable condition limitation or design factor which will
promote proper development of a planned unit development.
The planned unit development provisions of this Chapter are intended to provide the
following:
1. A choice in the type of environment available to the public by allowing
development that would not be possible under the strict application of other
sections of this Title.
2. Creation and/or permanent reservation of open space, recreational areas and
facilities.
3. A land use plan which permits preservation of green space, natural vegetation,
topographic and geological features, and historic resources.
4. A creative approach to the use of land and related physical facilities which
results in better urban design, higher quality construction and the provision of
aesthetic amenities.
5. The efficient use of land, so as to promote economies in the provision of utilities,
streets, schools, public grounds and buildings, and other facilities.
6. Innovations in development so the growing needs and demands of the
population may be met by a greater variety in land uses, building type, design,
and layout, and by conservation and more efficient use of open space ancillary
to such development, all in a manner consistent with the character of the zoning
district in which the planned unit development is located.
7. A land use which promotes the public health, safety, comfort, morals and
welfare.
C. Minimum Area for Planned Unit Development: A minimum gross area of three (3)
acres is required of each site for a planned unit development, except in the R-4, R-5,
B and E Zoning Districts where there shall be no minimum size requirement.
D. Application: A planned unit development shall be granted as a special use in
permissible zoning districts and in accordance with the procedures and standards
set forth in this Section. To the extent the procedures and standards set forth in this
Section conflict with other sections of the Village Code, this Section shall apply,
except that all required improvements, construction standards, design standards
and all other engineering standards contained within the Village's Subdivision and
Land Development regulations of Title 7 must be complied with, except where
specifically varied through the provisions of this Section.
1. Application: Applications shall be made on forms provided by the Community
Village of Lincolnshire Page 14 Title 6-14
Revised 11/25/2015
and Economic Development Department and shall be filed as outlined in Section
6-14-8(A) of this Chapter.
2. Joint Request: If any additional application pursuant to this Title is filed in
conjunction with a planned unit development, the applications shall be
processed concurrently; however all applicable public hearings shall be
convened by the Village Board of Trustees, which shall consider the joint
requests prior to consideration of the planned unit development application.
3. Optional Pre-Application Conference: Prior to filing an application for a planned
unit development, the applicant may request a pre-application conference with
the Zoning Administrator. The purpose of such a conference is to allow the
Zoning Administrator to inform the applicant of all applicable ordinances, rules,
regulations, plans, policies, standards, and procedures which may affect the
proposed development, or the consideration of said development by the Village
Board of Trustees. Such conference also allows the applicant to present a
general concept of the proposed development prior to the preparation of detailed
plans. No final or binding action shall be taken at a pre-application conference
and any views expressed shall be deemed to be only preliminary and advisory.
E. Preliminary Development Plan: The Preliminary Development Plan of the planned
unit development is intended to provide the basic scope, character, and nature of
the entire proposed planned unit development. The Preliminary Development Plan is
the basis on which the required public hearing is held, enabling public consideration
of the proposal at the earliest possible stage.
1. Preliminary Evaluation Meeting: An application for a planned unit development
shall be first evaluated at a Preliminary Evaluation Meeting by the Village Board
of Trustees for initial review prior to any further action, and shall include the
following plans and documents:
 A detailed explanation of the character of the planned unit development and
the reasons why it has been planned to take advantage of the flexibility of
these regulations. This item shall include a specific explanation of how the
proposed land use(s) and how the proposed planned unit development
meets the objectives of all official plans which affect the parcel(s) in
question.
 A location map.
 An accurate legal description of the entire area under immediate
development within the planned unit development.
 Conceptual design plans regarding land use, dwelling type, density, building

1-12-1 of the Village Code.
2. Development Review Team: Following the Preliminary Evaluation Meeting, a
meeting of the Development Review Team shall be conducted pursuant to
Section 6-14-6 to carry out review of Preliminary Development Plans prior to
consideration by the Architectural Review Board. Copies of the Preliminary
Development Plan for all new residential developments shall be made available
to any school district, library district, and fire protection district which might be
affected by the development. The Zoning Administrator shall notify any such
district concerning the filing of said documents.
The Preliminary Development Plan and supporting data shall include the
following:

6-14-8(c) and make findings of fact in accordance with standards
hereinafter prescribed, Architectural Review Board findings and
recommendation, and other supporting data.
b. Findings of Fact: The Preliminary Development Plans may be approved
by the Village Board of Trustees if it can make findings of fact related to
the specific proposal set forth with particularity, describing in what
respects the proposal would be in the public interest, based on the
following:
i. The proposed plan is consistent with the stated purpose of the
planned unit development regulations.
ii. The proposed plan meets the requirements and standards of the
planned unit development regulations.
iii. The proposed plan departs from the zoning and subdivision

Village of Lincolnshire Page 18 Title 6-14
Revised 11/25/2015
beyond the minimum requirements of the Zoning Code shall be
specifically listed as evidence of justified bulk premiums and/or use
exception.
v. The physical design of the proposed plan makes adequate
provisions for public services, provides adequate control over
vehicular traffic, provides for and protects designated common open
space, and further the amenities of light and air, recreation and
visual enjoyment.
vi. The beneficial relationship and compatibility of the proposed plan to
the adjacent properties and neighborhood.
vii. The desirability of the proposed plan to the Village's physical
development, tax base and economic well-being.
viii. The conformity with the recommendations of the Official
Comprehensive Plan, as amended, and all other official plans and

findings and requirements specified herein.
i. Use Exceptions: The Village Board of Trustees may authorize
specified uses not permitted by the use regulations of the zoning
district(s) in which the planned unit development is located, provided
that:
 The uses permitted by such exception are necessary or
desirable and are appropriate with respect to the primary
purpose and character of the planned unit development.
 The uses permitted by such exception will not exercise a
detrimental influence on the neighborhoods surrounding the
planned unit development, or upon the internal character of any
part or all of the planned unit development itself.
ii. Bulk Regulations: The Village Board of Trustees may authorize
exceptions to the applicable bulk regulations of the Zoning Code
within the boundaries of such planned unit development, provided
that:
 Such exception shall be solely for the purpose of promoting an
integrated site plan no less beneficial to the residents or
occupants of such development as well as the neighboring
property, than would be obtained under the bulk regulations of
Village of Lincolnshire Page 19 Title 6-14
Revised 11/25/2015
the Zoning Code for buildings developed on separate zoning lots.
 The overall floor area ratio for the planned unit development
would not exceed more than ten percent (10%) the maximum
floor area ratio which would be determined on the basis of the
floor area ratio required for the individual uses in such planned
unit developments, as stipulated in each zoning district.
 Along the periphery of the planned unit development, required
front, side and rear yards may be provided as required by the

approved plans and specifications due to, but not limited to: discoloration,
cracking, missing components, rusting, settling, damage or general disrepair;
then the owner of the personal wireless service facility and the owner of the
building or lot on which the personal wireless service facility is located will be
jointly and severally responsible for remedying the specific non-conformities.
These non-conformities must be remedied within forty-five (45) days after
written notice, detailing those non-conformities, is sent by the Village to the
owner of the personal wireless service facility and the owner of the building or
lot. Failure to remedy all of the cited non-conformities, within the forty-five (45)
day time period, shall be subject to the fine set forth in the Comprehensive
Fine Schedule of the Code described in 17-1. (Ord. Amd. 10-3131-08, eff.
3/22/10)
D. PROTECTION - Every personal wireless service facility shall be protected
against unauthorized climbing or other access by the public.
E. STORAGE - Vehicular and outdoor storage associated with personal wireless
service facilities is prohibited on any site containing said facilities.
F. INTERFERENCE - In considering a request for approval of a Special Use or
variations to permit the installation of personal wireless service facilities, the
Zoning Board or the Board of Trustees, as the case may be, may require that
the applicant demonstrate that the proposed personal wireless service facilities
will not interfere with any existing Village public safety communication systems,
or residential or commercial application including, but not limited to, television
and radio broadcast signals.
G. ENGINEERING - No personal wireless service facility may be located within
the Village unless the Applicant has provided to the Village the written
certification of a professional engineer licensed by the State of Illinois that the
structure upon which the facility is located is sufficient from a structural
engineering standpoint to bear the load. In instances of free-standing
structures, this shall include a certificate that the foundation of the structure is
built, constructed and engineered to take into account the existing soil
conditions. A licensed professional engineer shall also certify that in the event
VILLAGE OF LINCOLNSHIRE TITLE 6-16: PERSONAL WIRELESS
Revised 07/25/2011 Page 6
of a fall or collapse, that the facility is designed and manufactured to fall
entirely within the boundary lines of the lot on which it is located, and it has
been erected in accordance with manufacturers specifications.
H. HEIGHT
1. Height Exceptions of Less Than 50% - If an applicant desires a height
exception of less than fifty percent (50%) of the maximum permitted
height for that zoning district, set forth in this Chapter 16, that applicant
shall file a Certificate of Necessity executed by an Engineer acceptable to
the Village and not in the employ of the applicant. The Certficate of
Necessity shall provide a statement, from the Engineer, that the relief
requested is the minimum necessary to accomplish the applicant=s
purpose and that unless the relief is granted, the signals to be sent or
received by this facility will be substantially impaired or obstructed within
the transceiving cell or service area. The Certificate of Necessity shall
also state that there is not another location reasonably available that
would require a lesser degree of exception, or no exception.
2. Exceptions of 50% or Greater - A height exception varying the standards
set forth in this Chapter 16 may be granted, where requested exceptions
are 50% of the maximum permitted height or greater, upon the holding of
a public hearing before the Zoning Board and approval by the Village
Board. Notice of the Public Hearing shall be given in the same manner as
is required in Chapter 14 for zoning variations. In addition, no exceptions
may be granted pursuant to this subparagraph 2 unless the Village is
provided with a Certificate of Necessity as set forth in subparagraph 1,
above, along with a sealed survey by a licensed surveyor showing the
location and height of the obstructing structures or vegetation. The
Certificate of Necessity shall provide clear proof, from the Engineer, that
the relief requested is the minimum necessary to accomplish the
applicant=s purpose and that unless the relief is granted, the signals to be
sent or received by this facility will be substantially impaired or obstructed
within the transceiving cell or service area. The Certificate of Necessity
shall also state that there is not another location reasonably available that
would require a lesser degree of exception, or no exception. For purposes
of this subparagraph 2 a mere differential in the cost of one location over
another shall not by itself meet the standard of not being Areasonably
available@ although a difference in cost may be considered along with
other factors. The applicant must also provide to the Village a written
affidavit detailing the efforts made by the applicant to fulfill the need for
this antenna with a structure requiring less than a 50% exception.
I. INSURANCE - The provider must tender to the Village of Lincolnshire, on an
annual basis, proof of public liability insurance covering the facility in an
VILLAGE OF LINCOLNSHIRE TITLE 6-16: PERSONAL WIRELESS

J. ROAD RIGHT-OF-WAY=S - A distance of one-thousand feet (1,000') must be
maintained between personal wireless service facilities located in a road rightof-
way; whether local, state or federal. The applicant will be required to
demonstrate that this requirement has been satisfied. Personal wireless
service facilities in road right-of-ways will be required to conform to the
regulations of Section 6-16-2(C). Road right-of-ways are not zoned property,
however, all such right-of-ways will be regulated as though they are in singlefamily
residential districts, and will comply with all applicable sections of this
Chapter 16.
6-16-6: TEMPORARY FACILITIES:
Temporary personal wireless service facilities shall conform to all of the
setback and yard requirements of the district in which they are located, as well
as sections 6-16-5A & 6-16-5B of this code, relating to signage and lighting. A
temporary personal wireless service facility shall not exceed the height of the
facility previously approved for the property, or 100' in the case of a special
event. Only one temporary personal wireless service facility will be allowed per
site at any one time, unless the approved facility on the subject site allows for
co-location, in which case the permissible number of temporary facilities on
that site shall be the number approved for that facility. A temporary personal
wireless service facility must be located behind the front plane of any principal
structure that is on the lot. A temporary personal wireless service facility may
be allowed in single-family residential areas only in conformance with the
restrictions in this section and those in section 6-16-2C.
A request for a temporary personal wireless service facility may be granted
only by the Village Manager, or his designee, in such reasonable numbers and
with such reasonable conditions as the Manager or designee may deem
appropriate. Any request for additional time beyond that set forth in these
paragraphs (A) and (B) shall be subject to review by the Zoning Board and
approval of the Village Board.
A. Special Events - Temporary personal wireless service facilities shall be
permitted for each licensed provider for special events (temporary sporting or
entertainment events) of a period of not to exceed twelve (12) weeks in a three
(3) year time period.
B. Repairs & Equipment Upgrading - If a permanent personal wireless service
facility is under repair or equipment is being upgraded, a temporary facility shall
be permitted for each licensed provider for a period of up to ninety (90) days.
The owner of the facility must certify in writing the necessity for the repair or

equipment upgrade.
6-16-7: ABANDONMENT & REMOVAL:
When a personal wireless service facility and related equipment is not operated
for the provision of personal wireless services for a continuous period of six (6)
months or more, such personal wireless service facility and related equipment
may be deemed to be abandoned by the Village. The owner of such personal
wireless service facility and related equipment shall remove such items within
forty-five (45) days following mailing of written notice that removal is required.
Such notice shall be sent by registered or certified mail, return receipt
requested, by the Village to such owner at the last known address of such
owner. If two (2) or more providers of personal wireless services use the
personal wireless service facility or related equipment to provide personal
wireless services, then the period of non-use under this provision shall be
measured from the cessation of operation at the location of said personal
wireless service facility and related equipment by all such providers.
6-16-8: PROHIBITED PLACEMENT OF PERSONAL WIRELESS SERVICE
FACILITIES:
The relative location of properties zoned as commercial in the Village enables
a provider of personal wireless service to provide service to the Village without
the need to locate any such facilities on a lot used for residential purposes in
the R1, R2, R2A and R3 Zoning Districts. A personal wireless service facility
shall be considered a prohibited use on a lot used for residential purposes in
such zoning districts. No variation or Special Use Permit shall be granted to
permit such a facility on a lot used for residential purposes in these zoning
districts.
6-16-9: NON-CONFORMITIES:
Any personal wireless service facility installed and operating prior to the
enactment of this Chapter 16, which would be prohibited under Chapter 16,
shall be considered a legal non-conforming use and/or a legal non-conforming
structure, as the case may be, and shall be subject to the rules on nonconformities
provided in Chapter 13 of this Title 6. (Amd Ord. 06-2014-05, eff.

shall obtain in the name of the Village and shall maintain and pay the
premiums for such insurance in such amount and with such provisions as will
protect the Village from contingent liability and a copy of such insurance policy

Revised 12/13/2010 Page 4
7-3-4: PROCEDURE FOR APPROVAL:
A. The Plan Commission shall determine whether the preliminary plat shall be
approved, approved with modifications, or disapproved, and shall give notice
to the subdivider of its determination. If approved, the Commission shall so
note on the face of the plat, and shall thereupon forward said plat to the
Village Board, notifying the subdivider of the action. If approved with
modifications, or if disapproved, the Commission shall attach to the original
plat a statement of the reasons for such action and shall return the original of
said plat to the subdivider, retaining one copy thereof for its records.
B. The approval of a preliminary plat by the Plan Commission is strictly
tentative, involving merely the general acceptability of the layout submitted.
This approval shall be effective for a maximum period of twelve (12) months,
unless upon application of the developer the Village Board grants an
extension. If the final plat has not been recorded within this time limit, the
preliminary plat must again be submitted for approval.
C. The Village Board shall, upon receipt of the report from the Plan Commission
and four (4) copies of the preliminary plat, upon motion and majority vote,
approve or disapprove the preliminary plat, and, if approved, give permission
to prepare detailed plans and specifications of the subdivision and public
improvements in accordance with the preliminary plat, and within the
requirements of this Code.
D. The approval of a preliminary plat by the Village Board is tentative only,
involving merely the general acceptability of the layout as submitted and must
have designated thereon the words "This is a Preliminary Plat, of No Legal
Effect, and Not to be Recorded".
E. The Plan Commission may recommend, or the Village Board may require
during consideration of a preliminary plat, such changes or revisions as are
deemed necessary in the interest and needs of the community.
F. No plat will be approved for the subdivision of land which is subject to
periodic flooding or which contains extremely poor drainage facilities and
which would make adequate drainage of the streets impossible. However, if
the subdivider agrees to make improvements which will, in the opinion of the
Village Engineer or upon the recommendation of the Department of Public
Works and Buildings of the State of Illinois, make the area completely safe
for residential occupancy and provide adequate street drainage, the
preliminary plat of the subdivision may be approved.
G. One print of the approved preliminary plat, signed by the Mayor and the
Village Clerk, shall be retained in the Village Clerk's office and two (2) copies
VILLAGE OF LINCOLNSHIRE TITLE 7-3: PRELIMINARY PLATS
Revised 12/13/2010 Page 5

Commission. One signed copy is authorization for the subdivider to proceed
with the preparation of plans and specifications for the minimum
improvements required in these rules and regulations and with the
preparation of the final plat.
H. The preliminary plat and documents in support thereof shall be filed at least
ten (10) days before a regular Plan Commission meeting. The Plan
Commission shall, not less than fifteen (15) days from the date of the second
regular meeting following the submission of the pat, forward its

Revised 07/08/12 Page 14
covenant shall read as follow:
G.
PERPETUAL MAINTENANCE COVENANT
The owners of all lots within this subdivision are jointly and severally
responsible for the perpetual maintenance of the screening, as approved by
the Village Forester, of all above-ground public utility appurtenances
including transformers, junction boxes, relief valves, and all structures
associated with the installation and function of such utilities. This covenant
shall constitute a covenant running with the land and shall be binding upon
all successor owners of record and shall run to the benefit of the Village of
Lincolnshire. This covenant shall be enforceable by the Village of
Lincolnshire in any court of competent jurisdiction by an appropriate action
in law or in equity to secure the performance of the covenants herein
contained. (Ord. 87-929-15)
7-6-6: PROCEDURE FOR APPROVAL AND ACCEPTANCE OF
IMPROVEMENTS:
A. Where a subdivider plans for the development of a subdivision within the
corporate limits of the Village, the subdivider shall, before submitting his
final plat for approval:
1. Make provision for the installation and construction of improvements
required by this Chapter.
2. Submit his provisions for installation and construction of improvements
required by this Chapter to the Village Engineer for his
recommendation.
3. Submit his provisions for installation and construction of improvements
required by this Chapter, along with the recommendation of the Village
Engineer to the Mayor and Board of Trustees of the Village for their
approval. (Ord. 66-142-4)
4. Preliminary and Final Plan Review Fees: Prior to the review of any
preliminary development or site plan, the potential developer shall
deposit funds with the Village equal to the cost of the estimated
engineering plan review expenses necessary to review the proposed
plans. Prior to the final approval of any final subdivision plans, the
developer shall pay the fee for review of plans to the Village equal to
two and one-half percent (2-1/2%) of the estimated cost of
VILLAGE OF LINCOLNSHIRE TITLE 07-06: REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS
Revised 07/08/12 Page 15
construction, less the funds previously paid for engineering review of
his preliminary plan. If this fee is insufficient to cover the costs of plan
review, the applicant shall pay the difference.
All costs connected with the inspection of subdivision improvements
shall be paid by the subdivider. Such costs, include, but are not limited
to, time of inspections, testing expense, televising of underground
improvements, soil testing reports and analyses, concrete analyses
and related tests as deemed to be reasonable and required by the
Village Engineer.
In addition, the Village will be furnished by the developer's engineer a
reproducible sepia of all specifications and standards and details.
(Ord. 78-548-38)
B. The Mayor and Board of Trustees of the Village shall not approve a
subdivider's provisions for improvements unless the provisions for
improvements required by this Chapter comply with the specifications for
these improvements as outlined herein. All improvements required by this
Chapter shall be inspected for compliance with this Code, and the contract
specifications during construction by the Village Engineer. No such
improvements shall be accepted by the Mayor and Board of Trustees
unless the Village Engineer shall certify that the improvements comply with
thin Code and the contract specifications, and unless the owner of the
property has tendered to the Village a fully executed bill of sale covering all
water mains, sanitary sewers, storm sewers and street lights constructed as
public improvements. All costs connected with the inspection of subdivision
improvements shall be paid by the subdivider. (Ord. 66-142-4; amd. Ord.
87-945-31)
C. The public improvements, including the water mains, sanitary sewers, the
entire above and below ground storm drainage system including detention
and retention areas, curb and gutter and binder roadway surface course,
and any approved landscaping, if applicable, as required by this Subdivision
Code, must be fully completed and accepted by the Village Board for each
separate phase or unit of a development prior to the issuance of any
occupancy permits for any buildings in any phase or unit.
If building permits are requested for buildings in any phase or unit prior to
the acceptance of the above listed public improvements, the building and/or
developer must:
1. Secure a permit from the Public Works Department for a temporary
road to serve the building or buildings under construction. The
roadway must be a minimum of twenty feet (20') in width and
VILLAGE OF LINCOLNSHIRE TITLE 07-06: REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS
Revised 07/08/12 Page 16
constructed of crushed stone aggregate to a minimum compacted
depth of eight inches (8"). The road must be kept in good repair during
the entire period of construction of the building or buildings. If at any
time the Director of Public Works is of the opinion that the roadway
does not meet the requirements stated above, construction will be
halted.
2. No construction work of a combustible nature shall be commenced
until water mains for the entire phase have been installed and the
Public Works Department has certified that they are in proper working
order and can be utilized for firefighting purposes. Prior to the
completion of the water improvements and the certification by the
Public Works Department, only foundation permits may be issued for
any phase or unit in accordance with all the requirements in this Code.
3. No service connections shall be made to any of the above listed public
improvements until the improvements have been accepted by the
Village Board.
4. In a residential development the public improvements, including the
water mains, sanitary sewers, the entire above and below ground
storm drainage system including detention and retention areas, curb
and gutter and binder roadway surface course, and any approved
landscaping, must be fully completed and accepted by the Village
Board of Trustees for each separate phase or unit of a phased
development prior to the issuance of any building permits for buildings
in any subsequent phase or unit.
5. The final roadway surface course is to be added upon substantial
completion of construction within a phase. The Director of Public
Works will make the determination of when the final roadway surface
is to be installed based upon the size and type of development under
consideration and the availability of other construction traffic routes.
The purpose of this requirement is to avoid undue stress upon any
roadways as a result of construction traffic.
6. Prior to the issuance of any foundation or building permits when the
public improvements listed above have not been completed and
accepted, the developer must provide the Public Works Department
with an installation schedule for these public improvements. The
developer will then be expected to adhere to this schedule unless
unusual circumstances are encountered. If the developer fails to
adhere to the schedule, the Village may be required to complete the
public improvements utilizing the irrevocable letter of credit submitted
by the developer in accordance with escrow agreement required by the
VILLAGE OF LINCOLNSHIRE TITLE 07-06: REQUIRED IMPROVEMENTS
Revised 07/08/12 Page 17
subdivision regulations. (Ord. 86-905-42)
D. Whenever a proposed subdivision coming within the jurisdiction of this
Code has an area of more than ten (10) acres, the subdivider may be
required to reserve up to ten percent (10%) of the area, exclusive of public
streets and alleys, for public use. The location of the area shall be referred
to the Zoning Board for approval and the area shall be appropriately
marked on the plat prior to approval of the plat. (Ord. 66-142-4)

7-7-2: REQUIREMENTS FOR COMPLIANCE:
VILLAGE OF LINCOLNSHIRE TITLE 7-7: DONATIONS
Revised 12/13/2010 Page 3
A. REFERRAL: Upon referral of a subdivision or planned unit development by the
Corporate Authorities to the applicable Boards, Commission and Districts for
review, the subdivider or developer shall consider one of the following methods
for compliance with the terms of this Chapter.
1. Donation Requirements: The subdivider or developer shall agree to make
all land dedications and pay all cash contributions as required in this
Chapter of the Village Code.
2. Written Agreement: The subdivider or developer shall negotiate the
donation and present a written agreement to the Corporate Authorities for
consideration.
If the development is determined by the Administrative Staff to be a
substantial size and it will be completed in logical phases, the subdivider
or developer may petition the Corporate Authorities to allow payment of
the cash contribution by phases of development. Said Agreement shall
contain the dates and amounts of subsequent payments. The Corporate
Authorities may require that sufficient security be deposited with the
Village for any such delayed contribution to insure that actual payment is
made in sufficient time to meet the impact of the subdivision or planned
unit development.
The negotiation of donations may occur between the:
a. Village of Lincolnshire and Subdivider/Developer: The
subdivider or developer shall enter into an Agreement with the
Village after a negotiated donation has been presented for
consideration whereby the amount of the park, schools, and/or
library donations and the date of payment shall be established
based on the following:
1) An independent consultant will be selected and retained by
the Village at the developer's expense to study the actual
impact the proposed development will have on each
applicable taxing district and shall include at a minimum:
a) A review of each taxing district's capital budget.
b) The ability of each taxing district to provide
services to new residents at the same level of
service provided to the existing households.
VILLAGE OF LINCOLNSHIRE TITLE 7-7: DONATIONS
Revised 12/13/2010 Page 4
c) The Capital Improvement Plan for the taxing
district.
d) Any other information the Village may require to
make an informed decision.
If the independent study indicates a higher
contribution per residential unit than established by
the provisions of this Chapter the subdivider or
developer may negotiate a settlement with each
taxing district provided however, that the
negotiated donations are no less than what the
requirements of this Chapter.
b. Taxing District and Subdivider/Developer: The subdivider or
developer may negotiate a land dedication, cash contribution or
combination of both, with one or more of the taxing districts and
present the written agreement to the Corporate Authorities for
consideration at the time of final plat/plan approval. The
subdivider or developer shall be responsible for obtaining and
providing the Village with a separate written confirmation of the
agreed final contribution signed by a representative of the
individual taxing district.
B. CONSIDERATION: During consideration of the development proposal the
developer or subdivider shall submit written verification that indicates the
predominant (50% or more) residence size by bedroom anticipated for the
subdivision or planned unit development. This information will be used by the
Village to calculate the amount of donations.
The subdivider or developer shall be responsible for making additional cash
contributions when the residence size for the number of dwelling units actually
constructed in the subdivision or planned unit development is greater than the
donations made upon approval of the development. The subdivider or
developer may file a written appeal for a partial refund of donations when the
residence size for the number of dwelling units actually constructed is less than
that used to calculate the donations.
C. APPROVAL: Prior to consideration of a final plat of subdivision or planned unit
development by the Corporate Authorities, the Plan Commission, Park Board,
Site Plan Review Board and School Districts shall make a recommendation
regarding whether the donation should be land, cash in-lieu of land, or a
combination of both. The recommending Boards, Commission and Districts
shall base their recommendation on the criteria established in the specific

regulations of this Chapter.
7-7-3: INDEMNIFICATION AND COVENANT NOT TO SUE:
The Village is not obligated to cause the payment of money or the transference
of land to School Districts, or other Districts that could benefit from donations
made by developers and subdividers. Therefore any School District, Library
District and any other District for which donation is collected by the Village for
said District's use recognizes that the Village may, at its sole discretion, amend
its ordinances or annexation agreements or its practices so as to discontinue
the payment of donations to the said District(s), and, as a condition of receiving
donations hereunder, agrees to indemnify and hold harmless the Village from
any loss, claims, debts, causes of actions or liabilities of every kind incurred by
the Village as either a direct or indirect result of the passage of this Chapter,
the administration or enforcement thereof, or the failure to administer or
enforce the same including any incurred as a result of a lawsuit brought or
threatened by any such District. The Village shall undertake the defense
against any suit or claim, subject to indemnification and reimbursement of fees
and costs from the Districts whose donations are involved or gave rise to the
claim or suit. The costs of said defense shall be borne proportionately by all
Districts whose donations are involved, concerned or gave rise to the suit or
claim, and shall be paid promptly upon billing.
In the event that a final determination is made by a court of competent
jurisdiction that contributions of land or money received by the District(s)
receiving the donation(s) are, in whole or in part, excessive, the receiving
District(s) shall promptly repay to the person who procures such a judgement
against the Village or the District(s), together with such other amounts judged

8-2-3: WATER AND SANITARY SEWER CONNECTIONS REQUIRED:
See Title 5, Chapter 6 of this Village Code.
VILLAGE OF LINCOLNSHIRE TITLE 8-2: VILLAGE WATER AND SEWER REGULATIONS
Revised 12/14/15 Page 4
Every building within the Village not connected to the Village water system on
the effective date of this Ordinance shall connect to the Village water system
within one hundred twenty (120) days of the date a service water main first
comes within one hundred fifty (150) feet of a boundary line of the lot or parcel
on which the building is located, unless a valid variance postponing connection
of the lot or parcel to the Village water system has been granted, in which
event connection shall be made within one hundred twenty (120) days after the
expiration of the variance. The Village water main must be extended from its
existing terminus (i.e., within one hundred fifty (150) feet from the lot or parcel)
to the far boundary line of the lot or parcel on which the building is located in
the process of providing water from the Village water system to the building.
Upon connection of the building to the Village water system, all existing wells
or private water support piping shall be disconnected from the potable water
piping of the building.
A Except on any lot or parcel no boundary line of which lies within one hundred
fifty (150) feet of a Village service water main and except on any lot or parcel
governed by a variance granted by the Village Board permitting postponement
of connection to the Village water system, no private well or individual water
supply system shall be constructed, installed or used in the Village for potable
water supply and/or use in a buildings= plumbing system.
B. On any lot or parcel within the Village which has a structure connected to the
Village water system, the use of wells shall be restricted as follows:
1. On any lot or parcel within the Village, a previously existing well may be
used solely for the purposes of:
a. Irrigation; or
b. Replacement of water lost by evaporation and/or percolation
from a private decorative pond, which pond shall not exceed ten
(10) percent of the total lot or parcel size exclusive of required
yard areas, and
c. Said pond shall not be located in an easement, required yard, or
conservancy area and shall be primarily for ornamental
purposes; and the primary source of water for such pond shall be
from storm water runoff; and
d. The preexisting well in order to be used in conjunction with said
pond shall be limited in capacity to twenty (20) gallons per
minute, shall be limited in depth to the shallow acquifer, shall not
be located within two hundred (200) feet of another shallow well
and shall be subject to all State and County agencies having
jurisdiction over well construction and operation.
VILLAGE OF LINCOLNSHIRE TITLE 8-2: VILLAGE WATER AND SEWER REGULATIONS
Revised 12/14/15 Page 5
2. Only on lots or parcels of three (3) acres or more, on which there is no
previously existing well, one private well may be constructed or installed,
provided that said well shall in addition to being limited in capacity to
twenty (20) gallons per minute and limited in depth to the shallow
acquifer, shall not be located within one thousand (1000) feet of another
shallow well, and the use of said well shall be limited to:
a. Irrigation;
b. Replacing water lost by evaporation and/or percolation from a
private decorative pond, which pond meets the standards set
forth in subsection 1(b), supra; and/or
c. Replacing water lost from a retention / detention basin by
evaporation and percolation. The primary source of water for the
retention / detention basin must be storm water, the sole use of
the basin water external to the basin must be irrigation, and the
basin must be located so as to receive the storm water runoff
from the areas being irrigated.
3. On any lot or parcel involuntarily annexed to the Village, wells preexisting
the annexation may continue to be used for a period not to exceed ten
(10) years from the effective date of the final Village action taken to annex
the lot or parcel to the Village, or the date of approval of this Ordinance,
August 11, 2003, whichever is later, unless the well and/or equipment
necessary for its use earlier ceases to function sufficiently to serve the
water needs of the building and/or to meet health and environmental
regulations, in which case it must be abandoned if a Village service water
main be within one hundred fifty (150) feet of a boundary of the lot or
parcel. These ten (10) year amortization grace periods apply to the lot or
parcel only so long as it continues to be owned by those who owned it on
the date of annexation or the date of approval of this Ordinance, August
11, 2003, whichever is later; a change in ownership obligates the new
owner to connect to a Village service water main existing within one
hundred fifty (150) feet of any boundary line of the lot or parcel within one
hundred twenty (120) days of coming into title.
4. Under no circumstances shall a well or irrigation system be cross
connected to the Village water system or supply.
C. No septic tank, or other individual sewage disposal system shall be
constructed, installed or used in the Village except:
On any lot or parcel zoned R1 Single-Family Residential where a service sewer
main is not within one hundred fifty (150) feet of the lot or parcel and the
VILLAGE OF LINCOLNSHIRE TITLE 8-2: VILLAGE WATER AND SEWER REGULATIONS
Revised 12/14/15 Page 6
installation of said septic tank or disposal system is approved by the Lake
County Board of Health
1. On any lot or parcel zoned F1 Farming serving an individual residence
located on a minimum of five (5) acres of the lot or parcel and the
installation of said septic tank or disposal system is approved by the Lake
County Board of Health.
2. On any lot or parcel involuntarily annexed to the Village, a septic tank or
disposal system approved by the Lake County Board of Health that
preexisted the annexation may continue to be used for ten (10) years
from the effective date of the final Village action to annex the lot or parcel
to the Village, or the date of approval of this Ordinance, August 11, 2003,
whichever is later, provided that if the septic tank and/or disposal system
earlier ceases to function sufficiently to meet health and environmental
regulations, it must be abandoned if a Village service sewer main be
within one hundred fifty (150) feet of a boundary of the lot or parcel.
These ten (10) year amortization grace periods apply to the lot or parcel
only so long as it continues to be owned by those who owned it on the
date of annexation or the date of approval of this Ordinance, August 11,
2003, whichever is later; a change in ownership obligates the new owner
to connect to a Village service sewer main existing within one hundred
fifty (150) feet of any boundary line of the lot or parcel within one hundred
twenty (120) days of coming into title.
D. The right to continue a well and/or septic tank or other individual sewage
disposal system under the terms of this Code Section despite a Village water
main and/or Village sewer main being within one hundred fifty (150) feet of a
boundary of the lot or parcel, as a result of the involuntary annexation of the lot
or parcel, shall terminate, even if the well or septic tank or other individual
sewage disposal remains serviceable if:
1. The building served is being torn down, even if reconstructed, and/or
2. Any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost of
which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the
structure either: (1) before the improvement or repair is started, or (2) if
the structure has been damaged, and is being restored, before the
damage occurred. This subsection does not, however, include either:
a. Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with
existing State of local health, sanitary, or safety code
specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living
conditions, or
b. Any alteration of a structure or site documented as deserving
VILLAGE OF LINCOLNSHIRE TITLE 8-2: VILLAGE WATER AND SEWER REGULATIONS
Revised 12/14/15 Page 7
preservation by the Illinois Department of Conservation or listed
on the National Register of Historic Places.
E. A variance may be granted by the Village Board of Trustees in its discretion for
limited duration, qualified by reasonable terms and conditions established by
the Village Board of Trustees tailored to the circumstances, upon application of
a property owner whose lot or parcel is not already connected to the Village
water system or sanitary system upon a clear showing that complying with the
requirements of this Ordinance would cause an undue hardship, except that no
variance shall be granted where there is a Village service water main and/or a
Village service sewer main within fifty (50) feet of a boundary line of the lot or
parcel, and/or the lot or parcel for which the variance is sought is part of a new
subdivision under development.
1. An application for a variance shall be made jointly by all of the titleholders
of the lot or parcel affected or jointly by the trustee(s) and all beneficiaries
of any land trust in which the lot or parcel affected is held requesting the
variance.
2. The application shall be made on a form provided by the Village which
shall, at a minimum, identify the lot or parcel affected by both its common
address and its legal description, list the names of all titleholders, trustees
and beneficiaries, giving their respective residential addresses and
identifying the interest of each in the lot or parcel affected, state clearly all
of the facts relied on for the claim of hardship giving rise to the request for
variance and the exact variance relief requested from the Village Board
(e.g., terms, conditions, duration of variance). The application shall be
filed with the Village Manager or his or her designee.
3. The Village shall publish a notice of hearing on the application for
variance in a newspaper of general circulation within the Village at least
once not more than thirty (30) nor less than fifteen (15) days before the
hearing on the application for variance to be held before the Village Board
or its designee, which notice shall name the applicants, identify the lot or
parcel by its common address and legal description, set forth the stated
grounds given for the claim of hardship and give the time and place of the
hearing on the application for variance.
4. At the time and place noticed, an evidentiary hearing shall be held before
the Village Board or its designee at which time proof of the stated
grounds for hardship shall be made by competent evidence and
testimony for and against the variance shall be made under oath and
subject to cross-examination.
5. A variance may be granted only if the record of evidence received at
hearing has established to the satisfaction of the Village Board that a
VILLAGE OF LINCOLNSHIRE TITLE 8-2: VILLAGE WATER AND SEWER REGULATIONS
Revised 12/14/15 Page 8
hardship on the applicant(s) has been established and that the hardship is
not outweighed by inconvenience and/or health, safety and welfare
concerns of the public. In reaching its conclusion, the Village Board shall
consider, and its decision must be consistent with, the following
standards:
a. Because of the particular legal, practical, topographical or
physical conditions of the property surrounding the specific lot or
parcel involved, a particular hardship to the owner would result,
as distinguished from a mere inconvenience if the strict letter of
the regulations were to be carried out;
b. The conditions upon which an application for a variance is based
are unique to the lot or parcel for which the variance is sought, or
its owner(s), and are not applicable generally to other property or
owners within the same area;
c. The purpose of the variance is not based primarily upon a desire
to minimize financial burden;
d. The alleged difficulty or hardship is caused by this Title and has
not been created by any persons presently having an interest in
the lot or parcel;
e. The granting of the variance will not be detrimental to the public
welfare or injurious to other property or improvements in the
neighborhood in which the lot or parcel is located; and
f. The granting of the variance will not impair the availability of a
healthy drinking water supply or a safe and healthy sewage
disposal system to the lot or parcel for which application for
variance is made and/or neighboring properties.
6. The variance may be granted by single majority of the Village Board and
shall be given in writing specifying the lot or parcel to which it is applicable
and setting forth all the terms and conditions to which it is subject and the
date of expiration.
F. Temporary sewage disposal systems, such as portable potties, are permissible
for special events and similar temporary occasions with permission of the
Village Manager or his or her designee.(Ord. 03-1858-35, eff. 8/11/03)
8-2-3-1: WATER AND SANITARY SEWER CONNECTIONS, PROPERTIES
LOCATED OUTSIDE VILLAGE LIMITS:
A. Annexation Agreement Required. Any owner(s) of property located outside the
VILLAGE OF LINCOLNSHIRE TITLE 8-2: VILLAGE WATER AND SEWER REGULATIONS
Revised 12/14/15 Page 9
Village limits who desires to connect his or her property to the Village=s water
or sanitary sewer system or to both systems must apply to the Board of
Trustees for permission to make any such connection(s). The owner(s) shall
make application on a form to be provided by the Village. The owner(s) shall
agree that they will not voluntarily annex to any other municipality so long as
they are obligated hereby to annex to the Village.
1. Property Contiguous to the Village. The Board of Trustees shall not grant
permission to make any such connection(s) to any owner whose property
is contiguous to the Village unless and until the owner(s) files an
unconditional petition to annex his or her property to the Village. The
Village shall not be required to permit such annexation and may include
conditions of annexation in any Annexation Agreement.
2. Property Not Currently Contiguous to the Village. The Board of Trustees
shall not grant permission to make any such connection(s) to any
owner(s) whose property is not contiguous to the Village at the time of the
filing of the application unless and until the owner(s) enters into a written
agreement with the Village, in the form approved by the Village, to file an
unconditional petition to annex the property to the Village at the time that
the property becomes contiguous to the Village. The Village shall not be
required to accept such annexation at the time the property becomes
eligible for annexation and may include conditions of annexation in any
Annexation Agreement.
At a minimum, any Annexation Agreement shall require that security for
the installation and maintenance shall be provided as required by the
Village Subdivision Code and any water or sewer system must be
extended to the far property line of the property to be served.
3. Property Subject to an Intergovernmental Agreement. The remainder of
this Section 8-2-3-1 shall not apply to any property located outside the
Villages corporate limits for which an intergovernmental agreement
either:
a. Requires the Village to make water and/or sanitary sewer service
available to such property; or
b. Prohibits the subject property from annexing to any municipality
other than the Village
The owner of each property to which this paragraph (3) applies
must apply to the Board of Trustees for permission to make any
such connections(s). The owner(s) shall make applications on a
form to be provided by the Village.
VILLAGE OF LINCOLNSHIRE TITLE 8-2: VILLAGE WATER AND SEWER REGULATIONS
Revised 12/14/15 Page 10
B. Service For More Than One Single Family Residence. The foregoing
notwithstanding, the Village shall not approve any agreement to provide
water or sewer service outside of the Village limits for any commercial
enterprise or for any single family development of more than one dwelling
unit except as follows:
1. A public hearing is held before the Village Board on the issue of providing
such service; and
2. The issuance by the Village Board of a Certificate of Necessity approved
by a vote of 3/4 of the members of the Village Board then holding office
based upon findings of fact considering the following matters:
a. Will the failure to permit the connection to Village facilities result
in some negative impact to the Village or its residents (such as
the destruction of trees, the use of septic systems in an area
where such system is not desirable, the use of a non-municipal
sewerage system that is substandard or other health, safety or
aesthetic matters)?; and
b. In light of the potential for future annexation, will the provision of
such sewer and/or water service enable the Village to assure a
development that is compatible with the Village=s comprehensive
plan and adjacent Village development?
For purposes of this Subsection B, a property shall be deemed to
be being developed for more than one unit if, considering the
current or potential future zoning , the Village Manager is of the
opinion that the property for which service is sought is capable of
division into more than one building lot. The Village Manager
may make such determination even if only one building permit is
currently contemplated.
C. Government Bodies. The Board of Trustees may grant permission to other
governmental bodies which serve other municipalities in addition to the Village
to connect to the Village=s water and/or sanitary sewer systems without
annexation if presently contiguous or without entering into a written agreement
with the Village to annex the property at the time that said property becomes
contiguous to the Village. If permission is granted by the Board of Trustees for
such a connection, all out-of-pocket costs to the Village and all other expenses
necessary to make the connection shall be borne by the governmental body
requesting the connection. The permission to allow the connection to the
Village=s water and/or sanitary sewer systems by another governmental body
shall remain in effect as long as that governmental body remains in
unincorporated Lake County. When and if said governmental body annexes to
any other municipality, other than the Village, the water and/or sanitary sewer
VILLAGE OF LINCOLNSHIRE TITLE 8-2: VILLAGE WATER AND SEWER REGULATIONS
Revised 12/14/15 Page 11
connection will be disconnected and all costs for said disconnection shall be
borne by the governmental body which requested said connection. All
associated fees shall be paid by the governmental body requesting the
connection in accordance with the requirements in this Village Code. (Ord. 01-
1773-31, eff. 7/9/01)
8-2-3-2: SANITARY SEWERS, PROHIBITED CONNECTIONS AND FLOWS:
A. It is the purpose of this Section that the entry of extraneous flows of
whatsoever nature into the sanitary sewer system of the Village be prohibited
and be discontinued, whether such entry may be occurring accidentally or
knowingly. Extraneous flows are those flows other than domestic sewage or
industrial waste, including, without limiting the generality of the foregoing,
ground waters, surface waters, storm waters, spring waters and other drainage
or clear waters. Only sewage shall be permitted to enter into said sanitary
sewer system.
B. Prohibited Acts:

special agreement or arrangement between the Village and any industrial
concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be
accepted by the Village for treatment, subject to payment therefor, in
accordance with applicable Village provisions by the industrial concern,
provided such payments are in accordance with Federal and State guidelines
for user charge system and industrial cost recovery system. (Ord. 78-524-13)
D. Grease, oil and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the
Village, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing
grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes, sand, or other harmful
ingredients; except that such interceptors shall not be required for private living
quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity
approved by the Village, and shall be located as to be readily and easily
accessible for cleaning and inspection.

samples taken at said control manhole. In the event that no special manhole
has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest
downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building
sewer is connected. Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted
methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon the sewage works and to
determine the existence of hazards to life, limb, and property. The particular
analysis involved will determine whether a twenty- four (24) hour composite of
all outfalls of a premise is appropriate or whether a grab sample or samples
should be taken. Normally, but not always, a BOD and suspended solids
analysis are obtained from twenty-four (24) hour composites of all outfalls,
whereas pH's are determined from periodic grab samples. (Ord. 78-535-25)

B. Duration: No permit issued to a utility shall be valid for a period longer than six (6) months
unless construction is actually begun within that period and is thereafter diligently pursued to
completion. Collocation of small wireless facilities must be completed within 180 days after the
issuance of the permit. If collocation is not complete, the permit will be void. Permits for small
wireless facilities are valid for 5 years from the time of issuance.
C. Pre-construction meeting required: No construction shall begin pursuant to a permit issued
under this Chapter prior to attendance by the permittee and all major contractors and
subcontractors who will perform any work under the permit at a pre-construction meeting. The
pre-construction meeting shall be held at a date, time and place designated by the Village with

such Village representatives in attendance as the Village deems necessary. The meeting shall
be for the purpose of reviewing the work under the permit, and reviewing special considerations
necessary in the areas where work will occur, including, without limitation, presence or absence
of other facilities in the area and their locations, procedures to avoid disruption of other utilities,
use of rights-of-way by the public during construction, and access and egress by adjacent
property owners.
D. Compliance with All Laws Required: The issuance of a permit by the Village does not excuse
the permittee from complying with other requirements of the Village and applicable statutes,
laws, ordinances, rules, and regulations.
8-6-7: Revised Permit Drawings:
In the event that the actual locations of any facilities deviate in any material respect from the
locations identified in the plans, drawings and specifications submitted with the permit
application, the permittee shall submit a revised set of drawings or plans to the Village within
ninety (90) days after the completion of the permitted work. The revised drawings or plans shall
specifically identify where the locations of the actual facilities deviate from the locations
approved in the permit. If any deviation from the permit also deviates from the requirements of
this Chapter, it shall be treated as a request for variance in accordance with Section 8-6-21 of
this Chapter. If the Village denies the request for a variance, then the permittee shall either
remove the facility from the right-of-way or modify the facility so that it conforms to the permit
and submit revised drawings or plans therefore.
8-6-8: Annual Recurring Rates for Small Wireless Facilities:
The Village shall charge an annual recurring rate for the collocation of small wireless facilities
on municipally-owned infrastructure located in its right-of-way equal to either the rate
established in Title 1, Chapter 15 per utility pole, or the actual, direct, and reasonable costs
related to the wireless providers use of space on the Village utility pole, whichever is greater. If
the Village elects to charge the actual, direct, and reasonable costs related to the wireless
providers use of space on the municipally-owned infrastructure, it shall adopt a fee schedule on
an annual basis.
8-6-9: Insurance:
A. Required Coverages and Limits: Unless otherwise provided by franchise, license, or similar
agreement, each wireless provider or utility occupying right-of-way or constructing any
facility in the right-of-way shall secure and maintain the following liability insurance policies

1. The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of this Chapter;
2. Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the Village occasioned by the
permittees failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations, orders, permits
and other directives of the Village issued pursuant to this Chapter; and
3. The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims, costs, or
expenses that the Village may pay or incur by reason of any action or nonperformance
by permittee in violation of this Chapter including, without limitation,
any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee is required by
this Chapter to perform that the Village must perform itself or have completed as
a consequence solely of the permittee=s failure to perform or complete, and all
other payments due the Village from the permittee pursuant to this Chapter or
any other applicable law.
B. Form: The permittee shall provide the Security Fund to the Village in the form, at the
permittees election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable to the Village, or an
unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the Village. Any surety bond or letter of
credit provided pursuant to this Subsection shall, at a minimum:
1. Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the Village and the
permittee;
2. Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by the Village of
any amounts covered by it; and
3. Shall provide a location convenient to the Village and within the State of Illinois
at which it can be drawn.
C. Amount: The dollar amount of the Security Fund shall be sufficient to provide for the reasonably
estimated cost to restore the right-of-way to at least as good a condition as that existing prior to
the construction under the permit, as determined by the Village Engineer or his or her designee,
and may also include reasonable, directly related costs that the Village estimates are likely to be
incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the construction of facilities
proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple locations in the Village, with
each phase consisting of construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations,
and where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to substantial completion
of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the Village Engineer or his or her designee may,
in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the permittee to post a single amount of security which
shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under the permit. The amount of the

been required under the provisions of this Subsection (c) for any single phase.
D. Withdrawals: The Village, upon fourteen (14) days advance written notice clearly stating the
reason for, and its intention to exercise withdrawal rights under this Subsection, may withdraw
an amount from the Security Fund, provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the Village
for such amount within the fourteen (14) day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the
permittee:
1. Fails to make any payment required to be made by the permittee hereunder;
2. Fails to pay any liens relating to the facilities that are due and unpaid;
3. Fails to reimburse the Village for any damages, claims, costs or expenses which
the Village has been compelled to pay or incur by reason of any action or nonperformance
by the permittee; or
4. Fails to comply with any provision of this Chapter that the Village determines can
be remedied by an expenditure of an amount in the Security Fund.
E. Replenishment: Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written notice from the Village that
any amount has been withdrawn from the Security Fund, the permittee shall restore the Security
Fund to the amount specified in Subsection c) of this Section.
F. Interest: The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued on the amount in the
Security Fund be returned to the permittee by the Village, upon written request for said
withdrawal to the Village, provided that any such withdrawal does not reduce the Security Fund
below the minimum balance required in Subsection c) of this Section.
G. Closing and Return of Security Fund: Upon completion of the work authorized under the permit,
the permittee shall be entitled to the return of the Security Fund, or such portion thereof as
remains on deposit, within a reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to
compensate the Village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this Chapter
or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit, the Security Fund, and any
and all accrued interest therein, shall become the property of the Village to the extent necessary
to cover any reasonable costs, loss or damage incurred by the Village as a result of said
revocation, provided that any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be
refunded to the permittee.

5. Underground Power or Communication Facility. An underground power or
communication facility may cross a highway only if:
i. The design materials and construction methods will provide maximum
maintenance-free service life; and
ii. Capacity for the utility=s foreseeable future expansion needs is provided in
the initial installation.
6. Markers. The Village may require the utility to provide a marker at each right-ofway
line where an underground facility other than a power or communication
facility crosses a highway. Each marker shall identify the type of facility, the
utility, and an emergency phone number. Markers may also be eliminated as
provided in current Federal regulations. (49 C.F.R. '192.707 (1989)).
D. Facilities to be Located Within Particular Rights-of-Way: The Village may require that facilities
be located within particular rights-of-way that are not highways, rather than within particular
highways.

Revised 05/29/2018 Page 27
specific utility pole or category of poles. However, should the application
necessitate the installation of a new utility pole, the Village may propose that
the small wireless facility be collocated on an existing utility pole or existing
support structure within 100 feet of the proposed collocation. Should the
applicant reject the proposed relocated collocation, it must provide a written
certification describing the property rights, technical limits or material cost
reasons the alternative location will not satisfy the wireless providers needs.
The Village may require any monopole, utility pole or other freestanding
facility located within a right-of-way to be screened from view in compliance
with the appearance standards described below.
ii. If all existing monopoles, utility poles and other aboveground facilities are
located on one side of the right-of-way, all new monopoles, utility poles and
other freestanding facilities shall be located on the same side of the right-ofway
as the existing aboveground facilities. If there exist above ground
facilities on both sides, new freestanding facilities shall be located on the
side where the above ground facilities most closely match the scale of the
new freestanding facility.
2. Other Facilities.
i. The Village may restrict the location and size of any monopole, utility pole or
other freestanding facility located within a right-of-way. No freestanding
facility located within a right-of-way may be constructed or modified so that
the height of the free standing facility is higher by more than ten feet or more
than 10%, whichever is greater, than any other existing, freestanding facility
located within the right-of-way within three hundred (300) feet of the
proposed facility, measured along the center line of the respective right-ofway.
Where there are no other freestanding facilities located within three
hundred (300) feet of the proposed facility, the maximum height of the
freestanding facility shall be forty five (45) feet.
ii. The Village may require any monopole, utility pole or other freestanding

wherever possible by means such as rust removal, calking, limited paint
removal and reapplication of paint.
4. General Design Standards.
Applicability: These design standards apply to all small wireless facilities:
a. All small wireless facilities not governed by the preceding design standards
must be placed so as to minimize visibility. The small wireless facility,
including all ancillary equipment and appurtenances, must be a color that
blends with the surroundings of the utility pole or municipally-owned
infrastructure on which it is mounted and use non-reflective materials which
blend with the materials and colors of the surrounding area and structures.
Any wiring must be concealed within the freestanding facility or covered with
an appropriate cover.
b. The Village may discourage the installation of facilities in particular locations
in order to preserve visual quality.
c. A facility may be constructed only if its construction does not require
extensive removal or alteration of trees or terrain features visible to the rightof-

a variance only if the utility requesting the variance has demonstrated that:
1. One or more conditions not under the control of the utility (such as terrain
features or an irregular right-of-way line) create a special hardship that would
make enforcement of the provision unreasonable, given the public purposes to
be achieved by the provision; and
2. All other designs, methods, materials, locations or facilities that would conform
with the provision from which a variance is requested are impracticable in
relation to the requested approach.
D. Additional Conditions for Granting of a Variance: As a condition for authorizing a variance, the
Village Engineer or his or her designee may require the utility requesting the variance to meet
reasonable standards and conditions that may or may not be expressly contained within this
Chapter but which carry out the purposes of this Chapter.

D. A person commits an offense if the person operates a facility that is
discharging storm water associated with industrial activity without having
submitted a copy of the Notice of Intent to do so to the Village.
8-7-10: MONITORING OF DISCHARGES:
A. Applicability: This section applies to all facilities that have storm water
discharges to the storm drainage system or associated with construction or
industrial activity.
B. Access To Facilities:
1. The Authorized Enforcement Agency shall be permitted during the
discharger=s regular operating hours to enter and inspect premises
subject to regulation under this Chapter and to inspect and copy any
relevant records, at its own expense, as often as may be necessary to
determine compliance with this article. If a discharger has security
measures in force that require proper identification and clearance before
entry into its premises, then the discharger shallmake the necessary and
reasonable arrangements to allow access to representatives of the
Authorized Enforcement Agency, except in case of emergency. Access to
the premises shall not be unduly withheld.
2. Facility operators shall allow the Authorized Enforcement Agency ready
access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection,
sampling, examination, and copying of records that must be kept under
the conditions of an NPDES permit to discharge storm water, and the
performance of any additional duties as defined by state and federal law.
3. The Authorized Enforcement Agency shall have the right to set up on any
permitted facility such devices as are necessary in the opinion of the
Authorized Enforcement Agency to conduct monitoring and/or sampling
of the facility's storm water discharge.
4. The Authorized Enforcement Agency has the right to require the
VILLAGE OF LINCOLNSHIRE TITLE 8-7: REGULATIONS FOR DISCHARGES INTO STORM WATER DRAINAGE SYSTEM
Revised 03/22/10 Page 10
discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's
sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a
safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own expense.
All devices used to measure storm water flow and quality shall be
calibrated to ensure their accuracy.
5. Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the
facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the
operator at the written or oral request of the Authorized Enforcement
Agency and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access
shall be borne by the operator.
6. Unreasonable delay in allowing the Authorized Enforcement Agency
access to a permitted facility is a violation of a storm water discharge
permit and of this article. A person who is the operator of a facility with an
NPDES permit to discharge storm water associated with construction or
industrial activity commits an offense if the person denies the Authorized
Enforcement Agency reasonable access to the permitted facility for the
purpose of conducting any activity authorized or required by this article.
7. If the Authorized Enforcement Agency has been refused access to any
part of the premises from which storm water is discharged, and he or she
is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a
violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as
part of a routine inspection and sampling programs designed to verify
compliance with this article or any order issued hereunder, or to protect
the overall public health, safety, and welfare of the community, then the
Authorized Enforcement Agencymay seek issuance of a search warrant

or industrial establishment will provide, at its own expense, reasonable
protection from accidental discharge of pollutants or other wastes into the
municipal storm drainage system or watercourses through the use of these
structural or nonstructural BMPs. Further, any person responsible for a
property or premises, which is, or may be, the source of an illicit discharge,
may be required to implement, at said people=s expense, additional structural
and nonstructural BMPs to prevent the further discharge of pollutants to the

conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing the discharge of storm water
associated with industrial activity, to the extent practicable, shall be deemed
compliance with the provisions of this section. These BMPs shall be part of a
Storm Water Pollution Prevention Pan (SWPP) as necessary for compliance
with requirements of the NPDES permit. (Ord. 05-1957-21, eff. 3/14/05)

the watercourse. In addition, the owner or lessee shall maintain existing
privately owned structures within or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such
structures will not become a hazard to the use, function, or physical integrity of
the watercourse. (Ord. 05-1957-21, eff. 3/14/05)
8-7-13: NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS:

into storm water, the storm drainage system, or water of the United States said
person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the discovery, containment,
and cleanup of such release. In the event of such a release of hazardous
materials said person shall immediately notify emergency response agencies
of the occurrence via emergency dispatch services. In the event of a release of
nonhazardous materials, said person shall notify the Authorized Enforcement
Agency in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next business
day. Notifications in person or by phone shall be confirmed by written notice

3. Any motor vehicle bearing registration plates or a special decal or device
specified in this Section or in Section 3-616 of the IVC or such parking
device as specifically authorized in Section 11-1301.2 of the IVC, as

VILLAGE OF LINCOLNSHIRE TITLE 10-01: ENFORCEMENT OF TRAFFIC REGULATIONS
Revised 10/27/14 Page 12
official sign as provided under Section 11-301 of the IVC.
4. Parking privileges granted by this Section are strictly limited to the person

person with disabilities is present. A person to whom privileges were
granted shall at the request of a police officer or any other person invested
by law with authority to direct, control, or regulate traffic, present an
identification card with a picture as verification that the person is the person
to whom the special registration plates, special decal or device was issued.

a. The Secretary of State shall provide for, by administrative rules, the
design, size, color, and placement of a person with disabilities

issuance thereof to a person with disabilities, provided that the decal
or device is valid for no more then 90 days, subject to renewal for like
periods based upon continued disability for periods not longer than
one (1) year, and further provided that the decal or device clearly sets
forth the date that the decal or device expires. The application shall
include the requirement of an Illinois Identification Card number or a
State of Illinois driver=s license number. This decal or device shall be
the property of such person with disabilities and may be used by that
person to designate and identify a vehicle not owned or displaying
registration plates as provided in Sections 3-609 and 3-616 of the IVC
to designate when the vehicle is being used to transport said person
or persons with disabilities, and thus is entitled to enjoy all the
privileges that would be afforded a person with a disabilities licensed
vehicle. Any Person with disabilities decals or devices issued and
displayed pursuant to Section 1303.3 of the IVC shall be recognized
and honored by the Village regardless of which local authority issued
such decal or device. One additional decal or device may be issued
VILLAGE OF LINCOLNSHIRE TITLE 10-01: ENFORCEMENT OF TRAFFIC REGULATIONS

or device is to be used has a temporary disability as defined in
Section 1-159.1 of the IVC.

devices if the original is lost, stolen or destroyed, as established in the
Comprehensive Fee Schedule set forth in Chapter 15 of Title 1 of this
Code.

displaying registration plates or decals issued to a person with
disabilities, as defined by Section 1-159.1 of the IVC, pursuant to
Sections 3-616, 11-1301.1 or 11-1301.2 of the IVC or to a disabled
veteran pursuant to Section 3-609 of the IVC, as evidence that the
vehicle is operated by or for a person with disabilities or disabled

motor vehicle in a designated access aisle adjacent to any parking
place specifically reserved for persons with disabilities, by the posting

parking privileges for persons with disabilities, the parking decal or
device must be displayed properly in the vehicle where it is clearly
visible to law enforcement personnel, either hanging from the rearview
mirror or placed on the dashboard of the vehicle in clear view. Any

10-1-13-3: SEIZURE AND IMPOUNDMENT:
VILLAGE OF LINCOLNSHIRE TITLE 10-01: ENFORCEMENT OF TRAFFIC REGULATIONS
Revised 10/27/14 Page 40
A. Whenever a Police Officer has reason to believe that a vehicle is subject to
seizure and impoundment pursuant to this Section, the Police Officer shall
provide for the towing of the vehicle to a facility approved by the Chief of
Police. This Section shall not apply if the vehicle used in the violation was
stolen at that time and the theft was reported to the appropriate police
authorities within 24 hours after the theft was discovered or reasonably should
have been discovered.
B. The Police Officer shall notify any person identifying himself as the owner of
the vehicle or any person who is found to be in control of the vehicle at the time
of the alleged violation, if there is such a person, of the fact of the seizure and
of the vehicle owner=s right to request an administrative hearing to be
conducted under this Section.
10-1-13-4: ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING:
A. At the time a vehicle is seized and towed or impounded under the conditions
set forth in Section 10-13-2 of this Code, the person in control of the vehicle
shall be provided with a "Rights Pursuant to Notice of Vehicle Seizure" form.
This form details the conditions causing the vehicle seizure and instructions on
how to arrange for the return of the vehicle and how to request an
Administrative Hearing to contest the seizure and tow. Upon payment of the
penalty fee, the owner of the seized vehicle will be provided instructions on
how to request a Hearing and must sign a non-binding "Penalty/Bond Sheet"
receipt either requesting a Hearing or forfeiting a right to a Hearing. Copies of
both forms will be provided to the driver/owner of the seized vehicle at the time
of the seizure and penalty payment, or within a reasonable time period
thereafter.
The owner of the record seeking a Hearing must file a written request for a
Hearing with the Village Manager or his designee no later than ten (10)
business days after notice was provided in either written and/or verbal form.
The Hearing date must be no more than ten (10) business days after a request
for a Hearing has been filed.
B. All interested persons shall be given a reasonable opportunity to be heard at
the hearing. The formal rules of evidence shall not apply at the hearing and
hearsay evidence shall be admissible. In a hearing on the propriety of
impoundment of a vehicle any sworn or affirmed report, citation or ticket that (i)
is prepared in the performance of a law enforcement officer=s duties and (ii)
sufficiently describes the circumstances leading to the impoundment, shall be
admissible evidence of the vehicle owner=s liability, unless rebutted by clear
VILLAGE OF LINCOLNSHIRE TITLE 10-01: ENFORCEMENT OF TRAFFIC REGULATIONS
Revised 10/27/14 Page 41
and convincing evidence to the contrary.
C. If, after the hearing, the Hearing Officer determines by a preponderance of
evidence that the vehicle was used in violation of the Section, the Hearing
Officer shall then enter an order finding the owner of record of the vehicle civilly
liable to the Village for the administrative penalty.
D. If, after a hearing, the Hearing Officer does not determine by a preponderance
of the evidence that the vehicle was used in such a violation, the Hearing
Officer shall enter an order finding for the owner and for the return of the
vehicle.
E. If the owner of record requests a hearing but fails to appear at the hearing or
fails to request a hearing in a timely manner, the owner of record shall be
deemed to have waived his or her right to a hearing and the Hearing Officer
shall enter a default order in favor of the Village in the amount of the
administrative penalty.
F. If the owner of record pays such penalty and the vehicle is returned to the
owner, no default order need be entered if the owner is informed of his or her
right to a hearing and signs a written waiver, in which case an order of liability
shall be deemed to have been made when the Village receives the written
waiver.
10-1-13-5: DISPOSITION OF IMPOUNDED VEHICLES:
A. A penalty imposed pursuant to this Section shall constitute a debt due and
owed the Village. A vehicle impounded pursuant to this Section shall remain
impounded until:
1. The fee as established in the Comprehensive Fee Schedule set forth in
Chapter 15 of Title 1 of this Code is paid to the Village and all applicable
towing fees are paid to the towing agent, in which case the owner of
record shall be given possession of the vehicle, or
2. A bond in the amount of the fee as established in the Comprehensive Fee
Schedule set forth in Chapter 15 of Title 1 of this Code is posted with the
Police Department and all applicable towing fees are paid to the towing
agent, at which time the vehicle will be released to the owner of record, or
3. The vehicle is deemed abandoned, in which case the vehicle shall be
VILLAGE OF LINCOLNSHIRE TITLE 10-01: ENFORCEMENT OF TRAFFIC REGULATIONS
Revised 10/27/14 Page 42
disposed of in the manner provided by law for the disposition of
abandoned vehicles.
10-1-13-6: POSTING OF BOND:
A. If a bond is posted with the Police Department, the impounded vehicle shall be
released to the owner of record. The owner of the vehicle shall still be liable to
the towing agent for any applicable towing fees.
B. If a penalty is imposed for violation of this Section, the bond will be forfeited to
the Village; however if a violation of this Section is not proven by a
preponderance of the evidence, the bond will be returned to the person posting
the bond.
C. All bond money posted pursuant to this Section shall be held by the Village
until the Hearing Officer issues a decision, or, if there is a judicial review, until
the court issues its decision.
D. The bond posted will be in the form of cash, money order or certified check.
Credit cards, personal checks, business checks or traveler=s checks will not be
accepted.
10-1-13-7: VEHICLE POSSESSION:
Any motor vehicle that is not reclaimed within 30 days after the expiration of
the time during which the owner of record may seek judicial review of the
Village=s action under this Section, or the time at which a final judgment is
rendered in favor of the Village, or the time a final administrative decision is
rendered against an owner of record who is in default, may be disposed of as
an unclaimed or abandoned vehicle as provided by law, provided, however,
that where proceedings have been instituted under state or federal drug asset
forfeiture laws, the subject vehicle may not be disposed of by the Village
except as consistent with those proceedings.
10-1-14: PENALTY:
Any violation of said provisions of the Illinois Vehicle Code shall hereinafter be
considered a violation of this Chapter and each such violation shall subject the
violator thereof to the penalty provisions provided in the Illinois Vehicle Code or
where superseded by the Comprehensive Fine/Penalty Schedule in Chapter
17, of Title 1 of this Code.

VILLAGE OF LINCOLNSHIRE TITLE 11-01: CRIMINAL ACT AND MENTAL STATE
Revised 12/13/10 Page 1
CHAPTER 1
CRIMINAL ACT AND MENTAL STATE
SECTION:
11-1-1: Voluntary Act
11-1-2: Possession as Voluntary Act
11-1-3: Mental State
11-1-4: Intent
11-1-5: Knowledge
11-1-6: Recklessness
11-1-7: Negligence
11-1-8: Ignorance or Mistake
11-1-9: Absolute Liability
11-1-1: VOLUNTARY ACT:
Unless it is stated otherwise, amaterial element of every offense is a voluntary
act, which includes an omission to perform a duty which the law imposes on
the offender and which the offender is physically capable of performing.
11-1-2: POSSESSION AS VOLUNTARY ACT:
Possession is a voluntary act if the offender knowingly procured or received
the thing possessed, or was aware of having control over the thing for a
sufficient time to have been able to terminate possession.
11-1-3: MENTAL STATE:
A. A person is not guilty of an offense, other than an offense which involves
absolute liability, unless, with respect to each element described by the section
defining the offense, the person acts while having one of the mental states
described in Sections 11-1-4 through 11-1-7.
B. If the section defining an offense prescribes a particular mental state with
respect to the offense as a whole, without distinguishing among the elements
thereof, the prescribed mental state applies to each element. If the section

does not prescribe a particular mental state applicable to an element of an
offense (other than an offense which involves absolute liability), any mental
state defined in Sections 11-1-4, 11-1-5 or 11-1-6 is applicable.
C. Knowledge that certain conduct constitutes an offense, or knowledge of the

credit union, or other depository of money, or medium of savings and
collective investment.
2. An account holder is any person having a checking account or savings
account in a financial institution.
3. To act with the "intent to defraud" means to act willfully, and with the
specific intent to deceive or cheat, for the purpose of causing financial
loss to another, or to bring some financial gain to oneself. It is not
necessary to establish that any person was actually defrauded or
deceived.
B. General Deception: A person commits a deceptive practice when, with intent
to defraud:
1. With the intent to obtain control over property or to pay for property, labor
or services of another of less than one hundred fifty dollars ($150.00), he
or she issues or delivers a check or other order upon a real or fictitious
depository for the payment of money, knowing that it will not be paid by
the depository. Failure to have sufficient funds or credit with the
depository when the check or other order is issued or delivered, or when
such check or other order is presented for payment and dishonored on
each of two (2) occasions at least seven (7) days apart, is prima facie
evidence that the offender knows that it will not be paid by the depository,
and that he has the intent to defraud.
2. He issues or delivers a check or other order upon a real or fictitious

depository in the face amount of the check or order within seven (7) days
of receiving actual notice from the depository or payee of the dishonor of
the check or order.

material or the circumstances of its dissemination to be specially designed for
or directed to such an audience.
Where circumstances of production, presentation, sale, dissemination,
distribution, or publicity indicate that material is being commercially exploited
for the sake of its prurient appeal, such evidence is probative with respect to
the nature of thematter and can justify the conclusion that thematter is lacking
in serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.
In any prosecution for an offense under this Section, evidence shall be
admissible to show:
1. The character of the audience for which the material was designed or to
which it was directed;
VILLAGE OF LINCOLNSHIRE TITLE 11-11: SEX OFFENSES

children under eighteen (18) years of age;
2. Was to institutions or individuals having scientific or other special
justification for possession of such material.

child's age if the person actually knows the age or fails to exercise reasonable
care in ascertaining the child's true age.

standards, its predominant appeal, taken as a whole, is prurient interest,
that is a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex, or excretion, which
VILLAGE OF LINCOLNSHIRE TITLE 11-11: SEX OFFENSES
Revised 01/07/97 Page 5
goes substantially beyond customary limits of candor in description or
representation of such matter, and is material the redeeming social
importance of which is substantially less than its prurient appeal.

other representation or embodiment.

consideration.

C. Interpretation of Evidence: The predominant appeal to prurient interest of the
material shall be judged with reference to average children of the same
general age of the child to whom suchmaterial was offered, distributed, sent or
exhibited, unless it appears from the nature of thematter or the circumstances
of its dissemination, distribution or exhibition that it is designed for specially
susceptible groups, in which case the predominant appeal of thematerial shall
be judged with reference to its intended or probable recipient group.
In prosecution under this Section, where circumstances of production,
presentation, sale, dissemination, distribution, or publicity indicate thematerial
is being commercially exploited for the sake of its prurient appeal, such
evidence is probative with respect to the nature of the material and can justify
the conclusion that the redeeming social importance of the material is in fact
substantially less than its prurient appeal.

5/11-21(e) of the Illinois Compiled Statutes.

DIMENSION MEASUREMENT
SECTION:
12-7-1 DIMENSION MEASUREMENT
A. Computation of Sign Area
Sign area is calculated as described in this Section.
1. For signs on a background, the entire area of the background shall be calculated for sign
area, including any material or color forming the Sign Face or background used to
differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure against which it is placed. For
Monument Signs, Sign Area includes any supporting framework, bracing or structure.
For all other sign types, Sign Area does not include any supporting framework or bracing,
unless such framework, bracing or structure contains part of the message, Sign Face or
Copy.
2. For a double-post sign, two (2) separate area calculations are necessary, one (1) for the
sign area and one (1) for the total area of the structure including both sign posts. The
sign area includes the entire area of the sign, including any material or color forming the
sign face or background used to differentiate the sign from the backdrop or structure
against which it is placed. Sign area does not include any supporting framework or
bracing, unless such framework or bracing is part of the message or sign face. The area
of the sign structure is calculated by means of the smallest rectangle that will encompass
the extreme limits of the supporting posts, framework or bracing of the sign.

3. For signs consisting of freestanding letters or logos, the area of a sign face (sign area)
is calculated by means of the smallest rectangle that will encompass the extreme limits of
the writing, representation, emblem or other display. Sign area does not include any
supporting framework or bracing, unless such framework or bracing contains part of the
message, Sign Face or Copy.
4. The sign area of free-form or sculptural (non-planar) signs is calculated as fifty percent
(50%) of the sum of the area of the four (4) vertical sides of the smallest cube that will
encompass the sign.
5. For a Double-Faced Sign, the sign area is computed as the area of one (1) face only. For
a Sign where the angle between two (2) sign faces is greater than 30 degrees (30?), the
sign area is computed as the sum of the areas of the two (2) faces.

SIGN CONSTRUCTION AND DESIGN: GENERAL STANDARDS
SECTION:
12-8-1 SIGN CONSTRUCTION AND DESIGN: GENERAL STANDARDS
The following standards apply to all signs, unless specifically noted otherwise.
A. Location
1. Only signs placed by federal, state and/or local government may be erected upon public
property, including but not limited to rights-of-way.
2. No sign mounted on the exterior of a building shall cover any windows, doors or any
architectural building features.
3. All portions of letters/logo shall be a minimum of three (3) feet from the building edge of
any face, roof line, ground line or floor/ceiling/roof/wall lines which separate individual
tenant spaces.
4. On a corner lot, no freestanding sign over two (2) feet tall may be placed within the
visibility triangle. The visibility triangle is an area with one (1) point at the intersection of
the intersecting streets centerlines, and the other two (2) points located on each streets
centerline one-hundred (100) feet away from the intersection of said centerlines. The
clear sight area is illustrated below.

B. Sign Structure and Installation
Supports and braces shall be an integral part of the sign design. Angle irons, chains or wires
used for supports or braces shall be hidden from public view to the extent technically feasible.
C. Wind Pressure and Direct Load
All signs must be designed and constructed to receive dead loads and withstand a wind
speed of no less than ninety (90) miles per hour.
D. Illumination
Any sign illumination, including gooseneck reflectors must be designed, located, shielded and
directed to prevent the casting of glare or direct light upon roadways and surrounding
properties, or to distract the operators of motor vehicle or pedestrians in the public right-ofway.
In the case of internally illuminated signs, the sign face must function as a filter for any
illumination.
1. Illuminated signs located within 120 feet of any dwelling and for which the sign face has a
direct line of sight toward windows of such dwelling shall be turned off and not operated
no later than one oclock (1:00) A.M. or when the premises is no longer open to the
public, whichever is earlier, and may be turned and operated no earlier than when the
premises opens to the public or six oclock (6:00) A.M., whichever is earlier.
Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary, for businesses which are open to the
public 24 hours each day, illuminated signs are not required to be turned off any time the
business remains open. For the purpose of this section D.1, the measurement shall be
from the face of the sign to the nearest façade of the nearest dwelling. Except as
provided in this paragraph, all other signs are not required to be turned off.
2. Lighting for signs shall be in harmony with the signs' and the project's design. If outside
lighting is used, it should be arranged so the light source is shielded from view.
3. The maximum lighting shall be one-half (½) footcandle, as measured at the property line
reflecting from a white background aimed at the face of the sign.
4. All illuminated signs shall be equipped with a safety shut-off switch.
E. Ground Sign Landscaping

following:
1. For every one (1) square foot of gross sign area, there shall be provided a minimum of
two (2) square feet of landscape area.
2. The sign landscape plan must be drawn to scale, and shall show the dimensions of the
proposed landscape area. The sign landscape plan shall provide a species list which
includes the common and scientific name, size, quantity, and period of flowering (annuals
and perennials), for all proposed plant material.
3. The sign landscape plan will utilize a variety of plant types including, but not limited to;
deciduous and evergreen shrubs, annual and perennial plants and grasses, and ground
covers, to achieve both height variation and color interest throughout the four seasons.
Village of Lincolnshire Title 12: Sign Control
Revised 6/10/19 Page 3
Ground signs must be landscaped with small shrubs a minimum of eighteen (18) inches
in height at planting. The remainder of the landscaped area must be planted with
perennials or other groundcover.
4. To provide diversity, at least two (2) different types of plant material must be installed,
excluding turf and annual flowers, provided that at least one plant type shall consist of
evergreen shrubs or groundcovers. If any portion of the required planting area is located
less than fifteen (15) feet from the edge of the street, evergreen shrubs or groundcovers
are not required, but at least three (3) different types of plant material must be installed, one
of which may be annual flowers.
5. In addition to the plantings described above, the sign landscape plan shall also include
soil protection such as, but not limited to, ground cover plants or organic hardwood
mulch. However, no more than twenty-five percent (25%) of the total landscape bed may
be void of plants at any one time.
6. All landscaping must be maintained in good condition, and free and clear of rubbish and
weeds.

All letters, figures, characters or representations, in cut-out or irregular form, maintained in
conjunction with, attached to, or superimposed upon any sign must be safely and securely
built or attached to the sign structure.
H. Items of Information
1. All signs must limit the number of items of information on any single sign face to no more
than two (2) items to prevent traffic hazards for passing motorists and to minimize the
cluttered appearance of signs.
2. Each descriptive or identifying word, set of words, icon, logo, symbol or image on a
sign shall be defined as an item of information. For example, but not in limitation
thereof, each of the following would be one (1) item of information: (a) the name of
the business, even if multiple words, or (b) the business logo. The street number
address of the business is not counted as an item of information. A company
catchphrase or motto may be included on a sign only if it is a part of the legal name
of a business. Products, services, telephone number, or a website address shall not
be permitted as part of the Copy on a permanent sign unless it is part of the legal
name of a business. The prohibition against displaying the names of products or
services shall not apply to Awning/Canopy Signs. Temporary signs shall be exempt
from any limitations on items of information.
Village of Lincolnshire Title 12: Sign Control
Revised 6/10/19 Page 4

1. All signs shall be kept and maintained in a safe, neat and orderly condition and
appearance.
2. The owner and/or lessee of each sign shall maintain such sign to prevent corrosion or
deterioration caused by the weather, age or any other condition, and otherwise to keep
the same in a safe, neat and orderly condition and appearance.
J. Design Criteria
The purpose of these design criteria is to establish a checklist of those items relative to signs
that affect the aesthetics of Lincolnshire's environment. Pertinent to signs is the design of the
sign and its relation to buildings, structures, planting, street furniture and the distance to the
nearest public street.
The following criteria are not intended to restrict imagination, innovation or variety, but rather
to assist in focusing on design principles that can result in creative solutions that will develop
a satisfactory visual appearance within the Village, preserve property values and promote the
public health, safety and welfare.
1. Every sign shall have good scale and proportion in its design and in its visual relationship
to buildings and surroundings.
2. Sign materials, size, color, lettering, location and arrangement shall be an integral part of
site and building design.
Illustration of number of items of information for 12-8-1-H-2

of the area of the wall to which it is attached, including doors and windows, or the
maximum wall sign area listed in Table 3, whichever is less.
Village of Lincolnshire Title 12: Sign Control
Revised 11/11/19 Page 3
2. Wall signs are permitted for each building wall that faces a public street or parking lot, with
no more than one (1) wall sign permitted on any wall, unless permitted by Section 12-9-
1(B)(11) and Section 12-9-1(B)(13). Where there is a secondary customer entrance, an
additional wall sign is permitted but shall be limited to no more than sixteen (16) square feet
and shall only indicate the name of the business and the words entrance, enter or similar
term.
3. The total area of a side wall sign or signs shall not exceed five percent (5%) of the area
of the side façade of the principal building, including doors and windows, or twenty-five
(25) square feet, whichever is less. Any side wall sign must be located facing a side yard
of twelve (12) feet or more in width on the same lot.
4. Wall signs must be safely and securely attached to the building wall. Wall signs must be
affixed flat against the building wall and must not project more than six (6) inches from
the building wall. Illuminated wall signs shall not be permitted to extend more than twelve
(12) inches beyond the sign face or sign structure.
5. No wall sign affixed to a building, including sign support structure, may project beyond the
ends or top of the wall to which it is attached. On buildings existing on the effective date
of this Title, July 1, 2009, a parapet wall must not be constructed for the sole purpose of
increasing the allowable height of a wall sign.
6. Wall signs shall not cover windows, doors or architectural features.
7. For buildings in commercial use, wall signs should be located on the sign frieze, or the
portion of the building immediately above the first floor windows and below the second
floor window sills in the case of a two-story building. For buildings in office use that are
larger than two-stories, wall signs may be located on the top floor of the building no more
than five (5) feet above the windows on the top floor and no portion of such wall sign shall
extend above the roof line.
8. Wall signs may be constructed of wood, metal or plastic.
9. Wall signs may have either channel lit letters or reverse channel lit letters. Sign bands
shall not be illuminated. In the Office/Industrial Sign District, channel lit letters are
permitted under the following conditions: a) the majority of gross floor area must be
devoted to office use; b) the wall sign shall only identify the office occupant; c) the
building height must be a minimum of forty (40) feet; and d) the wall sign shall be
mounted a minimum of thirty-five (35) feet above grade. Gooseneck reflectors are

uniform height on the building wall in similar proportion to one another. Wall signs
identifying individual tenant spaces in multi-tenant structures shall be centered within
each leaseable space unless otherwise approved by the Department of Community and
Economic Development. Signs within a multi-tenant commercial development must be of
a natural or white finish, however a logo or mark registered with the United States Patent
and Trademark Office shall not be limited by color. Where a single principal building is
devoted to two (2) or more business or commercial uses, the operator of each such use
may install a wall sign. The maximum area of each such sign shall be determined by the
proportionate share of the front façade, including doors and windows, of the principal
building occupied by each such use and applying such proportion to the total sign area
Village of Lincolnshire Title 12: Sign Control
Revised 11/11/19 Page 4
permitted for the front wall of the building.
11. On multi-tenant office buildings, one wall sign shall be permitted per building frontage,
provided signs have a minimum separation from the common edge of each building
frontage equal to ten feet (10) or one third (1/3) of the length of the respective frontage,
whichever is lesser.
12. On multi-tenant industrial buildings, individual tenant wall signs shall be permitted only for
those tenant spaces that have individual entrances facing a public street or a parking lot.
Such signs must be located over or next to a corresponding entrance at a uniform height
on the building wall in similar proportion to one another. Regardless of whether the first
wall sign in any multi-tenant building is installed over the entry or next to the entry, that
same placement type shall be required for any additional signs in the same building. The
maximum area of each such sign shall be determined by the proportionate share of the
front façade, including doors and windows of the principal building occupied by each
tenant space and applying such proportion to the total sign area permitted for the front
wall of the building. Any two adjoining wall signs placed next to entrances shall be
located no closer than 1 foot (1) from each other. Any two adjoining wall signs placed
above entrances shall be located no closer than 5 feet (5) from each other.
13. Within a single-tenant commercial development, signs utilizing carved, etched, or raised
letters are not limited by color. Metal letters and logos shall have a non-reflective metal
surface.
14. Wall signs shall be attached to a building façade at a height of not less than eight (8) feet
above any sidewalk, and may not extend over said thoroughfare and/or sidewalk.
15. Consistency must be provided between ground sign lettering design for individual tenants
and the corresponding lettering of wall signs on the façade of the building.

9. The Village shall field verify for growth and the size. The DBH at time of
replacement shall be the credit applied.
10. A tree credit will only be given once for each individual tree planted
regardless of its size. For example: Two Appendix A credit trees are
planted at 3 DBH. Within a years time the trees are 5 in DBH each.
That same year the property owner wishes to remove another Appendix A
tree that is 8 in DBH. The two credit trees are valued at 10 and the tree
to be removed is valued at 8. The two credit trees will be used as
replacement for the 8 removal. No further credit will be given for the two
credit trees.

A. SEEDING:
Description: This section describes the seed bed preparation and furnishing, transporting
and placing the seed and other materials required in seeding operations.
CONSTRUCTION REQUIREMENTS:
Seed Bed Preparation: Seed bed preparation shall not be started until all stones. Boulders
debris and similar material larger than 3 inches in diameter have been removed. The area
to be seeded shall be worked to a minimum depth of 3 inches with a disk or other equipment
approved by the Village Engineer, reducing all soil particles to a size not larger than 2
inches in the largest dimension. The prepared surface shall be relatively free from all weeds,
clods, stones, roots, sticks, rivulets, gullies, crusting and caking. No seeds shall be sown
until the seed bed has been approved by the Village Engineer.
Seed bed preparation will not be required for Erosion Control Seeding if the soil is in a loose
and pliable condition. Light discing shall be done if the soil is hard or caked.
Seeding Methods: No seed shall be sown during high winds or when the ground is not in a
proper condition for seeding, nor shall any seed be sown until the purity test has been
completed for the seeds to be used, and shows that the seed meets the noxious weed seed
requirements. The Village Engineer will examine and then approve any equipment to be
used. Prior to starting work, seeders shall be calibrated and adjusted to sow seeds at the
proper seeding rate. Equipment shall be operated in a manner to ensure complete coverage
of the entire area to be seeded. The Village Engineer shall be notified 48 hours prior to
beginning the seeding operations so that the Village Engineer may determine by trial runs
that a calibration of the seeder will provide uniform distribution at the specified rate per acre.
When seed or fertilizer is applied with a hydraulic seeder, the rate of application shall be not
less than 1000 gallons of slurry per acre. This slurry shall contain the proper quantity of
seed or fertilizer specified per acre. When using a hydraulic seeder, the fertilizer nutrients
and seed shall be applied in two separate operations.
Within 12 hours, all seeded areas, including slopes 3 to 1 or flatter, shall be rolled at right
angles to the run off with an approved type roller or cultipacker to compact the seed bed and
place the seed in contact with the soil. Slopes steeper than 3 to 1 need not be rolled. Rolling
will not be required in the following conditions:
On slopes steeper than 3 to 1.
When a mulch stabilizer is used to anchor the mulch.
When a hydraulic seeder is used to apply the seed.
When a rangeland type grass drill is used.
When the seeding equipment is equipped with a roller that achieves the desires
compaction.
VILLAGE OF LINCOLNSHIRE TITLE 13-2
LANDSCAPING
Revised 06/22/2015 Page 25
When Erosion Control Seeding is called for on the plans, a harrow, approved by
the Village Engineer, maybe substituted for the roller.
The optimum depth for seeding shall be 1/4 inch.
All legumes (clover, vetch, birdsfoot trefoil, lespedeza and alfalfa) shall be inoculated with the
proper bacteria in the amounts and manner recommended by the manufacturer of the
inoculant before sowing or being mixed with other seeds for sowing. The inoculant shall be
furnished by the Contractor and shall be approved by the Village Engineer. The seed shall
be sown as soon as possible after inoculation and seed that has been standing more
than 24 hours after inoculation shall be re-inoculated before sowing. If legumes are applied
by hydro seeder, 3 times the normal amount of inoculant shall be used.
a. Native Grass and Native Forb Seed Mixtures: Native Grass and Native Forb
Seed Mixtures shall be done by hydraulic seeders or with a rangeland type grass drill
meeting the approval of the Village Engineer.
If a hydraulic seeder is used, the water application rate shall be not less than 500
gallons per acre.
Seeding operations for new construction (bare earth) shall be May 15 to June 30 or
October 15 to December 1. Seeding operations on existing turf shall be between
October 15 and December 1. All areas of existing turf to be seeded except as listed
below shall be mowed one or more times to a height of not more than three inches.
The equipment used shall be capable of completely severing all growth at the cutting
height and distributing it evenly over the mowed area. The cut material shall not be
windrowed or left in a lumpy or bunched condition. Subsequent mowing may be
required on certain areas in order to disperse the mowed material and allow
penetration of the seed.
Debris encountered during the mowing and seeding operations which may hamper
the operations shall be removed and disposed of. Damage to the turf, such as ruts or
wheel tracks more than two inches in depth, shall be repaired to the satisfaction of the
Village Engineer prior to the time of seeding.
b. Erosion Control Mixture
This method shall be considered a temporary erosion control method and shall be
used as a temporary cover when permanent seeding cannot be accomplished. All
areas that are to be left bare for more than one month will be consider for Erosion
Control Seeding. Any areas that cannot receive permanent seeding before winter shut
down shall be seeded with Erosion Control Seeding.
Seeding Mixtures: The classes of seeding mixtures will be designated by the Village
Engineer and will consist of one or more of the types listed in Table 1.

Method of Measurement: The quantities and application rates of fertilizer nutrients and
agricultural ground limestone are subject to adjustment and will be determined on the basis
of the analysis of soil samples taken by the Developer.
Fertilizer will be measured by weight in pounds of actual nutrients. The following formula
will be used to determine the pounds of fertilizer nutrients applied:
(Total weight of mixed fertilizer in pounds) X (Percentage of each nutrient in the
fertilizer applied) = pounds of each fertilizer nutrient.
B. MULCH AND EXCELSIOR BLANKET
Description: This section describes the furnishing, transporting and placing mulch or
excelsior blanket.
Materials: Materials shall meet the following requirements:
Mulching Seeded or Planted Areas: Within 24 hours from the time seeding, or planting of
VILLAGE OF LINCOLNSHIRE TITLE 13-2
LANDSCAPING
Revised 06/22/2015 Page 28
seedling trees, shrubs or vines has been performed, the seeded or planted area shall be
given a covering of mulch by one of the following methods. On slopes steeper than 3:1
mulch shall be applied the same day as seeded or planted. Mulch shall be applied
uniformly at the rate specified.
Method 1: This method shall consist of hand or machine application of straw mulch.
The mulch shall be loose enough to permit air to circulate but compact enough to reduce
erosion. If baled mulch material is used, care shall be taken that the material is in a
loosened condition and contains no lumps or knots of compacted material.
Method 2: This method shall consist of applying a layer of asphalt-coated straw mulch
on seeded areas or planted areas.
This mulch shall have a partial coating of EmulsifiedAsphalt.
The coated mulch shall be placed by equipment which will blow or eject, by means of a
constant air stream, controlled quantities of the mulch and asphalt in a uniform pattern
over the specified area. If the mulch is excessively cut or broken, the Contractor shall
take measures to reduce the cutting or breakage to a limit approved by the Village
Engineer.
The asphalt shall be introduced into the air stream by means of a spray arranged in
such a manner that it will partially coat the mulch with a spotty asphalt tack prior to the
depositing of the mulch covering. The rate of application will be determined by the
Village Engineer; however, the rate of application shall be not less than 75 gallons per ton
of mulch.
Method 3: The straw shall be applied in accordance with all of the requirements of Method
1, except a mulch stabilizer shall be used to anchor mulch into the soil by means of dull
blades or disks. These blades or disks shall be without camber, be approximately 20
inches in diameter.
The disks shall be notched and shall be spaced at approximately 3-inch intervals and shall
be equipped with scrapers. The stabilizer shall weigh approximately 1000 pounds and shall
have a working width nor to exceed 72 inches and shall be equipped with a ballast
compartment, so that when directed, weight can be increased.
Method 4: This method shall consist of a hand or machine application of an approved
shredded tree bark mulch material. The processed bark mulch shall be uniformly applied
over the seeded area at a rate determined by the Village Engineer. Care shall be taken
that the material is in a loosened condition and contains no lumps or knots of compacted
material.
Method 5: This method shall consist of machine application of straw mulch at the
specified rate using an approved mulch blower followed immediately by an overspray
application of hydraulic mulch. The hydraulic mulch shall be applied as a slurry of 750
pounds of mulch and 1000 gallons of water per acre by an approved hydraulic mulch
applicator. The hydraulic mulch slurry shalt be agitated a minimum of 5 minutes before
application and shall be agitated during application.
VILLAGE OF LINCOLNSHIRE TITLE 13-2
LANDSCAPING
Revised 06/22/2015 Page 29
Method 6: This method shall consist of machine application of straw mulch at the
specified rate using an approved mulch blower with chemical mulch binder applied
simultaneously with the hay or straw as in Mulch Method 2 or with chemical mulch binder
applied as an overspray in accordance with Mulch Method 5. Chemical mulch binder shall
be applied at the rate and manner recommenced by the supplier and approved by the
Village Engineer.
Method 7: This method shall consist of machine application of wood or paper fiber
hydraulic mulch at the specified rate using an approved hydraulic seeder. The hydraulic
mulch shall be applied as a slurry of 2000 pounds of mulch and not less than 2000 gallons
of water per acre. The hydraulic mulch slurry shall be agitated a minimum of 5 minutes
before application and shall be in continuous agitation during application. The seeding
will not be applied concurrently with this operation.
Following the mulching operation, every precaution shall be taken to prohibit foot or
vehicular traffic, or the movement of mulching has been displaced by any Contractor's
equipment or personnel, the seeding or other work damaged as a result of that
displacement shall immediately be replaced and the mulch covering replaced, at the
Contractor's expense, in a manner satisfactory to the Village Engineer.
Excelsior Blanket: The excelsior blanket shall be placed within 24 hours after seeding
operations have been completed on the areas specified by the Village Engineer. Prior to
placing the mat, the areas to be covered shall be relatively free of all rocks or clods over 1
1/2 inches in diameter, and all sticks or other foreign material which will prevent the close
contact of the blanket with the seed bed. If as a result of a rain, the prepared seed bed
becomes crusted or eroded, or if eroded places, ruts or depressions exist for any reason,
the Contractor will be required to rework the soil until it is smooth and to reseed such
areas which are reworked. After the area has been properly shaped, fertilized and seeded,
the blanket shall be laid out flat, evenly and smoothly, without stretching the material.
Jute or paper mat used as a ditch lining shall be applied with the lengths running parallel to
the flow of water. When the blanket is unrolled, the netting shall be on top and the fibers
in contact with the soil.
In ditches, the blankets shall be applied in the direction of the flow of the water and
butted snugly against each other. Use 4 staples across at the start of each roll and
continue to staple each side and the center on 4-foot intervals. Use a common row of
staples on adjoining blankets.
On slopes, the blanket shall be applied either horizontally or vertically to the contour.
Staple similar to ditch applications except the space interval shall be 6 feet.
C. SODDING
Description: This section shall describe the preparation of the ground surface and
furnishing, transporting and placing sod and other materials required in the sodding
operations.
Ground Preparation: Immediately prior, but not in excess of 24 hours before the sod is
placed, the soil surface shall be worked until it is relatively free from debris, washes,
VILLAGE OF LINCOLNSHIRE TITLE 13-2
LANDSCAPING
Revised 06/22/2015 Page 30
gullies, clods and stones, and is in a satisfactory condition. The surface shall be worked to
a depth of not less than 3 inches with a disk, tiller or other equipment approved by the
Village Engineer. Prepared surfaces that become crusted shall be reworked to an
acceptable condition for sodding.
All soil surfaces shall be moist when the sod is placed. When directed by the Village
Engineer, the Contractor shall be required to apply water to dry soil surfaces at a minimum
rate of one gallon per square yard immediately prior to placing the sod.
When specified, agricultural ground limestone and fertilizer nutrients shall be applied at the
designated rates over the areas to be sodded.
Sodding Time: Sod shall be placed when the ground is in a workable condition and
temperatures are less than 90 degrees F. Sod shall not be placed when the sod or ground
surface is frozen or during and extended drought.
Transportation: All sod shall be properly covered when transported to prevent it from
drying out. Adequate shading and ventilation must be provided for the sod to prevent it
from decomposing while it is transported.
Sod cut for more than 48 hours shall only be used with the approval of the Village
Engineer. Any sod that has dried out, has heated to over 100 degrees F. or is frozen prior
to placing will be rejected and shall be immediately removed from the job site by the
Contractor.
Placing Sod: The sod shall be placed on the prepared surface with the edges in close
contact and alternate courses staggered.
In ditches, the sod shall be placed with the longer dimension perpendicular to the flow of
water in the ditch. On slopes, starting at the bottom of the slope, the sod shall be placed
with the longer dimension parallel to the contours of the ground. The exposed edges of
sod shall be buried flush with the adjacent soil.
On slopes where the sod may be displaced during sodding operations, the workmen shall
work from ladders or treaded planks.
Staking Sod: The sod shall be staked on all slopes of 2:1 or steeper. Sod shall be staked
with not less than 4 stakes per square yard with at least one stake for each piece of sod.
Stakes shall be a minimum of 6" long. Stakes shall be installed so that they hold the sod
firmly in place yet present no danger to pedestrians or mowing crews. The type of stake
and the method of installation shall meet the approval of the Village Engineer.
Sod Watering: Within 6 hours after the sod has been placed. 5 gallons of water per
square yard shall be applied. Thereafter, on days designated by the Village Engineer,
additional water shall be applied at the rate of 3 gallons per square yard. The sod must be
adequately watered during the period of establishment, defined as the period of time
between sod placement and when the sod becomes knitted to the soil and growing in
place.
The Contractor shall have on hand enough equipment to completely water all sodded
areas in 2 days at watering rates specified during the period of establishment. The Village
VILLAGE OF LINCOLNSHIRE TITLE 13-2
LANDSCAPING
Revised 06/22/2015 Page 31
Engineer will make periodic checks of the Contractors equipment to determine its adequacy
and operating condition.
All watering described herein shall be done with a spray application. An open end hose
will not be acceptable. The method of watering shall meet the approval of the Village
Engineer.
Supplemental Watering: During periods of intense heat or subnormal rainfall,
supplemental watering may be required prior to acceptance of the work. Supplemental
watering shall be performed when directed by the Village Engineer. Water shall be
applied at the rate specified by the Village Engineer within 24 hours of notice.
Supplemental watering may be performed during the period of establishment or any time
prior to final acceptance of the project.
Disposal of Surplus Material: Surplus and waste materials resulting from sodding
operations shall be disposed of by the Contractor, at his/her own expense.
D. PLANTING
Description: This work shall consist of digging and preparing plant holes, and of furnishing,
transporting and planting trees, shrubs, vines, seedlings and other materials.
It shall also include all incidental operations such as mulching, bracing, wrapping, care of
living plants and replacements of unsatisfactory plants.
Planting Time: Except for container grown items, plants must be dormant when delivered
to the storage site or project.
Bare root plant material shall be planted only when the air temperatures exceed 35
degrees F. The Contractor shall begin this work not later than September 1, following the
award date of the contract.
a. Spring Planting: This work shall be performed from the time the soil can be
worked until the plant, under field conditions, is not dormant except that:
1. Evergreen planting shall end April 30.
2. Seedlings shall be planted only during the spring planting season.
3. The planting time may be extended for container grown plants if the Village
Engineer determines that the weather conditions are favorable.
b. Fall Planting: This work shall be performed from the time the plant becomes
dormant until the ground cannot be satisfactorily worked except that evergreen
planting shall be performed between August 15 and October 15.
Digging of Plants: Plants shall not be dug until the Contractor is ready to transport them
from their original locations to the site of the work or approved storage. The maximum
time lapse between digging and being property loaded tor delivery to the site of the
work or being placed in approved storage, shall be 4 days for balled or burlapped
plants and one day for bare root plants. They shall be dug with care, avoiding injury to

the plants or loss or damage of the roots, particular attention being given to fibrous roots.
Immediately after digging, roots shall be protected against drying out and freezing. Bare
root plants shall be dug only when air temperatures exceed 35 degrees F.
Transportation: During transportation, the Contractor shall exercise care to prevent injury
and drying out of the plants. Upon arrival at the temporary storage location of the site of
the work, plants will be inspected tor proper shipping procedures. Should the roots be dried
out, large branches be broken, balls of earth be broken or loosened, or areas of bark be
torn, the Village Engineer may reject the injured tree. When a tree has been so rejected,
the Contractor shall at once remove it from the area of the work and replace it.
Temporary Storage: No plant shall remain in temporary storage over the summer. Plants
delivered to the project that are not to be planted immediately shall be protected in the
following manner:
a. Bare Root Plants: Plants may remain on the site of the work only 24 hours prior to
being planted or placed in storage. During this 24 hour period, the Contractor shall
continue to exercise care to prevent injury and drying out of the plants. The roots
of plants to be placed in storage shall first be puddled in a paste solution of the
prepared backfill used in planting and water. The plants shall then be protected and
kept moist by heeling-in the roots or by placing the plant in a cool moist storage
building. The heeling-in procedure shall require the plants to be separated and the
roots heeled in a suitable moist soil. If plants are stored in a building, the roots shall
be covered with a suitable moist mulch. Winter storage of bare rooted plants will be
allowed only in temperature and humidity controlled buildings. The Village Engineer
shall approve the storage methods. The duration of storage, the method of storage
and the materials used for mulch and heeling-in shall meet with the approval of the
Village Engineer.
b. Balled and Burlapped Plants and Container Grown Plants: Plants may remain on the
site of the work only 72 hours prior to being planted or placed in storage.
Balled and burlapped plants shall be kept moist and their solidity carefully
preserved. To prevent drying out or freezing, they shall be stored either in a cool
moist storage building or placed in a compact group with a suitable mulch material
placed around and between the balls so they are completely covered.
Container grown plant material shall be kept moist by watering as directed by the
Village Engineer. To prevent freezing, they shall be stored either in a cool moist
storage building or placed in a compact group with a suitable mulch material placed
around and between the balls so they are completely covered.
The duration of storage, method of storage and mulch material for balled and
burlap material and container grown plant material shall meet the approval of the
Village Engineer.
Layout of Planting: The area to be planted shall be finished to line and grade before
planting operations are begun. The Contractor shall furnish all marking flags for locating
plants and shall mark thereon the key number and size of plants. The Village Engineer
will place the marking flags and outline each area for mass or solid planting.

Excavation of Plant Holes: The sides of all plant holes shall be vertical and the bottoms
horizontal. On slopes, the depth of excavation will be measured at the center of the hole.
Unless otherwise specified, the excess material excavated from the holes shall be spread
in the immediate area as directed by the Village Engineer. The excavated material shall
not be stockpiled on turf or in ditches. The sides of holes shall not be glazed or smooth.
a. Excavation for Trees: Holes tor trees shall be dug at the location indicated by the
marking flags. The diameter of the hole shall be at least 24 wider than the diameter
of the ball and the depth of the hole shall be 2 less than the depth of the ball.
b. Excavation for Shrubs, Vines and Seedlings: Holes for shrubs, vines and seedlings
shall be dug within the marked outline of the planting bed. The interval of planting
will be designated on the plans. Spacing shall be measured from center to center
and alternate rows shall be staggered.
Prior to digging shrub and vine holes, existing vegetation on the area shall be
mowed or treated with a non-selective, post emergent non-residual herbicide
approved by the Village Engineer. The area shall then be tilled to a minimum depth
of 2 inches until free of debris, gullies, clods, weeds, stones and roots.
Holes for shrubs shall be dug to a minimum diameter of 18 inches greater than the
diameter of the ball or container. Holes for vines shall be dug to a minimum
diameter and depth of 8 inches.
Immediately prior to planting seedlings, the existing grass and weed growth within
the planting area shall be cut to a maximum height of 2 inches. On slopes flatter
than 3:1, the soil adjacent to the plant row parallel to the contour shall be prepared
by cultivating or scalping to remove all grass and weed growth, in a continuous strip
not less than 18 inches wide. The seedlings shall be planted in the center of this
strip.
Holes for seedlings shall be made large enough to accommodate the root system
with a spade, planting bar or an approved mechanical tree planting machine.
Individual holes for container grown plants shall be excavated to the same
dimensions for comparable size balled and burlapped maternal.
Pruning: Pruning shall be done in such a manner as to preserve the natural growth habit
or each plant. The method and location of pruning and the percentage of growth to be
removed shall beet the approval of the Village Engineer, all pruning shall be done with
sharp tools in accordance with the best horticultural practices.
The ends of all broken and damaged roots of 1/4 inch or larger shall be pruned with a
clean cut, removing only the injured portion. All broken branches, stubs and improper
cuts of former pruning shall be removed.
a. Deciduous Trees: Pruning shall consist of thinning the twigs or branches as
dictated by the habit of growth of the various types of the trees to be pruned, and
as directed by the Village Engineer. The leader and terminal buds shall not be
cut unless directed by the Village Engineer.

Revised 06/22/2015 Page 34
b. Deciduous Shrubs: In general, shrubs shall be cut back to 1/2 of their height.
Shrubs that are slow growing o r do not sucker readily shall be pruned in the
same manner as deciduous shade trees.
c. Evergreens: Evergreens shall not be pruned except to remove broken branches.
Planting Procedures: The prepared backfill shall consist of a mixture of topsoil, peat
moss and fertilizer. To each cubic yard of topsoil, add 3 cubic feet of loose peat moss, 3
pounds of phosphorus nutrients and 1 pound of potassium nutrients. The method of
mixing the components of the prepared backfill shall meet the approval of the Village
Engineer. The compressed ratio of the baled peat moss will determine the number of
loose cubic feet contained therein. Topsoil shall be stockpiled at locations approved by
the Village Engineer.
At the end of the establishment period, nitrogen nutrients shall be uniformly applied to the
surface of all backfilled areas where trees, shrubs and vines were planted at the rate of 6
pounds or nutrients per 1000 square feet on inorganic mulch, and 10 pounds of nutrients
per 1000 square feet on organic mulch.
The prepared backfill soil shall, at the time of planting, be in a loose, friable condition. At
no time shall the prepared backfill or other topsoil used on the job be stockpiled on turf or
in ditches.
All plants shall be placed in a plumb position and set 2 inches higher than the depth they
grew in the nursery. Prepared backfill shall be placed around the root system. Tamping
or watering shall accompany the backfilling operation to eliminate air pockets.
Thorough watering of trees, shrubs and vines, with a method approved by the Village
Engineer, shall follow the backfilling operation. This watering shall completely saturate
the backfill and be performed during the same day of planting. After the ground settles,
as a result of the watering, additional backfill shall be placed to match the level of the
finished grade. Approved watering equipment shall be at the site of the work and in
operational condition prior to starting the planting operation.
a. Balled and Burlapped Plants: After the plant is placed in the hole, all cords and
burlap shall be cur away from the trunk.
b. Container Grown Plants: Prior to placing the plant in the hole, the container shall be
removed with care so as not to disturb the ball of soil that contains the root system.
During the planting operation, care shall be taken not to destroy the solidity of the
ball of soil. Pots of material that will decompose in one growing season need not be
removed.
c. Bare Root Plants: The roots shall be carefully spread in a natural position and
prepared backfill shall be worked in around the roots so each root is individually
packed to eliminate air pockets. The plant shall be gently raised and lowered to
assure contact of the roots with the soil.

d. Seedling Plants: When seedlings are removed from storage tor planting, they shall
be transported to the planting site in containers of water and the roots shall be
continuously immersed until planted. The roots shall be placed in the center of the
hole and prepared backfill shall be compacted around the roots to eliminate air
pockets. The prepared backfill shall be saturated with water after the plant is placed.
Any unplanted seedlings left at the end of each day shall be removed from the
water, the roots wrapped in moist materials and the seedlings placed in storage.
Mulch Cover: A mulch cover shall be provided for all plants except seedlings. A 4-inch
deep circular water saucer of soil shall be constructed around single plants and shall be
filled with mulch material to a depth of not less than three inches (3). When the plant is
in a bed in which spacing is less than 6 feet on centers, the entire bed shall be
mulched to a depth of not less than three inches (3) and with a mulch material. The
mulch shall extend 3 feet beyond the peripheral plants of the bed.
Wrapping: Within 7 days after planting, all shade trees of 2 1 / 2 inches diameter or
larger shall be wrapped from the ground to the lowest major branch. Unless
otherwise specified, a double layer of commercial screen wire mesh shall be wrapped
around the trunk of the tree. The screen wire shall be secured to itself with staples or
single wire strand tied to the mesh.
E. PERIOD OF ESTABLISHMENTAND GUARANTEE
Final inspection of all work will be made during the month of September each year. To be
acceptable, the plant must be in a live healthy condition, representative of its species,
and shall have been growing in place for not less than one year prior to inspection. No
portion of this work will be inspected until all items of work are completed.
Plants that do not meet the requirements tor acceptance shall be replaced by the
Contractor at his/her own expense following the date of inspection and prior to November
15 or in the case of items specified for spring planting only, prior to the following May 15,
at which time another final inspection will be made for replacements only. Should
replacements include both spring and fall items, the Contractor may elect to plant all
replacements in the spring, prior to May 15.
The Contractor shall remove immediately from the site of the work any dead plant
material. During spring or fall planting, the Contractor will not be permitted to terminate
the operation until all plant material is in a live, healthy condition. All plant material which
dies within 15 days after being planted shall be replaced at the time and shall be
considered as part of the original planting and be subject to the requirement of the period
of establishment.
Plant Care: During the period of establishment, the Contractor shall properly care for all
plants doing such weeding, watering, adjusting of braces, repair of water saucers or
other work which is necessary to maintain the health and satisfactory appearance of the
plantings. All requirements for proper care during the period of establishment shall be
considered as incidental to the cost of the contract and shall be performed within 5 days
following notification by the Village Engineer.
a. During the period of establishment, additional watering shall be performed at

The schedule for watering within the 30 day increment will be determined by the
Village Engineer. Should excessive moisture conditions prevail, the Village
Engineer may delete any of all of the additional watering cycles or any part of
said cycles.
The water shall be applied to individual plants in such a manner that the plant hole will
be saturated without allowing the water to overflow beyond the earthen saucer.
Watering of plants in beds shall be applied in such a manner that all plant holes are
uniformly saturated without allowing the water to flow beyond the periphery of the
bed. The plants to be watered and the method of application shall be approved by the
Village Engineer. The Contractor shall not be relieved in any way from the
responsibility for unsatisfactory plants due to the amount of supplemental watering.
b. During the period of establishment, weeds and grass growth shall be removed
from within the earthen saucer of individual trees and from the area within the
periphery of the mulched plant beds. This weeding shall be performed at least
twice during the months of May through September. The weeding schedule will be
determined by the Village Engineer.
The weeding may be performed in any manner approved by the Village Engineer
provided the weed and grass growth, including their roots and stems, are removed
from the area specified therein. Mulch disturbed by the weeding operation shall be
replaced to its original condition. All debris that results from this operation must be
removed from the right of way at the end of each day.
The plants weeded will be determined by the Village Engineer. The Contractor shall
not be relived in any way from the responsibility for unsatisfactory plants due to the
extent of weeding.
