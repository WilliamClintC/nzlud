McFARLAND, CALIFORNIA - MUNICIPAL CODE 
1988 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of 
the City of McFarland, California 
____________ 
Beginning with Supplementation in 2011, 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 
  
PREFACE 
The McFarland, California Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1988, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
Beginning with Supplementation in 2011, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation. 
During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of M. Dwain Smith, city attorney, Doris L. Wood, city clerk, and Donnie Campbell, city administrator. 
The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplementation in 2011, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance No. 006-2018, passed June 28, 2018.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title , then chapter , and ending with section . Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, can be added between Chapter 2.04 and Chapter 2.08. 
Section. 
Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
Beginning with Supplementation in 2011, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
As of Supplementation in 2011, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
Beginning with Supplementation in 2011, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
Beginning with Supplementation in 2011, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
When originally published, the pages of this code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplementation in 2011, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM. Our e-mail address is: ords@municode.com .

Chapter 1.14 - ADMINISTRATIVE CITATIONS 
 
1.14.010 - Purpose and intent. 
The enforcement of the city's municipal code is vital to the protection of the public's health, safety and quality of life. Under Government Code Section 53069.4, the city is authorized to adopt an administrative citation and civil fine program, which offers an alternative method of enforcement of violations of the municipal code. The purpose of issuing administrative citations pursuant to this chapter is to encourage compliance with the provisions of this code and to provide a method of holding persons responsible when they fail or refuse to comply with the provisions of this code. The use of this chapter is also intended to minimize the expense and delay associated with pursuing code violations through the civil or criminal justice system. 
(Ord. No. 018-2012, § 1, 2-23-12)  
1.14.020 - Definitions. 
For the purposes of this chapter, the following definitions apply to these words and phrases: 
"Administrative citation" or "citation" means a written notice to a responsible person that a violation of this code has occurred and an assessment of a civil fine issued by a code enforcement officer. 
"City manager" means the city manager of the city of McFarland or the manager's designee. 
"Continuing violation" means either: (1) a particular violation of the code continuing for more than thirty days without correction or abatement, or (2) a repeated, consecutive violation of the same offense without intervening days. 
"Hearing officer" means the city of McFarland chief of police or his or her designee. 
"Notice of violation" means a written notice to a responsible person that a violation of this code has occurred and a warning that an administrative citation assessing fines will be issued unless the violation is ceased and abated. 
"Officer" means any person authorized to enforce certain provisions of this code. The following officers and employees have the authority to issue administrative citations as civil fines: city manager, police chief, public works director and planning director. 
"Responsible party" means any person or persons that an officer determines are responsible for causing or maintaining a violation of this code. The term "responsible person" includes but is not limited to a property owner, tenant, person with a legal interest in real or personal property, or person in possession or control of real or personal property. 
(Ord. No. 018-2012, § 1, 2-23-12; Ord. No. 065-2017, § 1, 2-9-17)  
1.14.030 - General citation authority and applicability. 
A.  This chapter authorizes use of administrative citations that are in addition to all other legal remedies, criminal or civil, that the city may pursue to address any violation of this code. 
B.  The use of this chapter is at the sole discretion of the city manager or any other officer authorized to enforce certain provisions of this code. 
C.  Any officer, upon determining that a provision of this code which such officer is charged to enforce has been violated, has the authority to issue an administrative citation to any responsible person. 
D.  Any responsible person violating any provision of this code, or causing, permitting or maintaining a violation of any provision of this code may be issued an administrative citation by a code enforcement officer. 
E.  Each and every thirty days a violation of this code exists constitutes a separate and distinct offense and will be subject to a separate fine. A single citation may charge for the violation of one or more code sections. Continuing violations will automatically accrue fines beginning on the date the citation is issued until verification of abatement pursuant to Section 1.14.070(C). 
F.  The owner of any property, building or structure within the city has the responsibility for keeping such property, building or structure free of violations related to its use or condition. The owner of such property, building or structure is a responsible person and is separately liable for violations committed by tenants or occupants relative to the use or condition of the property. 
(Ord. No. 018-2012, § 1, 2-23-12)  
1.14.040 - Notice of violation. 
A.  Whenever an officer determines that a violation of this code exists, the officer shall issue a notice of violation to a responsible person. The notice of violation serves as a written warning of responsibility and allows twenty days for the responsible person to cease and abate the violation. The notice of violation shall include the information set forth below and a date by which the violation can reasonably be ceased and abated. If the violation is not ceased or abated by the end of the correction period stated in the notice, the officer shall issue a notice to abate to a responsible person prior to issuing an administrative citation. The notice to abate serves as a second written warning of responsibility and requires immediate action by the responsible person to cease and abate the violation within seven days of the date of mailing of the notice to abate. If the violation has not ceased or abated within seven days of final notice, the code enforcement officer may issue an administrative citation. 
1.  Administrative citations will be issued on a form approved by the city attorney, and at a minimum will contain the following information: 
a.  Name of the person who is charged as a responsible person for the violation;

c.  The code sections or conditions violated and a description of the violation; 
d.  A description of the actions necessary to correct the violation; 
e.  An order to the responsible person to immediately correct the violation and an explanation of the consequences of the failure to correct the violation; 
f.  Whether the offense is a continuing violation which will accrue fines until properly ceased and abated; 
g.  The amount of the fine for the violation, including the amount due for the initial violation and any prospective daily fine for failure to abate the violation (if applicable to a continuing violation);

B.  In accordance with Government Code Section 53069.4, no responsible person will be assessed an administrative fine under this chapter for a continuing violation pertaining to a building, plumbing, electrical or similar structural or zoning issue that does not create an immediate danger to the public health or safety without first receiving a notice of violation and a reasonable opportunity to correct or otherwise remedy the violation. In such circumstance, the stated period available to correct the violation prior to the assessment of a fine must be appropriate to the violation as determined by the officer, but in no event less than thirty days. If, after the correction period stated in the notice, the violation is not ceased or abated, the officer may issue an administrative citation. 
C.  Any responsible person receiving notice for a continuing violation may petition the city manager for an extension of time to correct the violation so long as the petition is received before the end of the correction period. The city manager may grant an extension of time to correct the violation if the responsible person has supplied sufficient evidence showing that the correction cannot reasonably be made within the stated period or has demonstrated that substantial progress has been made towards abating the violation. 
D.  The requirement of a reasonable opportunity to cure a violation does not apply in instances where in the discretion of the city manager, a code violation poses an immediate danger to the public health or safety.

1.14.050 - Service procedures. 
A.  Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, whenever notice is required to be given under this chapter, it must be given in one of the following ways: 
1.  Personal service; 
2.  Certified mail, postage prepaid, return receipt requested. Concurrently, the same notice should be sent by regular mail. If a notice that is sent by certified mail is returned unsigned, then service will be deemed effective by regular mail, provided that notice is not returned. Service by mail will be effective on the date of mailing; 
3.  Posting the notice conspicuously on or in front of the affected property or any other real property within the city in which the city has knowledge that the responsible person has a legal interest. 
B.  The failure of any interested person to receive any notice served in accordance with this section will not affect the validity of any proceedings taken under this chapter. 
C.  The notice procedures in this section do not apply to an initial notice of violation, which may be sent by regular mail or personally served. Service of a notice of violation by mail is effective on the date of mailing. 
(Ord. No. 018-2012, § 1, 2-23-12)  
1.14.060 - Assessment of administrative citation fine. 
A.  The amount of the fine will be assessed according to a schedule of fines adopted by the city council. The schedule may include escalating fine amounts for repeat violations occurring within specified periods of time, and fines may vary depending on the particular code provision violated. 
B.  Where no amount is specified by resolution of the city council, the following fines will apply: 
1.  A fine not exceeding one hundred dollars every thirty days for a first violation; 
2.  A fine not exceeding two hundred and fifty dollars every thirty days for a second violation of the same code provision or permit within one year from the date of the first violation; 
3.  A fine not exceeding five hundred dollars every thirty days for each additional violation of the same code provision or permit within one year from the date of the first violation. 
C.  A penalty of ten percent will be added on any delinquent fines on the last day of each month after the due date. 
(Ord. No. 018-2012, § 1, 2-23-12)  
1.14.070 - Satisfaction of administrative citation. 
A.  Upon receipt of a citation, the responsible person must do the following: 
1.  Pay the fine within thirty days from the date of the administrative citation. All fines assessed are payable to the city. Payment of a fine does not excuse or discharge the failure to correct the violation nor will it bar further enforcement action by the city. 
2.  Cease and abate the violation. If the offense is a continuing violation and the responsible person fails to properly cease and abate the violation, fines will accrue for each day until the abatement is properly verified. Additionally, subsequent administrative citations may be issued for the same violation. The amount of the fine for failure to correct the violation will increase at the rate specified in this chapter or as established by city council resolution. 
B.  At any time following thirty days after the issuance of the citation, the city may deliver a collection bill to the responsible person requiring payment for all outstanding amounts owed for the violation, including the amount due for the initial violation and any accrual of daily fines from the date the citation was issued to the date the abatement of the offense is properly verified (if applicable) plus any appropriate late payment charge, less any amount remitted pursuant to subsection A of this section. 
C.  The abatement of a continuing violation must be verified by an officer. The responsible person must contact the phone number designated on the citation and schedule an inspection by an officer. Fines will accrue until the abatement is verified, less any days delayed by action of the city in scheduling such inspection. 
(Ord. No. 018-2012, § 1, 2-23-12)  
1.14.080 - Collection of unpaid fines and penalties. 
A.  The failure of any person to pay a fine or penalty assessed by administrative citation within the time specified on the citation constitutes a debt to the city. To enforce that debt, the city may file a civil action, lien the subject property as set forth below, or pursue any other legal remedy to collect such debt. A person who fails to pay any fine or other charge owed to the city under this chapter is liable in any action brought by the city for all costs incurred in securing payment of the delinquent amount, including, but not limited to, administrative costs and attorneys' fees. Such collection costs are in addition to any fines, interest, and late charges. 
B.  In addition to any other legal remedy, the city may place a lien on property that is the subject of a citation if the citation has been issued to the property owner. The following procedure will apply: 
1.  The city's finance director may initiate proceedings to record a lien against the subject property. 
2.  Before recording the lien, the finance director shall submit a report to the city clerk stating the amounts due and owing. The report may include a fee, for the administrative costs associated with the preparation and recordation of the lien. 
3.  The city clerk shall fix a time, date, and place for a hearing before the city manager to consider the report and any protests or objections to it. 
4.  The city clerk must serve the property owner with a hearing notice not less than ten days before the hearing date. The notice must set forth the amount of the delinquent administrative fine, and any penalties and interest that is due. Notice must be delivered first class mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the property owner's address as it appears on the last equalized assessment roll or supplemental roll of Kern County, whichever is more current. Service by mail is effective on the date of mailing and failure of property owner to actually receive notice does not affect its validity. 
5.  At the conclusion of the hearing, the city manager may adopt a report confirming, discharging, or modifying the lien amount. 
6.  Following the adoption of the report imposing a lien, the city clerk shall cause the lien to be filed in the county recorder's office. 
7.  After confirmation and recordation, the city shall present a copy of the lien to the county tax collector to add the amount of the lien to the next regular property tax bills levied against the parcel for municipal purposes. This amount will be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary property taxes are collected, and will be subject to the same penalties and procedures under foreclosure and sale as provided for with ordinary municipal taxes. Or, after recording, the lien may be foreclosed by judicial or other sale in the manner and means provided by law. 
8.  Once the city receives full payment for outstanding principal, penalties, and costs related to a lien, the city clerk will cause to be recorded a notice of satisfaction or provide the property owner with a notice of satisfaction for recordation at the county recorder's office. This notice of satisfaction will cancel the city's lien. 
(Ord. No. 018-2012, § 1, 2-23-12)  
1.14.090 - Request for administrative hearing. 
A.  Any person receiving an administrative citation may contest the citation by completing a request for hearing form and returning it to the city within ten business days after the issuance date of the administration citation. Any request for hearing must be accompanied by an advance deposit of the fine assessed by the citation for the initial violation, unless waived by subsection C of this section. If it is determined, after a hearing, that there was no violation as charged in the administrative citation, the advance deposit will be refunded. 
B.  A request for hearing will not postpone or avoid the requirement of a responsible person to abate a violation nor toll the daily fines accruing for a continuing violation until the abatement of the offense is properly verified. In the event the hearing officer upholds the citation, the responsible person will be liable for the total fines accrued from the issuance of the citation to the date the abatement is properly verified, and any costs incurred to provide a hearing officer. 
C.  A person seeking an administrative hearing may request a hardship waiver of the fine deposit by filing with the city clerk a completed city form, which must be signed under penalty of perjury. The request must be submitted along with the request for hearing. The person requesting the waiver bears the burden of establishing that such person does not have the financial ability to make the deposit. The request will be decided by the city manager within five business days from date the request is received, and the city manager's decision is final. The applicant will be notified by telephone, facsimile, or in person of the decision on the request. The filing of a request for hardship waiver does not extend the time to file for an administrative hearing or pay the fine when due. If the request for hardship waiver is denied, an administrative hearing will not be scheduled unless the fine deposit is paid within five business days following the city manager's determination on the request for a hardship waiver. 
D.  The failure to submit a timely and complete request for hearing will terminate a person's right to contest the citation and result in a failure to exhaust administrative remedies, and the order of the citation will serve as a final determination and conclusive evidence of the named responsible person's liability for the citation. 
E.  The city clerk shall set a hearing before a city hearing officer on a date that is not less than fifteen and not more than sixty days from the date that the request for hearing is filed in accordance with the provisions of this section. Additional fines shall not accrue from the time the city clerk receives a timely and complete request for hearing until the hearing date. The city shall notify the person requesting the hearing by regular mail of the date, time and place set for the hearing at least ten days prior to the date of the hearing and give that person any additional written reports filed concerning the violation that are provided to the hearing officer. 
(Ord. No. 018-2012, § 1, 2-23-12)  
1.14.100 - Administrative hearing procedure. 
A.  A city hearing officer will conduct the administrative citation hearing. 
B.  No hearing to contest an administrative citation before a hearing officer will be held until a request for hearing form has been completed and submitted, and the fine has been deposited in advance, unless a hardship waiver is granted in accordance with Section 1.14.090(C). 
C.  The hearing officer may only consider evidence that is relevant to whether the violation occurred and whether the responsible person has caused or maintained the violation of this code on the date specified in the administrative citation. 
D.  At least ten days prior to the hearing, the city must provide the recipient of an administrative citation with copies of the citation, reports and other documents to be submitted to the hearing officer. No other discovery is permitted. Formal rules of evidence will not apply. 
E.  The person contesting the administrative citation will be given the opportunity to testify and present witnesses and evidence concerning the administrative citation. 
F.  Unless requested in advance by the person contesting the administrative citation, neither the issuing officer nor any other representative of the city is required to attend the hearing, provided that any such appearance may be made at the discretion of the city manager. 
G.  The failure of any recipient of an administrative citation to appear at the administrative citation hearing will constitute a forfeiture of the fine and a failure to exhaust administrative remedies, and the order of the citation will become the final determination. 
H.  The administrative citation and any additional documents submitted by the code enforcement officer to the hearing officer will constitute prima facie evidence of the violation and the respective facts contained in those documents. 
I.  The hearing officer may continue the hearing and request additional information from the code enforcement officer or the recipient of the administrative citation prior to issuing a written decision. 
(Ord. No. 018-2012, § 1, 2-23-12)  
1.14.110 - Administrative hearing decision. 
A.  After considering all of the testimony and evidence submitted at the hearing, the hearing officer shall issue a written decision within fourteen calendar days after the hearing to uphold or deny the administrative citation and must list in the decision the reasons for that decision. The hearing officer will use preponderance of evidence as the standard of evidence in deciding issues. The decision of the hearing officer will be final. 
B.  If the hearing officer determines that the administrative citation should be upheld, then any applicable fine amount on deposit with the city will be retained by the city. The hearing officer may also impose conditions and deadlines to correct the violation or require payment of any outstanding fines, penalties, and interest. 
C.  If the hearing officer determines that the administrative citation should be canceled or reduced because of an error in calculating the fine, the city will promptly refund the applicable amount of the deposited fine. 
D.  The city shall serve the recipient of the administrative citation with a copy of the hearing officer's written decision by certified mail. 
(Ord. No. 018-2012, § 1, 2-23-12)  
1.14.120 - Right to judicial review. 
Any person aggrieved by an administrative decision of a hearing officer on an administrative citation may obtain review of the administrative decision by filing a petition for review with the Kern County Superior Court in accordance with the timelines and provisions set forth in California Government Code Section 53069.4. 
(Ord. No. 018-2012, § 1, 2-23-12)  
1.14.130 - Emergency abatement. 
In the event the violation constitutes a significant and immediate threat to the public health, safety, or welfare so severe that immediate action is required, any officer may enter the property upon which the violation exists, abate the violation, and restore any property affected by it. To the extent reasonably practicable, informal notice shall be provided to the owner or occupant before abatement. If necessary to protect the public health, safety, or welfare, abatement may proceed without prior notice to or consent from the owner or occupant thereof. An administrative hearing before the city council shall follow the abatement action at the next regular meeting of the city council that the matter can be placed on the agenda wherein the city council shall determine the reasonableness of the action taken by the officer. Subject to the city council's determination, all costs of the abatement shall be borne by the owner of the property and all provisions described in this chapter relating to assessment and collection of same shall apply.

(Ord. No. 021-2012, § 1, 8-23-12; Ord. No. 024-2012, § 1(a), 11-11-12)

A.  Excluded from this policy is the purchase of supplies, materials and equipment which is included within a "public works" project as defined in the California Public Contract Code. 
(Ord. No. 021-2012, § 1, 8-23-12; Ord. No. 024-2012, § 1(a), 11-11-12)  
2.24.030 - Unauthorized purchases.

(Ord. No. 021-2012, § 1, 8-23-12; Ord. No. 024-2012, § 1(a), 11-11-12)

J.  Make purchase award recommendations to the city council. 
(Ord. No. 021-2012, § 1, 8-23-12; Ord. No. 024-2012, § 1(a), 11-11-12)

2.24.060 - Vendor relations. 
It is to the city's advantage to promote and maintain good relations with vendors. The purchasing division and operating department staff shall conduct their dealings with vendors in a professional manner and shall promote equal opportunity and demonstrate fairness, integrity and courtesy in all vendor relations. When feasible to do so vendors within the city should be utilized for supplies, materials and equipment. 
(Ord. No. 021-2012, § 1, 8-23-12; Ord. No. 024-2012, § 1(a), 11-11-12)  
2.24.070 - Purchasing methods. 
All supplies purchased by the city shall be purchased in one of the following ways: 
A.  Purchases of fifteen thousand dollars or less may be made by the employees of the city by force account, by negotiated contract or by blank or open purchase order upon the authority of the purchasing officer. Prudent judgment shall be used at all times. 
B.  For purchase of between fifteen thousand dollars and one cent to thirty-four thousand nine hundred ninety-nine dollars and ninety-nine cents the purchasing officer shall attempt to obtain three competitive quotations whenever reasonably possible for purchase. The purchasing officer shall submit a requisition which includes the recommended vendor with all supporting documentation to the city council. The city council may award purchase to the lowest responsive and responsible bidder whose quote fulfills the intended purpose, quality, and delivery needs of the solicitation provided that an unencumbered appropriation for that item exists. In lieu of awarding the purchase the city council may reject bids, or authorize the purchasing officer to negotiate further to obtain terms more acceptable to the city. 
C.  Another method of purchasing items is by contract purchase orders. Contract purchase orders are the preferred method of purchasing repetitive-use items which may be common to several departments or within one department. Establishing contract purchase orders provides a means of obtaining volume pricing based upon the combined needs of all departments reduces the administrative costs associated with seeking redundant competitive bids and processing a purchase order each time an order is placed, and allows departments to order as needed, reducing the requirement to maintain large to inventories of stock. All contract purchase orders shall be approved by the city council. If a contract purchase order exists departments shall order all of their requirements from the successful vendor. No other source shall be used without prior approval of the purchasing officer, and where required hereunder, the city council. Departments shall submit in writing to the purchasing division any performance problem encountered immediately following the occurrence so that corrective action may be taken. Contract purchase orders are annual and may include options for renewal for specific products, product type, or services at agreed upon prices or pricing structure and for a specified period of time. All renewals of contract purchase orders shall be approved by the city council. 
D.  The city may participate in purchases and contracts established by other political jurisdictions provided the cooperative agreement is established following a competitive bid process. The city council shall authorize the award of any such cooperative purchase agreements. 
E.  Commodities which can be obtained from only one vendor as determined by city are exempt from competitive bidding. Sole source purchases may include proprietary items sold directly from the manufacturer items that have only one distributor authorized to sell in this area or where a certain product has been proven to be the only product that has proven to be acceptable. All sole source purchases shall be supported by written documentation signed by the appropriate department head and forwarded to the purchasing officer. Final determination that an item as a valid sole source purchase will be made by the purchasing officer or designee. 
F.  Urgency purchases are defined herein as purchases for any of the following reasons: to preserve or protect life, health or property, or in the event of a natural disaster, or to forestall a shutdown of essential public services. Urgency purchases do not require competitive quotes or properly encumbered funds be committed. The city manager may approve urgency purchases without city council action or approval. The city manager shall use sound judgment in keeping such orders to an absolute minimum. The following requirements shall apply to urgency purchases: 
1.  The purchasing officer shall be contacted as soon as possible for an advance purchase order number which may be given verbally to cover the urgent transaction. 
2.  A completed purchase requisition shall be submitted to the purchasing officer within two working days or as soon as the information is available. All purchase requisitions for urgent purchases shall be signed by the appropriate department head. 
3.  Documentation explaining the circumstances and nature of the urgency purchase shall be submitted as follows: For purchases of the competitive bid amount hereinafter described or more the city manager shall report the purchase to the city council at its next scheduled meeting for ratification. 
4.  If the urgency purchase causes any budget line item to exceed the approved budget the city manager shall obtain subsequent city council approval for an additional appropriation or to make a transfer to cover the purchase. 
G.  With regard to purchases at or exceeding thirty-five thousand dollars (the "competitive bid amount") the following provisions shall apply: 
1.  Bids shall be awarded to the "responsive" and "qualified" bidder who submits the lowest bid. 
2.  In determining the lowest "responsive" bid the following elements shall be considered in addition to price. 
a.  A responsive bid is one which is in substantial conformance with the requirements of the invitation to bid, including specification and city's contractual terms and conditions. Bidders who substitute terms and conditions or who qualify their bids in such a manner as to nullify or limit their liability shall be considered non-responsive bidders. 
b.  Conformance with the requirements of the invitation to bid may also include providing proof of insurance, completing all forms, including references and providing all other information as requested in the bid document. 
c.  The successful bidder must demonstrate the ability to fulfill a contract successfully including rendering of subsequent and continuing service. Staff may request proof of a prospective bidder's reliability. Prospective bidders may be requested to furnish proof of financial resources, a list of current or previous customers and other pertinent data. Such action may also be taken after receipt of bids. 
d.  A bidder may be determined to be non-responsive if a prospective bidder fails to furnish proof of qualifications when required. 
3.  In determining the lowest "qualified" bidder the following elements shall be considered in addition to price: 
a.  That the products offered provide the quality, fitness, and capacity for the required usage. 
b.  That the bidder has the ability, capacity and skill to perform the contract satisfactorily and within the time required.

Written documentation signed by the appropriate department head shall accompany the requisition for any sole source request.

If a brand name is incorporated into a specification a minimum of two acceptable brands shall be listed whenever possible and shall be followed by the statement "or approved equal" unless the sole source rule applies. Using specifications provided by specific manufacturer should be avoided; however, if used the name of the manufacturer, model number and other pertinent information should be indicated. The bid document shall clearly state that the use of the manufacturer's specifications are for the sole purpose of establishing the level of quality desired. The city council shall determine and approve any product submitted as an "approved equal" as to such purchases. 
D.  There may be occasions when vendor assistance is required to develop a specification. Such specifications shall be written in general terms and the vendor shall be informed that the information they provide may be used to develop specifications for a competitive bid process. The vendor shall be allowed to submit a bid, but will not be given any preference over the other bids.

D.  "Transient" means any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other agreement for a period of thirty consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of thirty days has expired unless there is an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy. In determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior to and subsequent to the effective date of this chapter may be considered. 
E.  "Rent" means the consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy of space in a hotel valued in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and property and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever. 
F.  "Operator" means the person who is the proprietor of the hotel, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his functions through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for purposes of this chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both.

For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to and shall pay a tax in the amount of six percent of the rent charged by the operator. The tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the city which is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the city. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient's ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the tax administrator may require that such tax be paid directly to the tax administrator. 
(Ord. 133 §1, 1973: Ord. 85 §3, 1965)  
3.24.040 - Operator's duties. 
Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this chapter to the same extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent charged, and each transient shall receive a receipt for payment from the operator. No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner provided in this chapter.

The certificate shall, among other things, state the following:

D.  "This Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate signifies that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax Ordinance by registering with the Tax Administrator for the purpose of collecting from transients the Transient Occupancy Tax and remitting said tax to the Tax Administrator. This certificate does not authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business or to conduct any lawful business in an unlawful manner, nor to operate a hotel without strictly complying with all local applicable laws, including but not limited to those requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or office of this City. This certificate does not constitute a permit." 
(Ord. 85 §6, 1965)  
3.24.060 - Reporting and remitting. 
Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following the close of each calendar quarter, or at the close of any shorter reporting period which may be established by the tax administrator, make a return to the tax administrator, on forms provided by him, of the total rents charged and received and the amount of tax collected for transient occupancies. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the tax administrator. The tax administrator may establish shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder if he deems it necessary in order to ensure collection of the tax and he may require further information in the return. Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust for the account of the city until payment thereof is made to the tax administrator. 
(Ord. 85 §7, 1965)  
3.24.070 - Penalties and interest. 
A.  Original Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty of ten percent of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax. 
B.  Continued Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any delinquent remittance on or before a period of thirty days following the date on which the tax first became delinquent shall pay a second delinquency penalty of ten percent of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax and the ten percent penalty first imposed. 
C.  Fraud. If the tax administrator determines that the nonpayment of any remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of twenty-five percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties stated in subsections A and B of this section. 
D.  Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the rate of one-half of one percent per month, or fraction thereof, on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until paid. 
E.  Penalties Merged With Tax. Every penalty imposed and such interest as accrues under the provisions of this section shall become a part of the tax in this chapter required to be paid. 
(Ord. 85 §8, 1965)  
3.24.080 - Failure to collect and report tax-Deter- mination by tax administrator. 
If any person fails or refuses to collect the tax and to make, within the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of the tax or any portion thereof required by this chapter, the tax administrator shall proceed in such manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to base his estimate of the tax due. As soon as the tax administrator procures such facts and information as he is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, he shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by this chapter. In case such determination is made, the tax administrator shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States Mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his last-known place of address. Such operator may within ten days after the serving or mailing of such notice make application in writing to the tax administrator for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the tax administrator shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the tax administrator shall give not less than five days' written notice in the manner prescribed in this section to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in the notice why the amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing the tax administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed in this section of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen days unless an appeal is taken as provided in Section 3.24.090. 
(Ord. 85 §9, 1965)  
3.24.090 - Appeal. 
Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the tax administrator with respect to the amount of such tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the council by filing a notice of appeal with the city clerk within fifteen days of the serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The council shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and the city clerk shall give notice in writing to such operator at his last known place of address. The findings of the city council shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed above for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of notice. 
(Ord. 85 §10, 1965)  
3.24.100 - Records. 
It is the duty of every operator liable for the collection and payment to the city of any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve, for a period of three years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of such tax as he may have been liable for the collection of and payment to the city, which records the tax administrator shall have the right to inspect at all reasonable times. 
(Ord. 85 §11, 1965)  
3.24.110 - Refunds. 
A.  Whenever the amount of any tax, interest or penalty has been overpaid or paid more than once, or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city under this chapter, it may be refunded as provided under subsections B and C of this section provided a claim in writing therefor, stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded, is filed with the tax administrator within three years of the date of payment. The claim shall be on forms furnished by the tax administrator. 
B.  An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once, or erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner prescribed by the tax administrator that the person from whom the tax has been collected was not a transient; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to the transient or credited to rent subsequently payable by the transient to the operator. 
C.  A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid, paid more than once, or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city by filing a claim in the manner provided in subsection A of this section, but only when the tax was paid by the transient directly to the tax administrator, or when the transient having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the satisfaction of the tax administrator that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax. 
D.  No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing entitlement thereto. 
(Ord. 85 §12, 1965)

Dogs may be adopted, by a new owner, after an animal adoption contract is completed and approved and upon the payment of an adoption fee, spay or neuter fee, rabies vaccination fee, and a dog license fee according to the current animal control fee schedule. Any costs incurred by the city of McFarland in assisting the successful adoption of an animal will be withdrawn from the fund maintained by the finance department and collected from fines under Section 30804.7 of the Food and Agriculture Code for failing to spay or neuter impounded dogs. 
C.  No unclaimed cat shall be sold or given away to a new owner that has not been spayed or neutered except as otherwise described in this chapter. Cats may be adopted, by a new owner, after an animal adoption contract is completed and approved and upon the payment of an adoption fee, spay or neuter fee according to the current animal control fee schedule. Any costs incurred by the city of McFarland in assisting the successful adoption of an animal will be withdrawn from the fund maintained by the finance department and collected from fines under Section 31751.7 of the Food and Agriculture Code for failing to spay or neuter impounded cats. 
D.  If an adopter fails to comply with the spaying or neutering agreement within the given time period as provided in adoption contract, the adopter shall forfeit the sterilization deposit and will be subject to fines as established by the city council by resolution. The animal control officer, police officer, other authorized personnel may extend the date by which the spaying or neutering is to be completed at their discretion for good cause shown.

1.  A law enforcement officer or animal control officer may summarily and immediately seize and impound any dog which is alleged to have bitten or attacked a human being or domestic animal pending the completion of a hearing for the purpose of determining whether the dog is a vicious or potentially dangerous animal. Any animal seized and impounded pursuant to this chapter shall be boarded and housed in the animal shelter or other place which the animal control officer, police officer, other authorized personnel deems equally secure until such time as the hearing is completed. The owner or keeper of the dog shall be liable for any cost or expenses of impounding the dog. 
2.  Whenever it is necessary to make an inspection to enforce any of the provisions of this chapter, such official may enter private property at all reasonable times to inspect the premise or to perform any duty imposed by this chapter. Provided that if such property is occupied, such official shall first present proper credentials and demand entry. If entry is refused, or if the owner or other person having control of such property is not present to permit entry, such official shall have recourse to every remedy provided by law to secure entry at a later time. 
C.  A hearing shall be held to determine if a dog is potentially dangerous or vicious or if the owner of a previously determined potentially dangerous or vicious dog is in violation of this chapter and if the dog is a significant public threat.

Service of the findings, determination and any orders issued pursuant thereto shall be made upon the animal owner either personally or by first class mail, return receipt requested. The findings, determinations and orders of the appointed hearing officer are final. 
D.  A vicious dog may be destroyed if the appointed hearing officer determines that the release of the dog would create a significant threat to the public health, safety and welfare. If the appointed hearing officer determines that the vicious dog should not be destroyed, it must impose conditions upon the dog's owner or keeper that will protect the public health, safety and welfare. 
E.  The city may prohibit the owner of a vicious dog from owning, possessing, controlling or having custody of any dog for a period of up to three years when the appointed hearing officer finds, after proceedings conducted, that such ownership or possession would create a significant threat to the public health, safety and welfare. 
F.  Notwithstanding the provisions regarding licensing and vaccination, a dog determined to be potentially dangerous or vicious must have that designation in its registration records. A fee shall be imposed in addition to the regular licensing fee to provide for the increased costs maintaining the records of the dog in an amount established by the city council by resolution. 
G.  A dog may not be declared potentially dangerous or vicious under the following circumstances: 
1.  If the dog inflicted injury or damage to a person committing a willful trespass or other tort upon the premises occupied by the owner or keeper of the dog, or was teasing, tormenting, abusing or assaulting the dog, or was committing or attempting to commit a crime. 
2.  If it was protecting or defending a person within the dog's immediate vicinity from an unjustified attack or assault.

6.04.210 - Mandatory licensing of dog kennels and catteries. 
A.  No person shall operate or maintain a dog kennel or cattery without first obtaining a license from animal control. The city council may set the fee for such applications by resolution. Such license shall be valid for a period of one year from the date of issuance. An application for renewal of such license shall be made not less than thirty days prior to the date of expiration thereof. Where a dog kennel license has been issued and is in effect, the dogs contained in such a dog kennel shall be exempt from the requirements of individual license tags, as provided in this chapter. The dog kennel license fees, and late fees if an application for license is made after the date such license or renewal application is required, shall be as may be set from time to time by resolutions of the city council. Nothing herein shall exempt a kennel or cattery from obtaining a business license pursuant to Chapter 5.04. 
B.  Application for a dog kennel or cattery license shall be filed with animal control on a form prescribed. The application form shall contain such information as may reasonably be required by animal control for the purpose of enforcement of this chapter, including, but not limited to, the current home telephone number of the caretaker of the subject dog kennel or cattery and another current telephone number for emergency use or messages when such caretaker is absent from the subject kennel or cattery. Where a dog kennel or cattery is sought to be operated upon leased or rented premises, a letter of consent from the owner of the premises shall be submitted to animal control at the time the application is submitted. 
C.  Upon receipt of an application for a dog kennel or cattery license, animal control shall make an inspection of the premises of the dog kennel or cattery for which a license is requested. No dog kennel or cattery license shall be issued or renewed unless it is in compliance with this chapter and all other applicable laws and regulations. Upon application for issuance or renewal of a dog kennel or cattery license, animal control may limit the number of dogs or cats which are to be kept or maintained on the licensed premises. 
D.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, animal control or any peace officer of the city is authorized to enter upon and inspect the premises of any dog kennel or cattery located in the city for the purpose of determining whether such dog kennel or cattery is in compliance with the provisions of this chapter and the standards for kennels and catteries incorporated in this chapter. In consideration of the issuance of a dog kennel or cattery license, each owner and operator of a dog kennel or cattery shall allow animal control to make such entry and inspection. Such right of entry shall be made a provision of the license application. Inspections made by animal control shall be made with such frequency, not less than annually, as animal control may deem appropriate. Inspections may, for good cause and at the discretion of animal control, be made without prior notice to the owner or operator of the subject dog kennel or cattery. Willful refusal on the part of the owner or operator of a dog kennel or cattery to allow inspection by animal control constitutes grounds for summary denial of an application for a dog kennel or cattery license and for summary suspension or revocation of a dog kennel or cattery license already issued. 
E.  Nonprofit corporations formed pursuant to the provisions of the California Corporations Code and Section 501(C)(3) of the Internal Revenue Code for the prevention of cruelty to animals, and which have furnished proof of such incorporations to animal control, shall not be required to pay a fee for the licenses required by this chapter. However, all other provisions of this chapter shall be applicable to any such nonprofit corporation. Each corporation claiming to be exempt from fees pursuant to the subsection shall, before issuance of any license, agree in writing to indemnify, defend and hold the city and its officers, employees and agents harmless from all liability arising out of the exercise of the license.

A.  Animal control, after providing the applicant or licensee notice and an opportunity to be heard, may in her or his discretion, suspend or revoke any license and may deny any application for renewal of a dog kennel or a cattery license if it is found that a dog kennel or cattery fails to meet all of the standards for kennels and catteries contained or incorporated in this chapter or if the dog kennel or cattery is in violation of any other applicable federal, state or local law or regulation. 
B.  Animal control shall prepare a written notice of such denial, suspension or revocation which notice shall contain a concise statement of the reason or reasons for such denial, suspension or revocation. Animal shall serve such notice upon the applicant or licensee by personal delivery or by first class mail, postage prepaid. Denial, suspension or revocation shall be effective on the tenth day after service of such notice or upon such later date as may be specified in the notice. Service shall be deemed completed upon personal delivery or deposit in the United States mail.

The applicant shall indicate on the recycling plan the maximum rate of diversion he or she believes is feasible for each material and the specific circumstances that he or she believes make it infeasible to comply with the diversion requirement. 
B.  Meeting with Recycle Coordinator. The recycle coordinator shall review the information supplied by the applicant and may meet with the applicant to discuss possible ways of meeting the diversion requirement. The recycle coordinator may request that staff from the Kern County Integrated Waste Management Authority or designee attend this meeting or may require the applicant to request a separate meeting with Kern County Integrated Waste Management Authority staff. Based on the information supplied by the applicant and, if applicable, Kern County Integrated Waste Management Authority staff or designee, the recycle coordinator shall determine whether it is possible for the applicant to meet the diversion requirement. 
C.  Granting of Exemption. If the recycle coordinator determines that it is infeasible for the applicant to meet the diversion requirement due to unique circumstances, he or she shall determine the maximum feasible diversion rate for each material and shall indicate this rate on the recycling plan submitted by the applicant. The recycle coordinator shall return a copy of the recycling plan to the applicant marked "approved for infeasible exemption" and shall notify the building department that the recycling plan has been approved. 
D.  Denial of Exemption. If the recycle coordinator determines that it is possible for the applicant to meet the diversion requirement, he or she shall so inform the applicant in writing. The applicant shall have thirty days to resubmit a recycling plan form. If the applicant fails to resubmit the recycling plan, or if the resubmitted recycling plan does not comply with Sections 8.10.030(A) and (B), the recycle coordinator shall deny the recycling plan in accordance with Section 8.10.040(B). 
(Ord. No. 292-2004, § 1, 12-9-04)  
8.10.070 - Appeals.

8.12.005. - Legislative policy. 
The city council finds and determines that the storage, accumulation, collection and disposal of refuse, trash, rubbish, solid waste, debris and other discarded material is a matter of great public concern, in that improper control of such matters creates a public nuisance, which may lead to air pollution, fire hazards, illegal dumping, insect breeding and rat infestation and other problems affecting the health, welfare and safety of the residents of the city and surrounding cities. The city council further recognizes that recycling and waste reduction is of national, regional, and local importance, and that the adoption of uniform regulations for the collection, disposal, recycling, and transportation of solid waste, recyclable and compostable materials as provided in this chapter are designed to abide by State laws and eliminate environmental problems.

8.13.020 - Gate fees. 
A.  All persons disposing or causing the disposal of nonresidential waste at county waste facilities shall pay the gate fees required by this chapter unless specifically exempted by this chapter. Gate fees may be paid in cash at county waste facilities or as designated by the director and approved by the city. 
B.  The special fees set forth in this chapter for disposing of waste that requires county personnel to oversee disposal operations, for the disposal of tires and dead animals, and for checks returned to the county without payment for any reason shall be charged regardless of whether the waste being disposed of is residential or nonresidential waste. In addition demolition or construction waste will be charged a gate fee regardless of its source of origin. 
C.  The basis for computing gate fees shall be either the actual weight of the solid waste being disposed as measured by a scale, the estimated weight of the solid waste being disposed based on the type of material and its volume in cubic yards, the type of vehicle hauling the solid waste being disposed, the number of units being disposed and/or the special nature of the load. 
(Ord. 266 §2(part), 1993)  
8.13.025 - Bin disposal fees. 
A.  A bin disposal fee shall be charged for all nonresidential waste bins that are collected by any franchise hauler or city for disposal at a county waste facility. 
B.  The bin disposal fee shall be based on the basic per ton gate fee for nonresidential waste and shall be calculated using the following formula: The basic per ton gate fee for nonresidential waste, divided by two thousand pounds equals the fee per pound. The fee per pound, multiplied by the average weight in pounds of a cubic yard of municipal solid waste found in bins, equals the bin disposal fee per cubic yard. The bin disposal fee per cubic yard multiplied by the capacity of a bin, equals the total bin disposal fee per time the bin is collected by a hauler. 
C.  The average weight of a cubic yard of municipal solid waste from nonresidential waste bins shall be confirmed by the department by performing waste volume/weight studies, at least once per year. The department shall report the results of the waste basis and shall recommend modifications to the bin disposal fee as may be appropriate. 
D.  Each franchise hauler shall maintain adequate and accurate records of the number of nonresidential waste bins, the number of times each nonresidential waste bin has been collected for each nonresidential customer served by the franchise hauler or city. 
E.  Each franchise hauler shall prepare a nonresidential bin report and forward a copy of the report to the director within five working days of producing monthly invoices or statements for bin collection services rendered by the franchise hauler or city. The director may approve extensions granting franchise haulers or cities additional time to prepare or forward their nonresidential bin reports. The information in the nonresidential bin reports shall match the information that appears on the franchise hauler's and city's invoices or statements and any information required in the bin reports may be audited by the department. The nonresidential bin reports should list, at a minimum, the number of nonresidential bins billed to each nonresidential account, the bin volume (in cubic yards), the number of times each bin was collected in the billing period, and such information as may be required by the director. Nonresidential bin reports shall be reviewed by department accounting staff to confirm that the rates charged by each franchise hauler and city are in compliance with this chapter and all other applicable city and county ordinances, resolutions, regulations and rules. The number of reported cubic yards shall be used by the department to calculate the amount of the bin disposal fee the county will receive from each franchise hauler. 
F.  Each franchise hauler shall calculate the amount owed by each nonresidential customer for the bin disposal fee for the franchise hauler's or city's current billing period and shall include that bin disposal fee, in a separate line, or column, on the invoice or statement sent to each nonresidential customer for that billing period. Any franchise hauler's invoice or statement for a bin disposal fee shall become delinquent sixty days after it is due. 
G.  Each franchise hauler shall forward all moneys received from the billing of the bin disposal fees to the director within thirty-five days from the date that appears on the invoices or statements sent by that franchise hauler to its customers with bins. 
H.  Each franchise hauler shall maintain a fidelity bond covering each of that franchise hauler's employees who has the responsibility or power to handle any bin disposal fees which are to be paid by that franchise hauler to the county pursuant to this chapter. Any such fidelity bond must be approved by the director as to form and content. In addition, any such fidelity bond shall be executed by an admitted surety with a Best's rating of no less than B+. The limit of each such fidelity bond shall be in an amount to be approved by the director and this amount shall not be less than the average monthly amount of bin disposal fees collected by the franchise hauler maintaining this fidelity bond. Each such fidelity bond shall name the city and the county as additional named insured. Each such fidelity bond shall also contain an endorsement providing that the coverage of the fidelity bond shall not be reduced nor shall the fidelity bond be canceled until thirty days after county and city has received notice of any such cancellation or reduction. Each franchise hauler shall file a copy of the required fidelity bond with the department prior to initiating any collection of bin disposal fees. 
I.  The franchise hauler's actual and reasonable administration costs to comply with the foregoing provisions of this section, including but not limited to, the costs of obtaining the required fidelity bond, shall be considered by the city in the process of setting of the franchise hauler's rates. 
(Ord. 266 §2(part), 1993)

A.  In addition to and in accordance with the determination made and the authority granted by the state under Section 22660 of the Vehicle Code to remove abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles or parts thereof as public nuisances, the city council makes the findings and declarations set out in subsection B of this section. 
B.  The accumulation and storage of abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or inoperative vehicles or parts thereof on private or public property not including highways is found to create a condition tending to reduce the value of private property, to promote blight and deterioration, to invite plundering, to create fire hazards, to constitute an attractive nuisance creating a hazard to the health and safety of minors, to create a harborage for rodents and insects, and to be injurious to the health, safety and general welfare. Therefore, the presence of an abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicle or parts thereof on private or public property not including highways, except as expressly permitted in this article, is declared to constitute a public nuisance which may be abated as such in accordance with the provisions of this article.

10.16.050 - EnforcementRight of entry granted.

If the owner of the land on which the vehicle is located appears in person at the public hearing provided in Section 10.16.090 or presents a sworn statement denying responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on his land, along with his reasons for such denial, and if the city council determines that the vehicle was placed on the land without the consent of the land owner and that he has not subsequently acquiesced in its presence upon his land, then the city council shall not assess costs of administration or removal of the vehicle against the property upon which the vehicle is located or in any way attempt to collect such costs from the landowner. 
(Ord. 148 §7, 1976)  
10.16.080 - Abatement and removal-Notice. 
Not less than a ten-day notice of intention to abate and remove the vehicle or parts thereof as a public nuisance shall be mailed, by registered mail, to the owner of the land as shown on the last equalized assessment roll and to the last registered and legal owners of record, unless the vehicle is in such condition that identification numbers are not available to determine ownership or unless the property owner and the owner of the vehicle have signed releases authorizing removal and waiving further interest in the vehicle or part thereof. Such notice shall contain a statement of the hearing rights of the owner of the property on which the vehicle is located and the owner of the vehicle. The statement shall include notice to the property owner that he may appear in person at a hearing or may present a sworn statement denying responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on the land, with his reasons for such denial, in lieu of appearing. However, for those inoperable vehicles located upon a parcel that is (1) zoned for agricultural use or (2) not improved with a residential stucture containing one or more dwelling units, the notice of intention is not required for removal of a vehicle or part thereof which is inoperable due to the absence of a motor, transmission, or wheels and incapable of being towed, is valued at less than two hundred dollars by a person specified in Section 22855 of the California Vehicle Code, and is determined by the city council to be a public nuisance presenting an immediate threat to public health or safety, provided that the property owner has signed a release authorizing removal and waiving further interest in the vehicle or part thereof. Prior to final disposition under Section 22662 of the California Vehicle Code of such a low-valued vehicle or part for which evidence of registration was recovered, the city shall provide notice to the registered and legal owners of intent to dispose of the vehicle or part, and if the vehicle or part is not claimed and removed within twelve days after the notice is mailed, from the location specified in Section 22662, final disposition may proceed. 
(Ord. 215 §1, 1988: Ord. 148 §8, 1976)

This request for a hearing shall be made to the city council within ten days after the mailing of notice of intention to abate and remove the vehicle. If the owner of the land on which the vehicle is located submits a sworn statement to the city council denying responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on his land within such time period, the statement shall be construed as a request for a hearing which does not require the presence of the owner submitting such request. If such a request for a public hearing is not received within such period, the chief of police or whomever else the city council shall so designate shall have the authority to remove the vehicle without a public hearing. 
(Ord. 148 §9, 1976)  
10.16.100 - Public hearing. 
A.  All hearings under this article shall be held before the city council which shall hear all facts and testimony it deems pertinent.

The city council shall not be limited by the technical rules of evidence. The owner of the land on which the vehicle is located may appear in person at the hearing or present a sworn written statement in time for consideration at the hearing, and deny responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on the land, with his reasons for such denial. 
B.  The city council may impose such conditions and take such other action as its deems appropriate under the circumstances to carry out the purpose of this article. It may delay the time for removal of the vehicle or part thereof if, in its opinion, the circumstances justify it. At the conclusion of the public hearing, the city council may find that a vehicle or part thereof has been abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or is inoperative on private or public property and order the same removed from the property as a public nuisance and disposed of as provided in this article, and determine the administrative costs and the cost of removal to be charged against the owner of the land. The order requiring removal shall include a description of the vehicle or part thereof and the correct identification number and license number of the vehicle, if available at the site.

Chapter 15.12 - FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT[1] 
Sections: 
Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 301-2005, adopted September 8, 2005, repealed the Chapter 15.12, §§ 15.12.01015.12.510, and enacted a new Chapter 15.12 as set out herein. The former Chapter 15.12 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 262, 1993. 
 
ARTICLE I. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND METHODS 
 
15.12.010 - Statutory authorization. 
The legislature of the state of California has in Government Code Sections 65302, 65560, and 65800 conferred upon local government units authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city council of the city of McFarland does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations. 
(Ord. No. 301-2005, § 1.1, 9-8-05)  
15.12.020 - Findings of fact. 
A.  The flood hazard areas of the city of McFarland are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
B.  These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities also contribute to the flood loss. 
(Ord. No. 301-2005, § 1.2, 9-8-05)  
15.12.030 - Statement of purpose. 
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
A.  Protect human life and health; 
B.  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
C.  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
D.  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
E.  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
F.  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage; 
G.  Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and 
H.  Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. 
(Ord. No. 301-2005, § 1.3, 9-8-05)  
15.12.040 - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions to: 
A.  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities; 
B.  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
C.  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters; 
D.  Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
E.  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. 
(Ord. No. 301-2005, § 1.4, 9-8-05)  
ARTICLE II. - DEFINITIONS 
 
15.12.050 - Definitions. 
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application. 
"Accessory use" means a use which is incidental and subordinate to the principal use of the parcel of land on which it is located. 
"Appeal" means a request for a review of the floodplain administrator's interpretation of any provision of this chapter. 
"Area of shallow flooding" means a designated AH zone on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM). The base flood depths range from one to three feet; a clearly defined channel does not exist; the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; and velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
"Area of special flood hazard" - see "special flood hazard area." 
"Base flood" means a flood which has a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (also called the "one hundred-year flood"). Base flood is the term used throughout this chapter. 
"Basement" means any area of the building having its floor subgrade  i.e., below ground level  on all sides. 
"Building"  see "structure." 
"Development" means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials. 
"Encroachment" means the advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill, excavation, buildings, permanent structures or development into a floodplain which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain. 
"Existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of this chapter. 
"Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
"Flood, flooding, or flood water" means: 
1.  A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source; and/or mudslides (i.e., mudflows); and 
2.  The condition resulting from flood-related erosion. 
"Flood hazard boundary map" means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated the areas of flood hazards. 
"Flood insurance rate map (FIRM)" means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
"Flood insurance study" means the official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the flood insurance rate map, the flood boundary and floodway map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood. 
"Floodplain or flood-prone area" means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source - see "flooding." 
"Floodplain administrator" is the individual appointed to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations. 
"Floodplain management" means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans. 
"Floodplain management regulations" means this chapter and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other application of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state or local regulations in any combination thereof which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. 
"Floodproofing" means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents. 
"Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. Also referred to as "regulatory floodway." 
"Floodway fringe" is that area of the floodplain on either side of the "regulatory floodway" where encroachment may be permitted. 
"Fraud and victimization" as related to Article VI, Variance Procedure, of this chapter, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the floodplain administrator will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty to one hundred years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates. 
"Functionally dependent use" means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, and does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
"Governing body" is the local governing unit, i.e. county or municipality, that is empowered to adopt and implement regulations to provide for the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. 
"Hardship" as related to Article VI, Variance Procedure, of this chapter means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The floodplain administrator requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. 
"Highest adjacent grade" means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
"Historic structure" means any structure that is: 
1.  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
2.  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
3.  Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of Interior; or 
4.  Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either by an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
"Levee" means a man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
"Levee system" means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accord with sound engineering practices. 
"Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. 
1.  An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure below the lowest floor that is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor provided it conforms to applicable non-elevation design requirements, including, but not limited to: 
a.  The wet floodproofing standard in Section 15.12.170(C)(3); 
b.  The anchoring standards in Section 15.12.170(A); 
c.  The construction materials and methods standards in Section 15.12.170(B); and 
d.  The standards for utilities in Section 15.12.180. 
2.  For residential structures, all subgrade enclosed areas are prohibited as they are considered to be basements. This prohibition includes below-grade garages and storage areas. 
"Manufactured home" means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". 
"Manufactured home park or subdivision" means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
"Market value" shall be determined by estimating the cost to replace the structure in new condition and adjusting that cost figure by the amount of depreciation which has accrued since the structure was constructed. The cost of replacement of the structure shall be based on a square foot cost factor determined by reference to a building cost estimating guide recognized by the building construction industry. The amount of depreciation shall be determined by taking into account the age and physical deterioration of the structure and functional obsolescence as approved by the floodplain administrator, but shall not include economic or other forms of external obsolescence. Use of replacement costs or accrued depreciation factors different from those contained in recognized building cost estimating guides may be considered only if such factors are included in a report prepared by an independent professional appraiser and supported by a written explanation of the differences. 
"Mean sea level" means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
"New construction," for floodplain management purposes, means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of this chapter, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
"New manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter. 
"Obstruction" includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried downstream. 
"One hundred-year flood" or "100-year flood" see "Base flood." 
"Primary structure" means a structure used for the principal use of the property as distinguished from an accessory use. 
"Public safety and nuisance" as related to Article VI, Variance Procedure, of this chapter means that the granting of a variance must not result in anything which is injurious to safety or health of an entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin. 
"Recreational vehicle" means a vehicle which is: 
1.  Built on a single chassis; 
2.  Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
3.  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-duty truck; and 
4.  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
"Regulatory floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. 
"Remedy a violation" means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with State or local floodplain management regulations, or, if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of the chapter or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing state or federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development. 
"Riverine" means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc. 
"Sheet flow area" see "area of shallow flooding." 
"Special flood hazard area (SFHA)" means an area in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. It is shown on an FIRM as zone A, AO, A1-A30, AE, A99, AH. 
"Start of construction" includes substantial improvement and other proposed new development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty days from the date of the permit. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufacture home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
"Structure" means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground; this includes a gas or liquid storage tank or a manufactured home. 
"Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
"Substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other proposed new development of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
1.  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations or state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
2.  Any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure". 
"Variance" means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter. 
"Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
"Water surface elevation" means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, (or other datum, where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas. 
"Watercourse" means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, arroyo, channel or other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may occur.

ARTICLE III. - GENERAL PROVISIONS 
 
15.12.060 - Lands to which this chapter applies. 
This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazards within the jurisdiction of the city of McFarland. 
(Ord. No. 301-2005, § 3.1, 9-8-05)  
15.12.070 - Basis for establishing the areas of special flood hazard. 
The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the flood insurance study (FIS) dated September 29, 1986 and accompanying flood insurance rate maps (FIRMs), dated September 29, 1986, and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. This FIS and attendant mapping is the minimum area of applicability of this chapter and may be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation of this chapter and which are recommended to the city council by the floodplain administrator. The flood insurance study and the federal insurance rate maps are on file at the McFarland City Hall, 401 West Kern Avenue, McFarland, California, 93250.

For purposes of this chapter, "adversely affects" means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point. 
B.  Review, Use and Development of Other Base Flood Data. When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Section 15.12.070, the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or state agency, or other source, in order to administer Article V. Any such information shall be submitted to the city council for adoption. 
C.  Notification of Other Agencies. In alteration or relocation of a watercourse: 
1.  Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of Water Resources prior to alteration or relocation. 
2.  Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency; and 
3.  Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained. 
D.  Documentation of Floodplain Development. Obtain and maintain for public inspection and make available as needed the following: 
1.  Certification required by Sections 15.12.170(C)(1) and 15.12.200 (lowest floor elevations); 
2.  Certification required by Section 15.12.170(C)(2) (elevation or floodproofing of nonresidential structures);

(Ord. No. 301-2005, § 4.4, 9-8-05)  
ARTICLE V. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 
 
15.12.170 - Standards of construction. 
In all areas of special flood hazards the following standards are required: 
A.  Anchoring. 
1.  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy; 
2.  All manufactured homes shall meet the anchoring standards of Section 15.12.200. 
B.  Construction Materials and Methods. All new construction and substantial improvement shall be constructed: 
1.  With flood resistant materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
2.  Using methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
3.  With electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; and if 
4.  Within zones AH or AO, so that there are adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide floodwaters around and away from proposed structures. 
C.  Elevation and Floodproofing. 
1.  Residential construction, new or substantial improvement, shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the base flood elevation in all zones. 
Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor including basement shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor, and verified by the community building inspector to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator. 
2.  Nonresidential construction, new or substantial improvement, shall either be elevated to conform with Section 15.12.170(C)(1) or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities. 
a.  Be floodproofed below the elevation recommended under Section 15.12.170(C)(1) so that the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water; 
b.  Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and 
c.  Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the standards of this section (15.12.170(C)(2)) are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator. 
3.  All new construction and substantial improvement with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (excluding basements) that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and which are subject to flooding, shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwater. Designs for meeting this requirement must exceed the following minimum criteria: 
a.  Have a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwater; or 
b.  Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect. 
4.  Manufactured homes shall also meet the standards in Section 15.12.200. 
(Ord. No. 301-2005, § 5.1, 9-8-05)  
15.12.180 - Standards for utilities. 
A.  All new and replacement water supply and sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate: 
1.  Infiltration of flood waters into the systems; and 
2.  Discharge from the systems into flood waters. 
B.  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them, or contamination from them during flooding. 
(Ord. No. 301-2005, § 5.2, 9-8-05)  
15.12.190 - Standards for subdivisions. 
A.  All preliminary subdivision proposals shall identify the flood hazard area and the elevation of the base flood. 
B.  All subdivision plans will provide the elevation of proposed structure(s) and pad(s). If the site is filled above the base flood elevation, the lowest floor and pad elevations shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor and provided to the floodplain administrator. 
C.  All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage. 
D.  All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage. 
E.  All subdivisions shall provide adequate drainage to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
(Ord. No. 301-2005, § 5.3, 9-8-05)  
15.12.200 - Standards for manufactured homes. 
A.  All manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved, within zone AH on the community's flood insurance rate map, on sites located 
1.  Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; 
2.  In a new manufactured home park or subdivision; 
3.  In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or 
4.  In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on a site upon which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be securely fastened to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
B.  All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within zone AH on the community's flood insurance rate map that are not subject to the provisions of subsection A of this section will be securely fastened to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, and be elevated so that either the: 
1.  Lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation; or 
2.  Manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than thirty-six inches in height above grade. 
Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor including basement shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor, and verified by the community building inspector to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator. 
(Ord. No. 301-2005, § 5.4, 9-8-05)  
15.12.210 - Standards for recreational vehicles. 
A.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites within zone AH on the community's flood insurance rate map will either: 
1.  Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty consecutive days, and be fully licensed and ready for highway use  a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions; or 
2.  Meet the permit requirements of Article IV of this chapter and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes in Section 15.12.200(A). 
(Ord. No. 301-2005, § 5.5, 9-8-05)  
15.12.220 - Floodways. 
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 15.12.070 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters, which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply: 
A.  Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvement, and other new development unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base flood elevation during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
B.  If subsection A of this section is satisfied, all new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article V. 
(Ord. No. 301-2005, § 5.6, 9-8-05)  
ARTICLE VI. - VARIANCE PROCEDURE 
 
15.12.230 - Nature of variances. 
The variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristics must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners. 
It is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. 
(Ord. No. 301-2005, § 6.1, 9-8-05)  
15.12.240 - Appeal board. 
A.  In passing upon requests for variances, the city council shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the: 
1.  Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
2.  Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
3.  Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property; 
4.  Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
5.  Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
6.  Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
7.  Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
8.  Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
9.  Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
10.  Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and 
11.  Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges. 
B.  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that 
1.  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage, and 
2.  Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the applicant in the Office of the Kern County Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land; and a conformed copy of said recordation shall be provided to the floodplain administrator as indicated in the conditions attached to the variance. 
C.  The floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(Ord. No. 301-2005, § 6.2, 9-8-05)  
15.12.250 - Conditions for variances. 
A.  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the procedures of Articles IV and V of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
B.  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "historic structures" (as defined in Section 15.12.050 of this chapter) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
C.  Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
D.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the "minimum necessary" considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the floodplain administrator need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the floodplain administrator believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance. 
E.  Variances shall only be issued upon a: 
1.  Showing of good and sufficient cause; 
2.  Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional "hardship" (as defined in Section 15.12.050 of this chapter) to the applicant; and 
3.  Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance (as defined in Section 15.12.050  see "public safety or nuisance"), cause fraud or victimization (as defined in Section 15.12.02) of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
F.  Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of Sections 15.12.250(A)15.12.250(E) are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance. 
G.  Upon consideration of the factors of Section 15.12.240(A) and the purposes of this chapter, the floodplain administrator may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 301-2005, § 6.3, 9-8-05)

Chapter 15.30 - LANDSCAPE WATER CONSERVATION 
Sections: 
 
15.30.010 - Definitions. 
As used in this chapter: 
"Anti-drain valve or check valve" means a valve located under a sprinkler head to hold water in the system so it minimizes drainage from the lower elevation sprinkler heads. 
"Application rate" means the depth of water applied to a given area, usually measured in inches per hour. 
"Applied water" means the portion of water supplied by the irrigation system to the landscape. 
"Automatic controller" means a mechanical or solid state timer, capable of operating valve stations to set the days and length of time of a water application. 
"Backflow prevention device" means a safety device used to prevent pollution or contamination of the water supply due to the reverse flow of water from the irrigation system. 
"Conservation factor (0.62)" means a number that converts the maximum applied water allowance from acre-inches per acre per year to gallons per square foot per year. The conversion factor is calculated as follows: 
(325,851 gallons/43,560 square feet)/12 inches = (0.62) 
325,851 gallons = one acre foot 
43,560 square feet = one acre 
12 inches = one foot 
To convert gallons per year to one hundred-cubic-feet per year, another common billing unit for water, divide gallons per year by seven hundred forty-eight. (748 gallons = 100 cubic feet) 
"Ecological restoration project" means a project where the site is intentionally altered to establish a defined, indigenous, historic ecosystem. 
"Effective precipitation or usable rainfall" means the portion of total precipitation that is used by the plants. Precipitation is not a reliable source of water, but can contribute to some degree toward the water needs of the landscape. 
"Emitter" means drip irrigation fittings that deliver water slowly from the system to the soil. 
"Established landscape" means the point at which plants in the landscape have developed roots into the soil adjacent to the root ball. 
"Establishment period" means the first year after installing the plant in the landscape. 
"Estimated applied water use" means the portion of the estimated total water use that is derived from applied water. The estimated applied water use shall not exceed the maximum applied water allowance. The estimated applied water use may be the sum of the water recommended through the irrigation schedule, as referenced in subsection C of Section 15.30.040, Estimated Applied Water Use. 
"Estimated total water use" means the annual total amount of water estimated to be needed to keep the plants in the landscaped area healthy. It is based upon such factors as the local evapotranspiration rate, the size of the landscaped area, the types of plants, and the efficiency of the irrigation system, as described in subsection D of Section 15.30.040, Estimated Total Water Use. 
"ET adjustment factor" means a factor of 0.8, that, when applied to reference evapotranspiration, adjusts for plant factors and irrigation efficiency, two major influences upon the amount of water that needs to be applied to the landscape. A combined plan mix with a site-wide average of 0.5 is the basis of the plant factor portion of this calculation. The irrigation efficiency for purposes of the ET adjustment factor is 0.625. Therefore, the ET adjustment factor (0.8) = (0.5/0.625). 
"Evapotranspiration" means the quantity of water evaporated from adjacent soil surfaces and transpired by plants during a specific time. 
"Flow rate" means the rate at which water flows through pipes and valves (gallons per minute or cubic feet per second). 
"Hydrozone" means a portion of the landscaped area having plants with similar water needs that are served by a valve or set of valves with the same schedule. A hydrozone may be irrigated or nonirrigated. For example, a naturalized area planted with native vegetation that will not need supplemental irrigation once established is a nonirrigated hydrozone. 
"Infiltration rate" means the rate of water entry into the soil expressed as a depth of water per unit of time (inches per hour). 
"Irrigation efficiency" means the measurement of the amount of water beneficially used divided by the amount of water applied. Irrigation efficiency is derived from measurements and estimates of irrigation system characteristics and management practices. The minimum irrigation efficiency for purposes of this chapter is 0.625. Greater irrigation efficiency can be expected from well-designed and maintained systems. 
"Landscape irrigation audit" means a process to perform site inspections, evaluate irrigation systems, and develop efficient irrigation schedules. 
"Landscaped area" means the entire parcel less the building footprint, driveways, nonirrigated portions of parking lots, hardscapes, such as decks and patios, and other nonporous areas. Water features are included in the calculation of the landscaped area. Areas dedicated to edible plants, such as orchards or vegetable gardens are not included. 
"Lateral lines" means the water delivery pipeline that supplies water to the emitters or sprinklers from the valve. 
"Main line" means the pressurized pipeline that delivers water source to the valve or outlet. 
"Maximum applied water allowance" means, for design purposes, the upper limit of annual applied water for the established landscaped area as specified in subsection B of Section 15.30.040. It is based upon the area's reference evapotranspiration, the ET adjustment factor, and the size of the landscaped area. The estimated applied water use shall not exceed the maximum applied water allowance. 
"Mined-land reclamation projects" means any surface mining operation with a reclamation plan approved in accordance with the Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975. 
"Mulch" means any material such as leaves, bark, straw or other materials left loose and applied to the soil surface for the beneficial purpose of reducing evapotranspiration. 
"Operating pressure" means the pressure at which a system of sprinklers is designed to operate, usually indicated at the base of a sprinkler. 
"Overhead sprinkler irrigation system" means those with high flow rates (pop-ups, impulse sprinklers, rotors, etc.) 
"Overspray" means the water which is delivered beyond the landscaped area, wetting pavements, walks, structures, or other nonlandscaped areas. 
"Plant factor" means a factor that when multiplied by reference evapotranspiration, estimates the amount of water used by plants. For purposes of this chapter, the average plant factor of low water using plants ranges from 0 to 0.3, for average water using plants the range is 0.4 to 0.6, and for high water using plants the range is 0.7 to 1.0. 
"Rain-sensing device" means a system which automatically shuts off the irrigation system when it rains. 
"Record drawing or as-builts" means a set of reproducible drawings which show significant changes in the work made during construction and which are usually based on drawings marked up in the field and other data furnished by the contractor. 
"Recreational area" means areas of active play or recreation such as sports fields, school yards, picnic grounds, or other areas with intense foot traffic. 
"Recycled water," reclaimed water" or "treated sewage effluent water" means treated or recycled waste water of a quality suitable for nonpotable uses such as landscape irrigation; not intended for human consumption. 
"Reference evapotranspiration" or ETo means a standard measurement of environmental parameters which affect the water use of plants. ETo is given in inches per day, month, or year. For the Delano-McFarland area the reference evapotranspiration in inches per month are: 
Jan 0.9 	Apr 4.7 	Jul 8.5 	Oct 3.4 
Feb 1.8 	May 6.6 	Aug 7.3 	Nov 1.4 
Mar 3.1 	Jun 7.7 	Sep 5.4 	Dec 0.7 
 
The annual ETo is 52.0. 
The ETo is an estimate of the evapotranspiration of a large field of four to seven-inch tall, cool-season grass that is well-watered. Reference evapotranspiration is used as the basis of determining the maximum applied water allowances so that regional differences in climate can be accommodated. 
"Rehabilitated landscape" means any relandscaping project that requires a permit. 
"Runoff" means water which is not absorbed by the soil or landscape to which it is applied and flows from the area. For example, runoff may result from water that is applied at too great a rate (application rate exceeds infiltration rate) or when there is a severe slope. 
"Soil-moisture-sensing device" means a device that measures the amount of moisture in the soil. 
"Soil texture" means the classification of soil based on the percentage of sand, silt and clay in the soil. 
"Sprinkler head" means a device which sprays water through a nozzle. 
"Static water pressure" means the pipeline or municipal water supply pressure when water is not flowing. 
"Station" means an area served by one valve or by a set of valves that operate simultaneously. 
"Turf" means a surface layer of earth containing mowed grass with its roots. Annual bluegrass, Kentucky bluegrass, Perennial ryegrass, Red fescue, and Tall fescue are cool-season grasses. Bermudagrass, Kikuyugrass, Seashore paspalum, St. Augustinegrass, Zoysiagrass, and Buffalo grass are warm-season grasses. 
"Valve" means a device used to control the flow of water in the irrigation system. 
"Water conservation concept statement" means a one-page checklist and a narrative summary of the project.

B.  The Maximum Applied Water Allowance. 
1.  A project's maximum applied water allowance shall be calculated using the following formula: 
MAWA 	= 	(ETo) (0.8) (LA) (0.62) where: 

MAWA 	= 	Maximum applied water allowance (gallons per year) 
ETo 	= 	Reference evapotranspiration (inches/year) 
0.8 	= 	ET adjustment factor 
LA 	= 	Landscaped area (square feet) 
0.62 	= 	Conversion factor (to gallons/square foot) 
 
2.  Two example calculations of the maximum applied water allowance are: 
a.  Project Site One. Landscaped area of fifty thousand square feet in Fresno: 
MAWA = (ETo) (.8) (LA) (.62) 
= (51 inches) (.8) (50,000 sq. ft.) (.62) 
Maximum applied water allowance = 1,264,800 gallons per year or 1,691 hundred- 
cubic-feet per year: 1,264/748 = 1,691 
b.  Project Site Two. Landscaped area of fifty thousand square feet in San Francisco: 
MAWA = (ETo) (.8) (LA) (.62) 
= (35 inches) (.8) (50,000 sq. ft.) (.62) 
Maximum applied water allowance = 868,000 gallons per year or 1,160 hundred-cubic-feet per year. 
3.  Portions of landscaped areas in public and private projects such as parks, playgrounds, sport fields, golf courses, or school yards where turf provides a playing surface or serves other recreational purposes are considered recreational areas and may require water in addition to the maximum applied water allowance.

The estimated total water use may be calculated by summing the amount of water recommended in the irrigation schedule and adding any amount of water expected from effective precipitation (not to exceed twenty-five percent of the local annual mean precipitation) or may be calculated from a formula such as the following: 
The estimated total water use for the entire landscaped area equals the sum of the estimated water use of all hydrozones in that landscaped area. 
EWU (hydrozone) 	= 	(ETo) (PF) (HA) (.62) 
		    (IE) 
EWU (hydrozone) 	= 	Estimated water use (gallons/year) 
ETo 	= 	Reference evapotranspiration (inches/year) 
PF 	= 	Plant factor 
HA 	= 	Hydrozone area (sq ft) 
(.62) 	= 	Conversion factor 
IE 	= 	Irrigation efficiency 
 
2.  If the estimated total water use is greater than the estimated applied water use due to precipitation being included as a source of water, an effective precipitation disclosure statement shall be included in the landscape documentation package.

A.  The approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall confer a vested right to proceed with development in substantial compliance with the ordinances, policies, and standards described in Government Code Section 66474.2. 
However, if Section 66474.2 of the Government Code is repealed, the approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall confer a vested right to proceed with development in substantial compliance with the ordinances, policies, and standards in effect at the time the vesting tentative map is approved or conditionally approved. 
Fees required as conditions of approval of a vesting tentative map shall be such fees as are in effect as of the date of filing of the final map therefore, except that whenever a subdivider elects to defer payment of any such fees until development or issuance of a building permit, such fees shall be those in effect as of such later date. 
B.  Notwithstanding subsection A of this section, a permit, approval, extension, or entitlement may be made conditional or denied if any of the following are determined: 
1.  A failure to do so would place the residents of the subdivision or the immediate community, or both, in a condition dangerous to their health or safety, or both; 
2.  The condition or denial is required in order to comply with state or federal law. 
C.  The rights referred to herein shall expire if a final map is not approved prior to the expiration of the vesting tentative map as provided in Section 16.22.080. If the final map is approved, these rights shall last for the following periods of time: 
1.  An initial time period of twelve months. Where several final maps are recorded on various phases of a project covered by a single vesting tentative map, this initial time period shall begin for each phase when the final map for that phase is recorded;

The city shall deny such a vesting tentative map or approve it conditioned on the subdivider, or his or her designee, obtaining the necessary change in the zoning ordinance to eliminate the inconsistency. If the change in the zoning ordinance is obtained, the approved or conditionally approved vesting tentative map shall, notwithstanding Section 16.22.090, confer the vested right to proceed with the development in substantial compliance with the change in the zoning ordinance and the map, as approved. 
The rights conferred by this section shall be for the time periods set forth in Section 16.22.090(C).

Chapter 16.34 - PARKS AND RECREATIONAL LAND DIVISION[1] 
Sections: 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 336-2008, § 1, adopted November 19, 2008, in effect repealed the former Chapter 16.34, §§ 16.34.01016.34.060, and enacted a new Chapter 16.34 as set out herein. The former Chapter 16.34 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 216, 1988 and Ord. No. 321-2007, adopted August 9, 2007. 
 
16.34.010 - Purpose. 
City believes that it is necessary to have park and recreational facilities available to its residents. The purpose of this chapter is to describe how such facilities for new subdivisions will be financed and provided by fees described in Government Code Sections 66000 et seq. ("impact fees") and fees, dedications of land in lieu of thereof, or both under Government Code Section 66477 ("QuimbyAct"). Park and recreational facilities within the city are owned, developed, and operated by the McFarland Recreation and Parks District, a subdivision of the state of California duly organized pursuant to Sections 5780 et seq. of the Public Resources Code of the state ("district"). The city also may own, develop, and operate such facilities. The land to be conveyed or the fees to be paid under the Quimby Act and by impact fees adopted by the district in conformance with this chapter shall be conveyed or paid directly to the district in the manner hereinafter described. Use of the land and the fees shall be pursuant to the schedule developed by the district in its master plan ("master plan") specifying how, when, and where the district will use the land or the fees, or both, to develop park and recreational facilities. Impact fees adopted by the city shall be paid to the city. 
(Ord. No. 002-2009, § 1, 5-14-09; Ord. No. 326-2008, § 1, 11-19-08)  
16.34.020 - Requirements. 
As a condition of approval of a tentative subdivision map or residential parcel map within the jurisdiction of the city, the subdivider shall dedicate land, pay a fee in lieu thereof, or both, pursuant to the Quimby Act and pay impact fees as set forth in this chapter, for park and recreational purposes at the time and according to the standards and formula contained in this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 002-2009, § 1, 5-14-09; Ord. No. 326-2008, § 1, 11-19-08)  
16.34.030 - Formula for dedication of land or payment of fees. 
A.  The amount and location of land to be dedicated or fees to be paid under the Quimby Act will be jointly determined by the city and the district, provided, however, that the master plan will be used in the determination of same unless the city, in the reasonable exercise of its discretion, determines that other documentation, studies, or information should receive the same level of consideration as the master plan. The formula for determining the amount of land to be dedicated shall be established by use of the following formula: 
A = 5.0 (No.D.U. × D.F.) 
1000 
 
The terms used in the above formula have the following definitions: 
1.  "A" means the area in acres required to be dedicated or to be appraised for payment of a fee. 
2.  "5.0" means the number of acres per one thousand persons. 
3.  "No. D.U." means the number of dwelling units proposed in the subdivision which shall be the number proposed for construction. When the actual number of units to be considered is unknown, it shall be assumed for the purpose of this chapter that the maximum number permissible by law will be constructed. 
4.  "D.F." means the density factor applicable to the subdivision which shall be as described in Subsection (a)(2) of Section 66477 of the Government Code of the state. 
B.  The amount of the impact fees for the district shall be established by the district and the amount of the impact fees for the city shall be established by the city. 
(Ord. No. 002-2009, § 1, 5-14-09; Ord. No. 326-2008, § 1, 11-19-08)  
16.34.040 - Procedure for determining dedication of land and payment of fees under the Quimby Act. 
A.  At the time of submission of a tentative tract map or parcel map ("map"), city shall send a copy of the map to the district. The district shall thereafter notify the city that either land shall be dedicated or fees paid or both under the Quimby Act and, if land is to be dedicated, district shall designate the location of the land to be dedicated which shall be in compliance with the city's general plan and the district's master plan. The subdivider shall show the land on its map as open space for park or recreational facilities required to be dedicated to the district. The land shall be conveyed directly to the district by the subdivider. 
B.  Where a fee is required to be paid in lieu of land dedication under the Quimby Act, the amount of such fee shall be determined by appraisal to determine the fair market value of the land which would otherwise be required to be dedicated. The cost for the appraisal shall be paid by the subdivider. The appraiser shall be chosen by the district and the district shall obtain the appraisal. The fair market value shall be based on the value of the lots as if contained in a tentative tract map or parcel map approved or conditionally approved by the planning commission or the city council and ready for approval as a final map and for recordation. The appraised value shall be reviewed annually and revised accordingly until the fees are paid in full. The subdivider shall pay the cost of such annual review and revision. The fees shall be paid directly to the district by the subdivider. 
C.  Conveyance of dedicated land or payment of fees under the Quimby Act shall be made prior to recordation of the final tract map or parcel map or simultaneously therewith and conveyance of dedicated land shall be by grant deed in fee simple to the district by the subdivider free and clear of all monetary liens and those encumbrances which will unreasonably interfere with the use of the property for park and recreation purposes as reasonably determined by district. 
(Ord. No. 002-2009, § 1, 5-14-09; Ord. No. 326-2008, § 1, 11-19-08)  
16.34.050 - Criteria for requiring both land dedication and payment of fees. 
A.  When only a portion of the land for the subdivision is proposed in the master plan as the site for a park or recreational facilities, such portion shall be dedicated, and a fee computed under the Quimby Act pursuant to the provisions of Sections 16.34.030(A) and 16.34.040 shall be paid for any additional land that would have been required to be dedicated. When a major part of the local park or recreational facility has already been acquired by the district and only a small portion of land is needed from the development to complete the site, the remaining portion shall be dedicated and a fee computed and paid for any additional land that would have been required to be dedicated pursuant to Section 16.34.030(A). 
B.  Where the proposed subdivision has been recently annexed into the city and if not yet incorporated into the master plan, the amount of land dedication or fee to be paid shall be determined as described in Section 16.34.030(A) unless the subdivider requests that the land be incorporated into the master plan in which case the district shall proceed to do so at the sole cost of the subdivider and, after completion of same, the land to be dedicated or fees to be paid shall be based on the updated master plan. 
(Ord. No. 002-2009, § 1, 5-14-09; Ord. No. 326-2008, § 1, 11-19-08)  
16.34.060 - Credit for improvements and equipment. 
If the subdivider proposes to make park and recreational improvements or install park and recreational equipment to the dedicated land, subdivider shall first determine from the district the value of those improvements or equipment and the amount of the credit to be given to the subdivider by the district toward the amount of land to be dedicated or the fees to be paid under the Quimby Act and this chapter. If the improvements or the equipment are to be made a condition of the map or development, district shall provide specific information to the city with regard to same sufficient for the city to include the foregoing as conditions, otherwise, they shall not be included. 
(Ord. No. 002-2009, § 1, 5-14-09; Ord. No. 326-2008, § 1, 11-19-08)  
16.34.070 - Timing for conveyance of land or payment of fees. 
Notwithstanding any other provision to the contrary under this chapter, city may authorize recordation of a final map or issuance of building permits prior to the conveyance of land or payment of fees under the Quimby Act or prior to payment of impact fees but shall not issue a certificate of occupancy on any residential dwelling or unit within the development until the land has been conveyed or the fees paid. 
(Ord. No. 002-2009, § 1, 5-14-09; Ord. No. 326-2008, § 1, 11-19-08)

CHAPTER 17.102 - SPECIFIC USE DEVELOPMENT STANDARDS 
Sections: 
 
17.102.010 - Purpose and intent. 
It is the purpose and intent of this chapter to identify land uses and activities which possess the potential to cause deleterious effects to the community in which they are located and to subject such uses to specific regulations with the intent of minimizing to the extent practical these deleterious effects. Further it is intended that in the zone districts in which these land uses are permitted they are conducted in a manner which is consistent with the protection of the public health safety and welfare in accordance with the goals policies objectives and implementation programs contained in the general plan. 
It is further determined that it is in the interest of public health safety and welfare of the citizens of the city to protect minors from viewing publicly displayed harmful matter and that pursuant to Penal Code Section 313.1(d) and (e) the city is authorized to adopt ordinances which restrict the display of harmful matter to minors by the use of blinder racks. It has also been found that there exists an increasing trend toward the display of harmful matter within the meaning of Penal Code Section 313, at grocery stores, convenience stores, video stores, and other retail outlets, as well as from news racks, and that restriction of public display of such harmful matter will keep the adverse impacts of such harmful matter upon minors to a minimum. 
(Ord. No. 001-2009, § 1, 6-11-09)  
17.102.020 - Applicability. 
The provisions of this chapter shall apply to the activities and land uses specified by this chapter in addition to any standards and regulations established by this title which may also be applicable to these specified land uses or activities. 
(Ord. No. 001-2009, § 1, 6-11-09)  
17.102.030 - Adult entertainment. 
A.  Applicability. It is the intent of this chapter to prevent community wide adverse economic impacts, increased crime, decreased property values, and the deterioration of neighborhoods which can be brought about by the concentration of businesses in close proximity to each other or proximity to other incompatible uses such as schools for minors, churches, and residentially zoned districts or uses. The city council finds that it has been demonstrated in various communities that the concentration of businesses causes an increase in the number of transients in the area and an increase in the crime, and in addition the effects described above can cause other businesses and residents to move elsewhere. It is, therefore, the purpose of this title to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the concentration of adult oriented businesses or their close proximity to incompatible uses, while permitting the location of adult oriented businesses in certain areas. 
B.  Findings of the City Council. 
1.  The city council, in adopting the ordinance codified in this chapter, takes legislative notice of the existence and content of the following studies concerning the adverse secondary side effects of businesses in other cities: American Center for Law and Justice (1996); New York, New York (1994); State of New Jersey (1994); Garden Grove, California (1991); Tucson, Arizona (1990); Seattle, Washington (1989); Austin, Texas (1986); Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (1986); Indianapolis, Indiana (1984); Houston, Texas (1983); Beaumont, Texas (1982); Minneapolis, Minnesota (1980); Phoenix, Arizona (1979); Whittier, California (1978); Amarillo, Texas (1977); Cleveland, Ohio (1977); Los Angeles, California (1977). The City Council finds that these studies are relevant to the problems addressed by the City in enacting this ordinance to regulate the adverse secondary side effects of adult oriented businesses and more specifically finds that these studies provide convincing evidence that: 
a.  Adult-oriented businesses are linked to increases in the crime rates in those areas in which they are located and in surrounding areas. 
b.  Both the proximity of adult-oriented businesses to sensitive land uses and the concentration of adult-oriented businesses tend to result in the blighting and deterioration of the areas in which they are located. 
c.  The proximity and concentration of adult-oriented businesses adjacent to residential, recreational, religious, educational, and other adult-oriented business uses can cause other businesses and residence to move elsewhere. 
d.  There is substantial evidence that an increase in crime tends to accompany, concentrate around and be aggravated by adult-oriented businesses, including, but not limited to, an increase in the crimes of narcotics distribution and use, prostitution, pandering, and violence against persons and property. The studies from other cities establish convincing evidence that adult-oriented businesses which are not regulated as to permissible locations often have a deleterious effect on nearby businesses in residential areas, causing, among other adverse secondary effects, an increase in crime and a decrease in property values. 
2.  Based on the foregoing, the city council finds and determines that special regulation of adult-oriented businesses is necessary to ensure that their adverse secondary side effects will not contribute to an increase in crime rates or to the blighting or deterioration of the areas in which they are located or surrounding areas. The need for such special regulations is based upon the recognition that adult-oriented businesses have serious objectionable operational characteristics, particularly when several of them are concentrated under certain circumstances or located in direct proximity to sensitive uses such as parks, schools, churches, thereby having a deleterious effect upon the adjacent areas. It is the purpose and intent of these special regulations to prevent the concentration of adult-oriented businesses and thereby prevent such adverse secondary side effects. 
3.  The locational requirements, established by this chapter, do not unreasonably restrict the establishment or operation of constitutionally protected adult oriented businesses that are provided by this chapter. 
4.  In developing the ordinance codified in this chapter, the city council has been mindful of legal principles relating to regulation of adult-oriented businesses and does not intend to suppress or infringe upon any expressive activities protected by the First Amendments of the United States and California Constitutions, but instead desires to enact reasonable time place and manner regulations that address the adverse secondary effects of adult-oriented businesses. The city council has considered decisions of the United States Supreme Court regarding local regulations of adult-oriented businesses including, but not limited to, Young v. American Mini Theaters, Inc. 427 U S 50 (1976) Reh. Denied 475 U S 1132); FWIPBS, Inc. v. Dallas 493 U S 215 (1990); Barnes v. Glenn Theater 501 U S 560 (1991); United States Court of Appeals 9th Circuit decisions, including but not limited to: Topanga Press et al. v. City of Los Angeles 989 F. 2d 1524 (1993); several California cases including but not limited to: City of National City v. Wiener. 3 Cal4th 832 (1993); People v. Superior Court (Lucero) 149 Cal3d 14 (1989); and City of Vallejo v. Adult Books et al. 167 Cal App 3d 1169 (1985); and other federal cases including Lakeland Lounge v. City of Jacksonville (5th Cir. 1992) 973 F. 2d 1255; Hana On. Inc. v. Arlington (5th Cir 1995) 65 F. 3d 1248; Mitchell v. Commission on Adult Entertainment (3d Cir 1993) 10 F. 3d 123; International Eateries v. Broward County (11th Cir 1991) 941 F. 2d 1157; and Star Satellite v. City of Biloxi (5th Cir 1986) 779 F. 2d 1074. 
5.  The city council also finds that locational criteria alone do not adequately protect the health safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city and thus certain requirements with respect to the ownership and operation of adult oriented businesses are in the public interest. In addition to the findings and studies conducted in other cities regarding increases in crime rates decreases in property values and the blighting of areas in which such businesses are located the city council also takes legislative notice of the facts recited in the case of K. v. Inc. v. Kitsay County 793 F. 2d 1053 (1986), regarding how live adult entertainment results in secondary effects such as prostitution drug dealing and other law enforcement problems. 
6.  The city council finds the following in part based upon its understanding of the documents and judicial decision in the public record: 
a.  Evidence indicates that some dancers models and entertainers and other persons who publicly perform specified sexual activities or publicly display specified anatomical parts in adult oriented businesses collectively referred to as performers have been found to engage in sexual activities with patrons of adult-oriented businesses on the site of the adult oriented business. 
b.  Evidence has demonstrated that performers employed buy adult oriented businesses have been found to offer and provide private shows to patrons who for a price are permitted to observe and participate with the performers in live sex shows. 
c.  Evidence indicates that performers at adult oriented businesses have been found to engage in acts of prostitution with patrons of the establishment. 
d.  Evidence indicates that fully enclosed booths individual viewing areas and other small rooms whose interiors cannot be seen from public areas of the establishment regularly have been found to be used as a location for engaging in unlawful sexual activity. 
e.  As a result of the above and the increase in incidents of AIDS and hepatitis B which are both sexually transmitted diseases the city has a substantial interest in adopting regulations which will reduce to the greatest extent possible the possibility of the occurrence of prostitution and casual sex acts at adult oriented businesses. 
7.  Zoning licensing and other police power regulations are legitimate reasonable means of accountability to help protect the quality of life in the city and to help assure that all operators of adult oriented businesses comply with reasonable regulations and are located in places that minimize the diverse secondary effects which naturally accompany the operation of such businesses. 
8.  The city council recognizes the possible harmful effects on children and minors exposed to the effects of such adult oriented businesses and the deterioration of respect for family values and the need and desire of children and minors to stay away from and avoid such businesses which causes children to be fearful and cautious when walking through or visiting the immediate neighborhood of such businesses and the city council desires to minimize and control the adverse secondary side effects associated with the operation of adult oriented businesses and thereby protect the health safety and welfare of the citizens of the city protect the citizens from increased crime preserve the quality of life preserve the property values and the character of surrounding neighborhoods and businesses deter the spread of urban blight and protect against the threat to health from the spread of communicable and sexually transmitted diseases. 
9.  It is not the intent of the city council in enacting the ordinance codified in this chapter or any provision thereof to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material and the city council recognizes that state law prohibits the distribution of the obscene materials and expects and encourages law enforcement officials to enforce state obscenity statutes against such illegal activities in the city. 
10.  Nothing in this chapter is intended to authorize legalize or permit the establishment operation or maintenance of any business building or use which violates any city ordinance or any statue of the state of California regarding public nuisances unlawful or indecent exposure sexual conduct lewdness obscene or harmful matter or the exhibition or public display thereof. 
11.  The city council finds the following in part based upon its understanding of the documents and judicial decisions in the public record. 
a.  Evidence indicates that some dancers models and entertainers and other persons who publicly perform specified sexual activities or publicly display specified anatomical parts in adult oriented businesses collectively referred to as performers have been found to engage in sexual activities with patrons of adult oriented businesses on the site of the adult oriented business. 
b.  Evidence has demonstrated that performers employed by adult oriented businesses have been found to offer and provide private shows to patrons who for a price are permitted to observe and participate with the performers in live sex shows. 
c.  Evidence indicates that performers at adult oriented businesses have been found to engage in acts of prostitution with patrons of the establishment. 
12.  In prohibiting public nudity in adult oriented businesses the city council does not intend to proscribe the communication of erotic messages or any other communicative element or activity but rather only to prohibit public nudity due to the secondary impacts associated with such public nudity. 
13.  The city council also finds as a wholly independent basis that it has a substantial public interest in preserving societal order and morality and that such interest is furthered by a prohibition on public nudity. 
14.  While the city council desires to protect the rights conferred by the United States Constitution to adult oriented businesses it does so in a manner that ensures the continued and orderly development of property within the city and diminishes to the greatest extent feasible those undesirable secondary effects which the aforementioned studies have shown to be associated with the development operation of adult oriented businesses. 
15.  In enacting a nudity limitation the city declares that the limitation is a regulatory licensing provision and not a criminal offense. The city has not provided a criminal penalty for a violation of the nudity limitation. The city adopts such a limitation only as a condition of issuance and maintenance of an adult oriented business permit issued pursuant to this code. 
16.  The city council finds that preventing the exchange of money between entertainers and patrons also reduces the likelihood of drug and sex transactions occurring in adult oriented businesses. 
17.  Requiring separations between entertainers and patrons reduces the likelihood that such persons will negotiate narcotics sales and or transact sexual favors within the adult oriented business. 
18.  Enclosed or concealed booths and dimly lit areas within adult oriented businesses greatly increase the potential for misuse of the premises including unlawful conduct of a type which facilitates transmission of disease. Requirements that all indoor areas be open to view by management at all times and that adequate lighting be provided are necessary in order to reduce the opportunity for and therefore the incidence of illegal conduct within adult oriented businesses and to facilitate the inspection of the interior of the premises thereof by law enforcement personnel. 
C.  Establishment of an adult oriented business as used herein shall mean and include any of the following: 
1.  The opening or commencement of any adult oriented business as a new business.

a.  For each dwelling unit, at least one architectural projection not less than two feet from the wall plane and not less than four feet wide shall be provided. Such projections shall extend the full height of single-story structures, at least one-half the height of a two-story building, and two-thirds the height of a three-story building; 
b.  A change in wall plane of at least two feet in depth for at least twelve feet in length for each two units shall be provided. 
2.  Materials. Piecemeal embellishment and frequent changes in materials shall be avoided. 
3.  Balconies, Porches and Patios. Balconies, porches and patios shall be required. These elements shall be integrated to break up large wall masses, and to offset floor setbacks. 
4.  Dwelling Unit Access. The use of long, monotonous access balconies and corridors which provide access to five or more units shall be avoided. Instead, access points to units shall be clustered in groups of four or less. To the extent possible, the entrances to individual units shall be plainly visible from nearby parking areas. The use of distinctive architectural elements and materials to denote prominent entrances shall be used. 
5.  Exterior Stairs. Simple, clean, bold projections of stairways shall be used to complement the architectural massing and form of the multifamily structure. Stairways shall be of smooth stucco, plaster or wood, with accent trim of complimentary colors. Thin-looking, open metal, prefabricated stairs are prohibited. 
6.  Carports, Garages and Accessory Structures. Carports, detached garages, and accessory structures shall be designed as an integral part of the architecture of projects. They shall be similar in materials, color and detail to the principal structures of the development. Carports may utilize flat roofs but shall not project above any exterior walls adjacent to public streets, and shall be located in parking courts to the rear of buildings. Prefabricated metal carports shall not be used unless the exterior facade is made to match the exterior facade of the buildings. 
   Where garages are utilized, doors shall appear to be recessed into the walls rather than flush with the exterior wall. Their design shall be simple and unadorned. 
7.  Solar Panels. Solar panels, when used, shall be integrated into the roof design, flush with the roof slope. Frames shall be colored to match the roof colors. Natural aluminum finish is strongly discouraged. Any mechanical equipment shall be enclosed and completely screened from view. 
8.  Mechanical and Utility Equipment. All mechanical equipment whether mounted on the roof or ground shall be screened from view. Utility meters and equipment shall be placed in locations where they are not exposed to view from the street or they shall be suitably screened. All screening devices shall be compatible with the architecture and color of the adjacent structures. 
9.  Antennas. All antennas shall be placed in attics or building interiors. All new units shall be pre-wired to accept cable reception. Satellite dish antennas are specifically prohibited on roofs and shall be considered early in the design process in terms of location and any required screening; 
H.  Multifamily Infill in Single-Family Neighborhoods. If multifamily projects are located in existing neighborhoods, they shall be compatible with adjacent structures and fit within the context of the existing neighborhood. Minimum requirements include the following: 
1.  Front Yard Setbacks. Front yard setbacks for new multifamily projects are pursuant to the requirements of the base zone district and if setback average is used, the setback shall be equal to or greater than the average setbacks for the two adjacent properties. 
2.  Architectural Compatibility. New multifamily development in existing neighborhoods shall incorporate architectural characteristics and maintain the scale of existing structures on the property and surrounding development, by incorporating window and door detailing, facade decoration, materials, color, roof style and pitch, porches and other features that are compatible.

Chapter 17.140 - OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION 
Sections: 
 
17.140.010 - Purpose of chapter. 
A.  It is declared to be the purpose of this chapter to establish reasonable limitations, safeguards and controls with respect to the future drilling for, development and production of oil, gas and other hydrocarbon substances within the city. 
B.  Such limitations, safeguards and controls are deemed necessary in the public interest to insure practices which will permit the economic recovery of the maximum amount of oil, gas and other hydrocarbon substances but which will also take into consideration the surface uses of land as such uses are indicated by the value and character of the existing improvements in or near localities where oil and gas operations are conducted, the desirability of the area for residential or other uses, and other factors relating to the public health, safety and general welfare. 
C.  It is recognized that in regulating the surface use of land for the development of such natural resources it is in the public interest that such regulations be of a character designed to impose the minimum burdens consistent with the maximum enjoyment of each use.

CHAPTER 17.142 - OUTDOOR SIGNS 
Sections: 
 
17.142.010 - Purpose. 
A.  The purpose of this chapter is to promote the growth of the city in an orderly and attractive manner and to provide minimum standards to safeguard life, health, property, aesthetics and public welfare by regulating and controlling the type, number, area, height, quality of materials, design, construction, illumination, location and maintenance of all signs and sign structures in compliance with the Outdoor Advertising Act as codified in Business and Professions Code sections 5200 et seq. Signs that cause distraction and represent potential safety hazards as well as aesthetic problems are either discouraged or prohibited. 
The city of McFarland has had ordinances regulating signs since at least 1961. Recently the constitutionality of city Ordinance Nos. 36, 57, 74, 86 and 143 regulating signs and advertising signs within the city of McFarland have been questioned. Additionally, recent efforts to plan for and revitalize the downtown area have been initiated and undertaken. Based thereon, this chapter is hereby declared to be an chapter for the preservation of the public peace, safety, health and welfare. 
A 1980 Federal Highway Administration Study found a positive correlation between billboards and accident rates and Federal and State courts have long cited aesthetics, traffic and safety as a legitimate basis for the regulation of advertising displays. The California Supreme Court in the case of Metromedia, Inc. v. City of San Diego, 453 U.S. 490 (1981) held that billboards are large, immobile and permanent structures which like other structures are subject to regulation. They are designed to stand apart from their surroundings and they create unique problems for land use and planning. It has been recognized by the federal government, the state government, the California and U.S. Supreme Court, and other courts, that billboards by their very nature can be perceived as an aesthetic harm. This chapter is necessary to protect the public health needs of the community because the proliferation of signs constitutes visual blight, which reduces the quality of life within the community would adversely effect the city of McFarland's current efforts to redevelop and beautify its downtown corridor and the city as it grows. 
B.  The sign regulations contained herein are not designed to regulate any speech based on the content of the speech or based upon who is speaking. The sign regulations are intended to accomplish the following results: 
1.  Protect and enhance the character of residential neighborhoods and property values by prohibiting obtrusive or incompatible signs; 
2.  Promote and maintain healthy commercial centers and property values for effective identification and communication of the nature of goods and services and avoidance of wasteful and unsightly competition signs; 
3.  Attract and direct persons to various activities and enterprises, in order to provide for public convenience; 
4.  Provide a reasonable system of sign control throughout the city; 
5.  Encourage signs which are well designed and pleasing in appearance and to provide incentive and latitude for variety, good design relationship and spacing; 
6.  Encourage a desirable urban character; 
7.  Enhance the economic value of the community and each are thereof through reasonable regulation of such things as type, number, area, height, location and illumination of signs; 
8.  Encourage signs which are harmonious with adjacent land uses and projects and to encourage architectural compatibility; 
9.  Reduce traffic and safety hazards through regulation of the type, number, area, height, location and illumination of signs; 
10.  Provide a reasonable amortization period for the removal of non-conforming signs. 
(Ord. No. 312-2006, § 1, 7-20-06)  
17.142.020 - Repeal of all other ordinances regulating outdoor advertising signs.

17.146.010 - Purpose and application. 
The purpose of this chapter is to ensure that development is aesthetically pleasing and compatible with surrounding development by requiring the provision of adequate landscaping in connection with new development and the expansion of existing development and changes in use. 
(Ord. No. 032-2013, § 1, 8-8-13)  
17.146.020 - Landscaping required. 
A.  All projects for which site plan approval is required, shall install and maintain landscaping in accordance with the requirements of this chapter; provided however, these landscape requirements shall not apply to projects where a current use is expanded but the valuation of the building permit is less than twenty-five percent of the appraised value. 
B.  All landscaping and irrigation required under these standards shall be installed prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy. 
(Ord. No. 032-2013, § 1, 8-8-13)  
17.146.030 - Landscaping standardsGenerally. 
If landscaping is required, landscape and irrigation plans shall be submitted as a part of the building plans. The following design standards shall apply: 
A.  All areas within a required setback shall contain living ground cover or a combination of living and nonliving ground coverings (nonliving to be a maximum of twenty percent). Parking shall not be allowed within the front or street side setback in any zone, and shall be fully landscaped as set forth herein. All plants within required setbacks to be of species suited to Sunset Western Garden Book Climate Zones 8 and 9. The use of low water varieties, grouped by similar water usage is required. 
1.  Definition. "Living groundcover" means low-growing plants or shrubs that after being planted will grow together to form a solid cover in one year or less. To achieve desired coverage, low-growing groundcover plants taken from flats shall be planted a maximum of twelve inches on center. Low-growing, shrub type groundcovers in one-gallon cans shall be planted a maximum of two feet on center. Spacing may be increased to three feet on center for fast growing plants as approved by the planning division. 
2.  Definition. "Nonliving groundcover" means forest humus or walk-on bark, rock and other similar materials. Use shall require permission of the planning director. 
3.  All soil surfaces are to be covered by plant materials or nonliving groundcovers as defined in subsection (C)(5)(b) of this section. At least two inches of nonliving materials shall be applied to all planting areas except turf. 
B.  Islands of a minimum area of eighty square feet shall be established at a maximum separation of ten continuous parking stalls. The islands shall be landscaped with groundcovers and with a minimum of one fifteen-gallon tree planted in each island. Actual numbers of trees will be based on the size of the project as determined by the planning director. 
C.  All landscaping as required in this chapter shall be reviewed by the planning director as to the type, density of planting and size of plants intended for use. All landscaped areas shall be permanently maintained by the property owner. Such maintenance shall include, where appropriate, pruning, mowing, weeding, cleaning, fertilizing and regular watering. Whenever necessary, planting shall be replaced with other plant materials to insure continued compliance. 
D.  All landscaped areas in commercial, industrial, and multifamily projects shall be surrounded with six-inch high concrete curbing, unless waived by the planning director or planning commission. 
E.  Buffer planting shall occur along freeways and major arterials in order to visually screen uses and provide noise reduction. The landscaping shall be in addition to screening requirements set forth in this chapter. 
F.  Trees: 
1.  Spacing of trees to be variable depending on type and eventual size, but that there be a general minimum standard of one tree with a minimum trunk diameter of two inches at four feet above finished grade at time of planting, for each thirty lineal feet of frontage of a required landscaped setback, exclusive of vehicular site lines and shall not be planted within five feet of any curb, gutter or sidewalk unless a root directing device is used. 
2.  Trees to be used in parking lots shall be of a type that will form a full head on a single trunk, i.e., Chinese Elm, Chinese Pistache, Golden Rain, Valley Oak or other approved species. All trees planted within public right-of-way shall be consistent with the City Street Tree Master Plan. 
3.  Where trees are planted in paved areas which are unprotected by curbs they shall have a protective tree grate or equivalent device. Tree grates shall be cast iron with a natural finish. A deep root-directing device shall also be used. 
4.  Tree planters located in parking areas shall be sufficiently large and protected so that a parked car does not extend into the minimum four-foot by four-foot tree planting area which shall be landscaped with groundcover, shrubs and/or climbing plants. 
G.  Shrubs. 
1.  At least seventy-five percent of shrubs planted shall be of five-gallon minimum size. One-gallon plants may be used if planted with approved low water-using varieties. 
2.  Shrubs within a required setback shall be spaced in such a way so that at maturity the plants will provide eighty percent ground coverage. 
H.  Mounding. 
1.  Mounding or low-growing shrub areas along street frontages may be used to screen parking areas and shall not exceed a 1:7 slope and shrubs shall be low-growing varieties with a mature height of four feet or less. Steeper slopes may be allowed if irrigated by drip systems. 
2.  Mounding shall not be required for landscape areas which are ten feet, or less, in width. 
3.  Mounds shall be compacted prior to planting to prevent excessive settlement. 
4.  Black plastic shall not be used under wood chips on mounds, or slopes in general. 
5.  Turf on mounds requires slope rates of 1:10 or less. Mounds with groundcovers require slope rates of 1:5 or less. 
6.  Mounds may not be used within site triangles, or in areas that will create hazards to pedestrians or motorists. 
I.  Parking Lots. 
1.  Trees shall be planted in all parking lots at a 1:6 ratio of trees to parking stalls. 
2.  Such tree planters shall contain approved trees on twenty-foot centers or in such a manner as to have fifty percent shade coverage of the parking lot in ten years. 
3.  Shrubs and trees to be arranged in such a way as to avoid damage from the front of parked cars extending into the planter areas. 
4.  All landscaped areas shall be irrigated. 
J.  Turf. 
1.  Turf shall be limited to forty percent of the total landscape area and use low water-using varieties. Public parks, golf courses, cemeteries, schools, properties within a historic district, and residential office conversions are to be reviewed for exemptions on a project by project basis. 
2.  No turf will be allowed: 
a.  In traffic medians on arterials or freeways; 
b.  Parkways or planting areas narrower than five feet; 
c.  Storm drainage ponds with slopes in excess of 1:6; 
d.  On mounds or slopes exceeding 1:10; 
e.  Exceptions to turf in parkways may be granted by the planning division in cases where pedestrian access is necessary across parkways.

(Ord. No. 298-2005, § 1, 6-9-05)  
17.150.040 - General requirements/applicability. 
A.  Residential Development. 
1.  For all new multiple family residential projects of fifteen units or more, at least fifteen percent of the project's dwelling units shall be affordable to very low, and/or low income households. For all new single family residential projects of fifteen units or more, at least twenty percent of the project's dwelling units shall be affordable to very low, low, and/or moderate income houses. These dwelling units shall be referred to as "inclusionary units." Special consideration will be given to projects in which a significant percentage of the inclusionary units are for very low and low income households. The specific mix of units within the three affordability categories shall be subject to approval by the city. 
2.  The inclusionary units shall be reserved for rent or purchase by eligible very low, low, and moderate income households, as applicable. Projects subject to these requirements include, but are not limited to, single-family detached dwellings, townhomes, apartments, condominiums, or cooperatives provided through new construction projects, and/or through conversion of rentals to ownership units. 
3.  The percentage of inclusionary units required for a particular project shall be determined only once on a given project, at the time of tentative map approval, or, for projects not processing a map, prior to issuance of building permit. If the subdivision design changes, which results in a change in the number of unit types required, the number of inclusionary units required shall be recalculated to coincide with the final approved project. In applying and calculating the fifteen percent requirement, any decimal fraction less than or equal to 0.50 may be disregarded, and any decimal fraction greater than 0.50 shall be construed as one unit. 
B.  Commercial, Office, and Industrial (COI) Development. New COI developments shall submit an affordable housing proposal as set forth in Section 17.150.100 of this chapter. Upon submittal of the affordable housing proposal, city staff will meet with the developer to discuss the potential for providing incentives to encourage on-site construction of affordable housing units and alternatives to constructing affordable units as set forth in this chapter. In the event a developer requests incentives or alternatives as a means of providing affordable housing in connection with a COI development, the Affordable Housing Proposal will be reviewed as set forth in Section 17.150.100 of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 298-2005, § 1, 6-9-05)  
17.150.050 - Inclusionary unit provisions and specifications. 
A.  Inclusionary units shall be dispersed throughout the project unless otherwise approved by the city. 
B.  Inclusionary units shall be constructed with identical exterior materials and an exterior architectural design that is consistent with the market rate units in the project. 
C.  Inclusionary units may be of smaller size than the market units in the project. In addition, inclusionary units may have fewer interior amenities than the market rate units in the project. However, the city may require that the inclusionary units meet certain minimum standards. These standards shall be set forth in the affordable housing agreement for the project. 
D.  Inclusionary units shall remain affordable in perpetuity through recordation of an affordable housing agreement as described in Section 17.150.060 of this chapter. 
E.  All inclusionary units in a project shall be constructed concurrently within or prior to the construction of the project's market rate units. 
F.  For purposes of calculating the affordable rent or affordable sales price of an inclusionary unit, the following household size assumptions shall be used for each applicable dwelling unit type: 
Unit Size 	HUD Income Category By Household Size 
Studio Unit 	One Person 
One Bedroom Unit 	Two Persons 
Two Bedroom Unit 	Three Persons 
Three Bedroom Unit 	Four Persons 
Four or more Bedroom Unit 	Five or more Persons 
 
G.  The city's adopted preference and priority system shall be used for determining eligibility among prospective beneficiaries for affordable housing units created through the inclusionary zoning ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 298-2005, § 1, 6-9-05)  
17.150.060 - Affordable housing agreement. 
An affordable housing agreement shall be entered into by the city and the project owner. The agreement shall record the method and terms by which a project owner shall comply with the requirements of this chapter. The approval and/or recordation of this agreement shall take place prior to final map approval or, where a map is not being processed, prior to the issuance of building permits for such lots or units. 
A.  The affordable housing agreement shall state the methodology for determining a unit's initial and ongoing rent or sales and resale price(s), any resale restrictions, occupancy requirements, eligibility requirements, city incentives including second mortgages, recapture mechanisms, the administrative process for monitoring unit management to assure ongoing affordability and other matters related to the development and retention of the inclusionary units. 
B.  In addition to the above, the affordable housing agreement shall set forth any waiver of the lower income housing fee. For projects which meet the affordability threshold with very low and/or low income units, all units in the project shall be eligible for a waiver of the lower income house fee. For single family residential projects which meet the affordability threshold with moderate income units, or multiple family residential projects which do not meet the affordability threshold, only the inclusionary units shall be eligible for a waiver of the lower income housing fee except as otherwise approved by the city council. 
C.  To assure affordability over the life of the unit, the affordable housing agreement shall be recorded with the property deed or other method approved by the city attorney. In the event an inclusionary units is affordable by design the affordable housing agreement shall stipulate the method for assuring that the units retain their affordability as the housing market changes. 
D.  The planning director may waive the requirement for an affordable housing agreement for projects approved prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter and/or for projects that have their affordable housing requirements included in a development agreement or other city document. 
(Ord. No. 298-2005, § 1, 6-9-05)  
17.150.070 - Incentives to encourage on-site construction of inclusionary units. 
The city shall consider making available to the applicant incentives to increase the feasibly of residential projects to provide inclusionary units. Incentives or financial assistance will be offered only to the extent resources for this purpose are available and approved for such use by the city council or city manager, as defined below, and to the extent that the project, with the use of incentives or financial assistance, assists in achieving the city's housing goals. However, nothing in this chapter establishes, directly or through implication, a right of an applicant to receive any assistance or incentives from the city. Any incentives provided by the city shall set out in the affordable housing agreement pursuant to Section 17.150.060 of this chapter. The granting of the additional incentives shall require demonstration of exceptional circumstances that necessitate assistance from the city, as well as documentation of how such incentives increase the feasibility of providing affordable housing. 
The following incentives may be approved for applicants who construct inclusionary units on-site: 
A.  Fee Waiver or Deferral. The city council, by resolution, may waive or defer payment of city development impact fees and/or building permit fees applicable to the inclusionary units or the project of which they are a part. Fee waivers shall meet the criteria included in the city's adopted policy for evaluating waivers of city fees for affordable housing projects. The affordable housing agreement shall include the terms of the fee waiver. 
B.  Design Modifications. The granting of design modifications relative to the inclusionary requirement shall require the approval of the city council and shall meet all applicable zoning requirements of the city. Modifications to typical design standards may include the following: 
1.  Reduced setbacks; 
2.  Reduction in infrastructure requirements; 
3.  Reduced open space requirements; 
4.  Reduced landscaping requirements; 
5.  Reduced interior or exterior amenities; 
6.  Reduction in parking requirements; 
7.  Height restriction waivers. 
C.  Second Mortgages. The city may utilize available lower income housing funds for the purpose of providing second mortgages to prospective unit owners or to subsidize the cost of a unit to establish an affordable rent or an affordable sales price. Terms of the second mortgage or subsidy shall be stated in the affordable housing agreement. The utilization of these incentives shall not be the sole source of providing the inclusionary units and they are intended to augment the developer's proposal. 
D.  Priority Processing. After receiving its discretionary approvals, a project that provides inclusionary units may be entitled to priority processing of building and engineering approvals subject to the approval of the city manager. A Project eligible for priority processing shall be assigned to City engineering and/or building staff and processed in advance of all non-priority items. 
(Ord. No. 298-2005, § 1, 6-9-05; Ord. No. 002-2010, § 1, 2-11-10)  
17.150.080 - Alternatives to constructing inclusionary units on-site. 
The primary emphasis of the inclusionary zoning ordinance is to achieve the inclusion of affordable housing units to be constructed in conjunction with market rate units within the same project in all new residential projects. However, the city acknowledges that it may not always be practical to require that every project satisfy its affordable housing requirement through the construction of affordable units within the project itself. Therefore, the requirements of this chapter may be satisfied by various methods other than the construction of inclusionary units on the project site. Some examples of alternate methods of compliance appear below. As housing market conditions change, the city may need to allow alternatives to provide options to applicants to further the intent of providing affordable housing with new development projects. 
A.  Off-Site Projects. Inclusionary units required pursuant to this chapter may be permitted to be constructed at a location within the city other than the project site. Any off-site inclusionary units must meet the following criteria: 
1.  The off-site inclusionary units must be determined to be consistent with the city's goal of creating, preserving, maintaining, and protecting housing for very low, low, and moderate income households. 
2.  The off-site inclusionary units must not result in a significant concentration of inclusionary units in any one particular neighborhood. 
3.  The off-site inclusionary units shall conform to the requirements of all applicable city ordinances and the provisions of this chapter. 
4.  The occupancy and rents of the off-site inclusionary units shall be governed by the terms of a deed restriction, and if applicable, a declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions similar to that used for the on-site inclusionary units. 
The affordable housing agreement shall stipulate the terms of the off-site inclusionary units. If the construction does not take place at the same time as project development, the agreement shall require the units to be produced within a specified time frame, but in no event longer than five years. A cash deposit or bond may be required by the city, refundable upon construction, as assurance that the units will be built. 
B.  Land Dedication. An applicant may dedicate land to the city or a local non-profit housing developer in place of actual construction of inclusionary units upon approval of the city council. 
The intent of allowing a land dedication option is to provide the city or a local non-profit housing developer the land needed to make an inclusionary unit development feasible, thus furthering the intent of this chapter. The dedicated land must be appropriately zoned, buildable, free of toxic substances and contaminated soils, and large enough to accommodate the number of inclusionary units required for the project. The city's acceptance of land dedication shall require that the lots be fully improved, with infrastructure, adjacent utilities, grading, and fees paid. 
C.  Credit Transfers. In the event a project exceeds the total number of inclusionary units required in this chapter, the project owner may request inclusionary unit credits which may be used to meet the affordable housing requirements of another project. Inclusionary unit credits are issued to and become the possession of the project owner and may not be transferred to another project owner without approval by the city council. The number of inclusionary unit credits awarded for any project is subject to approval by the city council. 
D.  Alternate Methods of Compliance. Applicants may propose creative concepts for meeting the requirements of this chapter, in order to bring down the cost of providing inclusionary units, whether on- or off-site. The city council may approve alternate methods of compliance with this chapter if the applicant demonstrates that such alternate method meets the purpose of this Chapter (as set forth in Section 17.150.020). 
(Ord. No. 298-2005, § 1, 6-9-05)  
17.150.090 - Administration. 
An applicant of a project subject to this chapter shall submit an affordable housing proposal stating the method by which it will meet the requirements of this chapter. The Affordable Housing Proposal shall be submitted as a part of the applicant's city development application (e.g., design review, planned unit development, etc.) to the planning department in a form approved by the city manager. The Planning Director may waive the requirement for submittal of an Affordable Housing Proposal for projects approved prior to the effective date of this ordinance and/or for projects that have undergone considerable public review during which affordable housing issues were addressed. The affordable housing proposal shall be reviewed by the city's housing commission at a properly noticed meeting open to the public. The housing commission shall make recommendations to the city council either accepting, rejecting or modifying the developer's proposal and the utilization of any incentives as outlined in this chapter. The housing commission may also make recommendations to the planning commission regarding the project as necessary to assure conformance with this chapter. Acceptance of the applicant's affordable housing proposal is subject to approval by the city council, which may direct the city manager to execute an affordable housing agreement in a form approved by the city attorney. The city manager or his/her designee shall be responsible for monitoring the sale, occupancy and resale of inclusionary units. 
(Ord. No. 298-2005, § 1, 6-9-05; Ord. No. 002-2010, § 1, 2-11-10)  
17.150.100 - Conflict of interest. 
The following individuals are ineligible to purchase or rent an inclusionary unit: (a) city employees and officials (and their immediate family members) who have policy making authority or influence regarding city housing programs; (b) the project applicant and its officers and employees (and their immediate family members); and (c) the project owner and its officers and employees (and their immediate family members). 
(Ord. No. 298-2005, § 1, 6-9-05)  
17.150.110 - Enforcement. 
The city manager is designated as the enforcing authority. The city manager may suspend or revoke any building permit or approval upon finding a violation of any provision of this chapter. The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all agents, successors and assigns of an applicant. No building permit or final inspection shall be issued, nor any development approval be granted which does not meet the requirements of this chapter. In the event that it is determined that rents in excess of those allowed by operation of this chapter have been charged to a tenant residing in an inclusionary unit, the city may take appropriate legal action to recover, and the project owner shall be obligated to pay the tenant or to the city in the event the tenant cannot be located, any excess rents charged. 
(Ord. No. 298-2005, § 1, 6-9-05; Ord. No. 002-2010, § 1, 2-11-10)  
17.150.120 - Appeals. 
Any person aggrieved by an action or determination of the city manager under this chapter, may appeal such action or determination to the city council by providing the city clerk with written notice of appeal within fifteen days after the action or determination. 
(Ord. No. 298-2005, § 1, 6-9-05; Ord. No. 002-2010, § 1, 2-11-10)

An application for a density bonus shall be made to city on a form prescribed by city. The application shall be accompanied by a fee set by resolution of the city council. 
(Ord. No. 330-2008, § 1, 5-8-08)  
17.154.030 - Hearings and notice. 
Upon receipt of a density bonus application and city's determination that it is complete, city shall prepare a report in which it determines whether the development will qualify for a density bonus and, if so, the basis for its qualification, and the amount of density bonus and incentives required under the density bonus law or as otherwise recommended by the city. The city shall thereafter refer the matter to the planning commission and set a hearing in the manner described in Section 17.148.010(B). 
(Ord. No. 330-2008, § 1, 5-8-08)  
17.154.040 - Action of planning commission. 
The planning commission may recommend that the city council approve, approve with conditions, or deny the density bonus. The commission may recommend denial of a density bonus if it finds that the housing development will have an adverse impact as defined in Government Code Section 65589.5(d)(2) upon public health and safety or the physical environment or on any real property that is listed in the California Register of Historical Resources and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impacts without rendering the development unaffordable to low and moderate income households; or that it is not required in order to provide for affordable housing costs as defined in California Health and Safety Code Section 50052.5 or for rents for the targeted units to be set as specified in Government Code Section 65915(c). If the planning commission recommends that the city council approves or conditionally approves the density bonus the commission may recommend incentives which may be selected from the following: a reduction in site development standards or modification of zoning code requirements or architectural design requirements; or approval of mixed use zoning in conjunction with the housing project if commercial, office, industrial, or other land uses will reduce the cost of the housing development and if the commercial, office, industrial, or other land uses are compatible with the housing project and the existing or planned development in the area. 
(Ord. No. 330-2008, § 1, 5-8-08)  
17.154.050 - Action of city council. 
The city council shall consider the planning commission's recommendation. The council may approve, approve with modifications, or deny the application. If the council denies the application, it shall do so only after making the findings described in Section 17.154.040. If the council approves or conditionally approves the density bonus it shall also consider the recommendation of the planning commission regarding incentives and approve, conditionally approve, or deny them. After action by the council which includes approval or conditional approval of the density bonus, the council shall direct staff to negotiate an agreement with the developer regarding same.
