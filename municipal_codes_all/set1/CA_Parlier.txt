PARLIER, CALIFORNIA - MUNICIPAL CODE 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of 
Parlier, California 
____________ 
Beginning with Supplementation in 2013, 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 

PREFACE 
    The Parlier, California Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1974, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
    Beginning with supplementation in 2013, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation. 
    The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with supplementation in 2013, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance 2011-03, passed August 17, 2011.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are "reserved" for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with supplementation in 2013, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    As of supplementation in 2013, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with supplementation in 2013, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with supplementation in 2013, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Instruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, the pages of this code were consecutively numbered. As of supplementation in 2013, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System." (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM. Electronic files enable us not only to get you your code more quickly but also ensure that it is error-free. Our e-mail address is: ords@municode.com.

SUPPLEMENT HISTORY TABLE 
    The table below allows users of this Code to quickly and accurately determine what ordinances have been considered for codification in each supplement.

Every violation determined to be an infraction shall be punishable by a fine not to exceed one hundred dollars for the first offense, two hundred fifty dollars for the second offense, and five hundred dollars for all subsequent offenses. Each such person shall be guilty of a separate offense for each and every day during any portion of which any violation of any provision of this code is committed, continued or permitted by such person and shall be punished accordingly.

1.16.011 - Citation of violators. 
A.	Pursuant to the provisions of Part 2, Title 3, Chapter 5b of the Penal Code of the state, if any person is arrested for a violation of any provision of this code or of any other ordinance of the city, the violation of which is punishable as a misdemeanor, and such person is not immediately taken before a magistrate as set forth in the Penal Code, the arresting officer shall prepare in duplicate a written notice to appear in court, containing the name and address of such person, the offense charged, and the time and place where and when such person shall appear in court. 
B.	The time specified in the notice to appear must be at least five days after such arrest.
C.	The place specified in the notice to appear shall be either:
1.	Before a judge of the Parlier justice court; or
2.	Before an officer authorized by the county or city to receive a deposit of bail.
D.	The officer shall deliver one copy of the notice to appear to the arrested person, and the arrested person in order to secure release must give his written promise so to appear in court by signing the duplicate notice which shall be retained by the officer. Thereupon the arresting officer shall forthwith release the person arrested from custody. 
E.	The officer shall, as soon as practicable, file the duplicate notice with the magistrate specified therein. Thereupon, pursuant to said Chapter 5b of said Penal Code, the magistrate shall fix the amount of bail which in his judgment, in accordance with the provisions of Section 1275 of the Penal Code of the state will be reasonable and sufficient for the appearance of the defendant and shall indorse upon the notice a statement signed by him in the form set forth in Section 815a of the Penal Code of the state. The defendant may, prior to the date upon which he promised to appear in court, deposit with the magistrate the amount of bail thus set. Thereafter, at the time when the case is called for arraignment before the magistrate, if the defendant shall not appear, either in person or by counsel, the magistrate may declare the bail forfeited, and may in his discretion order that no further proceedings shall be held in such case. 
    Upon the making of such order that no further proceedings be had, all sums deposited as bail shall forthwith be paid into the county treasury for distribution pursuant to Section 1463 of the Penal Code. 
F.	No warrant shall issue on such charge for the arrest of a person who has given such promise to appear in court unless and until he has violated such promise or has failed to deposit bail, to appear for arraignment, trial or judgment, or to comply with the terms and provisions of the judgment, as required by law. 
(Ord. 78-10 §1(part), 1978). 
1.16.012 - Failure to appear as misdemeanor. 
    Any person wilfully violating his written promise to appear in court is guilty of a misdemeanor regardless of the disposition of the charge upon which he was originally arrested. 
(Ord. 78-10 §1(part), 1978). 
1.16.013 - Issuance of warrant. 
A.	When a person signs a written promise to appear at the time and place specified in the written promise to appear and has not posted bail, as provided in Section 1.16.011 of this chapter and in Section 853.1 of the Penal Code of the state, the magistrate shall issue and have delivered for execution a warrant for his arrest within twenty days after his failure to appear as promised, or if such person promises to appear before an officer authorized to accept bail other than a magistrate and fails to do so on or before the date which he promised to appear, then within twenty days after the delivery of such written promise to appear by the officer to a magistrate having jurisdiction over the offense. 
B.	When such person violates his promise to appear before an officer authorized to receive bail other than a magistrate, the officer shall immediately deliver to the magistrate having jurisdiction over the offense charged the written promise to appear and the complaint, if any, filed by the arresting officer. 
(Ord. 78-10 §1(part), 1978). 
1.16.014 - Enforcing officers generally. 
    The chief of police and all officers and employees of the police department, excepting clerks, stenographers and others whose duties do not fall within the scope of law enforcement service, are hereby declared to be and are peace officers, and as such have all powers conferred upon peace officer or policemen by the laws of the state, together with all powers conferred upon them by the city and they are hereby empowered to enforce, and are charged with the duty of enforcing, any and all provisions of this code or of any other ordinance of the city where the violation of such provision or provisions would constitute a misdemeanor.

All bids received after the designated closing date and time shall be considered nonresponsive and shall be rejected. 
12.	Tie Bids. If two or more bids received are in the same total amount, and the unit price, quality and service are equal, and if there is no evidence of collusion between the bidders and if the circumstances will not permit the readvertising of bids, the city may accept the bid of its choice.

Chapter 3.20 - TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX* 
Sections: 

FOOTNOTE(S):
--- () --- 
*  For statutory provisions authorizing cities to impose a tax on transients who occupy room space within the city limits, see Rev. & Tax. Code §§7280, 7281. 
3.20.010 - Title. 
    This chapter shall be known as the "transient room tax ordinance" of the city. 
(Ord. 115-NS §1, 1964). 
3.20.020 - Definitions. 
    Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this section govern the construction of this chapter. 
A.	"Hotel" means any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging, or sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging house, rooming house, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, mobilehome or house trailer at a fixed location, or other similar structure or portion thereof. 
B.	"Legislative body" means the city council of the city of Parlier, California.
C.	"Occupancy" means the use or possession or the right to the use or possession of any room or rooms or portions thereof in any hotel for dwelling, lodging, or sleeping purposes. 
D.	"Operator" means the person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his functions through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both. 
E.	"Person" means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate, or any other group or combination acting as a unit. 
F.	"Rent" means the consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods, labor, or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits, and property and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever. 
G.	"Tax administrator" means the city clerk.
H.	"Transient" means any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy in a hotel by reason of a lease, concession, permit, right of access, license or other agreement for a period of thirty consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of thirty days has expired unless there is an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy. In determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date of this chapter may be considered. 
I.	"Transient occupancy tax review committee" means a committee composed of the following three persons or officers: mayor, mayor pro tem and city clerk. 
(Ord. 115-NS §2, 1964). 
3.20.030 - Imposition and payment. 
    For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel on and after July 1, 1964, each transient is subject to and shall pay a tax in the amount of four percent of the rent charged by the operator. Said tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the city which is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the city. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. Any unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient's ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the tax administrator may require that such tax be paid directly to him. 
(Ord. 115-NS §3, 1964). 
3.20.040 - Collection by operator-Enforcement. 
A.	Every operator maintaining a place of business and renting rooms in this city, the occupancy of which is not exempted under the terms of this chapter, shall collect the tax from the occupant. The tax required to be collected by the operator constitutes a debt owing by the operator to the city. In all cases of transactions upon credit or deferred payment, the payment of tax to the operator may be deferred in accordance therewith, and the operator shall be liable therefor at the time and to the extent that such credits are paid or deferred payments are made in accordance with the rate of tax owing on the amount thereof. 
B.	The tax administrator shall enforce the provisions of this chapter and shall have the power to adopt rules and regulations not inconsistent herewith as may be necessary or desirable to aid in the enforcement hereof. He shall provide schedules for payment of the tax and such schedules shall eliminate fractions of one cent. 
(Ord. 115-NS §4, 1964). 
3.20.050 - Duties of operator. 
    Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this chapter to the same extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent charged, and each transient shall receive a receipt for payment from the operator. No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner hereinafter provided. 
(Ord. 115-NS §5, 1965). 
3.20.060 - Exemptions. 
    No tax imposed under this chapter shall be imposed upon: 
A.	Any person as to whom, or any occupancy as to which, it is beyond the power of the city to impose the tax herein provided; 
B.	Any officer or employee of the government of the United States of America, state of California, or any subdivision thereof when on official business; 
C.	Any officer or employee of a foreign government who is exempt by reason of express provision of federal law or international treaty; 
D.	Any occupant for more than thirty successive calendar days;
E.	Any occupant whose rent is of a value less than two dollars a day;
F.	Any person who rents a private home, vacation cabin or like facility from an owner who is not regularly engaged in the business of renting such facilities but does so only occasionally and incidentally to his own use thereof; 
G.	Any occupant whose rent is paid for a hospital room or to a medical clinic, convalescent home or home for aged people. 
    No exemption shall be granted under paragraphs A, B or C of this section except upon a claim therefor made at the time rent is collected and under penalty of perjury upon a form prescribed by the tax administrator. 
(Ord. 115-NS §6, 1965). 
3.20.070 - Operator registration required-Certificate of authority. 
A.	Every person engaging or about to engage in business as an operator of a hotel in this city shall register with the tax administrator on a form provided by him. Persons engaged in such business must so register not later than July 15, 1964, or within fifteen days after commencing business, whichever is later, but the privilege of registration after the date of imposition of such tax shall not relieve any person from the obligation of payment or collection of tax on and after the date of imposition thereof, regardless of registration. Such registration shall set forth the name under which such person transacts or intends to transact business, the location of his place or places of business and such other information to facilitate the collection of the tax as the tax administrator may require. The registration shall be signed by the owner if a natural person; in case of an association or partnership, by a member or partner; in the case of a corporation, by an executive officer or some person specifically authorized by the corporation to sign the registration. The tax administrator shall within ten days after such registration issue without charge a certificate of authority to each registrant to collect the tax from the occupant, together with a duplicate thereof for each additional place of business of such registrant. Such certificates shall be nonassignable and nontransferable and shall be surrendered immediately to the tax administrator upon the cessation of business at the location named or upon its sale or transfer. Each certificate and duplicate shall state the place of business to which it is applicable and shall be prominently displayed therein so as to be seen and come to the notice readily of all occupants and persons seeking occupancy. 
B.	Said certificate shall, among other things, state the following:
1.	The name of the operator;
2.	The address of the hotel;
3.	The date upon which the certificate was issued;
4.	"This Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate signifies that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the transient room tax ordinance of the City of Parlier by registration with the Tax Administrator for the purpose of collecting from transients the room tax imposed by said city and remitting said tax to the Tax Administrator. This certificate does not authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business or to conduct any lawful business in an unlawful manner, or to operate a hotel without strictly complying with all local applicable laws, including but not limited to those requiring a permit from any board, commission, department, or office of said city. This certificate does not constitute a permit." 
C.	If the tax administrator deems it necessary in order to facilitate initial registration hereunder of persons engaged in business on or prior to the date of imposition of tax as set forth in this chapter, he may prescribe provisions therefor other than those provided in this section. Such provisions shall be made to effect the purposes hereof. For such purposes, such provisions shall be in lieu of or in addition to those herein provided. Such registration and certificate thereof shall have the same effect as that provided herein. 
(Ord. 115-NS §7, 1965). 
3.20.080 - Original delinquency-Penalty. 
    Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty of ten percent of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax.

3.20.090 - Continued delinquency-Penalty.

(Ord. 115-NS §8(b), 1965). 
3.20.100 - Fraud-Intent to evade payment-Penalty. 
    If the tax administrator determines that the nonpayment of any remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud or intent to evade the provisions thereof, a penalty of twenty-five percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties stated in Sections 3.20.080 and 3.20.090 of this chapter. 
(Ord. 115-NS §8(c), 1965). 
3.20.110 - Interest in addition to penalty. 
    In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the rate of one-half of one percent per month or fraction thereof on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until paid. 
(Ord. 115-NS §8(d), 1965). 
3.20.120 - Penalty to be merged with tax. 
    Every penalty imposed and such interest as accrues under the provisions of Sections 3.20.080 through 3.20.110 shall be merged with and become a part of the tax herein required to be paid. 
(Ord. 115-NS §8(e), 1965). 
3.20.130 - Due date-Quarterly payments. 
    The tax imposed by this chapter shall become due and payable from the occupant at the time of occupancy. All amounts of such taxes collectible or collected by any operator are due and payable to the tax administrator quarterly on the first day of the months of April, July, October, and January next succeeding each respective quarterly period and are delinquent after the last day of such months. 
(Ord. 115-NS §9(a), 1965). 
3.20.140 - Returns-Filing. 
    On or before the last day of the month following each quarterly period of three months, a return for thy preceding quarterly period shall be filed with the tax administrator. The return shall be filed in such form as the tax administrator may prescribe, by every operator and by every person liable to payment of tax hereunder during such quarterly period who has not paid such tax, and who has not made return in regard to the related occupancy which is the subject of tax. 
(Ord. 115-NS §9(b), 1965). 
3.20.150 - Returns-Contents. 
    Returns shall show the amount of tax collected or otherwise due for the related period and such other information as is required by the tax administrator. The tax administrator may require returns to show the total rentals upon which tax was collected or otherwise due, the gross receipts of a registered returnee for such period and the explanation in detail of any discrepancy between such amounts. 
(Ord. 115-NS §9(c), 1965). 
3.20.160 - Return-Delivery with remittance. 
    The person required to file the return shall deliver the return, together with the remittance of the amount of the tax due, to the tax administrator at his office.

3.20.170 - Due date-Extension-Interest. 
    For good cause the tax administrator may extend for not to exceed one month the time for making any return or payment of tax. No further extension shall be granted, except by the transient occupancy review committee. Any person to whom an extension is granted who makes return and pays the tax within the period of such extension shall pay, in addition to the tax, interest on the amount thereof at the rate of one-half of one percent per month, or fraction thereof, on the unpaid balance for the period of such extension to the time of return and payment, which interest shall become a part of the tax. 
(Ord. 115-NS §9(e), 1965). 
3.20.180 - Returns-For other than quarterly periods. 
    The tax administrator, if he deems it necessary in order to insure payment or facilities collection by the city of the amount of taxes in any individual case, may require returns and payment of the amount of taxes for other than quarterly periods. 
(Ord. 115-NS §9(f), 1965). 
3.20.190 - Deficient payment-Determination. 
    If the tax administrator is not satisfied with the return or returns of the tax or the amount of the tax required to be paid to the city by any person, he may compute and determine the amount required to be paid upon the basis of the facts contained in the return or returns or upon the basis of any information within his possession or that may come into his possession. One or more deficiency determinations may be made of the amount due for one or more than one period. 
(Ord. 115-NS §10(a), 1965). 
3.20.200 - Deficient payment-Offsetting against other payments. 
    In making a determination the administrator may offset overpayments, if any, which may have been previously made for a period or periods together with interest on the overpayments, against any underpayment for a subsequent period or periods, or against penalties, and interest, on the underpayments. The interest on underpayments and overpayments shall be computed in the manner set forth in Section 3.20.340. 
(Ord. 115-NS §10(b), 1965). 
3.20.210 - Deficient payment-Notice. 
    The tax administrator shall give to the operator or occupant written notice of his determination. The notice may be served personally or by mail; if by mail, the notice shall be enclosed in a sealed envelope postage prepaid and addressed to the operator at his address as it appears in the records of the administrator. In case of service by mail of any notice required by this chapter the service is complete at the time of deposit in the United States Post Office. 
(Ord. 115-NS §10(c), 1965). 
3.20.220 - Deficient payment-Three-year time limit. 
    Except in the case of fraud, intent to evade this chapter or authorized rules and regulations, or failure to make a timely return, every deficiency determination shall be made and notice thereof mailed within three years after the last day of the month following the close of the quarterly period for which the amount is proposed to be determined or within three years after the return is filed, whichever period expires the later. 
(Ord. 115-NS §10(d), 1965). 
3.20.230 - Deficient payment-Collection-Procedure. 
    If any operator shall fail or refuse to collect the tax or to make, within the time provided in this chapter any report and remittance of the tax or any portion thereof required by this chapter or makes a fraudulent return or otherwise wilfully attempts to evade this chapter, the tax administrator shall proceed in such manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to base his estimate of the tax due. As soon as the tax administrator procures such facts and information as he is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, he shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by this chapter. In case such determination is made, the tax administrator shall give a notice in the manner aforesaid of the amount so assessed. Such determination and notice shall be made and mailed within three years after discovery by the tax administrator of any fraud, intent to evade or failure to file return. A determination shall become final within thirty days after giving notice thereof as herein provided. 
(Ord. 115-NS §10(e), 1965). 
3.20.240 - Deficient payment-Collection-When jeopardized by delay. 
    If the tax administrator believes that the collection of any tax or any amount of tax required to be collected and paid to the city will be jeopardized by delay, or if any determination will be jeopardized by delay, he shall thereupon make a determination of the tax or amount of tax required to be collected, noting that fact upon the determination. The amount determined is immediately due and payable. If the amount specified in the determination is not paid within ten days after service of notice thereof upon the person against whom the determination is made, the amount becomes final at the expiration of the ten days, unless a petition for redetermination is filed within the ten days, and the delinquency penalty and the interest provided in Sections 3.20.080 through 3.20.120 shall attach to the amount of the tax or the amount of the tax required to be collected. 
(Ord. 115-NS §10(f), 1965). 
3.20.250 - Redetermination-Petition. 
    Any person against whom a determination is made under Sections 3.20.190 through 3.20.240 or any person directly interested may petition for redetermination within fifteen days after service upon the person of notice thereof. If a petition for redetermination is not filed within the thirty-day period, the determination becomes final at the expiration of the period. Provided, however, a petition for redetermination under Section 3.20.300 of this chapter shall be filed within ten days after notice. 
(Ord. 115-NS §11(a), 1965). 
3.20.260 - Redetermination-Hearing. 
    If a petition for redetermination is filed within the allowable period, the tax administrator shall reconsider the determination, and, if the person has so requested in his petition, shall grant the person an oral hearing and shall give him ten days' notice of the time and place of the hearing. The tax administrator may continue the hearing from time to time as may be necessary. 
(Ord. 115-NS §11(b), 1965). 
3.20.270 - Redetermination-Change of amount of determination. 
    The tax administrator may decrease or increase the amount of the determination before it becomes final but the amount may be increased only if a claim for the increase if asserted by the tax administrator at or before the hearing. 
(Ord. 115-NS §11(c), 1965). 
3.20.280 - Redetermination-Decision. 
    The order or decision of the tax administrator upon a petition for redetermination becomes final fifteen days after service upon the petitioner of notice thereof, unless appeal of such order or decision is filed with the transient occupancy tax review committee within fifteen days after service of such notice. 
(Ord. 115-NS §11(d), 1965). 
3.20.290 - Redetermination-Guarantee of payment of determination. 
    No petition for redetermination or appeal therefrom shall be effective for any purpose unless at or before the filing thereof the amount found due in the original determination is paid or a bond or other security satisfactory to the tax administrator is filed with him guaranteeing payment of any amount finally determined to be due. 
(Ord. 115-NS §11(e), 1965). 
3.20.300 - Security for collection-Amount. 
    The tax administrator, whenever he deems it necessary to insure compliance with this chapter, may require any person subject thereto to deposit with him such security in the form of cash, bond, or other security as the tax administrator may determine. The amount of the security shall be fixed by the tax administrator but shall not be greater than twice the person's estimated average liability for the period for which he files returns, determined in such manner as the tax administrator deems proper, or ten thousand dollars, whichever amount is the lesser. The amount of the security may be increased or decreased by the tax administrator subject to the limitations herein provided. 
(Ord. 115-NS §12(a), 1965). 
3.20.310 - Security for collection-Action in delinquency. 
    If any person is delinquent in the payment of the amount required to be paid by him or in the event a determination has been made against him which remains unpaid, the tax administrator may, not later than three years after the payment became delinquent, give notice thereof by registered mail to all persons in the county having in their possession or under their control any credits or other personal property belonging to the delinquent, or owing any debts to the delinquent. After receiving the notice the persons so notified shall neither transfer nor make any other disposition of the credits, other personal property, or debts in their possession or under their control at the time they receive the notice until the tax administrator consents to a transfer or disposition or until twenty days elapse after the receipt of the notice. All persons so notified shall within five days after the receipt of the notice advise the tax administrator of all such credits, other personal property, or debts in their possession, under their control, or owing by them. 
(Ord. 115-NS §12(b), 1965). 
3.20.320 - Security for collection-Civil action. 
    At any time within three years after any tax or any amount of tax required to be collected becomes due and payable or at any time within three years after any determination becomes final, the tax administrator may bring an action in the courts of this state, or any other state, or of the United States in the name of the city, to collect the amount delinquent together with penalties and interest. 
(Ord. 115-NS §12(c), 1965). 
3.20.330 - Security for collection-Withholding by successors or assigns. 
    If any operator liable for any amount under this chapter sells out his business or quits the business, his successors or assigns shall withhold sufficient of the purchase price to cover such amount until the former owner produces a receipt from the tax administrator showing that he has been paid or a certificate stating that no amount is due. If the purchaser of a business fails to withhold the tax from the purchase price as required, he becomes personally liable for the payment of the amount required to be withheld by him to the extent of the purchase price, valued in money. Within thirty days after receiving a written request from the purchaser for a certificate, the tax administrator shall either issue the certificate or mail notice to the purchaser at his address as it appears on the records of the tax administrator of the amount that must be paid as a condition of issuing the certificate.

(Ord. 99-01 §1(part), 1999). 
3.30.030 - Development impact fees-Purpose. 
    In order to implement the goals and objectives of the circulation, public facilities and housing elements of the city's general plan, and to mitigate the impacts caused by new development in the city, various public improvements must be or had to be constructed or installed. The city council has determined that development impact fees are needed to finance such public improvements in order to pay the development's fair share of the cost of those improvements. In establishing the fees described in this chapter, the city council has considered the effects of the fees with respect to the city's housing needs as established in the housing element of the general plan and finds that these fees are consistent with the general plan. 
(Ord. 99-01 §1(part), 1999). 
3.30.040 - Development impact fees. 
A.	Development impact fees shall be collected by the city upon issuance of the following entitlements for use: building permits, subdivision maps, parcel maps, conditional use permits, site plan reviews, director review permits, and annexations of developed territory.

D.	On an annual basis, the city council shall review the development impact fees to determine whether the amounts are reasonably related to the impact of the proposed projects and whether the planned public facilities are still needed. 
(Ord. 99-01 §1(part), 1999). 
3.30.050 - Limited use of fees. 
    The revenues raised by payment of development impact fees shall be placed in separate and special accounts, and such revenues together with any interest earned on those accounts, shall be used solely to:

B.	Reimburse developers who have been required or permitted to install specified facilities which are larger in size, length, or capacity than needed only for their development projects.

A.	The developer of a project or the owner of developed territory proposed to be annexed to the city which is subject to payment of development impact fees may apply to the city council for a reduction, adjustment, deferral or waiver of some or all of those fees based on: 
1.	The absence of a reasonable relationship or nexus between the impacts of the project and either the amount of the fees or the facilities to be financed by the fees; or 
2.	The absence of any substantial benefit to a developed single-family residential property that would result from annexation to the city. 
B.	The application shall be made in writing and filed with the city clerk not later than thirty days after the director of development services determines the development impact fees applicable to the project. The application shall state the factual basis for the waiver, reduction, deferral or adjustment. The decision of the city council shall be final. 
C.	Any change in the project that is not consistent with an approved development impact fee reduction, adjustment, deferral or waiver shall invalidate the reduction, adjustment, deferral or waiver. 
(Ord. 99-01 §1(part), 1999). 
3.30.080 - Procedures. 
A.	Development impact fees may be imposed on discrete portions of lots where the project is limited to such portion of the lot by site plan review, conditional use permit, or director's review permit. 
B.	For industrial and commercial expansions, alterations and remodeling, the development impact fees shall be based on the relative amount of newly constructed building area in relation to the maximum lot coverage permitted in the applicable zone district, to the extent that the remodeling, alteration or expansion creates additional burdens on public facilities or adds to the need for new public facilities to serve the new development. The number of square feet of new building area, expressed as a percent of the maximum allowable building area on the lot, shall be multiplied by the development impact fees that would be applicable to the entire parcel. 
C.	Where a commercial or industrial project consists only of nonporous surfacing materials on the ground, only storm drain/flood control fees shall be imposed. The fee shall be the percent of area paved in relation to the total area of the parcel, multiplied by the fee for the entire parcel. 
D.	The developer of a vacant lot(s) in a subdivision shall be credited the value of oversized offsite public facilities or improvements constructed by the developer of that subdivision outside the boundaries of the subdivision, which serve or are available to serve developments other than the subject subdivision. The credit shall be prorated to each lot within the subdivision. The credit shall be applied only against the applicable development impact fee which relates to the oversized offsite public facilities actually constructed. 
E.	Churches shall be deemed single-family residential uses for the calculation and imposition of development impact fees, regardless of the zone district in which the project is located. 
F.	Development impact fees shall be calculated based on gross acres, which shall include the street area adjacent to the project to the centerline of the right-of-way. 
G.	Fees shall be based on the zone district in which the project is located.
H.	Fees apply to all projects in the city. The director of development services shall determine the type of project and the fee to be charged.

4.05.060 - Same-City response. 
A.	Upon receipt of the petition, the employee relations officer shall determine whether:
1.	There has been compliance with the requirements of the recognition petition; and
2.	The proposed representation unit is an appropriate unit in accordance with Section 4.05.100 of this chapter. 
B.	If an affirmative determination is made by the employee relations officer on the foregoing matters, the employee relations officer shall so inform the petitioning organization, give written notice of the request for recognition to the employees in the unit, and take no action on the request for thirty days. If either of the foregoing matters are not affirmatively determined, the employee relations officer shall offer to consult thereon with the petitioning employee organization and, if such determination thereafter remains unchanged, shall inform that organization of the reasons therefor in writing. The petitioning employee organization may appeal such determination in accordance with Section 4.05.120 of this chapter. 
(Ord. 97-4 §1(part), 1997). 
4.05.070 - Same-Open period for filing challenging petition. 
    Within thirty days after the date written notice was given to affected employees that a valid recognition petition for an appropriate unit has been filed, any other employee organization may file a competing request to be formally acknowledged as the exclusively recognized employee organization of the employees in the same or in an overlapping unit or one which corresponds with respect to some, but not all, the classifications or positions set forth in the recognition petition being challenged, by filing a petition evidencing proof of employee support in the unit claimed to be appropriate of at least thirty percent and otherwise in the same form and manner as set forth in Section 4.05.050 of this chapter. If such challenging petition seeks establishment of an overlapping unit, the employee relations officer shall call for a hearing on such overlapping petitions for the purpose of ascertaining the more appropriate unit, at which time the petitioning employee organizations shall be heard. Thereafter, the employee relations officer shall determine the appropriate unit or units in accordance with the standards in Section 4.05.100 of this chapter. The petitioning employee organizations shall have fifteen days from the date notice of such unit determination is communicated to them by the employee relations officer to amend their petitions to conform to such determination or to appeal such determination pursuant to Section 4.05.120 of this chapter. 
(Ord. 97-4 §1(part), 1997). 
4.05.080 - Election procedure. 
A.	The employee relations officer shall arrange for a secret ballot election to be conducted by a party agreed to by the employee relations officer and the concerned employee organization, in accordance with its rules and procedures subject to the provisions of this chapter. All employee organizations who have duly submitted petitions which have been determined to be in conformance with this chapter shall be included on the ballot. The ballot shall also reserve to employees the choice of representing themselves individually in their employment relations with the city. Employees entitled to vote in such election shall be those persons employed in regular permanent positions within the designated appropriate unit who were employed during the pay period immediately prior to the date which ended at least fifteen days before the date the election commences, including those who did not work during such period because illness, vacation or other authorized leaves of absence, and who are employed by the city in the same unit on the date of the election. An employee organization shall be formally acknowledged as the exclusively recognized employee organization for the designated appropriate unit following an election or runoff election, if it received a numerical majority of all valid votes cast in the election. In an election involving three or more choices, where none of the choices receives a majority of the valid votes cast, a runoff election shall be conducted between the two choices receiving the largest number of valid votes cast, the rules governing an initial election being applicable to a runoff election. 
B.	There shall be no more than one valid election under this chapter pursuant to any petition in a twelve-month period affecting the same unit. 
C.	If the parties are unable to agree on a third party to conduct an election, the election shall be conducted by the State Conciliation Service. 
D.	Costs of conducting elections shall be borne in equal shares by the city and by each employee organization appearing on the ballot. 
(Ord. 97-4 §1(part), 1997). 
4.05.090 - Procedure for decertification of exclusively recognized employees organization. 
A.	A decertification petition alleging that the incumbent exclusively recognized employee organization no longer represents a majority of the employees in an established appropriate unit may be filed with the employee relations officer only during the month of March of any year following the first full year of recognition or during the thirty-day period commencing one hundred twenty days prior to the termination date of a memorandum of understanding then having been in effect less than three years, whichever occurs later. A decertification petition may be filed by two or more employees or their representative of an employee organization and shall contain the following information and documentation declared by the duly authorized signatory under penalty of perjury to be true, correct and complete: 
1.	The name, address and telephone number of the petitioner and a designated representative authorized to receive notices or requests for further information; 
2.	The name of the established appropriate unit and of the incumbent exclusively recognized employee organization sought to be decertified as the representative of that unit; 
3.	An allegation that the incumbent exclusively recognized employee organization no longer represents a majority of the employees in the appropriate unit and any other relevant and material facts relating thereto; 
4.	Proof of employee support that at least thirty percent of the employees in the established appropriate unit no longer desire to be represented by the incumbent exclusively recognized employee organization. Such proof shall be submitted for confirmation to the employee relations officer or to a mutually agreed upon disinterested third party within the time limits specified in subsection A of this section. 
B.	An employee organization may, in satisfaction of the decertification petition requirements under this article, file a petition under this section in the form of a recognition petition that evidences proof of employee support of at least thirty percent and otherwise conforms to the requirements of Section 4.05.050 of this chapter. 
C.	The employee relations officer shall initially determine whether the petition has been filed in compliance with the applicable provisions of this article. If the determination is in the negative, the employee relations officer shall offer to consult thereon with the representative of such petitioning employees or employee organization and, if such determination thereafter remains unchanged, shall return such petition to the employees or employee organization with a statement of the reasons therefor in writing. The petitioning employees or employee organization may appeal such determination in accordance with Section 4.05.120 of this chapter. If the determination of the employee relations officer is in the affirmative, or if a negative determination is reversed on appeal, written notice of such decertification or recognition petition shall be given to the incumbent exclusively recognized employee organization and to unit employees. 
D.	The employee relations officer shall thereupon arrange for a secret ballot election to be held on or about fifteen days after such notice to determine the wishes of unit employees as to the question of decertification and, if a recognition petition was duly filed under this article, the question of representation. Such election shall be conducted in conformance with Section 4.05.090 of this chapter. 
E.	During the open period specified in subsection A of this section, the employee relations officer may on his or her own motion, when he or she has reason to believe that a majority of unit employees no longer wish to be represented by the incumbent exclusively recognized employee organization, give notice to that organization and all unit employees that such officer will arrange for an election to determine that issue. In such event any other employee organization may, within fifteen days of such notice, file a recognition petition in accordance with this section, which the employee relations officer shall act on in accordance with this section. 
F.	If, pursuant to this section, a different employee organization is formally acknowledged as the exclusively recognized employee organization, such organization shall be bound by all the terms and conditions of any memorandum of understanding then in effect for its remaining term. 
(Ord. 97-4 §1(part), 1997). 
4.05.100 - Policy and standards for determination of appropriate units. 
A.	The policy objectives in determining the appropriateness of units shall be the effect of a proposed unit on: 
1.	The efficient operations of the city and its compatibility with the primary responsibility of the city and its employees to effectively and economically serve the public; and 
2.	Providing employees with effective representation based on recognized community of interest considerations. 
B.	These policy objectives require that the appropriate unit shall be the broadest feasible grouping of positions that share an identifiable community of interest. Factors to be considered shall be: 
1.	Similarity of the general kinds of work performed, types of qualifications required, and the general working conditions; 
2.	History of representation in the city and similar employment; except that no unit shall be deemed to be an appropriate unit solely on the basis of the extent to which employees in the proposed unit have organized; 
3.	Consistency with the organizational patterns of the city;
4.	Number of employees and classifications, and the effect on the administration of employer-employee relations created by the fragmentation of classifications and proliferation of units; 
5.	Effect on the classification structure and impact on the stability of the employer-employee relationship of dividing a single or related classifications among two or more units. 
C.	Notwithstanding the foregoing provisions of this section, managerial, supervisory and confidential responsibilities, as defined in Section 4.05.020 of this chapter, are determining factors in establishing appropriate units under this article, and therefore such managerial, supervisory and confidential employees may only be included in units that do not include nonmanagerial, nonsupervisory and nonconfidential employees. Managerial, supervisory and confidential employees may not represent any employee organization which represents other employees. 
D.	The employee relations officer shall, after notice to and consultation with affected employee organizations, allocate new classifications or positions, delete eliminated classifications or positions, and retain, reallocate or delete modified classifications or positions from units in accordance with the provisions of this section. 
(Ord. 97-4 §1(part), 1997). 
4.05.110 - Procedures for modification of established appropriate units. 
A.	Requests by employee organizations for modifications of established appropriate units may be considered by the employee relations officer during the period specified in Section 4.05.090 of this chapter. Such requests shall be submitted in the form of a recognition petition and, in addition to the requirements set forth in Section 4.05.050 of this chapter, shall contain a complete statement of all relevant facts and citations in support of the proposed modified unit in terms of the policies and standards set forth in Section 4.05.100 of this chapter. The employee relations officer shall process such petitions as other recognition petitions under this article. 
B.	The employee relations officer may on his or her own motion propose during the period specified in Section 4.05.090 of this chapter, that an established unit be modified. The employee relations officer shall give written notice of the proposed modification to any affected employee organization and shall hold a meeting concerning the proposed modification, at which time all affected employee organizations shall be heard. Thereafter, the employee relations officer shall determine the composition of the appropriate unit or units in accordance with Section 4.05.100 of this chapter, and shall give written notice of such determination to the affected employee organizations. The employee relations officer's determination may be appealed as provided in Section 4.05.120 of this chapter. If a unit is modified pursuant to the motion of the employee relations officer under this article, employee organizations may thereafter file recognition petitions seeking to become the exclusively recognized employee organization for such new appropriate unit or units pursuant to Section 4.05.050 of this chapter. 
(Ord. 97-4 §1(part), 1997). 
4.05.120 - Appeals. 
A.	An employee organization aggrieved by an appropriate unit determination of the employee relations officer under this article may, within ten days of notice thereof, request the intervention of the State Conciliation Service pursuant to Government Code §§ 3507.1 and 3507.3, or may, in lieu thereof or thereafter, appeal such determination to the city council for final decision within fifteen days of notice of the employee relations officer's determination or the termination of proceedings pursuant to Government Code §§ 3507.1 and 3507.3, whichever is later. 
B.	An employee organization aggrieved by a determination of the employee relations officer that a recognition petition, challenging petition or decertification of recognition petition, or employees aggrieved by a determination of the employee relations officer that a decertification petition has not been filed in compliance with the applicable provisions of this chapter may, within fifteen days of notice of such determination, appeal the determination to city council for final decision. 
C.	Appeals to the city council shall be filed in writing with the city clerk, and a copy thereof served on the employee relations officer. The city council shall commence to consider the matter within thirty days of the filing of the appeal. The city council may, in its discretion, refer the dispute to a third party hearing process.

    If the meet-and-confer process has reached impasse, either party may initiate the impasse procedures by filing with the other party a written request for an impasse meeting, together with a statement of its position on all issues. An impasse meeting shall then be scheduled promptly by the employee relations officer. The purpose of such meeting shall be: 
A.	To review the position of the parties in a final effort to reach agreement on a memorandum of understanding; and 
B.	If the impasse is not resolved, to discuss arrangements for the utilization of the impasse procedures provided in this article. 
(Ord. 97-4 §1(part), 1997). 
4.05.210 - Procedures enumerated. 
A.	Impasse procedures are as follows:
1.	If either of the parties demand to submit the dispute to mediation, the dispute shall be submitted to mediation. All mediation proceedings shall be private. The mediator shall make no public recommendation, nor take any public position at any time concerning the issues. 
2.	If the parties fail to resolve the dispute through mediation within fifteen days after the mediator commenced meeting with the parties, the parties may agree to submit the impasse to fact-finding. 
3.	If the parties agree on fact-finding, they may agree on the appointment of one or more fact-finders. If they fail to so agree on one or more fact-finders, a fact-finding panel of three shall be appointed in the following manner: one member of the panel shall be appointed by the employee relations officer, one member shall be appointed by the exclusively recognized employee organization, and those two shall name a third, who shall be the chairperson. If they are unable to agree upon a third, they shall select by agreement the third member from one or more lists of seven names of individuals having fact-finding experience in the municipal sector to be provided by the State Conciliation Service. 
B.	The following constitute the jurisdictional and procedural requirements for fact-finding:
1.	The fact-finders shall consider and be guided by applicable federal and state laws.
2.	Subject to the stipulations of the parties, the fact-finders shall determine and apply the following measures and criteria in arriving at their findings and recommendations: 
a.	First, as relevant to the issues in dispute, the fact-finders shall compare the total compensation, hours and conditions of employment of the employees involved in the fact-finding proceeding with the total compensation, hours and conditions of employment of other employees performing similar services in public and private employment in the same and comparable communities. "Total compensation" shall mean all wage compensation including, but not limited to, premium, incentive, minimum, standby, out-of-class and deferred pay; all paid leave time; all allowances, including, but not limited to, educational and uniform benefits; and employer payments for all health, welfare and pension benefits. 
b.	The fact-finders shall then adjust the results of the above comparisons based on the following factors: 
i.	The compensation necessary to recruit and retain qualified personnel,
ii.	Maintaining compensation relationships between job classifications and positions within the city, 
iii.	The pattern of change that has occurred in the total compensation of the employees in the unit at impasse as compared to the pattern of change in the average consumer price index for goods and services, and the pattern of change in wages and compensation of other wage earners. 
c.	The fact-finders shall then determine preliminary recommendations based on the comparisons as adjusted above which, however, shall be reduced as appropriate based on the financial resources of the city to implement them. 
d.	In assessing the city's financial resources, the fact-finders shall be bound by the following: 
i.	Other legislatively determined and projected demands on agency resources, i.e., budgetary priorities as established by the city council, 
ii.	Allowance for equitable compensation increases for other employees and employee groups for the corresponding fiscal period, 
iii.	Revenue projections not to exceed currently authorized tax and fee rates for the relevant fiscal year, 
iv.	Assurance of sufficient and sound budgetary reserves, and
v.	Constitutional, statutory limitations on the level and use of revenues and expenditures.
3.	The fact-finders shall make written findings of the facts and recommendations for the resolution of the issues in dispute, which shall be presented in terms of the criteria, adjustments and limitations specified above. Any member of a fact-finding panel shall be accorded the right to file dissenting written findings of fact and recommendations. The fact-finder or chairperson of the fact-finding panel shall serve such findings and recommendations on the employee relations officer and the designated representative of the exclusively recognized employee organization. If these parties have not resolved the impasse within ten days after service of the findings and recommendations upon them, the fact-finder or the chairperson of the fact-finding panel shall make them public by submitting them to the city clerk for consideration by the city council in connection with the council's legislative consideration of the impasse. 
C.	If mediation was not successful and if the parties did not agree on fact-finding, or having so agreed, the impasse was not resolved, the city council may take such action regarding the impasse as it, in its discretion, deems appropriate in the public interest. Any legislative action by the city council on the impasse shall be final and binding. 
(Ord. 97-4 §1(part), 1997). 
4.05.220 - Costs. 
    The costs for the services of a mediator and fact-finder or chairperson of a fact-finding panel utilized by the parties, and other mutually incurred costs of mediation and fact-finding shall be borne equally by the city and the exclusively recognized employee organization. The cost for a fact-finding panel member selected by each party and other separately incurred costs shall be borne by such party.

C.	No special credit shall be allowed in meeting any qualifications or in the giving of any test of the establishment of any open-competitive promotional lists, for service rendered under a provisional appointment. 
(Ord. 97-4 §1(part), 1997). 
4.08.130 - Temporary employees, interns. 
A.	From time to time the city has a need for the employment of persons to fill temporary and/or seasonal work assignments. The cost and administrative delay inherent in testing persons to fill such short term positions is out of proportion to the positions and incompatible with the need to expeditiously fill such positions in time to perform the temporary work. The city is also frequently offered an opportunity to hire students or recent graduates who work as part of their course of study. It is in the interest of the city and in the efficient administration of city services that management be authorized to fill temporary positions and to employ interns with a minimum of administrative expense and delay. 
B.	Department directors are authorized to employ persons to fill positions that necessarily will terminate within six months after appointment. Department directors shall use an abbreviated testing procedure approved by the personnel director for the appointment of such persons. 
C.	Department directors are authorized to employ high school and college students to work as interns for up to one thousand hours. Interns are defined as persons regularly enrolled in high school or in an accredited college or university whose course of study is related to the activities of city government. 
D.	The procedures for the employment of temporary employees and interns shall require that eligible and qualified persons have a reasonable opportunity to apply for the position. Personal favoritism and/or prejudice for or against any person is strictly prohibited. The procedures utilized by department directors for the employment of temporary employees and interns shall be carefully scrutinized by the personnel director to ensure that the process is fair and complies with city policies. 
E.	Temporary employees and interns employed under this rule shall not be considered part of the competitive service; they may be removed from city service at any time without the right of appeal or hearing; they shall be allowed no special credit in meeting any qualification for employment in the competitive service; and they shall receive no employee benefits, such as sick leave, vacation, health plan, or retirement. 
(Ord. 97-4 §1(part), 1997). 
ARTICLE 3. - PROBATIONARY PERIOD 

4.08.200 - Regular appointment following probationary period. 
A.	All original and promotional appointments shall be tentative and subject to a probationary period of not less than six months' actual service.

The appointing authority or designee may extend such probationary period for six additional months. 
B.	The personnel director shall notify the appointing authority four weeks prior to the termination of any probationary period. If the service of the probationary employee has been satisfactory, the appointing authority shall file with the personnel director a statement in writing to such effect and stating that the retention of such employee in the service is desired. If no written statement is filed prior to termination of the probationary period, the probationary period shall be deemed satisfactorily completed. Where a statement of unsatisfactory service is filed, notice of the termination shall immediately be served on the probationer. 
(Ord. 97-4 §1(part), 1997). 
4.08.210 - Objective of probationary period.

4.08.230 - Rejection following promotion. 
    Any employee rejected during the probationary period following a promotional appointment, shall be reinstated to the position from which the employee was promoted, unless charges are filed and the employee is discharged in the manner provided for positions in the competitive service. If there is no vacancy in such position, the employee may request to be placed on a reemployment list. 
(Ord. 97-4 §1(part), 1997). 
ARTICLE 4. - TRANSFER, PROMOTION, DEMOTION AND REINSTATEMENT 

4.08.280 - Transfer. 
A.	No employee shall be transferred to a position for which that person does not possess the minimum qualifications. Upon notice to the personnel director, an employee may be transferred by the appointing authority from one position to another position in a comparable class. For transfer purposes, a comparable class is one with the same maximum salary range, involves performance of similar duties, and requires substantially the same qualifications. 
B.	If the transfer involves a change from one department to another, both department directors must consent thereto unless the city manager orders the transfer. Transfers shall not be used for the purpose of effectuating a promotion or demotion, which actions may be accomplished only as provided in the personnel ordinance. 
(Ord. 97-4 §1(part), 1997). 
4.08.290 - Promotion. 
A.	Insofar as consistent with the best interests of city service, all vacancies in the competitive service shall be filled by promotion from within the competitive service, after a promotional examination has been given and a promotional list established. 
B.	If, in the opinion of the personnel director, it is in the best interests of the city, a vacancy in the position may be filled by an open-competitive examination instead of promotional examination, the personnel director shall arrange for an open competitive examination and for the preparation and certification of an open competitive employment list. 
(Ord. 97-4 §1(part), 1997). 
4.08.300 - Demotion. 
    The appointing power may demote an employee whose ability to perform the required duties falls below standard or for disciplinary purposes. Upon request of the employee, and with the consent of the appointing power, demotion may be made to a vacant position. No employee shall be demoted to a position for which he or she does not possess the minimum qualifications. Disciplinary demotions shall be in accordance with the Chapter 4.03 of this title. 
(Ord. 97-4 §1(part), 1997). 
4.08.310 - Reinstatement. 
    With the approval of the appointing authority, a regular employee or probationary employee who has completed at least six months of probationary service and who has resigned with a good record, may be reinstated within two years of the effective date of resignation to a vacant position in the same or comparable class. Upon reinstatement, the employee shall be subject to the probationary period prescribed for the class as if a new employee. No credit for former employment shall be granted in computing salary, vacation, sick leave or other benefits except on the specific recommendation of the appointing authority at the time of reinstatement. 
(Ord. 97-4 §1(part), 1997). 
4.08.320 - Resignation. 
    An employee wishing to leave city service in good standing shall file with the appointing authority a written resignation stating the effective date and reasons for leaving, at least two weeks before leaving the service, unless such time limit is waived by the appointing authority. A statement as to the resigned employee's service performance and other pertinent information shall be forwarded to the personnel director. Failure to give notice as required by this rule shall be cause for denying future employment by the city. 
(Ord. 97-4 §1(part), 1997). 
ARTICLE 5. - ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVES, REPORTS AND RECORDS 

4.08.350 - Attendance. 
    Employees shall be in attendance at their work in accordance with the rules regarding hours of work, holidays and leaves. All departments shall keep daily attendance records of employees which shall be reported to the personnel director in the form and on the dates he or she shall specify. 
(Ord. 97-4 §1(part), 1997). 
4.08.360 - Military leave. 
    Military leave shall be granted in accordance with the provisions of state law. All employees entitled to military leave shall give the appointing authority an opportunity, within the limits of military regulations, to determine when such leave shall be taken. 
(Ord. 97-4 §1(part), 1997). 
4.08.370 - Leave of absence without pay. 
A.	The city manager, in his or her discretion, may grant a regular or probationary employee leave of absence without pay or seniority for not to exceed three months. After three months, the leave of absence may be extended. No such leave shall be granted except upon written request of the employee, setting forth the reason for the request. Upon expiration of a regularly approved leave or within a reasonable period of time after notice to return to duty, the employee shall be reinstated in the position held at the time leave was taken. Failure on the part of an employee on leave to report promptly at its expiration, or within a reasonable time after notice to return to duty, shall cause the employee to be deemed to be discharged. The depositing in the United States mail of a first-class letter, postage prepaid, addressed to the employee's last known address, shall constitute reasonable notice. 
B.	Department directors may grant a regular or probationary employee leave of absence without pay for not to exceed one calendar week. Such leaves shall be reported to the personnel director. 
(Ord. 97-4 §1(part), 1997). 
4.08.380 - Administrative leave/relief of duty. 
    The city manager may place an employee on relief of duty with full pay and benefits for an indeterminate period when circumstances exist such that the public interest requires that the employee be relieved from active duty. Such relief of duty shall not constitute punitive or disciplinary action. During the period of relief of duty, the employee may be required to regularly report to the department director or designee in a manner described in writing by the department director to the employee. 
(Ord. 97-4 §1(part), 1997).

The employee shall receive normal pay during the period of jury duty, and shall turn over all pay received for jury duty to the city for the times that the employee was required to miss work. 
(Ord. 97-4 §1(part), 1997). 
ARTICLE 6. - GRIEVANCE-COMPLAINT PROCEDURE 

4.08.400 - Established-Purpose. 
    In the belief that the resolution of grievances and complaints is beneficial to improved employer-employee relations, a grievance-complaint procedure is established. Such a procedure will give employees assurance that the city recognizes their right to be heard and will assist them in achieving job satisfaction. The purpose of this procedure is to provide a just and equitable method for the resolution of grievances and complaints without coercion or reprisal. 
(Ord. 97-4 §1(part), 1997).

I.	All employees have the right to consult with their supervisor, their department head, or the personnel officer without prejudice, concerning the manner, form and/or procedure for filing a grievance or complaint. 
J.	Failure of the grievant to complete any step on the grievance-complaint procedure will bar further consideration of the grievance or complaint. 
K.	The grievance-complaint procedure shall not be used in addition to, or as a substitute for, the disciplinary procedure, the unfair labor relations practice procedure or the impasse procedure, when any of such procedures are or could reasonably have been available in the exercise of reasonable diligence. 
L.	Grievances may be filed only by an exclusively recognized employee organization.
M.	The term "grievant" shall also include persons who file complaints under this procedure.
(Ord. 97-4 §1(part), 1997).

(Ord. 97-4 §1(part), 1997). 
ARTICLE 7. - HARASSMENT OF EMPLOYEES 

4.08.450 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to prevent city employees from being subjected to discrimination and harassment, and to ensure equal employment opportunities in conformance with Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Fair Employment and Housing Act. 
(Ord. 97-4 §1(part), 1997). 
4.08.460 - Policy statement. 
    The city is committed to creating and maintaining a work environment that is free from all forms of unlawful discrimination and intimidation, including sexual harassment. The city will take appropriate preventative, corrective and/or disciplinary action in response to behavior that violates this article or the rights and privileges it is designed to protect. 
(Ord. 97-4 §1(part), 1997). 
4.08.470 - Definitions. 
A.	"Discrimination" means any act or omission which would create a hostile work environment for, or exclude any person from, employment or promotional opportunities because of sex, sexual orientation, race, color, ancestry, religious creed, national origin, physical disability, mental disability, medical condition, age or marital status. 
B.	"Harassment" means unwelcome derogatory comments, slurs, jokes, pictures, cartoons or posters, or actions which reasonably result in an employee being offended or insulted because of a protected status as enumerated in subsection A of this section. 
C.	"Sexual harassment" means unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors or other verbal, visual or physical conduct of a sexual nature when: 
1.	Submission to such conduct is explicitly or implicitly made a term or condition of employment; 
2.	Submission to or rejection of such conduct by an employee is used as the basis for employment decisions affecting the employee; or 
3.	Conduct that reasonably has the purpose or effect of interfering with an employee's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile, or offensive work environment. 
D.	Unlawful harassment does not include the following:
1.	Acts or omissions based on bona fide occupational qualifications.
2.	Bona fide requests or demands by a supervisor that an employee improve his/her work quality or output, that the employee report to the job site on time, that the employee comply with city or departmental rules or regulations, or any other appropriate work related communications between supervisor and employee. 
(Ord. 97-4 §1(part), 1997). 
4.08.480 - Responsibility. 
A.	Each department director is responsible for ensuring that the work environment is free from all types of unlawful discrimination, including harassment. Supervisors are responsible for taking prompt and appropriate action within their work units to avoid and minimize the incidence of discrimination. Individual employees may be held responsible and personally liable for discriminatory acts, including harassment, and shall be educated by their supervisors as to what constitutes unlawful discrimination and harassment. 
B.	Because of differences in individual values, supervisors may find it difficult to recognize that their behavior or the behavior of others is discriminatory or constitutes harassment. Given the nature of discrimination and harassment, false or mistaken accusations of discrimination and harassment could have negative effects on the careers of innocent employees. It is therefore imperative that supervisors and management act responsibly in the handling of such situations and make determinations on allegations of discrimination and/or harassment based upon all available facts. 
C.	Supervisors receiving information regarding violations of this article shall determine if there is a substantial basis for the allegations and shall proceed with resolution as provided in Section 4.08.490 of this chapter. 
D.	City personnel made aware of any allegation of discrimination/harassment shall notify the department director of the allegations within twenty-four hours. 
(Ord. 97-4 §1(part), 1997). 
4.08.490 - Investigation of complaints. 
A.	Methods of Resolution.
1.	Informal Resolution. Whenever possible, employees who believe that they are experiencing unlawful discrimination and/or harassment are encouraged to inform the individual that his/her behavior is unwelcome, offensive, unprofessional or highly inappropriate. If this does not resolve the concern or if the employee feels uncomfortable, threatened, or has difficulty expressing his/her concern, informal assistance or counseling should be sought from a supervisor, or the department director. 
2.	Formal Investigation. Upon being notified of any complaint which has not been satisfactorily resolved through the informal means described above, the department director shall initiate a formal investigation after consultation with the personnel officer. 
a.	The personnel officer shall cause an investigation to be made of all aspects of the complaint. The investigative authority shall include access to records and cooperation of all employees involved. No influence will be used to suppress any complaint, and (except as herein provided) no employee will be subject to retaliation or reprisal for filing a complaint. 
b.	Formal investigation of the complaint will be confidential and will include, but not be limited to details of the specific incident, frequency and dates of occurrences and names of any witnesses. 
3.	Optional Resolution. Employees who believe they have been discriminated against or harassed because of their protected status may, without following the departmental chain of command, file a complaint directly with the department director, city manager or director of personnel, or city council. 
B.	Disposition of Complaints.
1.	Confirmed Complaints. If the complaint is substantiated, this policy (article) prohibiting discrimination/harassment will be reviewed by the offender, and appropriate disciplinary action, counseling and/or training will be taken pursuant to departmental and city procedures. 
2.	Not Sustained Complaints. If a complaint of discrimination/harassment is not substantiated, the person filing the complaint will be counseled regarding the potential impact of a false accusation on his/her career and the career of the accused. The accused shall be notified that the complaint was not substantiated. Both parties will be cautioned as to the sensitivity of the situation. 
3.	Unfounded Complaints. If it is determined that an act reported pursuant to this article did not in fact occur, or did occur but was lawful and proper within the guidelines established herein, a finding of unfounded shall be made. 
a.	Should it be determined that the reporting party filed the complaint through a mistake of fact, the employee shall be counseled/trained. 
b.	Should it be determined that the reporting party filed the complaint knowing that it was false or frivolous at the time of the complaint, the employee shall be subject to appropriate discipline. 
4.	Documentation. All complaints or allegations shall be documented. All reports shall be maintained for a minimum of five years. 
(Ord. 97-4 §1(part), 1997). 
ARTICLE 8. - ALCOHOL AND DRUG ABUSE POLICY 

4.08.500 - Purpose. 
    Substance abuse causes job-related accidents, absenteeism, substandard performance and poor employee morale, and impairs the city's reputation. This article is intended to eliminate substance abuse in the workplace. It is not intended to intrude into the private lives of city employees. The city's concern is that employees be in a condition to perform their duties safely and efficiently. The use of performance-impairing or unlawful drugs and alcoholic beverages on the job and the influence of those substances on employees during working hours are inconsistent with that objective. 
(Ord. 97-4 §1(part), 1997). 
4.08.510 - Policies. 
A.	Employees shall not be under the influence of or in possession of alcoholic beverages or unlawful or performance-impairing drugs while on city property or work locations, while on city duty. 
B.	The city manager may grant permission for use of cooking sherry or the like to city staff in appropriate circumstances. 
C.	City employees shall not be barred by this article from properly performing their job functions. Accordingly, police employees who come into possession of alcoholic beverages and/or unlawful drugs as part of their official duties shall not be in violation of this article. 
D.	Employees shall not sell or provide unlawful drugs or alcoholic beverages to any person while on city duty. 
E.	Employees must report their use of any performance-impairing drugs to their supervisor before beginning work. 
F.	If there is a question regarding an employee's ability to safely or effectively perform his or her duties while using a drug, clearance from a qualified physician may be required. 
G.	An employee may be required to submit promptly to a blood or urine test for drugs or alcohol by a city-selected physician or laboratory when there exists reasonable cause to suspect that the employee is or was impaired or under the influence of drugs or alcoholic beverages while on city duty. 
H.	The city will provide reasonable accommodation to employees who have a drug or alcohol problem which classifies them as handicapped under federal and/or state law. Such accommodation does not include allowing the employee to work while he or she is impaired or under the influence of drugs or alcoholic beverages. 
I.	The city has established a voluntary employee assistance program (EAP) to assist employees who voluntarily seek help for alcohol or drug related problems. Employees should contact their supervisors or the EAP counselor for information concerning this program. 
(Ord. 97-4 §1(part), 1997). 
4.08.520 - Procedures. 
    If a supervisor reasonably suspects that an employee is or was under the influence of alcoholic beverages or performance-impairing drugs while on city duty, the following procedures shall be followed: 
A.	The employee and department director (or city manager, if the director is not available) shall immediately be informed of the supervisor's suspicions and advised that he or she may have a representative present during the drug/alcohol test. This notification shall be documented. The delay in the employee securing representation shall not exceed fifteen minutes from the time the employee is ordered to submit to the drug/alcohol test. The employee shall be permitted an additional period of time, not to exceed five minutes, in which to confer with the representative. 
B.	The supervisor shall document the specific facts constituting the reasonable suspicion that the employee is or was under the influence of alcoholic beverages or performance-impairing drugs while on city duty. 
C.	The employee will be offered an opportunity to give an explanation of his or her condition, such as reaction to a prescribed drug, fatigue, etc. This shall be recorded in the incident report. 
D.	The supervisor shall sign and date the incident report form.
E.	The employee shall be provided with a copy of the incident report form upon its completion.
F.	Before a drug/alcohol test is administered to an employee or applicant for city employment, the person will be asked to sign a consent form authorizing the clinic or laboratory to obtain a blood and/or urine specimen and to release the results of the test to the personnel director and to the appropriate department director. The consent form shall provide space for the employee or job applicant to indicate his or her current or recent use of prescription or over-the-counter medication. 
G.	Unless there is reason to believe that the employee or job applicant has altered a sample or specimen, or unless modified by agreement of the parties, the employee or applicant shall be allowed to provide the specimen in the privacy of a stall or otherwise partitioned area. 
H.	A job applicant who refuses to consent to a drug and/or alcohol test will be denied employment with the city and will be removed from the appropriate eligibility list. 
I.	An employee who refuses to consent to a drug and/or alcohol test when there is reasonable suspicion of drug or alcohol use in violation of this article, shall be subject to disciplinary action up to and including termination. The reason for the refusal shall be considered in determining the appropriate disciplinary action. 
J.	An employee reasonably believed to be under the influence of alcoholic beverages or unlawful or performance-impairing drugs while on city duty shall be prevented from engaging in further work and shall be detained for a reasonable time until he or she can be safely transported from the work site. 
(Ord. 97-4 §1(part), 1997). 
4.08.530 - Application of article. 
    This article applies to all employees and applicants for employment with the city. It applies to alcoholic beverages and to all substances, drugs and medications, legal or illegal, which could impair an employee's ability to effectively and safely perform his or her job. 
(Ord. 97-4 §1(part), 1997). 
4.08.540 - Employee responsibilities. 
    Employees shall: 
A.	Not report to work while their ability to perform their job duties is impaired due to use of alcoholic beverages or drugs; 
B.	Not possess or use alcoholic beverages or unlawful or performance-impairing drugs during working hours, on breaks, during meal periods or at any time while on city property other than as part of their job related duties; 
C.	Not directly or through a third party sell or provide unlawful or performance-impairing drugs or alcoholic beverages to any person, including employees, while either or both employees are on city duty; 
D.	Submit immediately to an alcohol/drug test when requested by a responsible city representative;
E.	Notify their supervisor before beginning work when taking any medications or drugs, prescription or nonprescription, which may interfere with the safe and effective performance of their duties or the operation of city equipment; and 
F.	Provide, within twenty-four hours of request by their supervisor, bona fide verification of a current valid prescription for any potentially impairing drug or medication identified when a drug/alcohol test is positive. 
(Ord. 97-4 §1(part), 1997). 
4.08.550 - Management responsibilities and guidelines. 
A.	Directors and supervisors are responsible for enforcement of this policy.
B.	Directors and supervisors may request an employee submit to a drug and/or alcohol test when the supervisor has a reasonable suspicion that the employee is intoxicated or under the influence of unlawful or performance-impairing drugs or alcoholic beverages while on city duty. "Reasonable suspicion" means a belief based on objective facts sufficient to lead a reasonably prudent person to suspect that an employee is under the influence of unlawful or performance-impairing drugs or alcoholic beverages so that the employee's ability to perform the functions of his or her job is impaired or that the employee's ability to perform his or her job safely is reduced. For example, any of the following, alone or in combination, may constitute reasonable suspicion: 
1.	Slurred speech;
2.	Alcoholic odor on breath;
3.	Unsteady walking and movements;
4.	Bizarre or extremely unusual behavior; or
5.	Possession of alcohol or unauthorized drugs while on duty.
C.	A director or supervisor requesting an employee to submit to a drug and/or alcohol test shall document on an incident report form the facts constituting the reasonable suspicion for believing that the employee is impaired or under the influence of alcoholic beverages or drugs. 
D.

If the application is denied, or conditionally approved, the city manager shall inform the applicant of the grounds for denial in writing, or the reason for a change in the date, time, route or location of the event, and the right of appeal. The applicant shall be notified of any permit conditions at the time the application is approved, and of the right of appeal from the permit conditions.

(Ord. 98-04 §1(part), 1998). 
8.02.060 - Grounds for denial of application for a special event permit. 
A.	The city manager shall approve an application for a special event permit unless he/she determines, from a consideration of the application or other pertinent information, that: 
1.	Information contained in the application, or supplemental information requested from the applicant, is false in any material detail; 
2.	The applicant failed to complete the application after having been notified of the additional information or documents required; 
3.	The primary purpose of the event is for private profit;
4.	Another special event permit application has been received prior in time, or has already been approved, to hold another event at the time and place requested by the applicant or so close in time and/or place as to cause undue traffic congestion, or the police department is unable to meet the needs for police services for both events; 
5.	The time, route or size of the event will substantially interrupt the safe and orderly movement of traffic contiguous to the event site or route, or disrupt the use of a street at a time when it is usually subject to traffic congestion; 
6.	The concentration of persons, animals and vehicles at the site of the event, or the assembly and disbanding areas around the event, will prevent proper police, fire or ambulance services to areas contiguous to the event; 
7.	The size of the event will require diversion of so great a number of police officers of the city to insure that participants stay within the boundaries or route of the event, or to protect participants in the event, as to prevent normal protection to the rest of the city. Nothing herein authorizes denial of a permit when additional peace officers would be available to the city under applicable state law and mutual aid plans, if requested by the city in advance of the event. Nothing herein authorizes denial of a permit because of the need to protect participants from the conduct of others, if reasonable conditions can be imposed to allow for adequate protection of event participants with the number of police officers available to police the event; 
8.	The parade or other event moving along a route, will not move from its point of origin to its point of termination expeditiously and without unreasonable delays, or in a reasonable amount of time; 
9.	The location of the event will substantially interfere with any construction or maintenance work scheduled to take place upon or along the city streets or a previously granted encroachment permit; or 
10.	The event will occur at a time when a school is in session at a route or location adjacent to the school or class thereof, and the noise created by the activities of the event would substantially disrupt the educational activities of the school or class thereof; 
11.	The applicant or group on whose behalf the application was made, previously utilized or applied to utilize city facilities an excessive number of times, such that other city residents are likely to be prevented from having a reasonable opportunity to use such facilities. 
B.	When the grounds for denial of an application for permit specified in subsections A4 through A11 of this section can be corrected by altering the date, time, duration, route or location of the event, the city manager shall, instead of denying the application, approve the application upon the applicant's written acceptance of conditions for permit issuance. The conditions imposed shall provide for only such modifications of the applicant's proposed event as are necessary to achieve compliance with subsections A4 through A11 of this section. 
(Ord. 98-04 §1(part), 1998). 
8.02.070 - For-profit special event permits. 
    Where the primary purpose of a special event utilizing city facilities is for the private profit of the event organizer or sponsor, the city manager shall apply the following in addition to the other provisions of Chapter 8.02: 
A.	The city shall be paid fifteen percent of the total gross revenues of the event.
B.	Not more than a total of five "for-profit" special events may be conducted annually using city facilities.

H.	The city manager will issue permits, subject to appeal to the city council, with due consideration for the impacts of such events on the residents of the city. 
I.	No person shall be allowed more than two of the available dates for such events in a single year, unless no other party has been issued a for-profit special event permit for the remaining available dates by July 1st of that year. 
(Ord. 98-04 §1(part), 1998). 
8.02.080 - Permit conditions. 
    The city manager may condition the issuance of a special event permit by imposing reasonable restrictions on the time, place and manner of conducting the event as are necessary or appropriate to protect persons and property and to control traffic; provided that such restrictions shall not unreasonably interfere with the right of free speech. Such conditions may include the following: 
A.	Alteration of the date, time, route or location of the event;
B.	Conditions concerning the area of assembly and disbanding of parade or other events occurring along a route; 
C.	Conditions concerning accommodation of pedestrian or vehicular traffic, including restricting the event to only a portion of a street;

The agreement shall also provide that the permittee/sponsoring organization shall defend the city and indemnify and hold the city and its officers and employees harmless from any liability to any persons resulting from any damage or injury occurring in connection with the permitted event, insofar as permitted by law. 
B.	The indemnification and cash bond requirements of this section shall be waived if the following conditions are satisfied: 
1.	The applicant or an officer of the sponsoring organization signs a verified statement that the primary purpose of the event is First Amendment expression, and that the cost of posting a bond or entering into an indemnification agreement is or may be so financially burdensome that it would constitute an unreasonable burden on the right of free speech, or that it has been impossible to obtain a bond. The statement shall include the name and address of at least one bonding agency contacted to determine the cost of a bond for indemnification purposes. 
2.	The city may, at its discretion, require the applicant/sponsor to apply for an indemnification bond for the event under terms selected by the city. The applicant/sponsor must provide any information pertinent to qualifying for the bond. In such event, the bond fee will be paid by the city. 
(Ord. 98-04 §1(part), 1998). 
8.02.120 - Insurance. 
A.	The applicant/sponsor of an event must possess or obtain public liability insurance to protect against liability for personal injury and property damage arising from the event. Such insurance shall name on the policy or by endorsement as additional insureds the city of Parlier, its officers, employees and agents. Insurance coverage must be maintained for the duration of the event. Coverage shall be a comprehensive general liability insurance policy. Minimum limits required: 
1.	One million dollars for each occurrence combined single limit bodily injury and property damage; 
2.	If food or nonalcoholic beverages are to be sold or served at the event, the policy must also include an endorsement for products liability in an amount not less than five hundred thousand dollars.

The special event permit shall not be issued by the city manager until after the insurance policy or certificate of insurance, together with all necessary endorsements, have been filed with the city and approved by the city manager. 
C.	The insurance requirements of subsections A and B of this section shall be waived where the applicant or an officer of the sponsoring organization signs a verified statement that the event's primary purpose is first amendment expression, and that the cost of obtaining insurance is so financially burdensome that it would constitute an unreasonable burden on the right of free speech, or that it has been impossible to obtain insurance coverage. The statement shall include the name and address of at least one insurance agent or other source for insurance coverage contacted to determine the cost of such insurance coverage. 
D.	The city may, as its discretion, require the applicant/sponsor to apply for insurance coverage for the event under a policy selected by the city.

Traffic control includes clearing the event route or site of unauthorized vehicles, diversion of traffic around the event, and directing pedestrian and vehicular traffic along the route of an event.

(Ord. 98-04 §1(part), 1998). 
8.02.180 - Revocation of permit. 
    The city manager may revoke a special event issued pursuant to this chapter if he/she finds that any term, condition, restriction or limitation of such permit has not been complied with, including the timely payment of all required deposits; or if he/she finds that, as a result of changed circumstances, any one or more of the grounds for denial specified in Section 8.02.060 have been met. Notice of such action revoking a permit shall be delivered in writing to the permittee by personal service or by registered mail.

(Ord. No. 2009-03, § 1, 10-7-2009) 
9.21.020 - Findings and content. 
    The city council finds and determines as follows: 
A.	The occurrence of parties on private property where alcohol is served or consumed by underage person(s) is harmful to the underage person(s) and a threat to public health, safety, quite enjoyment of property, and the general welfare, or the communities where such parties are held. 
B.	Underage person(s) often obtain alcoholic beverages at parties held at private residences or at rented residential and commercial premises that are under the control of a person who knows or should know of the underage service and/or consumption. Person(s) responsible for the occurrence of parties on private property over which they have possession or control have failed to ensure that alcoholic beverages are neither served to nor consumed by underage person(s) at these parties. 
C.	Control of parties on private property where underage person(s) are being served or consuming alcohol is necessary because such activity poses a threat to the peace, health, safety, or general welfare of the public. Law enforcement's ability to abate gatherings where alcohol is served to or consumed by underage person(s) on private property will result in decrease in abuse of alcohol by underage person(s), physical altercations and injuries, neighborhood vandalism, and excessive noise disturbance thereby improving public safety. 
D.	Problems associated with such parties at which alcoholic beverages are served to or consumed by underage person(s) are difficult to prevent and deter unless law enforcement has the legal authority to direct the host to disperse the party. 
E.	Law enforcement, fire and other emergency response services personnel have and are required to respond, sometimes on multiple occasions, to parties on private property at which alcoholic beverages are served to or consumed by the underage person(s). Responses to such parties result in a disproportionate expenditure of public safety resources and cause a drain on staff, leaving other areas of the city with inadequate protection. 
F.	Person(s) held responsible for abetting or tolerating parties will be more likely to properly supervise and stop such conduct at parties held on private property under their possession and control. The prohibitions found in this chapter are reasonable and expected to deter the consumption of alcoholic beverages by underage person(s) by holding person(s) who knowingly allow services to or consumption by underage person(s) responsible. 
(Ord. No. 2009-03, § 1, 10-7-2009) 
9.21.030 - Purpose. 
    The city council finds and declares that the purpose of this chapter is: 
A.	To protect the public health, safety, and general welfare;
B.	To enforce laws prohibiting the services to and consumption of alcohol by underage person(s); 
C.	To reduce the costs of providing law enforcement, fire, and other emergency response services to parties by imposing a civil fee against social host and landowners (including landlord); and 
D.	To reduce the costs of providing substance abuse treatment and/or prevention services through the imposition of a civil fee against social hosts and landowners (including landlords). 
(Ord. No. 2009-03, § 1, 10-7-2009)

10.60.010 - Purpose-Certain vehicles deemed nuisance-Definitions. 
A.	In addition to and in accordance with the determination made and the authority granted by the state of California under Section 22660 of the Vehicle Code to remove abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles or parts thereof as public nuisances, the city of Parlier makes the following findings and declarations: 
B.	The accumulation and storage of abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or inoperative vehicles or parts thereof on private or public property not including highways is found to create a condition tending to reduce the value of private property, to promote blight and deterioration, to invite plundering, to create fire hazards, to constitute an attractive nuisance creating a hazard to the health and safety of minors, to create a harborage for rodents and insects and to be injurious to the health, safety and general welfare. Therefore the presence of an abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicle or part thereof, on private or public property not including highways, except as expressly hereinafter permitted, is declared to constitute a public nuisance which may be abated as such in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
C.	As used in this chapter:
1.	"Highway" means a way or place of whatever nature, publicly maintained and open to the use of the public for purposes of vehicular travel. "Highway" includes street.

B.	Nothing in this section shall authorize the maintenance of a public or private nuisance as defined under provisions of law other than Chapter 10, commencing with Section 22650, of Division 11 of the Vehicle Code and this chapter. 
(Ord. 68-127 §2, 1968).

10.60.070 - Abatement-Hearing-Notice to owner.

B.	The city council may impose such conditions and take such other action as it deems appropriate under the circumstances to carry out the purpose of the chapter. It may delay the time for removal of the vehicle or part thereof if in its opinion the circumstances justify it. At the conclusion of the public hearing, the city council may find that a vehicle or part thereof has been abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or is inoperative on private or public property and order the same removed from the property as a public nuisance and disposed of as hereinafter provided and determine the administrative costs and the cost of removal to be charged against the owner of the parcel of land on which the vehicle or part thereof is located. The order requiring removal shall include a description of the vehicle or part thereof and the correct identification number and license number of the vehicle, if available at the site.

12.22.040 - Grant of franchise. 
A.	Grant. A franchise granted by the city under the provisions of this chapter shall encompass the following purposes: 
1.	To engage in the business of providing cable service, and such other services as may be permitted by law, which grantee chooses to provide, to subscribers within the designated service area; 
2.	To erect, install, construct, repair, rebuild, reconstruct, replace, maintain and retain cable lines, related electronic equipment, supporting structures, appurtenances and other property in connection with the operation of the cable television system in, on, over, under, upon, along and across streets, public property, or other public places within the designated service area; 
3.	To maintain and operate such franchise properties for the origination, reception, transmission, amplification and distribution of television and radio signals and for the delivery of cable services and such other services as may be permitted by law; 
4.	To set forth the obligations of a grantee under the franchise.
B.	Franchise Required. It is unlawful for any person to construct, install or operate a cable television system in the city within any street without a properly granted franchise awarded pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. 
C.	Term of Franchise. A franchise granted hereunder shall be for a term established in the franchise agreement, commencing on grantor's adoption of an ordinance or resolution authorizing the franchise. 
D.	Franchise Renewal. A franchise granted hereunder may be renewed upon application by grantee pursuant to the provisions of applicable state and federal law and of this chapter. 
E.	Franchise Territory. Any franchise shall be valid within all the territorial limits of the city, and within any area added to the city during the term of the franchise, unless otherwise specified in the franchise agreement. 
F.	Federal or State Jurisdiction. This chapter shall be construed in a manner consistent with all applicable federal and state laws, and shall apply to all franchises granted or renewed after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter to the extent permitted by applicable law. 
G.	Franchise Nontransferable.
1.	Grantee shall not sell, transfer, lease, assign, sublet or dispose of, in whole or in part, either by forced or involuntary sale, or by ordinary sale, contract, consolidation or otherwise, the franchise or any of the rights or privileges therein granted without the prior consent of the council and then only upon such terms and conditions as may be prescribed by the council, which consent shall not be unreasonably denied or delayed; provided that such consent shall not be required for transactions between any parent, subsidiary or commonly owned entities. Any attempt to sell, transfer, lease, assign or otherwise dispose of the franchise without the consent of the council shall be null and void. The granting of a security interest in any grantee assets, or any mortgage or other hypothecation solely for purposes of financing, shall not by itself be considered a transfer for the purposes of this section. 
2.	The requirements of subsection (G)(1) shall apply to any change of control of grantee. The word "control" as used herein is not limited to major stockholder or partnership interests, but includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised. The acquisition or accumulation by any person or group of persons acting in privity of forty percent of the voting shares or interests in grantee or any person which controls grantee shall be presumed to constitute a change of control of grantee, but grantee shall be entitled to rebut such presumption. 
3.	Grantee shall notify grantor in writing of any foreclosure or any other judicial sale of all or a substantial part of the franchise property of grantee. Such notification shall be considered by grantor as notice that a change in control of ownership of the franchise has taken place and the provisions under this section governing the consent of grantor to such change in control of ownership shall apply. 
4.	For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such change, sale, transfer, lease, assignment, sublease, disposal or acquisition of control, grantor may inquire into the qualifications of the prospective transferee or controlling party, and grantee shall assist grantor in such inquiry. In seeking grantor's consent to any change of ownership or control, grantee shall have the responsibility of insuring that the transferee completes any required application identical or substantially similar to FCC Form 394, Application for Franchise Authority Consent to Assignment of Control of Cable Television Franchise, or any successor form. An application shall be submitted to grantor not less than sixty days prior to the date of transfer. The transferee shall be required to establish that it possesses the qualifications and financial and technical capability to operate and maintain the system and comply with all franchise requirements for the remainder of the term of the franchise. If the legal, financial, background and technical qualifications of the applicant are satisfactory to grantor, grantor shall consent to the transfer of the franchise on such terms and conditions as it determines in its discretion. The consent of grantor to such transfer shall not be unreasonably denied or delayed. 
5.	Any financial institution having a pledge of grantee or its assets for the advancement of money for the construction and/or operation of the franchise shall have the right to notify grantor that it or its designee satisfactory to grantor shall take control of and operate the cable television system in the event of a grantee default of its financial obligations. Further, the financial institution shall also submit a plan for such operation within thirty days of assuming such control that will insure, to grantor's satisfaction, continued service and compliance with all franchise requirements, at at least the same level, during the term the financial institution exercises control over the system. The financial institution shall not exercise control over the system for a period exceeding one year unless extended by grantor in its discretion, and during said period of time it shall have the right to petition grantor to transfer the franchise to another grantee. If, by the end of the one-year period, the financial institution has not petitioned for transfer to another grantee, or if grantor does not consent to such transfer, the franchise shall cease and terminate at grantor's option. 
6.	At the time an application for a transfer is submitted to grantor, grantee shall deposit with grantor an application fee of fifteen hundred dollars to cover grantor's reasonable out-of-pocket processing and review expenses in connection with the transfer of the franchise or of control of the franchise. The application fee shall not be charged against any franchise fee due to grantor during the term of the franchise. 
H.	Geographical Coverage.
1.	Grantee shall design, construct and maintain the cable television system to have the capability to pass every dwelling unit within the public streets and rights-of-way and public property in the city, subject to any service area and line extension requirements of the franchise agreement. 
2.	After service has been established by activating trunk and/or distribution cables for any service area, grantee shall provide service to any requesting subscriber within that service area within thirty days from the date of request, provided that grantee is able to secure all rights-of-way necessary to extend service to such subscriber within such thirty-day period on reasonable terms and conditions. 
I.	Nonexclusive Franchise. Any franchise granted shall be nonexclusive. Grantor specifically reserves the right to grant, at any time, such additional franchises for a cable television system or any component thereof, as it deems appropriate, subject to applicable state and federal law, provided that if grantor grants an additional franchise on terms more favorable to the second grantee (whether by the grant of greater benefits or the imposition of lesser obligations), then the initial grantee shall have the right to renegotiate its franchise to incorporate the more favorable terms. 
J.	Multiple Franchises.
1.	Grantor may grant any number of franchises subject to applicable state or federal law. Grantor may limit the number of franchises granted, based upon, but not necessarily limited to, the requirements of applicable law and specific local considerations, such as: 
a.	The capacity of the public rights-of-way to accommodate multiple cables in addition to the cables, conduits and pipes of the utility systems, such as electrical power, telephone, gas and sewerage, 
b.	The benefits that may accrue to cable subscribers as a result of cable system competition, such as lower rates and improved service, 
c.	The disadvantages that may result from cable system competition, such as the requirement for multiple pedestals on residents' property and the disruption arising from numerous excavations of the rights-of-way. 
2.	Each grantee awarded a franchise to serve the entire city shall offer cable service to all residences in the city, in accordance with construction and service schedules mutually agreed upon between grantor and grantee, line extension policies and applicable law. 
3.	Developers of new residential housing with underground utilities shall provide conduit to accommodate cables for at least two cable systems. 
4.	Grantor may require that any new grantee be responsible for its own underground trenching and the costs associated therewith if, in grantor's opinion, the rights-of-way in any particular area cannot feasibly and reasonably accommodate additional cables. 
(Ord. 95-07 §2(part), 1995).

In the event such costs exceed the application fee, the selected applicant(s) shall pay the difference to the city within thirty days following receipt of an itemized statement of such costs. In the event such costs are less than the city application fee, city shall refund the unused portion of the fee within thirty days following the conclusion of the process, subject to grantor's receipt and approval of an itemized statement of such costs. 
B.	Application Contents. An application for an initial franchise for a cable television system shall contain, where applicable:

Within thirty days after the close of the hearing, the council shall make a decision based upon the evidence received at the hearing as to whether or not the franchise(s) should be granted, and, if granted, subject to what conditions. The council may grant one or more franchises, or may decline to grant any franchise. 
D.	Franchise Renewal. Franchise renewals shall be in accordance with applicable law. Grantor and grantee, by mutual consent, may enter into renewal negotiations at any time during the term of the franchise. Unless agreed otherwise in the franchise renewal agreement, grantee shall reimburse grantor for costs incidental to the franchise renewal award, not to exceed any maximum specified in the renewal agreement. Any such reimbursement shall not be charged against any franchise fee due to grantor during the term of the franchise. 
E.	Minimum Consumer Protection and Service Standards.
1.	Except as otherwise provided in the franchise agreement, grantee shall maintain a local area office (not necessarily within the city limits) to provide the necessary facilities, equipment and personnel to comply with the following consumer protection and service standards under normal operating conditions: 
a.	Knowledgeable, qualified company representatives will be available to respond to customer telephone inquiries Monday through Friday during normal business hours.

c.	Under normal operating conditions, the customer will receive a busy signal less than three percent of the total time that the cable office is open for business. 
d.	If grantee utilizes an automated answering and distributing equipment, such equipment will limit the number of routine rings to four or fewer. If grantee does not utilize automated equipment, grantee shall make every effort to answer incoming calls as promptly as the automated systems.

g.	Requests for Cable Service and Repairs.
i.	Grantee shall render efficient service, make repairs promptly, and interrupt service only for good cause and for the shortest time possible. Scheduled interruptions exceeding four hours between midnight and six a.m. and exceeding one hour between six a.m. and midnight shall be preceded by notice over the cable system to subscribers in the affected area. To the extent that grantee can control them, scheduled interruptions shall occur during a period of minimum system use, preferably between midnight and six a.m. 
ii.	Grantee shall maintain a repair force of technicians capable of responding to subscriber requests for service within the following time frames under normal operating conditions no less than ninety-five percent of the time measured on a quarterly basis: 
(A)	Installation. An installation staff capable of installing service to any residential subscriber within seven business days after receipt of a request, in all areas where coaxial feeder cable has been activated within one-hundred fifty feet of the residence, provided that grantee is able to secure all rights-of-way necessary to extend service to such subscriber on reasonable terms and conditions within such seven-day period. 
(B)	Outages. Grantee will respond to service interruptions promptly and in no event later than twenty-four consecutive hours after becoming aware of such interruption. Other service problems will be responded to within thirty-six consecutive hours during the normal work week. 
(C)	Inferior Reception Quality. Grantee will respond within thirty-six consecutive hours during the normal work week of receiving a request for service identifying a problem concerning picture or sound quality. 
iii.	Grantee shall schedule, within a specified four-hour time period, appointments with subscribers for installation or service. Specifying appointments as either "morning" or "afternoon" shall be deemed to comply with this requirement. The obligation of grantee to specify installation or service appointments within a designated four-hour time period shall be consistent with grantee's scheduling calendar, such that when available morning and afternoon appointments have been scheduled, additional subscribers requesting installation or service on such days may be advised that grantee's service personnel may arrive at any point during the business day, and any such subscriber may request grantee to make an appointment for morning or afternoon service on the next business day in which such appointments are available. 
iv.	Grantee shall be deemed to have responded to a request for service under provisions of this subsection when a service representative arrives at the service location and begins work on the problem. If an appointment was scheduled per subsection (E)(g)(iii) of this section, or an appointment was not scheduled, and a subscriber is not home when a service representative arrives (within the appointment window if one was scheduled), response shall be deemed to have taken place if the representative leaves written notification of arrival. 
v.	The term "normal operating conditions" as used in this chapter means those service conditions which are within the control of grantee. Those conditions which are not within grantee's control include, but are not limited to, natural disasters, civil disturbances, power outages, telephone network outages, and severe or unusual weather conditions. Those conditions which are within grantee's control include, but are not limited to, special promotions, pay-per-view events, rate increases, regular peak or seasonal demand periods, and maintenance or upgrade of the cable system. 
F.	Complaint Procedures.
1.	Grantee shall establish written procedures for receiving, acting upon and resolving subscriber complaints without intervention by grantor. The written procedures shall prescribe the manner in which a subscriber may submit a complaint either orally or in writing specifying the subscriber's grounds for dissatisfaction. Grantee shall file a copy of these procedures with grantor. 
2.	Grantor shall have the right to review grantee's response to subscriber complaints in order to determine grantee's compliance with the franchise requirements, subject to the subscriber's right to privacy. 
G.	Continuity of Service.
1.	It shall be the right of all subscribers to continue receiving service insofar as their financial and other obligations to grantee are honored. In the event that grantee elects to rebuild, modify or sell the system, or grantor gives notice of intent to terminate or not to renew the franchise, grantee shall act so as to ensure that all subscribers receive service so long as the franchise remains in force. 
2.	In the event of a change of control of grantee, or in the event a new operator acquires the system, the original grantee shall cooperate with grantor, new grantee or operator in maintaining continuity of service to all subscribers. During such period, the original grantee shall be entitled to the revenues for any period during which it operates the system. 
3.	Except as reasonably necessary for system maintenance, construction, rebuild or upgrade activity, grantee shall not intentionally terminate the ongoing operation of the cable system so as to deny cable service to its subscribers. Because the provision of cable service to subscribers is a unique service, money damages would not be a sufficient remedy for violation of subsection G of this section. Grantor shall be entitled to equitable relief, including injunctive relief and specific performance, as a remedy for violation of this subsection G. Such remedy shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedy, but shall be in addition to any other remedy provided for in this chapter or the franchise agreement or at law or in equity. 
H.	Identification. All officers, agents or employees of grantee or its contractors or subcontractors who, in the normal course of work come into contact with members of the public or who require entry onto subscribers' premises shall carry a photo-identification card in a form reasonably approved by grantor. Grantee shall account for all identification cards at all times. Every vehicle of grantee or its major subcontractors shall be clearly identified as working for grantee. 
I.	Additional Service Standards. Additional service standards and standards governing consumer protection and response by grantee to subscriber complaints not otherwise provided for in this chapter may be established in the franchise agreement, and grantee shall comply with such standards in the operations of the cable television system. A verified and continuing pattern of noncompliance may be deemed a material breach of the franchise, provided that grantee shall receive due process, including written notification and an opportunity to cure, prior to any sanction being imposed. For purposes of this subsection I, the term "continuing" shall mean failure to comply with any such standard three or more times in any consecutive twelve-month period where such failure causes a substantial adverse effect on the provision of cable service through grantee's cable system. Also for purposes of this subsection I, the term "verified" shall mean verified by the council or its designated representative. 
J.	Franchise Fee.
1.	Following the issuance and acceptance of the franchise, grantee shall pay to grantor a franchise fee in the amount set forth in the franchise agreement. 
2.	Grantor, on an annual basis, shall be furnished a statement within sixty days of the close of the calendar year, either audited and certified by an independent certified public accountant or certified by an officer of grantee, reflecting the total amounts of gross annual revenues and all payments, deductions and computations for the period covered by the payment. Upon thirty days' prior written notice, grantor shall have the right to conduct an independent audit of grantee's records, in accordance with generally accepted accounting procedures, and if such audit indicates a franchise fee underpayment of two percent or more, grantee shall pay such underpayment to grantor within fifteen calendar days and shall assume all reasonable costs of the audit. 
3.	Except as otherwise provided by law, no acceptance of any payment by grantor shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim grantor may have for further or additional sums payable as a franchise fee under this chapter or under the franchise agreement for the performance of any other obligation of grantee. 
4.	In the event that any franchise payment or recomputed amount is not made on or before the dates specified in the franchise agreement, grantee shall pay as additional compensation: 
a.	An interest charge, computed from such due date, at an annual rate equal to the prime lending rate of First Interstate Bank or any other bank as adopted by resolution of the council, plus one percent during the period for which payment was due; and 
b.	If the payment is late by forty-five days or more, a sum of money equal to five percent of the amount due in order to defray those additional expenses and costs incurred by grantor by reason of delinquent payment. 
5.	Franchise fee payments shall be made in accordance with the schedule indicated in the franchise agreement. 
K.	Security Fund.
1.	Grantor may require grantee to provide a security fund in an amount and form established in the franchise agreement or a guarantee by a corporate parent. The amount of any security fund or guarantee shall be established based on the extent of grantee's obligations under the terms of the franchise. 
2.	The security fund or guarantee shall be available to grantor to satisfy all claims, liens and/or taxes due grantor from grantee which arise by reason of construction, operation or maintenance of the system, and to satisfy any actual or liquidated damages arising out of a franchise breach, subject to the procedures and amounts designated in the franchise agreement. 
3.	If the security fund is drawn upon by grantor in accordance with the procedures established in this chapter and the franchise agreement, grantee shall cause the security fund to be replenished to the original amount no later than thirty days after each withdrawal by grantor. Failure to replenish the security fund shall be deemed a material breach of the franchise. 
L.	Hold Harmless. Grantee's indemnity obligations shall be as specified in the franchise agreement. 
M.	Insurance. Grantee's insurance obligations shall be as specified in the franchise agreement. 
N.	Records Required and Grantor's Right to Inspect.
1.	Grantee shall at all times maintain:
a.	A record of all service calls and interruption or degradation of service experienced for the preceding two years, provided that such complaints result in or require a service call, subject to the subscriber's right of privacy as specified by applicable law; 
b.	A full and complete set of plans, records and "as-built" maps showing the locations of the cable television system installed or in use in the city, exclusive of subscriber service drops and equipment provided in subscribers' homes; 
c.	If requested by grantor, a summary of service calls, identifying the number, general nature and disposition of such calls, on a quarterly basis. A summary of such service calls shall be submitted to grantor within thirty days following any grantor request, in a form reasonably acceptable to grantor. If grantor determines, based on review of such summary, that grantor wishes to review grantee's records pertaining to individual service calls reflected in the summary, grantee shall submit such records, subject to the subscribers' privacy rights under applicable law, within thirty days following grantor's request for the records. 
2.	Grantor may impose reasonable requirements for additional information, records and documents from time to time, provided they reasonably relate to the scope of the city's rights under this chapter or grantee's franchise agreement. 
3.	Upon reasonable notice, and during normal business hours, grantee shall permit examination by any duly authorized representative of grantor of all franchise property and facilities, together with any appurtenant property and facilities of grantee situated within or without the city, and all records relating to the franchise, provided they are necessary to enable grantor to carry out its regulatory responsibilities under this chapter or the franchise agreement. Grantee shall have the right to be present at any such examination. 
(Ord. 95-07 §2(part), 1995).

A.	Grantee shall not construct any cable system facilities until grantee has secured the necessary permits from grantor or other affected public agencies. 
B.	In those areas of the city where transmission lines or distribution facilities of the public utilities providing telephone and electric power service are underground, grantee likewise shall construct, operate and maintain its transmission and distribution facilities therein underground. 
C.	In those areas of the city where grantee's cables are located on the above-ground transmission or distribution facilities of the public utility providing telephone or electric power service, and in the event that the facilities of both such public utilities subsequently are placed underground, then grantee likewise shall reconstruct, operate and maintain its transmission and distribution facilities underground, at grantee's cost. Certain of grantee's equipment, such as pedestals, amplifiers and power supplies, which normally are placed above ground, may continue to remain in above-ground enclosures, unless otherwise provided in the franchise agreement. 
D.	Any changes in or extensions of any poles, anchors, wires, cables, conduits, vaults, laterals or other fixtures and equipment (herein referred to as "structures"), or the construction of any additional structures, in, upon, along, across, under or over the streets, alleys, public ways or public property shall be made only after grantee has secured all permits required therefor and under the direction of grantor's city engineer or a designee. The height above public thoroughfares of all aerial wires shall conform to the requirements of the California Public Utilities Commission or other regulatory body having jurisdiction thereof. 
1.	All transmission and distribution structures, lines and equipment erected by grantee shall be constructed and located so as not to interfere with the proper use of streets, alleys, other public ways and places or public property and to cause minimum interference with the rights or reasonable convenience of property owners who adjoin any of such streets, alleys, other public ways and places or public property, and not to interfere with existing public utility installations. 
2.	In the event that any property or improvement of grantor in a public right-of-way is disturbed or damaged by grantee or any of its contractors, agents or employees in connection with undertaking any work pursuant to the right granted to grantee pursuant to this chapter, grantee shall promptly, at grantee's sole cost and expense, restore as nearly as practicable to their former condition the property or improvement which was so disturbed or damaged, and in the event that any such property or improvement shall at any later time become uneven, unsettled or otherwise require restoration, repair or replacement because of such disturbance or damage by grantee, then grantee shall, promptly upon receipt of notice from grantor or otherwise and at grantee's sole cost and expense, restore as nearly as practicable to their former condition the property or improvement which was disturbed or damaged. Any such restoration by grantee shall be made in accordance with such materials and specifications as may, from time to time, be then provided for by city ordinance. 
3.	Prior to commencing any work in the street, public rights-of-way or public property, grantee shall obtain any and all permits lawfully required by such grantor codes and ordinances of general application for such work. In the event that emergency work may be required by grantee, however, grantee shall obtain any and all such permits within three working days after the beginning of such emergency work. 
4.	There shall be no unreasonable or unnecessary obstruction of the public rights-of-way by grantee in connection with any of the work herein provided for, and grantee shall maintain such barriers, signs and warning signals during any such work performed on or about the public rights-of-way or adjacent thereto as may be required by applicable law and/or as may be necessary to reasonably avoid injury or damage to life and property. 
5.	If, at any time during the period of this franchise, grantor shall lawfully elect to alter or change the grade or location of any street, alley or other public rights-of-way, grantee shall, upon reasonable notice by grantor, remove, relay and relocate its poles, wires, cables, underground conduits, manholes and other fixtures at its own expense, and in each instance shall comply with the requirements of grantor. 
6.	Grantee shall not place poles, conduits or other fixtures above or below ground where the same will interfere with any gas, electric, telephone fixtures, water hydrants or other utility, and all such poles, conduits or other fixtures placed on or in any street or public property shall be so placed as to comply with all ordinances of grantor. 
7.	Grantee may be required by grantor to permit joint use of its poles, conduits and appurtenances located in the streets, alleys or other public rights-of-way or public property by utilities insofar as such joint use may be reasonably practicable and upon payment of reasonable rental therefor; provided that if grantee and any public utility are unable to agree on the terms and conditions of such joint use within sixty days after grantor requires the joint use, grantee and the utility shall promptly submit the terms and conditions, including without limitation the rental therefor, to the appropriate administrative agency having jurisdiction over the public utility or, if there is no such agency, the American Arbitration Association, for a final and binding decision. 
8.	Grantee shall, on request of any person holding a moving permit issued by grantor, temporarily move its wires or fixtures to permit the moving of buildings, the expense of such temporary removal to be paid by the person requesting the same. Grantee shall be given not less than forty-eight hours' advance notice to arrange for such temporary changes, and may require payment in advance. 
9.	Grantee shall have the authority, except when in conflict with applicable grantor ordinances, to trim any trees upon and overhanging the streets, alleys, sidewalks, public property or public places so as to prevent the branches of such trees from coming in contact with the wires and cables of grantee, except that at the option of grantor, such trimming may be done by grantor or under grantor's supervision and direction. 
E.	In new residential developments in which the electric power and telephone utilities are underground, the following procedure shall apply with respect to access to and utilization of underground easements: 
1.	The developer shall be responsible for contacting and surveying all franchised cable operators to ascertain which operators desire to provide cable service to that development. The developer may establish a reasonable deadline to receive cable operator responses. The final development map shall indicate the cable operators that have agreed to serve the development. 
2.	If two or more cable operators wish to provide service, they shall be accommodated in the joint utilities trench on a nondiscriminatory shared-cost basis. If fewer than two cable operators indicate interest, the developer shall provide conduit to accommodate two sets of cable television cables and dedicate to the city any initially unoccupied conduit. The developer shall be entitled to recover the costs of such initially unoccupied conduit in the event that grantor subsequently leases or sells occupancy or use rights to any grantee. 
3.	The developer shall provide at least ten working days' notice of the date that utility trenches will be open to the cable operators that have agreed to serve the development. When the trenches are open, cable operators shall have two working days to begin the installation of their cables, and five working days after beginning installation to complete installation. 
4.	The final development map shall not be approved until the developer submits evidence that it has, or has agreed in a subdivision agreement or other development agreement with the city that it will: 
a.	Notify each grantee that underground utility trenches are to be open as of an estimated date, and that each grantee will be allowed access to such trenches, including trenches from proposed streets to individual homes or home sites, on specified nondiscriminatory terms and conditions; and 
b.	Receive a written notification from each grantee that grantee intends to install its facilities during the open-trench period on the specified terms and conditions, or such other terms and conditions as are mutually agreeable to the developer and grantee, or receive no reply from a grantee within ten days after notification to such grantee, in which case grantee will be deemed to have waived its opportunity to install its facilities during the open-trench period. 
5.	Participating grantees shall share the joint utilities trench subject to compliance with state regulatory agency and utility standards. If such compliance is not possible, the developer shall provide a separate trench for the cable television cables, with the entire cost shared among the developer and participating grantees. With the concurrence of the developer, the affected utilities and grantees, alternative installation procedures, such as the use of deeper trenches, may be utilized, subject to applicable law. 
6.	Any grantee wishing to serve an area where the trenches have been closed shall be responsible for its own trenching and associated costs. 
7.	In the event that more than one franchise is awarded, the city may limit the number of drop cables per residence or may require that the drop cable(s) be utilized only by the grantee selected by the resident to provide service. 
8.	The city may grant an encroachment permit to a franchise applicant to install conduit and/or cable in anticipation of the granting of a franchise. Such installations shall be at the applicant's risk, with no recourse against the city in the event the pending franchise application is not granted. The city may require an applicant to provide a separate trench for its conduit and/or cable, at the applicant's cost. The construction of such separate trench, if provided, shall be coordinated with, and subject to, the developer's overall construction schedule. 
F.	Technical Standards.
1.	Grantee shall construct, install, operate and maintain its system in a manner consistent with all applicable federal, state and local laws, ordinances, construction standards, governmental requirements, FCC technical standards and any detailed standards set forth in its franchise agreement. In addition, grantee shall provide to grantor a written report of the results of grantee's periodic proof of performance tests conducted pursuant to FCC and franchise standards and guidelines. The written report shall be provided to grantor at same time that grantee files the report with the FCC. 
2.	Repeated and verified failure to maintain specified technical standards shall constitute a material breach of the franchise. For purposes of this subsection (F)(2), the term "repeated" shall mean failure to maintain any specified technical standard(s) three or more times in any consecutive twelve-month period where such failure causes a substantial adverse effect on the provision of cable service through grantee's cable system. Also for purposes of this subsection (F)(2), the term "verified" shall mean verified by the council or its designated representative.

E.	Compliance and Privacy Report. Upon grantor's request, but no more than once annually, grantee shall submit to grantor a report indicating the degree of compliance with the provisions contained in subsection B of this section and all steps taken to assure that the privacy rights of individuals have been protected.

3.	The wilful refusal, failure or neglect of grantee to file any of the reports required as and when due under this chapter or the franchise agreement may be deemed a material breach of the franchise agreement if such reports are not provided to grantor within thirty days after written request therefor, and may subject grantee to all remedies, legal or equitable, which are available to grantor under the franchise or otherwise. 
4.	Any materially false or misleading statement or representation made knowingly and wilfully by grantee in any report required under this chapter or under the franchise agreement may be deemed a material breach of the franchise and may subject grantee to all remedies, legal or equitable, which are available to grantor under the franchise or otherwise.

12.22.080 - System evaluation. 
A.	Annual Review of System Performance. Each year throughout the term of the franchise, if requested by grantor, grantor and grantee shall meet publicly to review system performance and quality of service. The various reports required pursuant to this chapter or the franchise agreement, results of technical performance tests, the record of subscriber complaints and grantee's response to complaints, and the information acquired in any subscriber surveys, shall be utilized as the basis for review. In addition, any subscriber may submit comments or complaints during the review meetings, either orally or in writing, and these shall be considered. Within thirty days after the conclusion of a system performance review meeting, grantor may issue findings with respect to the cable system's franchise compliance and quality of service. If grantor determines that grantee is not in compliance with the requirements of this chapter or grantee's franchise, grantor may direct grantee to correct the areas of noncompliance within a reasonable period of time. Failure of grantee, after due notice, to correct the areas of noncompliance within the period specified therefor, or to commence compliance within such period and diligently achieve compliance thereafter, shall be considered a material breach of the franchise, and grantor may exercise any remedy within the scope of this chapter and the franchise agreement. 
B.	Special Review of System Performance. When grantor determines that there has been a pattern of complaints made or when there exists other evidence which, in the judgment of grantor, casts reasonable doubt on the reliability or quality of cable service to the effect that grantee is not in compliance with the requirements of this chapter or its franchise, grantor shall have the right to compel grantee to test, analyze and report on the performance of the system in order to protect the public against substandard cable service. Grantor may not compel grantee to provide such tests or reports unless and until grantor has provided grantee with at least thirty days' notice of its intention to exercise its rights under this section and has provided grantee with an opportunity to be heard prior to its exercise of such rights. Such test or tests shall be made and the report shall be delivered to grantor no later than thirty days after grantor notifies grantee that it is exercising such right, and shall be made at grantee's sole cost. Such report shall include the following information: The nature of the complaints which precipitated the special tests, what system component was tested, the equipment used and procedures employed in the testing, the results of such tests, and the method by which such complaints were resolved. Any other information pertinent to the special test also shall be reported.

(Ord. 95-07 §2(part), 1995). 
12.22.100 - Miscellaneous provisions. 
A.	Abandonment or Removal of Franchise Property.
1.	In the event that the use of any franchise property of grantee within the public rights-of-way is discontinued for a continuous period of twelve months, grantee shall be deemed to have abandoned that franchise property. Any part of the cable system that is parallel or redundant to other parts of the system and is intended for use only when needed as a backup for the system or a part thereof shall not be deemed to have been abandoned because of its lack of use. 
2.	Grantor, upon such terms as grantor may impose, may give grantee permission to abandon, without removing, any system facility or equipment laid, directly constructed, operated or maintained under the franchise. 
3.	Unless such permission is granted or, unless otherwise provided in this chapter, grantee shall remove all abandoned above-ground facilities and equipment upon receipt of written notice from grantor and shall restore any affected street, public property or other public way or public place to its former state at the time such facilities and equipment were removed so as not to impair its usefulness. In removing its plant, structures and equipment, grantee shall refill, at its own expense, any excavation that shall be made by it and shall leave all streets, public property and public ways and places in as good condition as that prevailing prior to such removal without materially interfering with any electrical or telephone cable or other utility wires, poles or attachments. Grantor shall have the right to inspect and approve the condition of the streets, public property, public ways, public places, cables, wires, attachments and poles prior to and after removal. The liability, indemnity and insurance provisions of this chapter and the franchise agreement and the security fund or guarantee as provided herein shall continue in full force and effect during the period of removal and until full compliance by grantee with the terms and conditions of this section. 
4.	Upon abandonment of any franchise property in place, grantee, if required by grantor, shall submit to grantor an instrument, satisfactory in form to grantor, transferring to grantor the ownership of the franchise property abandoned. 
5.	At the expiration of the term for which the franchise is granted, or upon its revocation or earlier expiration, as provided herein, in any such case without renewal, extension or transfer, grantor shall have the right to require grantee to remove, at its own expense, all aboveground portions of the cable television system from all streets, public property and other public ways and public places within the city within a reasonable period of time, which shall not be less than one hundred eighty days or more than three hundred sixty five days. 
6.	Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this chapter, grantee may abandon any underground franchise property in place so long as it does not materially interfere with the use of the street, public property or other public way or place in which such property is located or with the use thereof by any public utility or other grantee. 
B.	Restoration by Grantor; Reimbursement of Costs. In the event of a failure by grantee to complete any work required herein or by any other law or ordinance, and if such work is not completed within thirty days after receipt of written notice thereof from grantor (except in cases of emergency constituting a threat to public health, safety or welfare) or, if more than thirty days are reasonably required therefor, if grantee does not commence such work within such thirty-day period and diligently complete the work thereafter, grantor may cause such work to be done and grantee shall reimburse grantor the costs thereof within thirty days after receipt of an itemized list of such costs. Without relieving grantee of such obligation, grantor may recover all or a portion of such costs through the security fund or guarantee provided by grantee. 
C.	Extended Operation and Continuity of Services. Upon expiration or revocation of the franchise, grantor shall have the discretion to grant a short-term license in lieu of a franchise to permit grantee to continue to operate the cable television system for a specific period of time, not to exceed twelve months. Grantee shall continue to operate the system under the terms and conditions of this chapter and the license and to provide the regular subscriber service and any and all of the services that may be provided at that time. It shall be the right of all subscribers to continue to receive all available service, provided that financial and other obligations to grantee are honored. Grantee shall use reasonable efforts to provide continuous, uninterrupted service to its subscribers, including operation of the system during transition periods following franchise expiration or termination. 
D.	Receivership and Foreclosure.
1.	A franchise shall, at the option of grantor, cease and terminate one hundred twenty days after appointment of a receiver or receivers, or trustee or trustees, to take over and conduct the business of grantee, whether in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or other action or proceeding, unless such receivership or trusteeship shall have been vacated prior to the expiration of the one hundred twenty days, or unless: (a) such receiver(s) or trustee(s) shall have, within one hundred twenty days after their election or appointment, fully complied with all the terms and provisions of this chapter and the franchise, and the receiver(s) or trustee(s) within the one hundred twenty days shall have remedied all the defaults under the franchise or provided a plan, satisfactory to grantor, for the remedy of such defaults; and (b) such receiver(s) or trustee(s) shall, within the one hundred twenty days, execute an agreement duly approved by the court having jurisdiction whereby such receiver(s) or trustee(s) assume and agree to be bound by each and every term, provision and limitation of the franchise granted. 
2.	In the case of a foreclosure or other judicial sale of the franchise property, or any material part thereof, grantor may serve notice of termination upon grantee and the successful bidder at such sale, in which event the franchise and all rights and privileges of grantee hereunder shall cease and terminate thirty days after service of such notice, unless: (a) grantor shall have approved the transfer of the franchise, as and in the manner that this chapter provides; and (b) such successful bidder shall have covenanted and agreed with grantor to assume and be bound by all terms and conditions of the franchise. 
E.	Rights Reserved to Grantor.
1.	In addition to any rights specifically reserved to grantor by this chapter, grantor reserves to itself every right and power which grantor may have under any other statute, code or ordinance or under the franchise. 
2.	Grantor may waive any provision of the franchise, except those required by federal or state regulation, if grantor determines (a) that it is in the public interest to do so, and (b) that the enforcement of such provision will impose an undue hardship on grantee or the subscribers. To be effective, such waiver shall be evidenced by a statement in writing signed by a duly authorized representative of grantor. Waiver of any provision in one instance shall not be deemed a waiver of such provision subsequent to such instance nor be deemed a waiver of any other provision of the franchise unless the statement so recites. 
F.	Rights of Individuals.
1.	Grantee shall not deny service, deny access or otherwise discriminate against subscribers, channel users or citizens on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, age, sex or sexual orientation. Grantee shall comply at all times with all other applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations relating to nondiscrimination. 
2.	Grantee shall adhere to the applicable equal employment opportunity requirements of federal, state and local regulations, as now written or as amended from time to time. 
3.	Neither grantee, nor any person, agency or entity shall, without the subscriber's consent, tap or arrange for the tapping of any cable, line, signal input device or subscriber outlet or receiver for any purpose except routine maintenance of the system, detection or investigation of unauthorized service, polling with audience participation, or audience viewing surveys to support advertising research regarding viewers where individual viewing behavior cannot be identified. 
4.	In the conduct of providing its service or in pursuit of any collateral commercial enterprise resulting therefrom, grantee shall take reasonable steps to prevent the invasion of a subscriber's or citizen's right of privacy or other personal rights through the use of the system as such rights exist pursuant to applicable law. Grantee shall not without lawful court order or other applicable valid legal authority utilize the system's interactive two-way equipment or capability for unauthorized personal surveillance of any subscriber or citizen. 
5.	No cable line, wire amplifier, converter or other piece of equipment owned by grantee shall be installed by grantee in the subscriber's premises, other than in appropriate easements, without first securing any required consent. If a subscriber requests service, permission to install upon subscriber's property shall be presumed. 
6.	Grantee and its agents and employees shall not sell or otherwise make available to any party without consent of the subscriber pursuant to state and federal privacy laws: 
a.	Any list containing the names and addresses of subscribers who request in writing to be removed from such list; or 
b.	Any list which identifies the viewing habits of individual subscribers, without the prior written consent of such subscribers. This does not prohibit grantee from providing composite ratings of subscriber viewing to any party. 
G.	Separability. If any provision of this chapter is held by any court or by any federal or state agency of competent jurisdiction to be invalid as conflicting with any federal or state law, rule or regulation now or hereafter in effect or for any other reason, or is held by such court or agency to be modified in any way in order to conform to the requirements of any such law, rule or regulation, such provision shall be considered a separate, distinct and independent part of this chapter, and such holding shall not affect the validity and enforceability of all other provisions hereof. In the event that such law, rule or regulation is subsequently repealed, rescinded, amended or otherwise changed so that the provision thereof which had been held invalid or modified is no longer in conflict with such law, rule or regulation or otherwise invalid, such provision shall thereupon return to full force and effect and shall thereafter be binding on grantor and grantee, provided that grantor shall give grantee thirty days' written notice of such change before requiring compliance with the provision or such longer period of time as may be reasonably required for grantee to comply with such provision. 
H.	Notices. Grantee shall maintain, throughout the term of the franchise, a local address for service of notices by mail. 
I.	Captions. The captions to sections throughout this chapter are intended solely to facilitate reading and reference. Such captions shall not affect the meaning or interpretation of this chapter. 
J.	No Recourse Against Grantor. Grantee shall have no recourse whatsoever against grantor or its council, officials, boards, commissions, agents or employees for any loss, costs, expenses or damage arising out of any provision of the franchise or because of the enforcement of the franchise. 
K.	Nonenforcement by Grantor. Grantee shall not be relieved of its obligation to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter by reason of any failure of grantor to enforce prompt compliance.

Variances shall not be granted for development within any designated floodway. Outside a designated floodway a variance can be granted by the City Council only upon a showing of severe hardship and gross inequity in the particular case involved, and that it will not adversely affect other properties or public safety or increase public costs. All such variances shall be recorded in connection with the particular property in the county recorder's office and records shall be maintained in readily accessible form by the building official.

--- (2) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2009-01, § 1, adopted May 20, 2009, amended Ch. 15.48 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Ch. 15.48, §§ 15.48.010-15.48.520, pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 85-04; Ord. No. 99-04, § 1, 2000. 
ARTICLE I. - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND METHODS 

15.48.010 - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of California has conferred upon local government units authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its residents. Therefore, the City Council of the City of Parlier does hereby adopt the following floodplain management policies and regulations. 
(Ord. No. 2009-01, § 1, 5-20-2009) 
15.48.020 - Findings of fact. 
A.	Flood hazard areas in the City of Parlier are subject to period inundation which could result in loss of life, property damage, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
B.	These expected flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities also contribute to potential flood losses. 
(Ord. No. 2009-01, § 1, 5-20-2009) 
15.48.030 - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
A.	Protect human life and health;
B.	Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;
C.	Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and general undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
D.	Minimize prolonged business interruptions;
E.	Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
F.	Help maintain a stable tax base providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas cause by flood damage; Ensure that potential buyers can discover that property is in an area of special flood hazard; 
G.	Ensure that potential buyers can discover that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and 
H.	Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard are responsible for their actions. 
(Ord. No. 2009-01, § 1, 5-20-2009) 
15.48.040 - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions to: 
A.	Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to flood water, or which result in dangerous increases in flood heights or velocities; 
B.	Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
C.	Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channels, and natural protective barriers which help accommodate or channel floodwaters; 
D.	Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
E.	Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. 
(Ord. No. 2009-01, § 1, 5-20-2009) 
15.48.100 - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application. 
    "Accessory use" means a use which is incidental and subordinate to the principal use of the parcel of land on which it is located. 
    "Alluvial fan" means a geomorphologic feature characterized by a cone or fan-shaped deposit of boulders, gravel, and fine sediments that have been eroded from mountain slopes, transported by floodflows, and deposited on valley floors, and which is subject to flash flooding, high velocity flows, debris flows, erosion, sediment movement and deposition, and channel migration. 
    "Apex" means the point of highest elevation on an alluvial fan, which on undisturbed fans is generally the point where the major stream that formed the fan emerges from the mountain front. 
    "Appeal" means a request for a review of the floodplain administrator's interpretation of any provision of this chapter. 
    "Area of special flood hazard." See "Special flood hazard area." 
    "Base flood" means a flood which has a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (also called the "100-year flood"). 
    "Basement" means an area of a building in which it is floor is subgrade; i.e., below ground level on all sides. 
    "Breakaway walls" are type of walls, whether solid or lattice, and whether constructed of concrete, masonry, wood, metal, plastic or any other suitable building material, which are not part of the structural support of the building and which are designed to break away under abnormally high tides, wave action, or high water without causing any damage to the structural integrity of the building on which they are used or any buildings to which they might be carried by floodwaters. A breakaway wall shall have a safe design loading resistance of not less than ten and no more then twenty pounds per square foot. Use of breakaway walls must be certified by a registered engineer or architect and shall meet the following conditions: 
1.	Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load less than that which would occur during the base flood; and 
2.	The elevated portion of the building shall not incur any structural damage due to the effects of wind and water loads acting simultaneously in the event of the base flood. 
    "Building." See "Structure." 
    "Development" means any manmade change to improved or unimproved land, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials. 
    "Encroachment" means the advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill, excavation, buildings, permanent structures or development into a floodplain which may impede or alter the flow capacity of the floodplain. 
    "Existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, installation of utilities, construction of streets, and either final site grading or pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date that these floodplain management regulations were adopted by the city. 
    "Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including installation of utilities, construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
    "Flood, flooding, or floodwater" means a general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland waters; the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
    "Flood boundary and floodway map (FBFM)" means the official on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the floodway. 
    "Flood hazard boundary map" means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated the areas of flood hazards. 
    "Flood insurance rate map (FIRM)" means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
    "Flood insurance study" means the official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the flood insurance rate map, the flood boundary and floodway map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood. 
    "Floodplain or flood-prone area" means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source. See "Flooding." 
    "Floodplain administrator" is the Parlier City Manager. 
    "Floodplain management" means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans. 
    "Floodplain management regulations" means this chapter and the zoning chapter, subdivision chapter, building codes, health regulations, special purpose chapters (such as grading), and other applications of the city's police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state or local regulations in any combination thereof which provide standards for preventing or reducing flood loss and damage. 
    "Floodproofing" means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents. 
    "Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. Also referred to as "regulatory floodway." 
    "Floodway fringe" is that area of the floodplain on either side of the "regulatory floodway" where encroachment may be permitted. 
    "Fraud and victimization" as related to Section 15.48.500 et seq., Variances, of this chapter, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the city council will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty to one hundred years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increase flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates. 
    "Functionally dependent use" means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair manufacturing facilities. 
    "Governing body" means the Parlier City Council. 
    "Hardship" as related to Section 15.48.500, Variances, of this chapter means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The requested variance must be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic consideration, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or this disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. 
    "Highest adjacent grade" means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure of a structure. 
    "Historic structure" means a structure that is: 
1.	Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the U.S. Department of the Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
2.	Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
3.	Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of the Interior; or 
4.	Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either by an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states with approved programs. 
    "Levee" means a manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
    "Levee system" means a flood protection system which consists of a levee or levees and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accord with sound engineering practices. 
    "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement (see "Basement" definition). 
1.	An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure below the lowest floor that is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other that a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided it conforms to applicable non-elevation design requirements, including, but not limited to: 
a.	The wet floodproofing standard in Section 15.48.400(C)(3). 
b.	The anchoring standards in Section 15.48.400(A). 
c.	The construction materials and methods standards in Section 15.48.400(B). 
d.	The standards for utilities in Section 15.48.410 
2.	For residential structures, all subgrade enclosed areas are prohibited as they are considered to be basements (see "Basement" definition). This prohibition includes below-grade garages and storage areas. 
    "Manufactured home" means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle." 
    "Manufactured home park or subdivision" means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    "Market value" shall be determined by estimating the cost to replace the structure in new condition and adjusting that cost figure by the amount of depreciation which has accrued since the structure was constructed. The cost of replacement of the structure shall be based on a square foot cost factor determined by reference to a building cost estimating guide recognized by the building construction industry. The amount of depreciation shall be determined by taking into account the age and physical deterioration of the structure and functional obsolescence as approved by the floodplain administrator, but shall not include economic or other forms of external obsolescence. Use of replacement costs or accrued depreciation factors different from those contained in recognized building costs estimating guides may be considered only if such factors are included in a report prepared by an independent professional appraiser and supported by a written explanation of the differences. 
    "Mean sea level" means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
    "New construction," for floodplain management purposes, means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of the chapter, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    "New manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of this chapter. 
    "Obstruction" includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or is likely to be carried downstream. 
    "One-hundred-year flood" or "100-year flood." See "Base flood." 
    "Public safety and nuisance" as related to Section 15.48.500 et seq., Variances, of this chapter means that the granting of a variance must not result in anything which is injurious to the safety or health of the community, neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, river, by stream, canal and basin. 
    "Recreational vehicle" means a vehicle which is: 
1.	Built on a single chassis;
2.	Is four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection;
3.	Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-duty truck; and
4.	Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    "Regulator floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. 
    "Remedy a violation" means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with state or local floodplain management regulations, or if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of the chapter or otherwise deterring future exposure with regard to the structure of other development. 
    "Riverine" means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc. 
    "Sheet flow area." See "Area of shallow flooding." 
    "Special flood hazard area (SFHA)" means an area in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. It is shown on an FHBM or FIRM as zone A, AO, A1-A30, AE, A99, AH, V1-V-30, VE or V. 
    "Start of construction" includes substantial improvement and other proposed new development, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty days from the date of issuance of the permit. The actual start means wither the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any site work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    "Structure" means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground; this includes a gas or liquid storage tank or a manufactured home. 
    "Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    "Substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other proposed new development of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term, however, does not include either: 
1.	Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations or state or local health, sanitary, or safety code requirements which have been identified by the local code requirements which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
2.	Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
    "Variance" means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter. 
    "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully complaint with this chapter. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    "Water surface elevation" means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 (or other datum where specified), or floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas. 
    "Watercourse" means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, arroyo, channel or other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may occur.

ARTICLE III. - ADMINISTRATION 

15.48.300 - Establishment of development permit. 
    A development permit shall be obtained before any construction or other development begins within any area of special flood hazard established in Section 15.48.210. Application for a development permit shall be made on forms furnished by the floodplain administrator and may include, but not be limited to: plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevation of the area in question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities; and the location of the foregoing. Specifically, the following information is required: 
A.	Proposed elevation, in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor (including basement) of all structures; 
B.	Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any nonresidential structure will be floodproofed, is required in Section 15.48.400(C)(3); 
C.	All appropriate certifications listed in Section 15.48.310 of this chapter; and 
D.	Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development. 
(Ord. No. 2009-01, § 1, 5-20-2009) 
15.48.310 - Duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator. 
    The duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator shall include, but not be limited to the following: 
A.	Permit Review. Review all development permits to determine that:
1.	Permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied;
2.	All other required state and federal permits have been obtained;
3.	The site is reasonably safe from flooding; and
4.	The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a floodway has not been designated. For purposes of this chapter, "adversely affects" means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point. 
B.	Review and Use of Any Other Base Flood Data. When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Section 15.48.210, the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or state agency, or other source in order to administer Section 15.48.400 et seq. Any such information shall be submitted to the city council for adoption. 
C.	Notification of Other Agencies. In alternation or relocation of a watercourse:
1.	Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of Water Resources prior to alteration or relocation; 
2.	Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency; and 
3.	Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained. 
D.	Documentation of Floodplain Development. Obtain and maintain for public inspection and make available as needed the following: 
1.	Certification required by Section 15.48.400(C)(1) (lowest floor elevations); 
2.	Certification required by Section 15.48.400(C)(2) (elevation or floodproofing of nonresidential structures); 
3.	Certification required by Section 15.48.400(C)(3) (wet floodproofing standard); 
4.	Certification of elevation required by Section 15.48.420(B) (subdivision standards); and 
5.	Certification required by Section 15.48.450(A) (floodway encroachments).

(Ord. No. 2009-01, § 1, 5-20-2009) 
ARTICLE IV. - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION 

15.48.400 - Standards of construction. 
    In all areas of special flood hazards, the following standards are required: 
A.	Anchoring.
1.	All new construction and substantial improvements shall be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy. 
2.	All manufactured homes shall meet the anchoring standards of Section 15.48.430 
B.	Construction Materials and Methods. All new construction and substantial improvement shall be construction and substantial improvement shall be constructed: 
1.	With materials and utility equipment resistant to flood damage;
2.	Using methods and practices that minimize flood damage; and
3.	With electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding. 
C.	Elevation and Floodproofing. (See Section 15.48.100 definitions for "basement," "lowest floor," "new construction," "substantial damage" and "substantial improvement.") 
1.	Residential construction, new or substantial improvement, shall have the lowest floor, including basement: 
a.	In an A zone, elevated at least one foot above the base flood elevation.
b.	In all other zones, elevated to or above the base flood elevation. Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor including basement shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor, and verified by the community building inspector to be properly elevated. Such certification or verification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator. 
2.	Nonresidential construction, new or substantial improvement, shall either be elevated to conform with subsection (C)(1) of this section or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities: 
a.	Be floodproofed below the elevation recommended under subsection (C)(1) of this section, so that the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water; 
b.	Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and 
c.	Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the standards of subsection (C)(2) of this section are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator. 
3.	All new construction and substantial improvement with fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor (excluding basements) that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and which are subject to flooding, shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwater. Designs for meeting this requirement must exceed the following minimum criteria: 
a.	Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect; or
b.	Have a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwater. 
4.	Manufactured homes shall also meet the standards in Section 15.48.430 
(Ord. No. 2009-01, § 1, 5-20-2009) 
15.48.410 - Standards for utilities. 
A.	All new and replacement water supply and sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate: 
1.	Infiltration of floodwaters into the systems; and
2.	Discharge from the systems into floodwaters.
B.	On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them or contamination from them during flooding. 
(Ord. No. 2009-01, § 1, 5-20-2009) 
15.48.420 - Standards for subdivisions. 
A.	All preliminary subdivisions proposals shall identify the flood hazard area and the elevation of the base flood. 
B.	All subdivision plans will provide the elevation of proposed structure(s) and pad(s). If the site is filled above the base flood elevation, the lowest floor and pad elevations shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor and provided to the floodplain administrator. 
C.	All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage.
D.	All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage. 
E.	All subdivisions shall provide adequate drainage to reduce exposure to flood hazards.
(Ord. No. 2009-01, § 1, 5-20-2009) 
15.48.430 - Standards for manufactured homes. 
A.	All manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's flood insurance rate map, on sites located: 
1.	Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision;
2.	In a new manufactured home park or subdivision;
3.	In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or
4.	In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on a site upon which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated at least one foot above the base flood elevation and be securely fastened to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation collapse and lateral movement. 
B.	All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within zones A1-30, AH, AE, V, on the community's flood insurance rate map that are not subject to the provisions of subsection (A) of this section will be securely fastened to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation collapse, and lateral movement, and be elevated so that either the: 
1.	Lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation; or
2.	Manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than thirty-six inches in height above grade. 
(Ord. No. 2009-01, § 1, 5-20-2009) 
15.48.440 - Standards for recreational vehicles. 
    All recreational vehicles placed on sites within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's flood insurance rate map will either: 
1.	Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty consecutive days, and be fully licensed ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system), is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions; or 
2.	Meet the permit requirements of Section 15.48.300 et seq. of this chapter and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes in Section 15.48.430(A). 
(Ord. No. 2009-01, § 1, 5-20-2009) 
15.48.450 - Floodways. 
    Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 15.48.210 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply: 
A.	Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvement, and other new development unless certification by a registered professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base flood elevation during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
B.	If subsection (A) of this section is satisfied, all new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Section 15.48.400 
(Ord. No. 2009-01, § 1, 5-20-2009) 
ARTICLE V. - VARIANCE PROCEDURE 

15.48.500 - Nature of variances. 
    The variance criteria set forth in this chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners. 
    It is the duty of the city council to help protect the city's residents from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood chapter are quite rare. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance may be granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. 
(Ord. No. 2009-01, § 1, 5-20-2009) 
15.48.510 - Appeal board. 
A.	In passing upon requests for variances, the city council shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and: 
1.	Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;
2.	Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;
3.	Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property; 
4.	Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;
5.	Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable;
6.	Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
7.	Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;
8.	Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for the area; 
9.	Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;
10.	Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site; and 
11.	Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges. 
B.	Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that: 
1.	The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage; and 
2.	Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the Office of the Fresno County Recorder so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land. 
C.	The floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Insurance Administration of the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(Ord. No. 2009-01, § 1, 5-20-2009) 
15.48.520 - Conditions for variances. 
A.	Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the procedures of Sections 15.48.400 et seq. and 15.48.500 et seq. of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
B.	Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "historic structures" (as defined in Section 15.48.100 of this chapter) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
C.	Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any non-negligible increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
D.	Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of a variance to an elevation requirement, this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local chapter. 
E.	Variances shall only be issued upon:
1.	Showing of good and sufficient cause;
2.	Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in "exceptional hardship" (as defined in Section 15.48.100 of this chapter) to the applicant; and 
3.	Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance (see "public safety or nuisance" as defined in Section 15.48.100), cause fraud or victimization (as defined in Section 15.48.100), cause fraud or victimization (as defined in Section 15.48.100) of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or chapters. 
F.	Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsection (A) through (E) of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance. 
G.	Upon consideration of the factors of Section 15.48.510 and the purposes of this chapter, the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.
