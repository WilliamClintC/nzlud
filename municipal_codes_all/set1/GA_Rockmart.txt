PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Rockmart, Georgia. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1976 Code, as supplemented through February 9, 1993, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the City Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1976 Code, as supple­mented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabet­ical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

CHARTER INDEX  CHTi:1

Indexes 

The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up to date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up to date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
This publication was under the direct supervision of Roger D. Merriam, Senior Code Attorney, and Ellen K. Torof, Editor, of the Municipal Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
The publisher is most grateful to Michael D. McRae, City Attorney, and Pam 
G. Herring, City Clerk, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-day administration of the city's affairs.

Checklist of Up-to-Date Pages 
(This checklist will be updated with the printing of each Supplement) 
From our experience in publishing Looseleaf Supplements on a page-for-page substitution basis, it has become evident that through usage and supplementation many pages can be inserted and removed in error. 
The following listing is included in this Code as a ready guide for the user to determine whether the Code volume properly reflects the latest printing of each page. 
In the first column all page numbers are listed in sequence. The second column reflects the latest printing of the pages as they should appear in an up-to-date volume. The letters "OC" indicate the pages have not been reprinted in the Supplement Service and appear as published for the original Code. When a page has been reprinted or printed in the Supplement Service, this column reflects the identification number or Supplement Number printed on the bottom of the page. 
In addition to assisting existing holders of the Code, this list may be used in compiling an up-to-date copy from the original Code and subsequent Supplements.

However, should the mayor and city council determine that it is not desirable to permanently abandon such street, lane, alley, avenue, road, or sidewalk, or any part thereof, but should desire to preserve it for future use to the city if needed for street or other purposes, the mayor and city council are hereby expressly granted the power and authority to lease or retain an easement to any such street, lane, alley, avenue, road, or sidewalk, or any part of the same, to any person, firm, or corporation, upon such terms and conditions as they may deem proper, with full power and authority to provide any such lease contract for a renewal of the same on a year-to-year basis, provided that the city shall not require the use of the property for street purposes at the expiration of any origi­nal lease contemplated herein.

Upon passage of such a resolution, the city shall then publish notice of the proposed closing or other disposition in a newspaper of general circulation located within the corporate limits of the city once a week for two weeks and hold a public hearing at the next regularly scheduled monthly city council meeting. If after such publication, no objection is made to the proposed disposition, the mayor and city council may proceed by ordinance to make such disposition. If, however, any citizen or prop­erty owner makes any objection to the proposed disposition, the mayor and city council shall con­duct a full and complete hearing and afford all parties the opportunity to present evidence or otherwise voice their opinions for or against the proposed disposition of the street property. The city shall retain full and complete discretion as to the final disposition of said property, even if requested by all adjoining property owners, and shall not have any obligation or duty to grant said property owners' request. 
(c) In the event that any person, firm, or corporation of the City of Rockmart files an appli­cation to close any portion of a street, lane, alley, avenue, road, or sidewalk, within the corporate limits of the city, the applicant shall bear all expenses occasioned by the closing of said street, lane, alley, avenue, road, or sidewalk, or any part of same, even if the mayor and city council do not ultimately grant the application. Said costs shall include, but not be limited to, any and all attorney's fees, survey costs, preparation of deeds or other legal instruments, recording fees, and any other reasonable costs and expenses incurred there­with. If multiple property owners submit such an application or petition, they shall bear all such costs equally. The applicant shall pay all such costs in advance, prior to the execution of any ordinances, quitclaim deeds, or any other docu­ments required to be executed at the conclusion of said closing. 
(d) The mayor and city council may place what­ever restrictions, contingencies, or requirements concerning the closing of such street, lane, alley, avenue, road, or sidewalk, or any part of same, as it may deem appropriate, including, but not lim­ited to, the right of retention of easements for sewer, water, and other municipal utilities ser­vices.

Section 4.16. Other taxes and fees; construc­tion. 
The mayor and city council shall be empowered to levy any other tax or fee now or hereafter permitted by law. The specific inclusion of any right, power, or authority in this article shall not be construed as limiting in any way the general powers of the city to collect taxes, fees, charges, and other moneys, and otherwise govern its local affairs.

Presently, the requirement of such bonds, under state law, is for all contracts of improvements exceeding $100,000.00. The provi­sions of O.C.G.A. § 13-10-1 are incorporated herein by reference and made a part of this subsection. Hereafter, the requirements of state law (and any later amendments thereto) shall govern the pur­chasing agent's requirements of performance and payment bonds pursuant to this article. 

(e) 
Performance bonds. To protect the interests of the city, a performance bond in the amount of 100 percent of the proposed contract shall be required from the successful bidder before enter­ing into the contract. If such bond is not provided within 15 days of the award of such bid, the award shall be void.

The heads of such departments shall follow normal purchasing procedures as defined in the purchasing procedures policy. 

(i) 
Petty cash fund. The purchasing agent is hereby authorized to establish a petty cash fund not to exceed $250.00, it being recognized that such fund eliminates the writing of numerous requisitions and purchase orders, thereby result­ing in a saving of appreciable time, supplies and money. Such fund shall be used primarily for the purchase of small items needed at once, and only upon the approval of the purchasing agent. In order to reimburse the petty cash fund, the pur­


chasing agent shall submit to the city clerk a petty cash voucher form, in duplicate, and attach all receipts as a means of accounting for its expenses.

After such hearing, the mayor and council shall take action with regard to the licensee's license as may be warranted by the facts, in its sole judg­ment and discretion.

Note to Table 5. The five permitted zones for freestanding signs are described in attachments "A" through "E" of the ordinance from which this section is derived. 
(1) 	
Location. If a lot has more than one street frontage and a freestanding sign is pro­posed on each street, then the freestand­ing sign allowed on each frontage can be no closer to the intersection of said streets than one-half the distance of the frontage on each street. 

(2) 	
Regulations within corporate limits. Free­standing signs that are authorized within the corporate limits of the city shall be subject to the following regulations: 

a. 	
All signs shall be constructed in an area that maintains a protective fall zone. That is, if the sign falls in any direction from its highest points, no building, parking lot, sign, or other improvement shall be located within the fall zone so that persons or prop­erty could be injured and/or dam­aged as a result of the falling sign. The fall zone shall be calculated by taking 11/2 times the height of the sign and drawing a circle with that radius around the sign's proposed centered location. 

b. 	
Freestanding signs shall be permit­ted within five zones (see Table 5) within the city. The description of each zone is attached and made a part of this article by reference. The city reserves the right to amend, restrict, or expand any freestanding sign zones. 

c. 	
In zones 2, 4 and 5 all freestanding signs shall have at least 300 feet of distance between the signs, in addi­tion to meeting all fall zone regula­tions set forth in subsection (b) of this section. 

d. 	
No signs shall be lower than two feet off the ground, nor higher than 25 feet. 

e. 	
No sign may be located so as to impair, in any way, traffic visibility at intersections where freestanding signs are allowed. 





(c) Billboards. Billboards shall be allowed only in C-2 and C-3 zoning districts and must have at least 2,500 feet of distance between the signs, in addition to meeting all fall zone regulations set forth in subsection (b)(2) of this section. No bill­board shall be higher than 35 feet, measured from the ground to the top of the sign. 
For the purposes of determining the required distances between billboards, distance shall be measured from the center of each billboard. Fur­ther, such measurement shall be by line of site or shortest distance, whichever is less. For purposes of enforcing the 2,500 feet of distance between billboards, the term billboard shall refer to any sign within or outside of the city limits that meets the definition of "billboard sign" in section 5-41 herein so that no billboard shall be allowed if there is another billboard within 2,500 feet no matter if the existing billboard is located within or outside of the city limits. The above manner of measuring distance applies only to the measure­ment of distances between signs and it is not applicable to any other section of this code requir­ing distance measurements. (Ord. No. 7-2003, § 1(5.55), 7-10-2003; Ord. No. 2008O-11, § 2, 11-18-2008)

Canopy and awning signage shall be deducted from allocated wall sign area. 

(2) 	
Height. Wall signs that project more than four inches from the building surface on which it is attached shall be at least eight feet above the finished elevation at its lowest extremity. The signs shall not be higher than the vertical wall to which it is attached. 

(3)

Sec. 5-54. Nonconforming signs. 
(a) Grandfathered signs. Signs lawfully exist­ing on the effective date of this article, which do not conform to the provisions of this article shall be deemed to be legal nonconforming grandfathered signs and may remain, except as otherwise spe­cifically qualified in this article. Such signs shall not be enlarged, extended, structurally recon­structed, replaced or altered in any manner; ex­cept a sign face may be changed so long as the new sign face does not increase either height or sign area. This provision shall not have the effect of excusing any violation of any other ordinance, nor shall it permit the continued existence of any unsafe sign or any sign that is not in good state of repair. 
(b) 
Maintenance. Nothing in this section shall be deemed to excuse a property owner from keep­ing nonconforming signs in good repair. No re­pairs other than minor maintenance and upkeep of nonconforming signs shall be permitted to make the sign comply with the requirement of this article. A nonconforming sign which has been declared by the city to be unsafe because of its physical condition shall not be repaired, rebuilt or restored unless such repair or restoration will result in a sign which conforms to all applicable provisions of this article. 

(c) 
Relocation. A nonconforming sign shall not be moved or otherwise relocated for any distance on the same lot or to another lot unless such change in location will make the sign conform to the provisions of this article, and meet permit requirements of this article. 

(d) 
Removal, destruction or discontinuance of use. If a nonconforming sign is removed or de­stroyed or the use of the sign is discontinued for any period of time, except for normal mainte­nance and repair, as defined in this article, or for maintenance of a building if such sign is attached to a building, the subsequent erection of a replace­ment sign shall be in accordance with the provi­sions of this article. As a consequence, when a nonconforming sign is destroyed or toppled by an act of God; weather, or whatever other means, this shall not constitute a sufficient reason to grant a variance to re-erect the nonconforming sign. 

(e) 
Replacement by a conforming sign. A non­conforming sign that is changed to, or replaced by, a conforming sign shall no longer be deemed nonconforming, and thereafter such sign shall be subject to the provisions of this article. (Ord. No. 7-2003, § 1(5.59), 7-10-2003)

Start of construction means the date the devel­opment permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction of the structure such as the pouring of slabs or footings, installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work be­yond the stage of excavation, and includes the placement of a manufactured home on a founda­tion. (Permanent construction does not include initial land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include ex­cavation for a basement, footings, piers or foun­dations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of buildings appurtenant to the permitted structure, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or part of the main structure. (NOTE: accessory structures are NOT exempt from any article requirements.) For a substantial improve­ment, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
Structure means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground, a manufactured home, a gas or liquid storage tank. 
Substantial damage means damage of any or­igin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
Substantial improvement means any reconstruc­tion, rehabilitation, addition, or other improve-ment of a structure, taking place during a five-year period, in which the cumulative cost equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure prior to the "start of construction" of the improvement. NOTE: The market value of the structure should be: 
(1) 	
The appraised value of the structure prior to the start of the initial repair or improve­ment; or 

(2) 	
In the case of damage, the value of the structure prior to the damage occurring. This term includes structures, which have incurred "substantial damage", regard­less of the actual amount of repair work performed. 



For the purposes of this definition, "substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimen­sions of the building. The term does not, however, include (1) those improvements of a structure required to comply with existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to as­sure safe living conditions and which have been identified by the code enforcement official, and not solely triggered by an improvement or repair project, or (2) any alteration of a "historic struc­ture" provided that the alteration will not pre­clude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure."

Sec. 5-132. Statement of purpose. 
It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1) 	
Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities, which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 

(2) 	
Restrict or prohibit uses which are dan­gerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which increase flood heights, velocities, or ero­sion; 

(3) 	
Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion; 

(4) 	
Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally di­vert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands; and 

(5) 	
Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which are involved in the accommodation of floodwaters.

1. 	
Provide a minimum of two open­ings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of en­closed area subject to flooding; 

2. 	
The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; and 

3. 	
Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided they permit the automatic flow of floodwater in both direction. 


b. 	
So as not to violate the "lowest floor" criteria of this article, the unfinished or flood resistant enclosure shall only be used for parking of vehicles, lim­ited storage of maintenance equip­ment used in connection with the premises, or entry to the elevated area; and 

c. 	
The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or fin­ished into separate rooms. 


(5) 	
All heating and air conditioning equip­ment and components (including ductwork), all electrical, ventilation, plumb­ing, and other service facilities shall be designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; 

(6)

Sec. 5-202. Specific standards. 
In ALL areas of special flood hazard the follow­ing provisions are required: 
(1) 	
New construction and/or substantial im­provements. Where base flood elevation data are available, new construction and/or substantial improvement of any structure or manufactured home shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation, which provides an addi­tional level of protection referred to as "freeboard." Should solid foundation pe­rimeter walls be used to elevate a struc­ture, openings sufficient to facilitate equal­ization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection 5-201(4), "Elevated Buildings." 

a. 	All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (includ­ing ductwork), all electrical, ventila­tion, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated at or above one foot above the base flood eleva­tion. 

(2) 	
Non-residential construction. New con­struction and/or the substantial improve­ment of any structure located in A1—30, 


AE, or AH zones, may be floodproofed in lieu of elevation. The structure, together with attendant utility and sanitary facil­ities, must be designed to be water tight to one foot above the base flood elevation, with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water, and structural com­ponents having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered profes­sional engineer or architect shall certify that the design and methods of construc­tion are in accordance with accepted stan­dards of practice for meeting the provi­sions above, and shall provide such certification to the official as set forth above and in subsection 5-178(6). 
(3) 	Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. Where base flood elevation data are available: 
a. 	
All manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved on: (1) individual lots or parcels, (2) in new and/or substantially improved man­ufactured home parks or subdivi­sions, (3) in expansions to existing manufactured home parks or subdi­visions, or (4) on a site in an existing manufactured home park or subdivi­sion where a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, must have the lowest floor including basement, elevated no lower than one foot above the base flood elevation. 

b. 	
Manufactured homes placed and/or substantially improved in an exist­ing manufactured home park or sub­division may be elevated so that ei­ther: 

1. 	
The lowest floor of the manu­factured home is elevated no lower than one foot above the level of the base flood elevation; or 

2. 	
The manufactured home chas­sis is elevated and supported by reinforced piers (or other 




foundation elements of at least an equivalent strength) of no less than 36 inches in height above grade. 
c. 	
All manufactured homes must be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation system to re­sist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. (Ref. subsection 5-201(6) above.) 

d. 	
All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 

1. 	
Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 

2. 	
Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, (a recreational ve­hicle is ready for highway use if it is licensed, on its wheels or jacking system, attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security de­vices, and has no permanently attached structures or addi­tions); or 

3. 	
The recreational vehicle must meet all the requirements for "new construction", including the anchoring and elevation re­quirements of subsection 5-202(3)a.—c., above. 




(4) 	Floodway. Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 5-135, are areas designated as floodway. A floodway may be an extremely hazardous area due to velocity floodwaters, debris or erosion potential. In addition, the area must remain free of encroachment in or­der to allow for the discharge of the base flood without increased flood heights. Therefore, the following provisions shall apply: 
a. 	Encroachments are prohibited, in­cluding earthen fill, new construc­tion, substantial improvements or other development within the regu­latory floodway. Development may be permitted however, provided it is demonstrated through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses performed in ac­cordance with standard engineering practice that the encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels or floodway widths during a base flood discharge. A registered professional engineer must provide supporting technical data and certi­fication thereof. 
b. 	ONLY if subsection 5-202(4)a. above is satisfied, then any new construc­tion or substantial improvement shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of divi­sion 3. 

(Ord. No. 2007O-12, 11-13-2007; Ord. No. 2008O­10, 8-12-2008) 
Sec. 5-203. Building standards for streams without established base flood elevations and/or floodway (A zones). 
Located within the areas of special flood haz­ard established in section 5-135 where streams exist but no base flood data have been provided (A zones), OR where base flood data have been provided but a floodway has not been delineated, the following provisions apply: 
(1) 	
When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accor­dance with section 5-135, then the build­ing official shall obtain, review, and rea­sonably utilize any scientific or historic base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or other source, in order to administer the provi­sions of division 3. ONLY if data are not available from these sources, then the following provisions (2) and (3) shall ap­ply: 

(2) 	
No encroachments, including structures or fill material, shall be located within an area equal to the width of the stream or 20 feet, whichever is greater, measured from the top of the stream bank, unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that such encroachment shall not result in 



more than a one foot increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
(3) 	In special flood hazard areas without base flood elevation data, new construction and substantial improvements of existing struc­tures shall have the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including base­ment) elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. (NOTE: Require the lowest floor to be elevated one foot above the estimated base flood elevation in A zone areas where a limited detail study has been completed). Openings sufficient to facilitate the unimpeded movements of floodwaters shall be provided in accor­dance with standards of subsection 5-201(4), "Elevated Buildings." 
a. 	All heating and air conditioning equipment and components (includ­ing ductwork), all electrical, ventila­tion, plumbing, and other service facilities shall be elevated no less than three feet above the highest adjacent grade at the building site. 
The building official shall certify the low­est floor elevation level and the record shall become a permanent part of the permit file.

vided however, that construction of any such residence shall conform to the mini­mum requirements as set forth in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6 and this paragraph. For single-family residence construction covered by the provisions of this paragraph, there shall be a buffer zone between the resi­dence and any state waters classi.ed as trout streams pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of the Georgia Water Quality Control Act. In any such buffer zone, no land disturbing activity shall be con­structed between the residence and the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream .ow or wave action from the banks of the trout waters. For primary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least 50 horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. For secondary trout waters, the buffer zone shall be at least 50 horizontal feet, but the director may grant variances to no less than 25 feet. Regardless of whether a trout stream is primary or secondary, for .rst order trout waters, which are streams into which no other streams .ow except for springs, the buffer shall be at least 25 horizontal feet, and no variance to a smaller buffer shall be granted. The minimum requirements of 
O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b) and the buffer zones provided by this paragraph shall be en­forced by the local issuing authority; 
(5) 	Agricultural operations as de.ned in 
O.C.G.A. § 1-3-3, "de.nitions", to include raising, harvesting or storing of products of the .eld or orchard; feeding, breeding or managing livestock or poultry; produc­ing or storing feed for use in the produc­tion of livestock, including but not limited to cattle, calves, swine, hogs, goats, sheep, and rabbits or for use in the production of poultry, including but not limited to chick­ens, hens and turkeys; producing plants, trees, fowl, or animals; the production of aquaculture, horticultural, dairy, live­stock, poultry, eggs and apiarian prod­ucts; farm buildings and farm ponds;

Sec. 5-254. Minimum requirements for ero­sion, sedimentation and pollu­tion control using best manage­ment practices. 
(a) General provisions. Excessive soil erosion and resulting sedimentation can take place dur­ing land disturbing activities if requirements of the article and the NPDES general permit are not met. Therefore, plans for those land disturbing activities which are not exempted by this article shall contain provisions for application of soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control mea­sures and practices. The provisions shall be incor­porated into the erosion, sedimentation and pol­lution control plans. Soil erosion, sedimentation and pollution control measures and practices shall conform to the minimum requirement of section 5-254(b) and (c) of this article. The application of measures and practices shall apply to all features of the site, including street and utility installa­tions, drainage facilities and other temporary and permanent improvements. Measures shall be in­stalled to prevent or control erosion, sedimenta­tion and pollution during all stages of any land disturbing activity in accordance with require­ments of this article and the NPDES general permit. 
(b) Minimum requirements/BMPs. 
(1) 	Best management practices as set forth in section 5-254(b) and (c) of this article shall be required for all land disturbing activities. Proper design, installation, and maintenance of best management prac­tices shall constitute a complete defense to any action by the director or to any other allegation of noncompliance with paragraph (2) of this subsection or any substantially similar terms contained in a permit for the discharge of stormwater issued pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act". As used in this subsection the terms "proper design" and "properly designed" mean de­signed in accordance with the hydraulic design speci.cations contained in the "Man­ual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" speci.ed in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-6(b). 

(2) 	
A discharge of stormwater runoff from disturbed areas where best management practices have not been properly de­signed, installed, and maintained shall constitute a separate violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issu­ing authority or of any state general per­mit issued by the division pursuant to 

O.C.G.A. § 12-5-30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such discharge results in the tur­bidity of receiving waters being increased by more than 25 nephelometric turbidity units for waters supporting warm water .sheries or by more than ten nephelometric turbidity units for waters classi.ed as trout waters. The turbidity of the receiv­ing waters shall be measured in accor­dance with guidelines to be issued by the director. This paragraph shall not apply to any land disturbance associated with the construction of single family homes which are not part of a larger common plan of development or sale unless the planned disturbance for such construc­tion is equal to or greater than .ve acres. 

(3) 	
Failure to properly design, install, or main­tain best management practices shall con­stitute a violation of any land disturbing permit issued by a local issuing authority or of any state general permit issued by the division pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-5­30(f), the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", for each day on which such failure occurs. 

(4) 	
The director may require, in accordance with regulations adopted by the board, reasonable and prudent monitoring of the 


turbidity level of receiving waters into which discharges from land disturbing activities occur. 
(5) 	The LIA may set more stringent buffer requirements than stated in subsections (c)(15) and (16), in light of O.C.G.A. § 12­7-6(c). 
(c) The rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions adopted pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. for the purpose of governing land disturb­ing activities shall require, as a minimum, pro­tections at least as stringent as the state general permit; and best management practices, includ­ing sound conservation and engineering practices to prevent and minimize erosion and resultant sedimentation, which are consistent with, and no less stringent than, those practices contained in the "Manual for Erosion and Sediment Control in Georgia" published by the Georgia Soil and Water Conservation Commission as of January 1 of the year in which the land disturbing activity was permitted, as well as the following: 
(1) 	
Stripping of vegetation, regrading and other development activities shall be con­ducted in a manner so as to minimize erosion. 

(2) 	
Cut-.ll operations must be kept to a min­imum; 

(3) 	
Development plans must conform to to­pography and soil type so as to create the lowest practicable erosion potential; 

(4) 	
Whenever feasible, natural vegetation shall be retained, protected and supplemented; 

(5) 	
The disturbed area and the duration of exposure to erosive elements shall be kept to a practicable minimum; 

(6) 	
Disturbed soil shall be stabilized as quickly as practicable; 

(7) 	
Temporary vegetation or mulching shall be employed to protect exposed critical areas during development; 

(8) 	
Permanent vegetation and structural ero­sion control practices shall be installed as soon as practicable; 


(9) 	
To the extent necessary, sediment in run­off water must be trapped by the use of debris basins, sediment basins, silt traps, or similar measures until the disturbed area is stabilized. As used in this para­graph, a disturbed area is stabilized when it is brought to a condition of continuous compliance with the requirements of 

O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq.; 

(10) 
Adequate provisions must be provided to minimize damage from surface water to the cut face of excavations or the sloping of .lls; 

(11) 	
Cuts and .lls may not endanger adjoining property; 

(12) 	
Fills may not encroach upon natural wa­tercourses or constructed channels in a manner so as to adversely affect other property owners; 

(13) 
Grading equipment 	must cross .owing streams by means of bridges or culverts except when such methods are not feasi­ble, provided, in any case, that such cross­ings are kept to a minimum; 

(14) 	
Land disturbing activity plans for ero­sion, sedimentation and pollution control shall include provisions for treatment or control of any source of sediments and adequate sedimentation control facilities to retain sediments on-site or preclude sedimentation of adjacent waters beyond the levels speci.ed in section 5-254(b)(2) of this article; 

(15) 
Except as provided in paragraph (16) of this subsection, there is established a 25-foot buffer along the banks of all state waters, as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream .ow or wave action, except where the director deter­mines to allow a variance that is at least as protective of natural resources and the environment, where otherwise allowed by the director pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12­2-8, where a drainage structure or a road­way drainage structure must be con­structed, provided that adequate erosion 


control measures are incorporated in the project plans and speci.cations, and are implemented; or along any ephemeral stream. As used in this provision, the term "ephemeral stream" means a stream: that under normal circumstances has wa­ter .owing only during and for a short duration after precipitation events; that has the channel located above the ground­water table year round; for which ground water is not a source of water; and for which runoff from precipitation is the primary source of water .ow. Unless ex­empted as along an ephemeral stream, the buffers of at least 25 feet established pursuant to part 6 of Article 5, Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", shall remain in force unless a variance is granted by the director as provided in this paragraph. The following requirements shall apply to any such buf­fer: 
a. 	
No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed state of vegetation until all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the .nal stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; provided, how­ever, that any person constructing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural can­opy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 

b. 	
The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, 



provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of cross­ing, within 25 degrees of perpendic­ular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate ero­sion control measures are incorpo­rated into the project plans and spec­i.cations and are implemented: 
1. 	
Stream crossings for water lines; or 

2. 	
Stream crossings for sewer lines; and 


(16) 	There is established a 50-foot buffer as measured horizontally from the point where vegetation has been wrested by normal stream .ow or wave action, along the banks of any state waters classi.ed as "trout streams" pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 5 of Title 12, the "Georgia Water Quality Control Act", except where a road­way drainage structure must be con­structed; provided, however, that small springs and streams classi.ed as trout streams which discharge an average an­nual .ow of 25 gallons per minute or less shall have a 25-foot buffer or they may be piped, at the discretion of the landowner, pursuant to the terms of a rule providing for a general variance promulgated by the board, so long as any such pipe stops short of the downstream landowner's property and the landowner complies with the buf­fer requirement for any adjacent trout streams. The director may grant a vari­ance from such buffer to allow land dis­turbing activity, provided that adequate erosion control measures are incorporated in the project plans and speci.cations and are implemented. The following require­ments shall apply to such buffer. 
a. 	No land disturbing activities shall be conducted within a buffer and a buffer shall remain in its natural, undisturbed, state of vegetation un­til all land disturbing activities on the construction site are completed. Once the .nal stabilization of the site is achieved, a buffer may be thinned or trimmed of vegetation as long as a protective vegetative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural can­opy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed: pro­vided, however, that any person con­structing a single-family residence, when such residence is constructed by or under contract with the owner for his or her own occupancy, may thin or trim vegetation in a buffer at any time as long as protective vege­tative cover remains to protect water quality and aquatic habitat and a natural canopy is left in sufficient quantity to keep shade on the stream bed; and 
b. 	The buffer shall not apply to the following land disturbing activities, provided that they occur at an angle, as measured from the point of cross­ing, within 25 degrees of perpendic­ular to the stream; cause a width of disturbance of not more than 50 feet within the buffer; and adequate ero­sion control measures are incorpo­rated into the project plans and spec­i.cations and are implemented: 
1. 	
Stream crossings for water lines; or 

2. 	
Stream crossings for sewer lines. 


(d) 
Nothing contained in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-1 et seq. shall prevent any local issuing authority from adopting rules and regulations, ordinances, or resolutions which contain stream buffer require­ments that exceed the minimum requirements in section 5-254(b) and (c) of this article. 

(e) 
The fact that land disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the standards provided for in this article or the terms of the permit. (Ord. No. 2010O-02, § IV, 4-13-2010) 


Sec. 5-255. Application/permit process. 
(a) General. The property owner, developer and designated planners and engineers shall design and review before submittal the general develop­ment plans. The local issuing authority shall review the tract to be developed and the area surrounding it. They shall consult the zoning ordinance, stormwater management ordinance, subdivision ordinance, .ood damage prevention ordinance, this article, and any other ordinances, rules, regulations or permits, which regulate the development of land within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing authority. How­ever, the owner and/or operator are the only parties who may obtain a permit. 
(b) Application requirements. 
(1) 	
No person shall conduct any land disturb­ing activity within the jurisdictional bound­aries of the City of Rockmart without .rst obtaining a permit from the department of community development to perform such activity and providing a copy of notice of intent submitted to EPD if applicable. 

(2) 	
The application for a permit shall be sub­mitted to the department of community development and must include the appli­cant's erosion, sedimentation and pollu­tion control plan with supporting data, as necessary. Said plans shall include, as a minimum, the data speci.ed in section 5-255(c) of this article. Erosion, sedimen­tation and pollution control plans, to­gether with supporting data, must dem­onstrate affirmatively that the land disturbing activity proposed will be car­ried out in such a manner that the provi­sions of section 5-254(b) and (c) of this article will be met. Applications for a permit will not be accepted unless accom­panied by three copies of the applicant's erosion, sedimentation and pollution con­trol plans. All applications shall contain a certi.cation stating that the plan preparer or the designee thereof visited the site prior to creation of the plan in accordance with EPD Rule 391-3-7-10. 

(3) 	
In addition to the local permitting fees, fees will also be assessed pursuant to 


O.C.G.A. § 12-5-23(a)(5), provided that such fees shall not exceed $80.00 per acre of land disturbing activity, and these fees shall be calculated and paid by the pri­mary permittee as de.ned in the state general permit for each acre of land dis­turbing activity included in the planned development or each phase of develop­ment. All applicable fees shall be paid prior to issuance of the land disturbance permit. In a jurisdiction that is certi.ed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) half of such fees levied shall be submitted to the division; except that any and all fees due from an entity which is required to give notice pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-17(9) or (10) shall be submitted in full to the division, regardless of the existence of a local issuing authority in the jurisdiction. 
(4) 	Immediately upon receipt of an applica­tion and plan for a permit, the local issu­ing authority shall refer the application and plan to the district for its review and approval or disapproval concerning the adequacy of the erosion, sedimentation and pollution control plan. The district shall approve or disapprove a plan within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the district to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the pending plan. The results of the district review shall be forwarded to the local issuing authority. No permit will be issued unless the plan has been approved by the district, and any variances required by section 5-254(c)(15) and (16) has been obtained, all fees have been paid, and bonding, if required as per section 5-255(b)(6), have been obtained. Such review will not be required if the local issuing authority and the district have entered into an agree­ment which allows the local issuing au­thority to conduct such review and ap­proval of the plan without referring the application and plan to the district. The local issuing authority with plan review authority shall approve or disapprove a revised plan submittal within 35 days of receipt. Failure of the local issuing author-ity with plan review authority to act within 35 days shall be considered an approval of the revised plan submittal. 

(5)

(Ord. No. 2010O-02, § V, 4-13-2010) 
Sec. 5-256. Inspection and enforcement. 
(a) The City of Rockmart will periodically in­spect the site of land disturbing activities for which permits have been issued to determine if the activities are being conducted in accordance with the plan and if the measures required in the plan are effective in controlling erosion and sedi­mentation. Also, the local issuing authority shall regulate primary, secondary and tertiary permit-tees as such terms are de.ned in the state general permit. Primary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best manage­ment practices where the primary permittee is conducting land disturbing activities. Secondary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance of best management practices where the secondary permittee is conducting land disturbing activities. Tertiary permittees shall be responsible for installation and maintenance where the tertiary permittee is conducting land disturb­ing activities. If, through inspection, it is deemed that a person engaged in land disturbing activi­ties as de.ned herein has failed to comply with the approved plan, with permit conditions, or with the provisions of this article, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compliance and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land disturbing activity fails to comply within the time speci.ed, he shall be deemed in violation of this article. 
(b) 
The local issuing authority must amend its ordinances to the extent appropriate within 12 months of any amendments to the Erosion and Sedimentation Act of 1975. 

(c) 
The City of Rockmart shall have the power to conduct such investigations as it may reason­ably deem necessary to carry out duties as pre­scribed in this article, and for this purpose to enter at reasonable times upon any property, public or private, for the purpose of investigation and inspecting the sites of land disturbing activ­ities. 

(d) 
No person shall refuse entry or access to any authorized representative or agent of the local issuing authority, the commission, the dis­trict, or division who requests entry for the pur­poses of inspection, and who presents appropriate credentials, nor shall any person obstruct, ham­per or interfere with any such representative while in the process of carrying out his official duties. 

(e) 
The district or the commission or both shall semi-annually review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certi.ed as local issuing authorities pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7­8(a). The district or the commission or both may provide technical assistance to any county or municipality for the purpose of improving the effectiveness of the county's or municipality's ero­sion, sedimentation and pollution control pro­gram. The district or the commission shall notify 


the division and request investigation by the division if any de.cient or ineffective local pro­gram is found. 
(f) The division may periodically review the actions of counties and municipalities which have been certi.ed as local issuing authorities pursu­ant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a). Such review may include, but shall not be limited to, review of the administration and enforcement of a governing authority's ordinance and review of conformance with an agreement, if any, between the district and the governing authority. If such review indi­cates that the governing authority of any county or municipality certi.ed pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-8(a) has not administered or enforced its ordinances or has not conducted the program in accordance with any agreement entered into pur­suant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-7(e), the division shall notify the governing authority of the county or municipality in writing. The governing authority of any county or municipality so noti.ed shall have 90 days within which to take the necessary corrective action to retain certi.cation as a local issuing authority. If the county or municipality does not take necessary corrective action within 90 days after noti.cation by the division, the division shall revoke the certi.cation of the county or municipality as a local issuing authority. (Ord. No. 2010O-02, § VI, 4-13-2010) 
Sec. 5-257. Penalties and incentives. 
(a) Failure to obtain a permit for land disturb­ing activity. If any person commences any land disturbing activity requiring a land disturbing permit as prescribed in this article without .rst obtaining said permit, the person shall be subject to revocation of his business license, work permit or other authorization for the conduct of a busi­ness and associated work activities within the jurisdictional boundaries of the local issuing au­thority. 
(b) Stop-work orders. 
(1) 	For the .rst and second violations of the provisions of this article, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a written warning to the violator. The vio­lator shall have .ve days to correct the violation. If the violation is not corrected within .ve days, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue a stop-work order requiring that the land disturbing activities be stopped until necessary cor­rective action or mitigation has occurred; provided, however, that, if the violation presents an imminent threat to public health or waters of the state or if the land disturbing activities are conducted with­out obtaining the necessary permit, the director or the local issuing authority shall issue an immediate stop-work order in lieu of a warning; 
(2) 	
For a third and each subsequent viola­tion, the director or the local issuing au­thority shall issue an immediate stop-work order; and; 

(3) 	
All stop-work orders shall be effective immediately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. 

(4) 	
When a violation in the form of taking action without a permit, failure to main­tain a stream buffer, or signi.cant amounts of sediment, as determined the local issu­ing authority or by the director or his or her designee, have been or are being dis­charged into state waters and where best management practices have not been prop­erly designed, installed, and maintained, a stop work order shall be issued by the local issuing authority or by the director or by his or her designee. All such stop work orders shall be effective immedi­ately upon issuance and shall be in effect until the necessary corrective action or mitigation has occurred. Such stop work orders shall apply to all land disturbing activity on the site with the exception of the installation and maintenance of tem­porary or permanent erosion and sedi­ment controls. 


(c) Bond forfeiture. If, through inspection, it is determined that a person engaged in land disturb­ing activities has failed to comply with the ap­proved plan, a written notice to comply shall be served upon that person. The notice shall set forth the measures necessary to achieve compli-ance with the plan and shall state the time within which such measures must be completed. If the person engaged in the land disturbing activity fails to comply within the time speci.ed, he shall be deemed in violation of this article and, in addition to other penalties, shall be deemed to have forfeited his performance bond, if required to post one under the provisions of section 5-255(b)(6). The local issuing authority may call the bond or any part thereof to be forfeited and may use the proceeds to hire a contractor to stabilize the site of the land disturbing activity and bring it into compliance. 
(d) Monetary penalties. 
(1) 	Any person who violates any provisions of this article, or any permit condition or limitation established pursuant to this article, or who negligently or intention­ally fails or refuses to comply with any .nal or emergency order of the director issued as provided in this article shall be liable for a civil penalty not to exceed $2,500.00 per day. For the purpose of enforcing the provisions of this article, notwithstanding any provisions in any city charter to the contrary, municipal courts shall be authorized to impose pen­alty not to exceed $2,500.00 for each vio­lation. Notwithstanding any limitation of law as to penalties which can be assessed for violations of county ordinances, any magistrate court or any other court of competent jurisdiction trying cases brought as violations of this article under county ordinances approved under this article shall be authorized to impose penalties for such violations not to exceed $2,500.00 for each violation. Each day during which violation or failure or refusal to comply continues shall be a separate violation. 

(Ord. No. 2010O-02, § VII, 4-13-2010) 
Sec. 5-258. Education and certi.cation. 
(a) Persons involved in land development de­sign, review, permitting, construction, monitor­ing, or inspection or any land disturbing activity shall meet the education and training certi.ca­tion requirements, dependent on their level of involvement with the process, as developed by the commission in consultation with the division and the stakeholder advisory board created pursuant to O.C.G.A. § 12-7-20. 
(b) 
For each site on which land disturbing activity occurs, each entity or person acting as either a primary, secondary, or tertiary permittee, as de.ned in the state general permit, shall have as a minimum one person who is in responsible charge of erosion and sedimentation control activ­ities on behalf of said entity or person and meets the applicable education or training certi.cation requirements developed by the commission pres­ent on site whenever land disturbing activities are conducted on that site. A project site shall herein be de.ned as any land disturbance site or multiple sites within a larger common plan of development or sale permitted by an owner or operator for compliance with the state general permit. 

(c) 
Persons or entities involved in projects not requiring a state general permit but otherwise requiring certi.ed personnel on site may contract with certi.ed persons to meet the requirements of this article. 

(d) 
If a state general permittee who has oper­ational control of land disturbing activities for a site has met the certi.cation requirements of 


O.C.G.A. § 12-7-19(b)(1), then any person or en­tity involved in land disturbing activity at that site and operating in a subcontractor capacity for such permittee shall meet those educational re­quirements speci.ed in O.C.G.A. § 12-7-19(b)(4) and shall not be required to meet any educational requirements that exceed those speci.ed in said paragraph. (Ord. No. 2010O-02, § VIII, 4-13-2010) 
Sec. 5-259. Administrative appeal and judi­cial review. 
(a) Administrative remedies. The suspension, revocation, modi.cation or grant with condition of a permit by the local issuing authority upon .nding that the holder is not in compliance with the approved erosion, sediment and pollution control plan; or that the holder is in violation of permit conditions; or that the holder is in viola­tion of any ordinance; shall entitle the person submitting the plan or holding the permit to a hearing before the city manager within 30 days after receipt by the local issuing authority of written notice of appeal. 
(b) Judicial review. Any person, aggrieved by a decision or order of the local issuing authority, after exhausting his administrative remedies, shall have the right to appeal de novo to the Superior Court of Polk County. (Ord. No. 2010O-02, § IX, 4-13-2010) 
Sec. 5-260. Effectivity, validity and liability. 
(a) 
Effectivity. This article shall become effec­tive on the 14th day of April, 2010. 

(b) 
Validity. If any section, paragraph, clause, phrase, or provision of this article shall be ad­judged invalid or held unconstitutional, such de­cisions shall not affect the remaining portions of this article. 


(c) Liability. 
(1) 	
Neither the approval of a plan under the provisions of this article, nor the compli­ance with provisions of this article shall relieve any person from the responsibility for damage to any person or property otherwise imposed by law nor impose any liability upon the local issuing authority or district for damage to any person or property. 

(2) 	
The fact that a land disturbing activity for which a permit has been issued results in injury to the property of another shall neither constitute proof of nor create a presumption of a violation of the stan­dards provided for in this article of the terms of the permit. 

(3) 	
No provision of this article shall permit any persons to violate the Georgia Ero­sion and Sedimentation Act of 1975, the Georgia Water Quality Control Act or the rules and regulations promulgated and approved thereunder or pollute any wa­ters of the state as de.ned thereby.

ARTICLE VII. MOVABLE HOUSING 


Sec. 5-286. De.nitions. 
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Building permit means the written document authorizing the construction of works of improve­ments, alterations or other construction activities concerning any movable housing, as de.ned in this section, within the city. 
Movable housing means any house, dwelling, building or other structure (not a manufactured home as de.ned in O.C.G.A. § 8-2-131(3)) which has been extracted from its foundation or other permanent location by means of dollies, jacks or other devices so as to be made portable, movable or otherwise subject to being transported or hauled; when in fact the structure was not constructed or designed for that purpose. 
Moving permit means that written document required to authorize the moving, transportation or relocation of any movable housing either within or without the corporate limits of the city. 
Sec. 5-287. Regulations, restrictions for use of public streets. 
(a) 
Permit. No person shall use the streets within the corporate city limits of the city to move, transport or relocate any house, dwelling, building or other structure of a width more than 12 feet at its widest point, or a length of more than 60 feet at its longest point, or a height of 14 feet at its highest point without .rst obtaining a permit from the building inspector, or his desig­nated agent (hereafter referred to as the issuer). 

(b) 
Movement times. No structure shall be moved upon any street within the city limits between the hours of 7:30 a.m. and 9:30 a.m., 11:30 a.m. and 


1:30 p.m., and 3:30 p.m. and 6:00 p.m. No move­ment shall be made between sunset and sunrise unless special permission is granted by the city council. Movement times may also be changed by the issuer or permit when special situations exist. 
(c) Permit application. The application for the permit shall designate: 
(1) 	
The type of load to be moved. 

(2) 	
The exact route and streets to be used. 

(3) 	
The time of day or night that the moving shall take place. 

(4) 	
The fact that Southern Bell Telephone, Georgia Power Company, Falcon Cable TV Company and any and all other public utilities whose facilities may be affected, have been noti.ed. 

(5) 	
Such other matters as the issuer deems proper. 



The terms of the permit shall be strictly adhered to by the mover; no deviation therefrom shall be permitted without the express written permission of the issuer. 
(d) 
Application deadline. Application for a per­mit must be made at least 15 days prior to the proposed moving, at which time the issuer shall notify the chief of police, who shall furnish, at the time of moving, such necessary police escort to the mover as the police chief deems necessary to ensure the safety of the public. 

(e) 
Sign required. A sign evidencing that a structure is to be removed or located, as the case may be, upon any real property within the city shall be placed upon the property at least 15 days prior to the proposed removal or relocation. This sign shall comport with the general size require­ments of signs evidencing a proposed change of property zoning within the city. 

(f) 
Permit fee; deposit as bond for damages. The fee for such moving permit shall be as set forth in the schedule of fees and charges. In addition thereto, the movers shall deposit with the issuing authority of the city an amount as set forth in the schedule of fees and charges for each such movable housing structure to be transported either within or without the city, as a bond for damages to public property. This sum shall be returned to the mover within 15 days after such moving if no damage is done to public property. In case of such damage, the amount of the refund will be the total deposit less actual damages, including repair, replacement, labor and inciden­


tal expenses. If damage costs exceed the deposit, the mover shall be liable to the city for all addi­tional expenses. 
Sec. 5-288. Restrictions on transportation. 
(a) 
When any part of movement is on a state route, the provisions of this section are in addition to those required by the state for its permit. No city permit shall be issued under this article in such cases unless the mover has .rst obtained a state permit for such movement. 

(b) 
In no event shall permission be granted to remove into or within the city any building which any government or governmental agency has found un.t for human habitation or use or which has been constructed of defective materials, or which has become defective from age, .re, abuse or other cause. When any doubt exists, the building inspector shall make a complete inspection for such faults. 

(c) 
When movement is on streets with over­head signals, cables, wires or other devices, the mover shall take such precautions as are neces­sary to guide and handle the wires and/or devices and to prevent damage thereto. 

(d) 
The issuer of the permit may contact the city .re chief as soon as the permit is issued. Changes in the predetermined route may be made at the discretion of the .re chief. 

(e) 
All extreme points on the structure being moved shall be visibly marked with .ags or lights or both. If movement at night is permitted, lights shall be required. 


Sec. 5-289. Building permits required; fees. 
(a) 
Building permit fees in addition to the moving permit shall be as established by the city council. 

(b) 
No permit as required by the building code shall be issued until the prescribed fee has been paid, nor shall an amendment to a permit be approved until the additional fee, if any, due to an increase in the estimated cost of the building or structure has been paid. 


(c) Where work for which a permit is required by this Code is started or proceeded with prior to obtaining the permit, the fees speci.ed shall be doubled, but the payment of such double fee shall not relieve any person from fully complying with the requirements of this Code in the execution of the work nor from any other penalties prescribed in this article. 
Sec. 5-290. Standards for review of issuance of permit. 
The building inspector of the city is charged with the authority for the enforcement of this article. As such, in determining whether to issue a moving permit, he shall use the following criteria: 
(1) 	
No permit for movable housing shall be issued until notice of an application for a permit, to be made on forms approved by the city, has been given to the owners of all adjoining property upon which the building or structure is to be moved. Each adjoining property owner, including those adjacent to the property and across the street directly therefrom, shall be allowed to be heard before the building inspector before the granting of a permit occurs. 

(2) 	
Whether the proposed housing can be properly brought to the level of minimum standard requirements contained in the building code of the city, and as generally required pursuant to the provisions of 

O.C.G.A. § 8-2-1 et seq. The aforesaid provisions of state law generally deal with the construction or alteration of build­ings. Those sections of this Code or state law applicable to movable housing shall be used as criteria for determining the feasibility of issuing a permit to the ap­plicant. 

(3) 	
Whether the structure, when complete, will have a fair market value which is not less than 80 percent of the assessed fair market value of adjoining comparable prop­erties, for tax purposes, in the general vicinity and neighborhood within the city where this structure is to be located. The 


purpose of this provision is to ensure that the structure's presence in the area will not diminish property values. 
(4) 	
Whether the structure can safely and properly, using reasonable construction standards and those contained in this Code, be properly placed upon the prop­erty, constructed, repaired and main­tained as a residential dwelling unit .t and safe for occupancy by the general public. 

(5) 	
Whether the placing of a movable housing structure, together with all work or other construction to be accomplished in the vicinity of the property will create a health, safety or public hazard or nuisance within the corporate limits of the city. 

(6) 	
Whether the applicant has, within .ve years before the date of the application, had a building permit revoked, failed to comply with code standards and require­ments of the building inspector or other­wise been cited for signi.cant violations of the building codes and ordinances of the city. 


Sec. 5-291. Permit not transferable; subject to denial, revocation, suspen­sion or amendment. 
(a) 
A permit, once issued, may not be trans­ferred from one person to another, or from one licensed location for the moving of a structure contemplated by this article to another location, without the express written consent of the build­ing inspector having been .rst obtained. 

(b) 
The building inspector shall have full power and authority to deny, revoke, refuse to grant, suspend or amend, as might be needed, any moving permit to be granted under this article. 

(c) 
Since the criteria and establishment of this permit also requires later enforcement and com­pliance with this article, this permit and the accompanying building permit shall be subject to revocation for cause. 

(d) 
Before taking any action adverse to an applicant or permit holder, the building inspector shall conduct a hearing at which all interested 


parties may be heard concerning the grant, re­newal, refusal or suspension of any license privi­leges granted under this article. Appeal of any decision of the building inspector shall be to the city council. 
Sec. 5-292. Hearing. 
Upon written application within 30 days of the decision of the building inspector, any applicant or other party aggrieved by any decision pursuant to this article shall be afforded an opportunity for a hearing before the city council. At that time the aggrieved party shall be allowed to present evi­dence, cross examine opposing witnesses, or pres­ent any and all documentation concerning the application or decision. Failure to make timely appeal of the decision within the time period shall cause the decision to become .nal and nonappeal­able. The hearing shall be conducted within 30 days from the date of a timely application and the .nal decision of the city council in this regard shall be accomplished in writing and communi­cated to the aggrieved party. The review before the city council shall be conducted pursuant to the criteria contained in this article for review by the building inspector, and shall be considered a de novo consideration of the decision.

ARTICLE VIII. MANUFACTURED HOMES 
Sec. 5-316. De.nitions. 
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Manufactured home means a factory-built, sin­gle-family structure that is manufactured under the authority of 42 USC 5401 (the National Man­ufactured Home Construction and Safety Stan­dards Act), transportable in one or more sections, which in traveling mode, is eight body feet or more in width or 40 body feet or more in length, or, when erected on site, is 320 or more square feet, and which is built on a permanent chassis and designed to be used as a dwelling with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities, and includes the plumb­ing, heating, air conditioning, and electrical sys­tems contained therein. Calculations used to de­termine the number of square feet in a structure will be based on the structure's exterior dimen­sions measured at the largest horizontal projec­tions when erected on site. These dimensions will include all expandable rooms, cabinets, and other projections containing interior space, but do not include bay windows. 
Mobile home means a transportable, factory-built home, designed to be used as a year-round residential dwelling and built prior to the enact­ment of the Federal Manufactured Housing Con­struction and Safety Standards Act of 1974, which became effective June 15, 1976. (Ord. of 4-13-2004)

(a) Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, unless the context clearly indicates otherwise: 
Odor means that property of an air contami­nant that affects the sense of smell. 
Odor concentration means the number of cubic feet that one cubic foot of sample will occupy when diluted to the odor threshold; that is, at further dilution no odor is detectable to the hu­man nose. It is a measure of the number of odor units in one cubic foot of the sample and is expressed in odor units per cubic foot. 
Odor unit means the quantity of any odorous substance or any mixture of odorous substances which when completely dispersed in one cubic foot of odor-free air, produces a threshold odor detec­tion response in humans. 
(b) 
Prohibitions. No person shall cause, suffer or allow the discharge from any device, machine, equipment, building, commercial operation or other facility of any gases, vapors, or gas-entrained effluents unless these emissions are controlled in such a manner as to abate any objectionable odor nuisance. 

(c) 
Objectionable odor nuisance determination. An objectionable odor nuisance exists when an inspector, upon the receipt of a complaint, deter­mines that the odor exists in the following con­centrations: 

(1) 	
Odor is detectable in the ambient air after it is diluted with two or more volumes of odor-free air in areas on or adjacent to residential, recreational, institutional, re­tail sales, hotel or educational premises. 

(2) 	
Odor is detectable in the ambient air after it is diluted with 31 or more volumes of odor-free air in areas on or adjacent to industrial premises. 




(3) 	Odor is detectable in the ambient air after it is diluted with seven or more volumes of odor-free air in areas on or adjacent to premises other than those mentioned above. 
(d) 
Location where measurement to be taken. Any odor level measurements taken to arrive at a determination that an objectionable odor nui­sance exists shall be at or near locations where human activity takes place but on or beyond the property line of the source where the odor is emitted. 

(e) 
Two positive determinations required. For an objectionable odor nuisance to exist two posi­tive determinations must be made by the building official at the required dilution in any one-hour period and at intervals of not less than 15 min­utes. 

(f) 
Testing procedures. Odor measurements may be made by use of the scentometer; by odor panel; or by other procedures approved by the building official and generally accepted by persons knowl­edgeable in the state of the art. 

(g) 
Determination of compliance. In order to determine if a proposed facility will meet the limitations required by subsection (c) of this sec­tion, the ambient air odor concentration may be determined by the use of appropriate atmospheric diffusion estimates or any other suitable method as accepted by the building official from the estimates of odor concentration of the sources to be installed.

(c) The boarding permit issued pursuant to this section shall authorize the boarding or other securing of a building or structure for an initial period of six months. If the structure is still boarded at the end of the sixth-month period, the boarding permit may be renewed upon the sub­mission of a written application by the owner of the property or their authorized representative or contractor with the submission of the application occurring no later than 30 business days prior to the expiration of the original permit, upon the payment of the required fee and upon con.rma­tion through inspection by the city code enforce­ment officer that the boarding or other method of securing the building or structure has been done in compliance with this article.

(1) 	
The owner shall submit a detailed plan for correction, repair or rehabilitation of violations of state or local building and housing standards and for the securing of the doors, windows and other openings by the conventional method used in the orig­inal construction and design of the build­ing or structure or, alternatively, a de­tailed plan for the sale of the property to another person or entity with the provi­sion in the sale of correction, repair or rehabilitation; and

"Good cause" shall require a show­ing by the owner that the permit renewal is made necessary by conditions or events beyond the owner's control, such as inability to obtain .nanc­ing for repair or rehabilitation, inability to locate a suitable buyer, unanticipated delays in repair or rehabilitation, or unanticipated damage to the property. In addition, where appropriate, "good cause" shall also require a showing by the owner that the owner has exercised reasonable and due diligence in attempting to complete the needed repair, rehabilitation or correction or is attempt­ing to sell the property.

ARTICLE I. IN GENERAL 

Sec. 11-1. Big box development. 
(a) 
Defined. The term "big box," as used in this section, means any commercial, or office/commer­cial office building larger than 50,000 square feet. 

(b) 
Rental agreement for leased big box. For any leased big box, the owner shall provide a copy of the current rental, or proposed rental agree­ment between the tenant and the landlord to the city attorney's office. The rental agreement must contain the following provisions: 

(1) 	
The tenant could not voluntarily abandon or vacate the premises during the term of the lease; 

(2) 	
The tenant may not cease conducting re­tail business of some type as a permitted use within the zoning code of the city, chapter 23, upon the premises, or perform any other use which is not authorized by the zoning code, chapter 23. 



(c) 
Vacancy. No person, firm or corporation may continue to pay rent, or allow the building to be vacant, in order to prevent a business, which might be in competition with the previous busi­ness located upon the premises, from leasing the facility thus leaving the facility vacant. A vacant building shall not be re-leased to any person, firm or corporation that intends to leave the building vacant. If a building becomes vacant before a lease on the building expires, all provisions of this section are applicable during the remaining term of the lease including but not limited to the following: 


(1) 	If a tenant voluntarily vacates the pre­mises before the end of the lease term, the landlord is free to market and lease the premises to another business entity, with­out any covenant or restriction in the lease prohibiting them from leasing it to business potentially in competition with tenant's previous business on the prop­erty. 
(2) 	When any big box is vacant for more than one year, then the following action can be taken by the municipality: 
a. 	
A fine against the owner of the pre­mises not to exceed $20.00 per 1,000 square feet of floor space, the fine to be continuing on a monthly basis or so long as the premises is vacant; or 

b. 	
In lieu of a fine, the owner may allow the city's designated marketing en­tity, chamber of commerce, or other designated party to market the prop­erty for lease or sale; provided that the proposed rental value was not less than 80 percent below the mar­ket rent at the time the premises became vacant; or in the event of a sale, provided that the fair market value of the sale would not be less than 80 percent of the current ap­praised value. Proceeds from any rent or sale would first satisfy any unpaid fines or assessments, or rea­sonable costs incurred by the City in marketing the premises for lease/ sale. 



(d) Applicability. This section shall apply to all big box structures built within the last 30 years. This section will also immediately apply to any new structures built after the date of adoption of the ordinance from which this section is derived. (Ord. No. 2006-12, § 2, 10-10-2006) 
Secs. 11-2—11-25. Reserved.

b. 	
Rebate of fee. Upon the disapproval of any application for which a fee has been submitted under the provisions of this chapter, the city clerk shall refund such fee, provided that the applicant is not otherwise indebted to the city.

(Code 1976, § 11-7; Ord. No. 1980-015, § 1(11­102(1), (2), (4)), 5-20-1980) 


Sec. 11-31. Limitations on license issuance.

Sec. 19-172. Purpose. 
The existence of real property which is main­tained in a blighted condition increases the bur­den of the state and local government by increas­ing the need for government services, including but not limited to social services, public safety services, and code enforcement services.

In recognition of the need for enhanced govern­ment services and in order to encourage private property owners to maintain their real property and the buildings, structures and improvements thereon in good condition and repair, and as an incentive to encourage community redevelop­ment, a community redevelopment tax incentive program is hereby established as authorized by Article IX, Section II, Paragraph VII(d) of the 1983 Constitution of the State of Georgia.

Sec. 19-174. Ad valorem tax increase on blighted property. 
(a) 
There is hereby levied on all real property within the city which has been officially identi.ed as maintained in a blighted condition an in­creased ad valorem tax by applying a factor of seven to the millage rate applied to the property, so that such property shall be taxed at a higher millage rate generally applied in the municipal­ity, or otherwise provided by general law; pro­vided, however, real property on which there is situated a dwelling house which is being occupied as the primary residence of one or more persons shall not be subject to official identi.cation as maintained in a blighted condition and shall not be subject to increased taxation. 

(b) 
Such increased ad valorem tax shall be applied and re.ected in the .rst tax bill rendered following official designation of a real property as blighted. 

(c) 
Revenues arising from the increased rate of ad valorem taxation shall, upon receipt, be segre­gated by the city manager and used only for community redevelopment purposes, as identi.ed in an approved urban redevelopment program, including defraying the cost of the city's program to close, repair, or demolish un.t building and structures. (Ord. No. 2015O-02, § 1, 6-9-2015) 


Sec. 19-175. Identi.cation of blighted prop­erty. 
(a) In order for a parcel of real property to be officially designated as maintained in a blighted condition and subject to increased taxation, the following steps must be completed: 
(1) 	
An inspection must be performed on the parcel of property. In order for an inspec­tion to be performed; 

a. 	
A request may be made by the public officer or by at least .ve residents of the city for inspection of a parcel of property, said inspection to be based on the criteria as delineated in arti­cle, or 

b. 	
The public officer may cause a sur­vey of existing housing conditions to be performed, or may refer to any such survey conducted or .nalized within the previous .ve years, to locate or identify any parcels which may be in a blighted condition and for which a full inspection should be conducted to determine if that parcel of property meets the criteria set out in this article for designation as be­ing maintained in a blighted condi­tion. 



(2) 	
A written inspection report of the .ndings for any parcel of property inspected pur­suant to subsection (1) above shall be prepared and submitted to the public of­.cer. Where feasible, photographs of the conditions found to exist on the property on the date of inspection shall be made and supplement the inspection report. Where compliance with minimum construc­tion, housing, occupancy, .re and life safety codes in effect within the city are in ques­tion, the inspection shall be conducted by a certi.ed inspector possessing the requi­site quali.cations to determine minimal code compliance. 

(3) 	
Following completion of the inspection report, the public officer shall make a determination in writing, that a property 


is maintained in a blighted condition, as de.ned by this article, and is subject to increased taxation. 
(4) 	The public officer shall cause a written notice of his determination that the real property at issue is being maintained in a blighted condition to be served upon the person(s) shown on the most recent tax digest of Polk County as responsible for payment of ad valorem taxes assessed thereon; provided, however, where through the existence of reasonable diligence it becomes known to the public officer that real property has been sold or conveyed since publication of the most recent tax digest, written notice shall be given to the person(s) known or reasonably believed to then own the property or be chargeable with the payment of ad valorem taxes thereon, at the best address available. Service by certi.ed mail or statutory over­night delivery, return receipt requested, to all interested parties whose identities and addresses are readily ascertainable and by .rst-class mail to the property address shall constitute sufficient notice to the property's owner or person charge­able with the payment of ad valorem taxes for purpose of this section, even if no one picks up or signs for the certi.ed or overnight delivery of the notice, or the notice is returned unclaimed, undeliver­able, or for any such reason. Posting of the notice on the property will not be re­quired, but may also constitute sufficient service if the city is unable to perfect service by using the mail methods set forth above. 

(b) The written notice given to the person(s) chargeable with the payment of ad valorem taxes shall notify such person of the public officer's determination the real property is being main­tained in a blighted condition and shall advise such person of the hours and location at which the person may inspect and copy the public officer's determination and any supporting documenta­tion. Persons noti.ed that real property of which the person(s) is chargeable with the payment of ad valorem taxes shall have 30 days from the receipt of notice in which to request a hearing before the city's municipal court. Written request for hearing shall be .led with the public officer and shall be dated stamped upon receipt. Upon receipt of a request for hearing, the public officer shall notify the municipal court and the building inspector or person who performed the inspection and prepared the inspection report. 
(c) 
Within 30 days of the receipt of a request for hearing, the municipal court clerk shall set a date, time and location for the hearing and shall give at least ten business days' notice to the person(s) requesting the hearing, the public offi­cer and the building inspector or person who performed the inspection and prepared the inspec­tion report. Notice of scheduled hearings shall be published as a legal advertisement in The Polk County Standard Journal, or other designated legal organ in Polk County, at least .ve days prior to the hearing. Hearings may be continued by the municipal court judge upon request of any party, for good cause. 

(d) 
At the hearing, the public officer shall have the burden of demonstrating by a preponderance of the evidence that the subject property is main­tained in a blighted condition, as de.ned by this article. The municipal court judge shall cause a record of the evidence submitted at the hearing to be maintained. Upon hearing from the public officer and/or their witnesses and the person(s) requesting the hearing and/or their witnesses, the judge of municipal court shall make a determina­tion either affirming or reversing the determina­tion of the public officer. The determination shall be in writing and copies thereof shall be served on the parties by certi.ed mail or statutory over­night delivery. The determination by the court shall be deemed .nal. A copy of such determina­tion shall also be served upon the tax commis­sioner of Polk County, who shall include the increased tax on the next regular tax bill ren­dered on behalf of the city. 

(e) 
Persons aggrieved by the determination of the court affirming the determination of the pub­lic officer may petition the Superior Court of Polk County for a writ of certiorari within 30 days of issuance of the court's written determination. (Ord. No. 2015O-02, § 1, 6-9-2015) 


Sec. 19-176. Remediation or redevelopment. 
(a) 
A property owner or person(s) who is charge­able with the payment of ad valorem taxes on real property which has been officially designated pur­suant to this article as maintained in a blighted condition may petition the public officer to lift the designation, upon proof of compliance with the following: 

(1) 	
Completion of work required under a plan of remedial action or redevelopment ap­proved by the city's planning and devel­opment director which addresses the con­ditions of blight found to exist on or within the property, including compliance with all applicable minimum codes; or 

(2) 	
Completion of work required under a court order entered in a proceeding brought pursuant to article IV, nuisances, of chap­ter 10 of the Code of Rockmart, Georgia. 



(b) 
Before action on a petition to lift the desig­nation, the public officer shall cause the property to be thoroughly inspected by a building inspector who, by written inspection report, shall certify that all requisite work has been performed to applicable code in a workmanlike manner, in accordance with the speci.cations of the plan of remedial action or redevelopment, or applicable court order. Upon .nding required work to be satisfactorily performed, the public officer shall issue a written determination that the real prop­erty is no longer maintained in a blighted condi­tion. Copies of this determination shall be served upon the person(s) chargeable with the payment of ad valorem taxes, and upon the tax commis­sioner of Polk County. 

(c) 
All plans for remedial action or redevelop­ment shall be in writing, signed by the person(s) chargeable with the payment of ad valorem taxes on the real property and the director of the city's planning and development department, and con­tain the following: 


(1) 	The plan shall be consistent with the city's comprehensive plan and all laws and ordinances governing the subject prop­erty, and shall conform to any urban re­development plan adopted for the area within which the property lies; 
(2) 	
The plan shall set forth in reasonable detail the requirements for repair, clo­sure, demolition, or restoration of existing structures, in accordance with minimal statewide codes; where structures are de­molished, the plan shall include provi­sions for debris removal, stabilization and landscaping of the property; 

(3) 	
On parcels of .ve acres or greater, the plan shall address the relationship to lo­cal objectives respecting land uses, im­proved traffic, public transportation, pub­lic utilities, recreational and community facilities, and other public improvements; 

(4) 	
The plan shall contain veri.able funding sources which will be used to complete its requirements and show the feasibility thereof; 

(5) 	
The plan shall contain a timetable for completion of required work; and 

(6) 	
Any outstanding ad valorem taxes (state, school, county, and city, including the in­creased tax pursuant to this article) and governmental liens due and payable on the property must be satis.ed in full. 



(Ord. No. 2015O-02, § 1, 6-9-2015) 
Sec. 19-177. Decrease of tax rate. 
(a) Real property which has had its designa­tion as maintained in a blighted condition re­moved by the public officer, as provided in this article, shall be eligible for a decrease in the rate of city ad valorem taxation by applying a factor of 
0.5 to the city millage rate applied to the property, so that such property shall be taxed at a lower millage rate than the millage rate generally ap­plied in the municipality or otherwise provided by general law; such decreased rate of taxation shall be applied beginning with the next tax bill ren­dered following removal of official designation of a real property as blighted. The decreased rate of taxation may be given in successive years, depend­ing on the amount of cost expended by the per-son(s) chargeable with payment of ad valorem taxes on the property to satisfy its remediation or redevelopment, with every $25,000.00 or portion thereof equaling one year of tax reduction; pro­vided, however, that no property shall be entitled to reduction in city ad valorem taxes for more than four successive years. 
(b) In order to claim entitlement for a de­creased rate of taxation, the person(s) chargeable with payment of ad valorem taxes on the property shall submit a notarized affidavit to the public officer, supported by receipts or other evidence of payment, of the amount expended. (Ord. No. 2015O-02, § 1, 6-9-2015) 
Sec. 19-178. Notice to tax commissioner. 
It shall be the duty of the public officer to notify the tax commissioner of Polk County in writing as to designation or removal of designation of a speci.c property as maintained in a blighted condition. Such notice shall identify the speci.c property by street address and tax map, block and parcel number, as assigned by the Polk County Tax Assessor's Office. The public officer shall cooperate with the tax commissioner to assure accurate tax billing of those properties subject to increased or reduced ad valorem taxation under this article. (Ord. No. 2015O-02, § 1, 6-9-2015)

Secs. 20-1—20-25. Reserved. 
ARTICLE II. TELECOMMUNICATIONS 
ANTENNAS AND TOWERS 


Sec. 20-26. Purpose of article. 
This article is designed and intended to bal­ance the interests of the residents of the city, telecommunications providers, and telecommuni­cations customers in the siting of telecommunica­tions facilities within the city so as to protect the health, safety and integrity of residential neigh­borhoods and foster, through appropriate zoning and land use controls, a competitive environment for telecommunications carriers that does not unreasonably discriminate among providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless services and shall not prohibit or have the effect of prohib­iting the provision of personal wireless services, and so as to promote the city as a proactive city in the availability of personal wireless telecommu­nications service. To that end, this article shall: 
(1) 	
Provide for the appropriate location and development of telecommunications facil­ities in the city; 

(2) 	
Protect the city's structures and natural environment by promoting compatible de­sign standards for telecommunications fa­cilities; 

(3) 	
Minimize adverse visual impacts of tele­communications facilities through careful design, siting, landscape screening and innovative camouflaging techniques; 

(4) 	
Avoid potential damage to adjacent prop­erties from towers or antennas failure through engineering and careful siting of telecommunications tower structures and antennas; 

(5) 	
Maximize use of any new and existing telecommunications towers so as to mini­mize the need to construct new towers and minimize the total number of towers throughout the city; 


(6) 	
Maximize and encourage the use of alter­native telecommunication tower struc­tures as a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use tow­ers; and 

(7) 	
Encourage and promote the location of new telecommunications facilities in ar­eas which are not zoned for residential use. 



(Ord. No. 4-2006, § I, 2-14-2006) 
Sec. 20-27. Definitions. 
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Accessory structures means any structures or components used in direct support of a telecom­munications facility. 
Antenna means any exterior apparatus de­signed for the sending and/or receiving of electro­magnetic waves for telephonic, radio, television, or personal wireless services. For the purposes of this article the term "antenna" does not include any tower and antenna under 30 feet in total height which is owned and operated by an ama­teur radio operator licensed by the Federal Com­munications Commission, any device designed for over-the-air reception of radio or television broad­cast signals, multichannel multipoint distribu­tion service or direct broadcast satellite service, or any cable television headed or hub towers and antennas used solely for cable television services. 
Building official means the Ordinance and Code Enforcement Officerof the city. 
Governing body means the city council. 

Macro telecommunications facilities means those telecommunications facilities which are located on existing buildings, poles or other existing sup­port structures and which project more than three feet above the top of the structure but not more than ten feet above the roof line, parapet or top of the structure. Macro telecommunication facilities may exceed the height limitation specified for the zoning district. 
Micro telecommunications facilities means those telecommunications facilities which are located on existing buildings, poles or other existing sup­port structures where antennas do not project more than three feet above the top of the struc­ture and there are no more than six antennas per site. 
Monopole tower means a telecommunications tower consisting of a single pole, constructed without guy wires or ground anchors. 
Telecommunications facilities refers to anten­nas and towers, either individually or together. 
Tower means a structure, such as a lattice tower, guy tower, or monopole tower, constructed as a freestanding structure or in association with a building, other permanent structure or equip­ment, on which is located one or more antennas intended for transmitting or receiving analog, digital, microwave, cellular, telephone, personal wireless service or similar forms of electronic communication. The term "tower" includes micro­wave towers, common carrier towers, and cellular telephone towers. (Ord. No. 4-2006, § II, 2-14-2006) 
Sec. 20-28. Exclusions. 
The following shall be exempt from the provi­sions of this article: 
(1) 	
Any tower and antenna under 30 feet in total height which is owned and operated by an amateur radio operator licensed by the Federal Communications Commis­sion; 

(2) 	
Any device designed for over-the-air re­ception of television broadcast signals, multichannel multipoint distribution ser­vice or direct broadcast satellite service; or 

(3) 	
Any telecommunications facilities located on property owned, leased or otherwise controlled by the city provided a license or lease authorizing the telecommunications facility has been approved by the city council; or 


(4) 	Any cable television headend or hub tow­ers and antennas used solely for cable television services. 
(Ord. No. 4-2006, § III, 2-14-2006) 
Sec. 20-29. Placement of telecommunications facilities by zoning district. 
(a) 
In I-1, I-2 and I-3 zoning districts, micro and macro telecommunications facilities shall be allowed as a use by right. Telecommunications towers designed and intended to accommodate at least one user are permitted as a use of right up to a height of 80 feet following design review by and receipt of a building permit from the building official. Telecommunications towers designed and intended to accommodate at least two users are permitted as a use of right up to a height of 100 feet following design review by and receipt of a building permit from the building official. Tele­communications towers designed and intended to accommodate at least three users are permitted as a use of right up to a height of 120 feet following design review by and receipt of a build­ing permit from the building official. 

(b) 
No telecommunications facilities shall be permitted in any residential areas. 

(c) 
Telecommunications facilities outside the guidelines listed above may only be built after approval of a variance. (Ord. No. 4-2006, § IV, 2-14-2006) 


Sec. 20-30. Co-location. 
(a) Use of existing towers, buildings, etc., com­pensation. All applicants shall make a reasonable attempt to co-locate on existing towers, buildings, or other tall structures. Furthermore, applicants shall be willing to allow other uses to co-locate on the proposed tower site in the future, subject to engineering and feasibility factors, frequency con­siderations, and proper compensation from the additional user. Such compensation shall be de­termined from average lease rates paid by the applicant for comparable co-location sites in the county and contiguous counties, to be provided by the applicant. Such information shall, however, remain confidential and shall not be disclosed by any city official. 
(b) Preferred location sites. 
(1) 	
Co-location sites. Any existing telecommu­nications towers currently being used for transmitting or receiving analog, digital, microwave, cellular, telephone, personal wireless service or similar forms of elec­tronic communication shall be a preferred location site regardless of the underlying zoning designation of the site, provided, however, that locations which meet this criteria shall be subject to the design and siting components of this article and co-location sites shall not become an an­tenna farm or otherwise be deemed by the building official or the city council to be visually obtrusive. 

(2) 	
Publicly used structures. Publicly used structures are preferred locations through­out the city because they appear in virtu­ally all neighborhoods, are dispersed throughout the city, and due to their in­stitutional or infrastructure uses are gen­erally similar in appearance to or readily adaptable for telecommunications facili­ties. Therefore, telecommunications facil­ities should be less noticeable when placed on publicly used structures than when placed on commercial or residential struc­tures. Publicly used structures include, but are not limited to, facilities such as police or fire stations, libraries, commu­nity centers, civic centers, courthouses, utility structures, water towers, schools, hospitals, clock or bell towers, light poles and churches. 

(3) 	
Industrial and commercial structures. Wholly industrial and commercial struc­tures such as warehouses, factories, retail outlets, supermarkets, banks, garages, or service stations shall be preferred loca­tions particularly where existing visual obstructions or clutter on the roof or along a roof line can and will be removed as part of the installation of the telecommunica­tions facility. 

(4) 	
Mixed use buildings in high density dis­tricts. Mixed use buildings (housing above commercial or other nonresidential space) are also preferred location sites. 



(c) Disfavored location sites. Any single-family, multifamily, or neighborhood commercial struc­ture or site shall be disfavored sites for the location of telecommunications facilities. (Ord. No. 4-2006, § V, 2-14-2006) 
Sec. 20-31. Requirements for telecommuni­cations facilities. 
(a) Standards governing location and construc­tion. The requirements set forth in this section shall govern the location and construction of all telecommunications facilities governed by this article. 
(1) 	Building codes and safety standards. To ensure the structural integrity of telecom­munications facilities, the owner of a tele­communications facility shall ensure that it is maintained in compliance with stan­dards contained in applicable local build­ing codes and the applicable standards for such telecommunications facilities, as amended from time to time. Owners of telecommunications facilities shall con­duct periodic inspections of such facilities at least once every year to ensure struc­tural integrity. Inspections shall be con­ducted by a qualified, independent engi­neer licensed to practice in the state. The results of such inspection shall be pro­vided to the building official, within 30 days after the inspection. Failure to pro­vide said reports could result in the revo­cation of any permits or licenses previ­ously granted to the owner by the city. 
(2) 	Regulatory compliance. 
a. 	All telecommunications facilities must meet or exceed current standards and regulations of the FAA, the FCC and any other agency of the state or federal government with the author­ity to regulate telecommunications facilities. If such standards and reg­ulations are changed, then the own­ers of the telecommunications facili­ties governed by this article shall bring such telecommunications facil­ities into compliance with such re­vised standards and regulations within the date established by the agency promulgating the standards or regulations. 

b. 	Owners of telecommunications facil­ities shall provide documentation showing that each telecommunica­tions facility is in compliance with all applicable federal and state re­quirements. Evidence of compliance must be submitted every 12 months to the building official. Failure to provide this information could result in revocation of any permit or license previously granted to the owner by the city. 
(3) 	
Security. All telecommunications facili­ties shall be equipped with an appropriate anticlimbing device or other similar pro­tective device to prevent unauthorized access to the telecommunications facility. 

(4) 	
Lighting. No illumination is permitted on telecommunications facilities unless re­quired by the FCC, FAA or other state or federal agency of competent jurisdiction or unless necessary for air traffic safety. If lighting is required or necessary, the build­ing official may review the available light­ing alternatives and approve the design that would cause the least disturbance to the surrounding uses and views. 

(5) 	
Advertising. No advertising is permitted on telecommunications facilities. 


(6) 	Visual impact. 
a. 	
Telecommunications facilities shall either maintain a galvanized steel finish or, subject to any applicable standards of the FAA or other appli­cable federal or state agency, be painted a neutral color or painted and/or textured to match the exist­ing structure so as to reduce visual obtrusiveness. 

b. 	
If an antenna is installed on a struc­ture other than a tower, the antenna and associated electrical and mechan­ical equipment must be of a neutral color that is identical to, or closely 


compatible with, the color of the sup­porting structure so as to make the antenna and related equipment as visually unobtrusive as possible. Roof-mounted antennas shall be made visually unobtrusive by screening to match existing air conditioning units, stairs, elevator towers or other back­ground. 
c. 	
Where feasible, telecommunications facilities should be placed directly above, below or incorporated with vertical design elements of a build­ing to help in camouflaging. 

d. 	
Telecommunications facilities shall not be placed in a direct line of sight with historic structures as desig­nated by the city council or by any state or federal law or agency. 

e. 	
Any equipment shelter or cabinet that supports telecommunications fa­cilities must be concealed from pub­lic view, made compatible with the architecture of the surrounding struc­tures, or placed underground. Equip­ment shelters or cabinets shall be screened from public view by using landscaping or materials and colors consistent with the surrounding back­drop. The shelter or cabinet must be regularly maintained by the owner of the telecommunications facility. 


(7) 	Landscaping. 
a. 	
Landscaping shall be used to effec­tively screen the view of the telecom­munications facility from adjacent public ways, public property and res­idential property, to the extent fea­sible. 

b. 	
Native vegetation on the site shall be preserved to the greatest practi­cal extent. The applicant shall pro­vide a site plan showing any existing significant vegetation to be removed, and vegetation to be replanted to replace that which is removed. 

c. 	
The city council may waive or modify the landscaping requirement where 


lesser requirements are desirable for adequate visibility for security pur­poses, for continued operation of ex­isting bona fide agricultural or forest uses such as farms, nurseries and tree farms or where an antenna is placed on an existing structure. In certain locations where the visual impact of the tower would be mini­mal, such as remote agricultural or rural locations or developed heavy industrial areas, the landscaping re­quirement may be modified or waived in the discretion of the city council. 
(8) 	Maintenance impacts. Equipment at a transmission facility shall be automated to the greatest extent possible to reduce traffic and congestion. Where the site abuts or has access to a collector or local street, access for maintenance vehicles shall be exclusively by means of the col­lector or local street. 
(9) 	
Principal, accessory and joint uses. 

a. 	
Accessory structures used in direct support of a telecommunications fa­cility shall be allowed but not be used for offices, vehicle storage or other outdoor storage. Mobile or im­mobile equipment not used in direct support of a telecommunications fa­cility shall not be stored or parked on the site of the telecommunica­tions facility. 

b. 	
Telecommunications facilities may be located on sites containing another principal use in the same buildable area. 



(10) 	
Lot size and setbacks. 


a. 	The following setback requirements shall apply to all telecommunica­tions facilities, provided however, that the city council may reduce the stan­dard setback requirements of this section if the goals of this article would be better served thereby: 
1. 	Telecommunications towers must be set back a distance equal to 11/2 times the height of the tower from any off-site res­idential structure. 
2. 	
Towers, guy wires and acces­sory facilities must satisfy the minimum zoning district set­back requirements. 

3. 	
Telecommunications facilities must be setback from any prop­erty line a sufficient distance to protect adjoining property from the potential impact of telecom­munications facility failure by being large enough to accommo­date such failure on the site, based on the engineer's analy­sis required in section 20-32. 


b. 	For antennas attached to the roof or a supporting structure on a rooftop, a 1:1 setback ratio (example: ten-foot high antenna and supporting struc­ture requires a ten-foot setback from edge of roof) shall be maintained unless an alternative placement is shown to reduce visual impact and said placement is approved by the building official. 
(b) Towers; site development and location. 
(1) 	
Site location and development shall pre­serve the existing character of the sur­rounding buildings and land uses and the zoning district as much as possible. Per­sonal wireless telecommunications towers shall be integrated through location and design to blend in with existing character­istics of the site to the extent practical. 

(2) 	
Existing on-site vegetation shall be pre­served or improved, and disturbance of the existing topography shall be mini­mized, unless such disturbance would re­sult in less visual impact of the site to the surrounding area. 

(3) 	
At a tower site the design of the buildings and related structures shall, to the extent possible, use materials, colors, textures, 



screening, and landscaping that will blend the tower and related facilities to the natural setting and built environment. 
(4) 	
Towers shall not be located any closer than 1,500 feet from an existing tower unless technologically required or visu­ally preferable. 

(5) 	
When a tower is adjacent to any structure and located on the ground, it must be set back from the nearest structure a dis­tance at least equal to 11/2 times its total height. 

(6) 	
In no case shall a tower be located in the required front yard, back yard or side yard in a residential district. 

(7) 	
Towers shall not be placed where they will negatively affect historic districts or build­ings as designated by the city council or any state or federal law or agency or where they will create visual clutter. 

(8) 	
Towers shall be enclosed by opaque or solid decay-resistant security fencing not less than six feet in height and shall be equipped with an appropriate anticlimb­ing device or other similar protective de­vice designed to prevent tower access. 

(9) 	
Placement of more than one tower on a lot shall be permitted, provided all setback, design, landscape, and placement require­ments are met as to each tower. Struc­tures may be located as close to each other as technically feasible, provided tower fail­ure characteristics of the towers on the site will not lead to multiple failures in the event that one fails. 

(10) 	
The city council shall have the discretion to waive the requirements of this subsec­tion where exact compliance would inter­fere with the function or purpose of a tower, or where compliance would place an unreasonable burden on an owner.

b. 	If the applicant does not know spe­cific future tower and antenna site locations but does know of areas where telecommunications facilities may be needed within the next five years to provide service, the appli­cant shall list the assessor's map and parcel numbers contained within the anticipated geographic service area and identify each geographic service area with a number that will correspond to the future telecommu­nication facility site. 
(3) 	Additional information requirements for towers. 
a. 	
If the proposed site is zoned R-1 through R-7 or C-1 through C-3 or O-1, and there are alternative sites in I-1, I-2 or I-3, applicants must justify why those alternate sites have not been proposed. The building of­ficial will review with special care justifications that appeal only to un­due expense and/or to undue difficul­ties in entering into a lease agree­ment. The building official shall carefully weigh such claims, and the evidence presented in favor of them, against a project's negative impact at the proposed site. 

b. 	
Applicants must identify all existing towers and all towers for which there are applications currently on file with the building official. Applicants must provide evidence of the lack of space on all suitable existing towers to locate the proposed antenna and of the lack of space on existing tower sites to construct a tower for the proposed antenna. If co-location on any such towers would result in less visual impact than the visual impact of the proposed tower, applicants must justify why such co-location is not being proposed. If co-location on any 


such tower would increase negative visual impact, then the applicant must so state and demonstrate. The building official will review with spe­cial care justifications that appeal only to undue expense and/or to un­due difficulties in entering into a lease agreement. The building offi­cial shall carefully weigh such claims, and the evidence presented in favor of them, against a project's negative impacts at the proposed site. 
c. 	
In all zones, applicants must demon­strate that they cannot provide per­sonal wireless communication ser­vice without the use of a telecommunications tower. 

d. 	
The applicant shall quantify the ad­ditional tower capacity anticipated, including the approximate number and types of antennas. The appli­cant shall provide a drawing for each tower showing existing and pro­posed antenna locations. The appli­cant shall also describe any limita­tions on the ability of the tower to accommodate other uses, e.g., radio frequency interference, mass height, frequency or other characteristics. The applicant shall describe the tech­nical options available to overcome those limitations and reasons why the technical options considered were not chosen to be incorporated. The building official shall approve those limitations if they cannot be over­come by reasonable technical means. 

e. 	
The applicant must provide a utili­ties inventory showing the locations of all water, sewage, drainage and power lines impacting the proposed tower site. 


(4) 	Information for review considerations. The applicant must provide any other informa­tion which may be requested by the build­ing official to fully evaluate and review the application and the potential impact of a proposed telecommunications facility. 
(b) Expedited review for building permits only. When a telecommunications facility will be a use as of right pursuant to section 20-29 and requires only a building permit and design review before it may be erected, the building official will attempt to expedite the review of the application and render a decision on the application within 15 business days after receipt of a complete applica­tion. 
(c) Special use permits. 
(1) 	
A request for a special use permit shall be initiated by application to the building official and handled in accordance with this section. The planning commission may issue a special use permit under this section provided it shall have determined that all of the requirements of section 20-31 have been satisfied and, further, that the benefits of and need for the proposed tower are greater than any pos­sible depreciating effects and damage to the neighboring properties. 

(2) 	
In granting a special use permit, the plan­ning commission may impose additional zoning conditions to the extent deter­mined necessary to buffer or otherwise minimize adverse effects of the proposed tower or antenna on surrounding proper­ties. 


(d) Variances. 
(1) 	
An applicant may seek a variance from the terms of this article after the building official informs him that the proposed site, tower, or any other matter is not in conformity with this article, by filing a written application for a variance with the planning commission. Said applica­tion shall contain all of the basic informa­tion required by this section for regular applications, as well as the basis for the variance. 

(2) 	
When an application for a variance is submitted the building official shall place or cause to be placed, a sign on the prop­erty where the facility is to be placed notifying the public of the application. In addition, a notice of the planning commis­


sion meeting shall be published once a week for two weeks prior to said meeting at which the variance is to be considered. The planning commission shall receive evidence and make a recommendation to grant or deny the variance to the city council, which shall proceed to consider the application at the next available meet­ing, but no sooner than ten days after the decision of the planning commission. All proceedings and decisions of either body shall be supported by substantial evi­dence in a written record. Any parties aggrieved by a decision of either the plan­ning commission or city council shall have the right to appeal as set forth in section 20-34. 
(3) 	In considering a variance, both the plan­ning commission and city council shall consider, but not be limited by the stan­dards contained in section 7.11 of appen­dix A, zoning. 

(Ord. No. 4-2006, § VII, 2-14-2006) 
Sec. 20-33. Co-location of future personal wireless technology. 
Applicant and owner shall allow other future personal wireless service companies, including public and quasi-public agencies, using function­ally equivalent personal wireless technology to co-locate antennas, equipment and facilities on a telecommunications facility unless specific tech­nical constraints prohibit said co-location. Appli­cant and other personal wireless carriers shall provide a mechanism for the construction and maintenance of shared facilities and infrastruc­ture and shall provide for equitable sharing of costs in accordance with industry standards. (Ord. No. 4-2006, § VIII, 2-14-2006) 
Sec. 20-34. Appeals. 
Appeals from any decision of the building offi­cial may be taken by any person aggrieved or any official of the city affected by the decision of the building official. Such appeal shall be to the planning commission pursuant to section 7.11 of appendix A, zoning. Appeals from any decision of the planning commission may be taken by any person aggrieved or any official of the city affected by the decision of the planning commission and shall be to the city council in accordance with the above-referenced sections. Appeals from any deci­sion of the council shall be made to the superior court within 30 days of the decision. Any decision by the building official or by the planning com­mission denying a request to place, construct or modify a telecommunications facility shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence in a written record. Any decision by the council denying or approving a request to place, construct or modify a telecommunications facility shall be in writing and supported by substantial evidence in a written record. (Ord. No. 4-2006, § IX, 2-14-2006) 
Sec. 20-35. Nuisances. 
Telecommunications facilities, including, with­out limitation, power source, ventilation and cool­ing, shall be operated at all times so as not to create excessive or unreasonable noise levels. In addition, such facilities shall not be operated so as to cause the generation of heat that adversely affects a building occupant, and shall not be maintained or operated in such a manner as to be a nuisance. (Ord. No. 4-2006, § X, 2-14-2006) 
Sec. 20-36. Removal of antennas and tow­ers. 
All telecommunications facilities shall be main­tained in compliance with standards contained in applicable building and technical codes so as to ensure the structural integrity of such facilities. If upon inspection by the building official any such telecommunications facility is determined not to comply with the code standards or to constitute a danger to persons or property, then upon notice being provided to the owner of the facility and the owner of the property if such owner is different, such owner shall have 30 days to bring such facility into compliance. In the event such tele­communications facility is not brought into com­pliance within 30 days, the city may provide notice to the owners requiring the telecommuni­cations facility to be removed. In the event such telecommunications facility is not removed within 30 days of receipt of such notice, the city may remove such facility and place a lien upon the property for the costs of removal. Delay by the city in taking action shall not in any way waive the city's right to take action. The city may pursue all legal remedies available to it to ensure that telecommunications facilities not in compliance with code standards or which constitute a danger to persons or property are brought into compli­ance or removed. The city may seek to have the telecommunications facility removed regardless of the owner's or operator's intent to operate the tower or antenna and regardless of any permits, federal, state or otherwise, which may have been granted. (Ord. No. 4-2006, § XI, 2-14-2006) 
Sec. 20-37. Abandoned towers. 
(a) 
Any telecommunications facility that is not operated for a continuous period of 12 months shall be considered abandoned, whether or not the owner or operator intends to make use of all or any part of it. The owner of a telecommunica­tions facility and the owner of the property where the facility is located shall be under a duty to remove the abandoned telecommunications facil­ity. If such antenna and/or tower is not removed within 60 days of receipt of notice from the city notifying the owner of such abandonment, the city may remove such tower and/or antenna and place a lien upon the property for the costs of removal. The city may pursue all legal remedies available to it to insure that abandoned telecommunica­tions facilities are removed. Delay by the city in taking action shall not in any way waive the city's right to take action. The city may seek to have the telecommunications facility removed regardless of the owner's or operator's intent to operate the tower or antenna and regardless of any permits, federal, state or otherwise, which may have been granted. 

(b) 
If the owner of an abandoned tower or antenna wishes to use such abandoned tower or antenna, the owner first must apply for and receive all applicable permits and meet all of the conditions of this article as if such tower or antenna were a new tower or antenna. (Ord. No. 4-2006, § XII, 2-14-2006) 


Sec. 20-38. Preexisting towers/nonconform­ing uses. 
(a) All telecommunications facilities operative on the effective date of this article shall be al­lowed to continue their present usage as a non­conforming use and shall be treated as a noncon­forming use in accordance with section 3.7 of appendix A, zoning. Routine maintenance, includ­ing replacement of a new tower or antenna of like construction and height, shall be permitted on such existing telecommunications facilities. New construction other than routine maintenance shall comply with the requirements of this article. 
(b) 
A telecommunications facility that has re­ceived city approval as of the effective date of this article in the form of either a building permit or special use exception, but has not yet been con­structed or placed in operation shall be consid­ered an existing telecommunications facility so long as such approval is current and not expired. 

(c) 
Placement of an antenna on a nonconform­ing structure shall not be considered an expan­sion of the nonconforming structure. (Ord. No. 4-2006, § XIII, 2-14-2006) 


Sec. 20-39. Penalty for violation of article. 
(a) 
Any person who attempts to erect or erects a telecommunications facility covered by this ar­ticle without having first obtained the necessary building permit, special use permit or variance in the manner provided in this article shall be deemed in violation of this article. Any responsible party or other persons convicted by a court of competent jurisdiction of violating any provision of this arti­cle shall be guilty of violating a duly adopted ordinance of the city and shall be punished either by a fine not to exceed $1,000.00 or by imprison­ment not to exceed 12 months, or both. The court shall have the power and authority to place any person guilty of a violation of this article on probation and to suspend or modify any fine or sentence. As a condition of such suspension, the court may require payment of restitution or im­pose other punishment allowed by law. 

(b) 
If any structure is erected, constructed, reconstructed, altered, repaired, converted or main­tained in violation of this article or without ob­taining the required permits, or if any building, structure or land is used in violation of this article, the city attorney, in addition to any other remedies, may institute proceedings in municipal court to prevent or enjoin such unlawful erection, construction, reconstruction, alteration, conver­


sion, maintenance or use or to correct or abate such violations. Each and every day such unlaw­ful erection, construction, reconstruction, alter­ation, conversion, maintenance or use continues may be deemed a separate offense, for purposes of assessing fines and/or other penalties. (Ord. No. 4-2006, § XIV, 2-14-2006) 
Sec. 20-40. Coordination with federal law. 
Whenever the city council finds that the appli­cation of this article would unreasonably discrim­inate among providers of functionally equivalent personal wireless services or prohibit or have the effect of prohibiting the provision of personal wireless services, a conditional use permit waiv­ing any or all of the provisions of this article may be granted by the city council. (Ord. No. 4-2006, § XV, 2-14-2006) 
Sec. 20-41. Standards for decisions. 
In reviewing applications for permits or vari­ances submitted under this article, or appeals from decisions of the building official, planning commission, or city council, city officials shall consider, but not limit themselves to, the follow­ing standards and factors: 
(1) 	
Aesthetic appeal of the proposed telecom­munications facility; 

(2) 	
Diminution in value of any adjoining prop­erty due to the placement of the proposed facility;

(2) 	
All newly installed or substantially im­proved irrigation systems, which use City of Rockmart Water System water shall be equipped with automatic timers with rain or soil moister [moisture] sensors that activate to prevent operation of those sys­tems while rain is falling and/or when soil moister [moisture] is adequate.

(e) 
Old building sewers may be used in connec­tion with new building only when they are found, on examination and test by the superintendent, to meet all of the requirements of this article. 

(f) 
The size, slope, alignment, materials of con­struction of a building sewer, and the methods to be used in construction shall all conform to the requirements of the building and plumbing code or other applicable rules and regulations of the county. In the absence of code provisions or in amplification thereof, the materials and proce­dures set forth in appropriate specifications of the American Society for Testing and Materials (ASTM) and Water Pollution Control Federation (WPCF) Manual of Practice No. 9 shall apply. Additionally, the following materials and methods shall apply to building sewers within the city supervision: 


(1) 	The building sewer shall be cast iron soil pipe, ASTM Specification A74, latest revi­sion, or equal; ductile iron pipe, American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Spec­ification A21.51, latest revision, or equal; or polyvinyl chloride (PVC) sewer pipe, ASTM Specification D3034, latest revi­sion. All joints shall be tight and water­proof. Any part of the building sewer that is located within ten feet of a water ser­vice pipe shall be constructed of cast iron soil pipe or ductile iron pipe with such bolted mechanical joints as may be re­quired by the superintendent where the sewer is exposed to damage by tree roots. If installed in filled or unstable ground, the building sewer shall be of cast iron soil pipe, except that plastic pipe may be acceptable if laid on a suitable concrete bed or cradle as approved by the superin­tendent. 

(2) 	
The size and slope of the building sewer shall be subject to the approval of the superintendent, but in no event shall the diameter be less than four inches. The slope of such four-inch pipe shall not be less than one-eighth inch per foot. Fur­thermore, the appropriate requirements of the Occupational Health and Safety Act (OSHA) shall be followed. 

(3) 	
The depth shall be sufficient to afford protection from frost, and the building sewer shall be laid at uniform grade and with straight alignment insofar as possi­ble. Changes in direction shall be made only with properly curved pipes and fit­tings. Building sewers shall not be placed in the same trench with water service lines. 

(4) 	
An excavation required for the installa­tion of a building sewer shall be open trench work unless otherwise approved by the superintendent. Pipe laying and backfill shall be performed in accordance with ASTM Specification C12, latest revi­sion, except that no backfill shall be placed until the work has been inspected and approved. 

(5) 	
Joints and connections. 

a. 	
All joints and connections shall be made gastight and watertight. Push-on joints for cast iron soil pipe shall have neoprene gaskets in ac­cordance with the requirements of ASTM C-564. 

b. 	
Push-on joints for ductile iron pipe shall also have neoprene gaskets and be installed according to the 




manufacturer's recommendations. PVC pipe joint material shall be of the bell and spigot type, sealed with a rubber O-ring gasket, having a composition and texture which is resistant to the common ingredients of sewage, industrial wastes (includ­ing oils), and groundwater, and which will endure permanently under the conditions likely to be imposed by this use. Installation of gaskets shall be done in accordance with the pipe manufacturer's instructions using all the necessary materials, lubricants, and equipment recommended by the manufacturer. 
c. 	Other jointing materials may be used only when approved by the superin­tendent. 
(6) 	The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be made at the "Y" branch, if such a branch is available at a suitable location. If the public sewer is 12 inches in diameter or less, and no prop­erly located "Y" branch is available, the city shall, at the owner's expense, cut a neat hole into the public sewer, with entry in the downstream direction at an angle of about 45 degrees, and install a 45­degree elbow with the spigot end cut so as not to extend past the inner surface of the public sewer. The invert of the building sewer at the point of connection shall be at an elevation of at least one-tenth foot above the invert of the public sewer. A neat smooth joint shall be made and the connection made secure and watertight by encasement in concrete. Special fit­tings may be used for the connection only when approved by the superintendent. 
(g) Whenever possible, the building sewer shall be brought to the building at an elevation below the basement floor. No building sewer shall be laid parallel to or within three feet of any bearing wall which might thereby be weakened. In all buildings in which any building drain is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary sewage carried by such building drain shall be lifted by an approved means and discharged to the building sewer. 
(h) 
No person shall make connection of roof downspouts, foundation drains, areaway drains, or other sources of surface runoff or groundwater to a building sewer or building drain which in turn is connected directly or indirectly to a public sanitary sewer unless such connection is ap­proved for purposes of disposal of polluted surface drainage. 

(i) 
The applicant for the building sewer permit shall notify the superintendent when the building sewer is ready for inspection and connection to the public sewer. The connection and testing shall be made under the supervision of the superinten­dent or his representative. 

(j) 
All excavations for building sewer installa­tion shall be adequately guarded with barricades and lights so as to protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways, and other public property disturbed in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the city. 

(k) 
The city will define the availability of sew­ers and any costs associated with sewer permits or construction. 

(l) 
The connections of the building sewer into the public sewer shall conform to the require­ments of the building and plumbing code or other applicable rules and regulations of the city or the procedures set forth in appropriate specifications of the ASTM and the WPCF Manual of Practice No. 9. All such connections shall be made gastight and watertight and verified by proper testing. Any deviation from the prescribed procedures and materials must be approved by the superinten­dent before installation. 

(m) 
If any house sewer permits the entrance of infiltration or inflow, the city may: 

(1) 	
Require the owner to repair the house sewer. 

(2) 	
Charge the owner a sewer rate that re­flects the costs of the additional expense of sewage treatment from the owner's property. 




(3) 	Require the owner to disconnect his sewer 

from the city sewer system. (Ord. No. 003-1998, art. 5, 4-14-1998)

(18) 
Any discharge that would result in the exceedance of ten percent of the lower explosive level (LEL) at the POTW. 


Wastes prohibited by this section shall not be processed or stored in such a manner that they could be discharged to the POTW. All floor drains located in process or materials storage areas must discharge to the industrial user's pretreatment facility before connecting with the POTW. 
(d) City options. If any waters or wastes are discharged or are proposed to be discharged to the public sewers, which waters contain the sub­stances or possess the characteristics enumerated above and which in the judgment of the city, may have a deleterious effect upon the wastewater facilities, processes, equipment, or receiving wa­ters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the city may: 
(1) 	
Reject the wastes; 

(2) 	
Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the public sew­ers; 

(3) 	
Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or 

(4) 	
Require a surcharge payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating the wastes. 


(e) 
Grease, oil, and sand interceptors. Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided when, in the opinion of the city, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing floatable grease in excessive amounts, sand, or other harmful ingredients; except that such inter­ceptors shall not be required for private living quarters or dwelling units. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the super­intendent and shall be located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. In the maintenance of these interceptors, the owner shall be responsible for the proper removal and disposal by appropriate means of the captured material and shall maintain records of the dates and means of disposal which are subject to review by the superintendent. Any removal and hauling of the collected materials not performed by owner's personnel must be performed by currently li­censed waste disposal firms. 

(f) 
Structure to facilitate the observation, sam­pling and measurement of wastes may be re­quired. When required by the city the owner of any property serviced by a building sewer carry­ing industrial wastes shall install a suitable struc­ture together with such necessary meters and other appurtenances in the building sewer to facilitate observation, sampling, and measure­ment of the wastes. Such structure, when re­quired, shall be accessibly and safely located and shall be constructed in accordance with approved plans. The structure shall be installed by the owner at his expense and shall be maintained by him so as to be safe and accessible at all times. This requirement will be on a case-by-case basis.

(7) 	
Details of systems to prevent and control the losses of materials through spills to the public sewer. 



(h) 
Special agreements between city and indus­trial concern. No statement contained in this article shall be construed as preventing any spe­cial agreement or arrangement between the city and any industrial concern whereby an industrial waste of unusual strength or character may be accepted by the city for treatment. 

(i) 
Standard methods. All measurements, tests, and analyses of the characteristics of waters and wastes to which reference is made in this article shall be determined in accordance with the latest edition of "Standard Methods for the Examina­tion of Water and Wastewater," published by the American Public Health Association. Sampling locations, times, durations, and frequencies are to be determined on an individual basis, subject to approval by the city. 

(j) 
Pretreatment of wastes. Persons discharg­ing industrial wastes into the sewerage system may be required to pretreat such wastes. Plans for all pretreatment facilities shall be approved by the superintendent or the state environmental protection division prior to construction. At the time written plans are submitted for approval, written maintenance plans shall also be submit­ted and approved by the superintendent. The facilities shall be allowed to operate only as long as they are maintained in accordance with the approved maintenance plans. Pretreatment re­quirements shall be determined on a case-by-case basis and shall include the following facilities as a minimum: 


(1) 	Neutralization. If plans are submitted for neutralization of strong acid or alkaline wastes, the plans shall include the neces­sary instrumentation and controls to as­sure compliance with the above regula­tion at all times. 

(2) 	
Equalization. Holding tanks or equaliza­tion basins shall be required ahead of the receiving manhole of the city sewerage system when deemed necessary by the superintendent to prevent peak flows that exceed the capacity of the system or that result in operational problems. 

(3) 	
Operation of facilities. All pretreatment facilities shall be operated and main­tained continuously in satisfactory and effective operation by the owner at his expense. 


(k) 
Waiver of requirements. There shall be no provision for the granting of variances for dis­charge of incompatible wastes. If a user begins to violate any of the provisions of this section, it shall be his responsibility to apply to the super­intendent who can issue a temporary permit along with a compliance schedule for the planning and construction of necessary treatment and pretreatment works. Each case will be carefully evaluated with respect to its effect on the waste­water treatment system and the environment prior to issuance of a temporary permit and compliance schedule. Any dilution of the waste­water by the user for the purpose of decreasing the concentrations of toxic materials shall be considered as a violation of this article. 

(l) 
Discontinuance of service for failure to com­ply. Failure to comply with the provisions of this article shall be cause for the discontinuance of sewer or water service to the offending person. The procedure shall be as follows: A written notice, signed by the superintendent, shall be delivered personally to the person then responsi­ble for the offending use, outlining the conditions of the wastes which violate the city ordinances. In the event that the person in charge will not accept the notice, it shall be conveyed by registered mail to the responsible person. The person notified shall have 24 hours from the time of receipt of the notice, either personally delivered or received by registered mail, to correct the offending condi­tions. If correction is not made or a request for extension is not received by the city within 24 


hours, it shall be mandatory that water or sewer service shall be discontinued to the offending person without further notice. If a request for an extension of time is received by the city within 24 hours of the above notice and if circumstances are such that, in the opinion of the superintendent, the best interest of the city would be served by extending the time for correction of the offending condition, then he may grant an extension of time up to a maximum limit of 30 days. 
(m) Responsibilities of the person discharging waste. It shall be the responsibility of the person discharging industrial waste into the city sewer­age system to: 
(1) 	
Build a control structure in the discharge line from his premises, immediately prior to the entrance of the discharge line into the city sewerage system, suitable for the sampling and measuring of wastes. Plans for this structure must be approved by the city. This requirement may be waived if deemed unnecessary by the city. In the event that no special manhole is required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. 

(2) 	
Contact the superintendent prior to oper­ation with changes which will materially alter the characteristics of the waste from the last prior sampling. 

(3) 	
Make timely, periodic payments to the city of surcharges for excessive loadings as detailed by the city.

Acids or chemicals damaging to sewer lines or treatment process are released into the public sewer causing rapid dete­rioration of these structures or interfering with proper conveyance and treatment of wastewater; 

(2) 	
A governmental agency informs the city that the effluent from the wastewater treatment plant is no longer of a quality permitted for discharge into a water­course, and it is found that the customer is discharging wastewater into the public sewer that cannot be sufficiently treated or requires treatment that is not provided by the city as normal domestic treatment; or 

(3) 	
The customer: 

a. 	
Discharges industrial waste or waste­water that is in violation of the per­mit issued by the approving author­ity; 

b. 	
Discharges wastewater at an uncon­trolled, variable rate in sufficient quantity to cause an imbalance in the wastewater treatment process; 

c. 	
Fails to pay monthly bills for sani­tary sewer service when due; or 

d. 	
Repeats a discharge of prohibited wastes into public sewer. 





Whenever a customer has violated or continues to violate the provisions of this article or an order or permit, water service to the customer may be severed and service will only recommence at the user's expense, after it has satisfactorily demon­strated its ability to comply. 
(b) Notification processes for discontinuance of service are presented in subsection 22-66(l). (Ord. No. 003-1998, art. 11, 4-14-1998) 
Sec. 22-72. Industrial wastewater surcharge. 
(a) 
Surcharge assessed. All industrial contrib­utors whose wastewaters exceed 250 mg/l BOD, 250 mg/l suspended solids, and/or 550 mg/l COD shall be assessed a surcharge in addition to the user charge. The surcharge shall be based on the proportionally higher BOD suspended solids, and COD concentration the industry contributes to the wastewater treatment facility. 

(b) 
Basis of surcharge. The surcharge rate is determined based on cost per pound per day of treatment of waste by the city in the present categories of measurement, BOD or COD, and TSS as defined in the definition provisions of the Code in section 22-62. The following equation, using the terms designated and further explained for purposes of the equation, shall be the basis of the rate of charge determination: 


Explanation of terms: 
(1) 	
BOD, TSS and COD: As defined in section 22-62. 

(2) 	
O&M cost: The total operation and main­tenance costs for the water pollution fa­cilities system for the city. 

(3) 	
BODR: The rate or cost per pound of BOD treated by the water pollution control facility on an average daily basis. 

(4) 	
TSSR: The rate or cost per pound of TSS treated by the water pollution control facility on an average daily basis. 

(5) 	
CODR: The rate or costs per pound of COD treated by the water pollution con­trol facility on an average daily basis. 

(6) 	
Q: The industrial metered flow of waste during a monthly billing cycle. 

(7) 	
I: Industrial average strength of a partic­ular waste in a billing cycle. 


(8) 	250, 550: Maximum limits industry is permitted to discharge to the sewer sys­tem before a surcharge is levied. These limits are established based on a desig­nated capacity of the city water pollution control facilities. 
(c) Surcharge calculations. The equations for calculation of all surcharges, using the terms set forth in the preceding part hereof, are as follows: 
(1) 	
BOD surcharge per pound -BOD O&M, cost over 365 × BOD average pounds per day plant -BODR. 

(2) 	
TSS and COD surcharge per pound ­Same basis. 

(3) 	
Therefore, the surcharge rate using the aforesaid calculations, is as follows: 


BOD -surcharge = Q × 8.34 × (BODi-250) × BODR 
TSS -surcharge = Q × 8.34 × (TSSi-250) × TSSR 
COD -surcharge = Q × 8.34 × (CODi-550) × CODR 
(4) 	The sum of the BOD surcharge, TSS sur­charge and COD surcharge = total sur­charge. 
Q = Industry flow in billing period. 
BODi = Industry average BOD in billing period. 
TSSi = Industry average TSS in billing period. 
CODi = Industry average COD in billing period. 
BODR = BOD surcharge rate from sub­section (d) of this section. 
TSSR = TSS surcharge rate from subsec­tion (d) of this section. 
CODR = COD surcharge rate from sub­section (d) of this section. 
(d) Rate adjustment. The surcharge rate may be analyzed from time to time by the city, and adjusted based upon the aforesaid calculations, so as to maintain the surcharge amount at the cost of capital improvements for the treatment of industrial sewage by the water pollution control facility of the city. Surcharge rates are published separate from this article. 
(e) 
Right to establish additional surcharge. Nothing contained in the above statement of rate of surcharge or method of calculation shall pro­hibit the city from hereafter establishing a method of surcharge for oil and grease calculations, ex­cess capacity of flow into the plant for an indus­trial user or otherwise establishing additional methods for calculations of surcharge. 

(f) 
Measurement of flow in computing sur­charges. The volume of flow used in computing industrial waste surcharges shall be based upon metered, estimated or prorated water consump­tion as shown in the records of meter reading maintained by the city water department. In the event that a person discharging wastes into the city sanitary sewer system produces evidence to the superintendent that a significant portion of the total annual volume of water used for all purposes does not reach the city sanitary sewer, an estimated percentage of total water consump­tion to be used in computing charges may be agreed upon between the superintendent and the persons discharging industrial wastes into said sewer, provided that said agreement shall be approved by the city council. 

(g) 
Disputed analyses; regauging and sam­pling of wastes. In the event that an analysis of wastes, determined by the sampling and gauging of wastes from a person or industry by the city is disputed; a program of resampling and gauging, with subsequent chemical determination may be instituted as follows: 

(1) 	
The person or industrial user interested must submit a request for resampling and gauging of their wastes to the superinten­dent by letter and bind themselves to bear the expenses incurred by the city in the resampling and gauging and subsequent chemical determination of the wastes. 

(2) 	
The chemist or engineer employed by the company responsible for the request sub­mitted to the city must confer with the superintendent or with the person in charge of gauging and sampling. They will estab­




lish the length of the rerun and the meth­ods to be employed to determine the flow and to sample the flow. 
(3) 	
The chemist or engineer engaged by the person or industry may be present during the gauging and sampling operation and also in the city laboratory during the chemical determination of the analysis. 

(4) 	
The results of the analysis, determined from the quantity and quality of the flow shall be considered the analysis of record and shall be used to establish current billing procedures. 



(Ord. No. 003-1998, art. 12, 4-14-1998) 
Sec. 22-73. Flagrant, continuous or egre­gious activities concerning sewer uses. 
(a) In addition to the surcharge rights of the city as contained in section 22-72, the city shall have the right, in the following defined instances, to assess additional fines and penalties (in addi­tion to any sewer surcharge), for the following defined types conduct and/or activities: 
(1) 	
Continuing violations of this section re­sulting in more than two surcharges within a 30-day period; 

(2) 	
Discharge of effluent into the system in such a fashion as to cause any form of plant upset in the POTW of the city; 

(3) 	
The disconnection, failure to keep func­tional, failure to repair, failure to properly install or maintain, or similar conduct which causes a partial or complete failure in operation of a pretreatment system of any industrial user to the extent that effluent, subject to pretreatment is not pretreated due to the acts, errors, and omissions of any user of this system. This failure to repair or maintain a pretreat­ment system contemplates a material act, error or omission due to lack of diligence, maintenance or intentional conduct which directly or indirectly causes a bypass of a pretreatment system, so that untreated 



effluent is directly discharged into the POTW contrary to federal, state or local laws and ordinances; 
(4) 	
Acts which constitute an intentional, know­ing, or constructive effort on the behalf of any user after notice from the city, con­tinuing acts which have previously been found to be in written violation of this article, and for which not only written violations have occurred, but significant surcharges in excess of $2,000.00, have been entered for the same, or similar conduct that causes the present com­plaint against any party discharging into the POTW; or 

(5) 	
Failure to properly sample any effluent pursuant to appropriate administrative order, or other requirements of this arti­cle, so that the city is unable to determine the nature, extent and strength of any wastewater discharge by a user into the system. 


(b) Any person, firm or corporation which vio­lates the provisions of section 22-72, shall be subject to a fine for each violation up to $1,000.00, together with any costs, or expense, (as restitu­tion) of the requirements of the city to correct the violation. Each day that a violation continues, or each separate act of violation found to exist, shall be considered a separate offense, subject to the fine and restitution requirements of this article. In addition to fines and restitution for these violations, the city shall have the right to exercise summary abatement of any dangerous conditions, nuisance, or other appropriate measure allowed by this article, and/or the general ordinances of the city, so as to provide appropriate and complete safety to the health and welfare of the citizens of the city, and especially any such action which could threaten the proper operations and/or func­tions of the POTW.

This surcharge shall include a proportionate share of charges for maintenance and operation of the water pollution control facil­ities including depreciation and other incidental expenses. 
(b) 
Determination of amounts. The rates for each of the aforementioned constituents shall be determined annually by the wastewater plant manager in order that the above factors may correctly represent current treatment costs. A schedule of the surcharge shall be filed with the city clerk by the wastewater plant manager. 

(c) 
Billing procedure. Industrial waste sur­charges provided for this section shall be pre­pared and rendered either as a separate invoice or with the regular water bill. The volume of flow used in billing the industrial waste surcharges shall be based upon metered potable water, me­tered wastewater, estimated wastewater flow, or estimated, or prorated water consumption. 


Sec. 22-137. Prohibited discharge standards. 
(a) 
General prohibitions. No user shall intro­duce or cause to be introduced into the POTW any pollutant or wastewater which causes pass through or interference. These general prohibitions apply to all users of the POTW whether or not they are subject to categorical pretreatment standards or any other national, state, or local pretreatment standards or requirements. 

(b) 
Specific prohibitions. No user shall intro­duce or cause to be introduced into the POTW the following pollutants, substances, or wastewater: 

(1) 	
Pollutants which create a fire or explosive hazard in the POTW, including, but not limited to, wastestreams with a closed-cup flashpoint of less than 140 degrees Fahrenheit (60 degrees Celsius) using the test methods specified in 40 CFR 261.21;

(c) Waste prohibitions. Pollutants, substances, or wastewater should not be processed or stored in such a manner that they could be discharged to the POTW. All floor drains located in process or materials storage areas must discharge to the industrial user's pretreatment facility before con­necting with the POTW. 
Sec. 22-138. National categorical pretreat­ment standards. 
The categorical pretreatment standards found at 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405— 471 are hereby incorporated by reference into this article as presently adopted, or hereafter amended, to-wit: 
(1) 	
Where a categorical pretreatment stan­dard is expressed only in terms of either the mass or the concentration of a pollut­ant in wastewater, the city may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(c)). 

(2) 	
When wastewater subject to a categorical pretreatment standard is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the city manager shall impose an alternate limit using the combined wastestream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e). 

(3) 	
A user may obtain a variance from a categorical pretreatment standard if the user can prove, pursuant to the proce­dural and substantive provisions in 40 CFR 403.13, that factors relating to its discharge are fundamentally different from the factors considered by EPA when de­veloping the categorical pretreatment stan­dard. 

(4) 	
A user may obtain a net gross adjustment to a categorical standard in accordance with 40 CFR 403.15. 


Sec. 22-139. Local limits. 
(a) The following pollutant maximum allow­able discharge concentration limits are estab­lished to protect against pass through and inter­ference. No person shall discharge wastewater containing in excess of the following discharge limits:

b. 	
The results of sampling and analysis identifying the nature and concen­tration, and/or mass, where required by the standard or by the city man­ager, of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each regulated pro­cess. Instantaneous, daily maximum, and long-term average concentra­tions, or mass, where required, shall be reported. The sample shall be representative of daily operations and shall be analyzed in accordance with the procedures set out in section 22-280. 

c. 	
Sampling must be performed in ac­cordance with the procedures set out in section 22-281. 


(6) 	
Certification. A statement, reviewed by the user's authorized representative and certified by a qualified professional, indi­cating whether pretreatment standards are being met on a consistent basis, and if not, whether additional operation and maintenance (O&M) and/or additional pretreatment is required to meet the pretreatment standards and requirements. 

(7) 	
Compliance schedule. If additional pretreat­ment and/or O&M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest schedule by which the user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or O&M. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later than the com­


pliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard. A compliance schedule pursuant to this section must meet the requirements set out in section 22-272. 
(8) 	Signature and certification. All baseline monitoring reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 22­
206. 

Sec. 22-272. Compliance schedule progress reports. 
The following conditions shall apply to the compliance schedule required by subsection 22­271(b)(7): 
(1) 	
The schedule shall contain progress incre­ments in the form of dates for the com­mencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable pretreat­ment standards (such events include, but are not limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major compo­nents, commencing and completing con­struction, and beginning and conducting routine operation); 

(2)

(3) 	
The user shall submit a progress report to the city manager no later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and the final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress, the rea­son for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return to the established schedule; and 

(4) 	
In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the city manager. 



Sec. 22-273. Reports on compliance with cat­egorical pretreatment standard deadline. 
Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreat­ment standards, or in the case of a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the city, a report containing the information described in subsection 22-271(b). For users subject to equivalent mass or concen­tration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long­term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All com­pliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 22-206. 
Sec. 22-274. Periodic compliance reports. 
All significant industrial users shall, at a fre­quency determined by the city manager but in no case less than twice per year (in June and Decem­ber), submit a report indicating the nature and concentration of pollutants in the discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. All significant users must sample and report for all regulated pollutants at least once during the reporting period. All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with section 22-206. 
(1) 	
All wastewater samples must be represen­tative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facili­ties shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of his discharge. 

(2) 	
If a user subject to the reporting require­ment in this section monitors any pollut­ant more frequently than required by the city, using the procedures prescribed in section 22-281, the results of this moni­toring shall be included in the report. 


Sec. 22-275. Reports of changed conditions. 
Each user must notify the city manager of any planned significant changes to the user's opera­tions or systems which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least 20 days before the change. 
(1) 	
The city manager may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condi­tion, including the submission of a waste­water discharge permit application under section 22-205. 

(2) 	
The city manager may issue a wastewater discharge permit under section 22-207 or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under section 22-239 in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions. 

(3) 	
For purposes of this requirement, signifi­cant changes include, but are not limited to, flow increases of ten percent or greater, and the discharge of any previously unre­ported pollutants. 


Sec. 22-276. Reports of potential problems. 
(a) 
In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonrouting, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the city man­ager of the incident. This notification shall in­clude the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and correc­tive actions taken by the user. 

(b) 
Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the city manager, submit a detailed written report describing the cause of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occur­rences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other dam­age to person or property; nor shall such notifica­


tion relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this article. 
(c) A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described in subsection (a) of this sec­tion. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
Sec. 22-277. Reports from unpermitted us­ers. 
All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate re­ports to the city as the city manager may require. 
Sec. 22-278. Notice of violation/repeat sam­pling and reporting. 
If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the city within 24 hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the city manager within 30 days after becoming aware of the violation. The user is not required to resample if the city monitors at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the city samples between the user's initial sampling and when the user receives the results of this sampling. 
Sec. 22-279. Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste. 
(a) Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a haz­ardous waste under 40 CFR 261. Such notifica­tion must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of dis­charge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream ex­pected to be discharged during the following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this subsection need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharge. However, notifications of changed con­ditions must be submitted under section 22-275. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards un­der the self-monitoring requirements of sections 22-271, 22-273, and 22-274. 
(b) 
Discharges are exempt from the require­ments of subsection (a) of this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than 15 kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as speci­fied in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15 kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one time noti­fication. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notifi­cation. 

(c) 
In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional char­acteristics of hazardous waste or listing any ad­ditional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the city manager, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the dis­charge of such substance within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations. 

(d) 
In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxic­ity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 


(e) This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this article, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law. 
Sec. 22-280. Analytical requirements. 
All pollutant analysis, including sampling tech­niques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques pre­scribed in 40 CFR 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment stan­dard. If 40 CFR 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in ques­tion, sampling and analysis must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA. 
Sec. 22-281. Sample collection. 
(a) 
Except as indicated in subsection (b) of this section, the user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection tech­niques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the city manager may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits. 

(b) 
Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile or­ganic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 

(c) 
The city reserves the right to take indepen­dent samples of the effluent of all regulated industries for the determination of compliance to pretreatment standards and to determine the amount of surcharge. 


Sec. 22-282. Timing. 
Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Ser­vice, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. 
Sec. 22-283. Recordkeeping. 
Users subject to the reporting requirements of this article shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this article and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person taking the samples; the dates analysis were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques of meth­ods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years. This period shall be automati­cally extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the city, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the city manager.

DIVISION 7. COMPLIANCE MONITORING 
Sec. 22-311. Right of entry; inspection and sampling. 
The city shall have the right to enter the premises of any user to determine whether the user is complying with all of the requirements of this article any wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder. Users shall allow the city ready access to all parts of the premises for the purposes of inspection, sampling, records exami­nation and copying, and the performance of any additional duties. 
(1) 	
Where a user has security measures in force which require proper identification and clearance before entry into its pre­mises, the user shall make necessary ar­rangements with its security guards so that, upon presentation of suitable iden­tification, the city will be permitted to enter without delay for the purposes of performing specific responsibilities. 

(2) 	
The city shall have the right to set up on the user's property, or require installation 


of, such devices as are necessary to con­duct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations. 
(3) 	
The city may require the user to install monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring equip­ment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated annually to ensure their accuracy. 

(4) 	
Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the city manager and shall not be replaced. The cost of clearing such access shall be born by the user. 

(5) 	
Unreasonable delays in allowing the city access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this article. 



Sec. 22-312. Search warrants. 
If the city has been refused access to a building, structure, or property, or any part thereof, and is able to demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may be a violation of this article, or that there is a need to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program of the city designed to verify compliance with this arti­cle or any permit or order issued hereunder, or to protect the overall public health, safety and wel­fare of the community, then the city manager may seek issuance of a search warrant from the mag­istrate court of the county. 
Secs. 22-313—22-340. Reserved. 
DIVISION 8. ADMINISTRATIVE 
ENFORCEMENT REMEDIES 


Sec. 22-341. Notification of violation. 
When the city manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreat­ment standard or requirement, the city manager may serve upon that user a written notice of violation. Within ten days of the receipt of this notice, an explanation of the violation and a plan for the satisfactory correction and prevention thereof, to include specific required actions, shall be submitted by the user to the city manager. Submission of this plan in no way relieves the user of liability for any violations occurring before or after receipt of the notice of violation. Nothing in this section shall limit the authority of the city manager to take any action, including emergency actions or any other enforcement action, without first issuing a notice of violation. 
Sec. 22-342. Consent orders. 
The city may enter into consent orders, assur­ances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such docu­ments will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such doc­uments shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to sections 22-344 and 22-345 and shall be judicially enforce­able. 
Sec. 22-343. Show cause hearing. 
The city manager may order a user who has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreat­ment standard or requirement, to appear before the city council and show cause why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. Notice shall be served on the user specifying the time and place for the meeting, the proposed enforce­ment action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show cause why the pro­posed enforcement action should not be taken. The notice of the meeting shall be served person­ally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least ten days prior to the hearing. Such notice may be served on any autho­rized representative of the user. A show cause hearing shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
Sec. 22-344. Compliance orders. 
When the city manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreat­ment standard or requirement, the city manager may issue an order to the user responsible for the discharge directing that the user come into com­pliance within a specified time. If the user does not come into compliance within the time pro­vided, sewer service may be discontinued unless adequate treatment facilities, devices, or other related appurtenances are installed and properly operated. Compliance orders also may contain other requirements to address the noncompli­ance, including additional self-monitoring and management practices designed to minimize the amount of pollutants discharged to the sewer. A compliance order may not extend the deadline for compliance established for a pretreatment stan­dard or requirement, nor does a compliance order relieve the user of liability for any violation, including any continuing violation. Issuance of a compliance order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking other action against the user. 
Sec. 22-345. Cease and desist orders. 
When the city manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreat­ment standard or requirement, or that the user's past violations are likely to recur, the city man­ager may issue an order to the user directing it to cease and desist all such violations and directing the user to: 
(1) 	
Immediately comply with all require­ments; and 

(2) 	
Take such appropriate remedial or preven­tive action as may be needed to properly address a continuing or threatened viola­tion, including halting operations and/or terminating the discharge. 


Issuance of a cease and desist order shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
Sec. 22-346. Administrative fines. 
(a) 
When the city manager finds that a user has violated, or continues to violate, any provision of this article, a wastewater discharge permit or order issued hereunder or any other pretreatment standard or requirement, the city manager may fine such user in an amount not to exceed $1,000.00. Such fines shall be assessed on a per violation, per day basis. In the case of monthly or other longterm average discharge limits, fines shall be assessed for each day during the period of viola­tion. 

(b) 
Unpaid charges, fines, and penalties shall, after 30 calendar days, be assessed an additional penalty of ten percent of the unpaid balance, and interest shall accrue thereafter at a rate of ten percent per month. A lien against the user's property will be sought for unpaid charges, fines, and penalties. 

(c) 
Users desiring to dispute such fines must file a written request for the city manager to reconsider the fine along with full payment of the fine amount within ten days of being notified of the fine. Where a request has merit, the city manager may convene a hearing on the matter. In the event the user's appeal is successful, the payment, together with any interest accruing thereto, shall be returned to the user. The city manager may add the costs of preparing admin­istrative enforcement actions, such as notices and orders, to the fine. 

(d) 
Issuance of an administrative fine shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 


Sec. 22-347. Emergency suspensions. 
The city manager may immediately suspend a user's discharge, after informal notice to the user, whenever such suspension is necessary to stop an actual or threatened discharge which reasonably appears to present or cause an imminent or substantial endangerment to the health or wel­fare of persons. The city manager may also imme­diately suspend a user's discharge, after notice and opportunity to respond, that threatens to interfere with the operation of the POTW, or which presents, or may present, an endanger­ment to the environment. 
(1) 	
Any user notified of a suspension of its discharge shall immediately stop or elim­inate its contribution. In the event of a user's failure to immediately comply vol­untarily with the suspension order, the city manager may take such steps as deemed necessary, including immediate severance of the sewer connection, to pre­vent or minimize damage to the POTW, its receiving stream, or endangerment to any individuals. The city manager may allow the user to recommence its dis­charge when the user has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the city that the period of endangerment has passed, un­less the termination proceedings in sec­tion 22-348 are initiated against the user. 

(2) 	
A user that is responsible, in whole or in part for any discharge presenting immi­nent endangerment shall submit a de­tailed written statement, describing the causes of the harmful contribution and the measures taken to prevent any future occurrence, to the city manager prior to the date of any show cause or termination hearing under section 22-343 or 22-348. 



Nothing in this section shall be interpreted as requiring a hearing prior to any emergency sus­pension under this section. 
Sec. 22-348. Termination of discharge. 
In addition to the provisions in section 22-241, any user who violates the following conditions is subject to discharge termination: 
(1) 	
Violation of wastewater discharge permit conditions; 

(2) 	
Failure to accurately report the wastewa­ter constituents and characteristics of its discharge; 

(3) 	
Failure to report significant changes in operations or wastewater volume, constit­uents, and characteristics prior to dis­charge; 


(4) 	
Refusal of reasonable access to the user's premises for the purpose of inspection, monitoring, or sampling; or 

(5) 	
Violation of the pretreatment standards in division 2 of this article. 



Such user will be notified of the proposed termi­nation of its discharge and be offered an opportu­nity to show cause under section 22-343 why the proposed action should not be taken. Exercise of this option by the city shall not be a bar to, or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user.

(1) 	An upset occurred and the user can iden­tify the cause of the upset; 
(2) 	
The facility was at the time being oper­ated in a prudent and workman-like man­ner and in compliance with applicable operation and maintenance procedures; and 

(3) 	
The user has submitted the following in­formation to the city manager within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset (if this information is provided orally, a writ­ten submission must be provided within five days): 

a. 	
A description of the indirect dis­charge and cause of noncompliance; 

b. 	
The period of noncompliance, includ­ing exact dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance is expected to con­tinue; and 

c. 	
Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent recur­rence of the noncompliance. 





(d) 
In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof. 

(e) 
Users will have the opportunity for a judi­cial determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards. 

(f) 
Users shall control production of all dis­charges to the extent necessary to maintain com­pliance with categorical pretreatment standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until the facility is restored or an alterna­tive method of treatment is provided. This require­ment applies in the situation where, among other things, the primary source of power of the treat­ment facility is reduced, lost, or fails. 


Sec. 22-437. Prohibited discharge standards. 
A user shall have an affirmative defense to an enforcement action brought against it for noncom­pliance with the general prohibitions in subsec­tion 22-137(a) or the specific prohibitions in sub­sections 22-137(b)(3) through (18) if it can prove that it did not know, or have reason to know, that its discharge, alone or in conjunction with dis­charges from other sources, would cause pass through or interference and that either: 
(1) 	
A local limit exists for each pollutant discharged and the user was in compli­ance with each limit directly prior to, and during, the pass through or interference; or 

(2) 	
No local limit exists, but the discharge did not change substantially in nature or con­stituents from the user's prior discharge when the city was regularly in compliance with its NPDES permit, and in the case of interference, was in compliance with ap­plicable sludge use or disposal require­ments. 


Sec. 22-438. Bypass. 
(a) The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the mean­ings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Bypass means the intentional diversion of wastestreams from any portion of a user's treat­ment facility. 
Severe property damage means substantial phys­ical damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them to become inopera­ble, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production. 
(b) 
A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient op­eration. These bypasses are not subject to the provision of subsections (c) and (d) of this section. 

(c) 
If a user knows in advance of the need for a bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the city manager, at least ten days before the date of the bypass, if possible. 


(1) 	A user shall submit oral notice to the city manager of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable pretreatment stan­dards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the bypass. 
(2) 	A written submission shall also be pro­vided within five days of the time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall contain a description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been corrected, the anticipated time it is ex­pected to continue; and steps taken or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The city man­ager may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the oral report has been received within 24 hours. 
(d) 
Bypass is prohibited, and the city manager may take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless: 

(1) 	
Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of life, personal injury, or severe property damage; 

(2) 	
There were no feasible alternative to the bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treat­ment facilities, retention of untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime. This con­dition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judg­ment to prevent a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment down­time or preventive maintenance; and 

(3) 	
The user submitted notices as required under subsection (c) of this section. 



(e) 
The city manager may approve an antici­pated bypass, after considering its adverse ef­fects, if the city manager determines that it will meet the three conditions listed in subsection (d)(1) of this section.

(Ord. No. 2009O-06, § 2, 10-13-2009) 
Sec. 22-457. Conditions of street occupancy. 
Failure to comply with the terms and condi­tions set forth in this article may result in revo­cation of registration and removal of facilities from the rights-of-way. 
(1) 	The 1988 Utility Accommodation Policy and Standards manual, including all ref­erences contained therein to codes, rules, regulations, schedules, forms and appen­dix items, except Appendix B (Permit Forms and supporting Documents), pro­mulgated by the State of Georgia Depart­ment of Transportation, as may be amended from time to time is hereby adopted by reference and incorporated in the article as if fully set forth herein, subject to the amendments and modifica­tion contained in this chapter.

References to state person­nel, agencies, and fees shall be inter­preted, where required, as meaning the City of Cedartown municipal equivalents. 
(2) 	
Protection of traffic and roadway. In con­formance with city policy, no utility may occupy the city rights-of-way unless suffi­cient space is available so that the free flow and safety of traffic and other capac­ity considerations are not unduly im­paired and the installation does not pre­vent the department from reasonably maintaining the streets, structures, traf­fic control devices and other appurtenant facilities, and further provided that main­tenance and operations of the facilities do not jeopardize the traffic, street structure, other users of the right-of-way, or the right-of-way itself. 

(3) 	
Grading. If the grades or lines of any street within the city right-of-way are changed at any time during the term of the permit and this change involves an area in which the utility's facilities are located, then the utility shall, at its own cost and expense and upon the request of the city upon reasonable notice, protect or promptly alter or relocate the facilities, or any part thereof, so as to conform with such new grades or lines. In the event the utility refuses or neglects to so protect, alter, or relocate all or part of the facili­ties, the city shall have the right to break through, remove, alter, or relocate all or any part of the facilities without any liability to the utility and the utility shall pay to the city the costs incurred in con­nection with such breaking through, re­moval, alteration, or relocation. 


(4) 	Installation of poles and other wirehold­ing structures and relocation. Unless oth­erwise provided in a valid service agree­ment, no placement of any pole or wireholding structure of the utility is to be considered a vested interest in the right-of-way, and such poles or structures are to be removed, relocated underground, or modified by the utility at its own ex­pense whenever the city determines that the public convenience would be enhanced thereby. The facilities shall be so located and installed as to cause minimum inter­ference with the rights and convenience of property owners. 

(Ord. No. 2009O-06, § 2, 10-13-2009) 
Sec. 22-458. Restoration of property. 
A utility shall be liable, at its own cost and expense, to replace or repair, any street, facilities or property or structure thereon, thereunder or thereover or adjacent thereto that may become disturbed or damaged as a result of the construc­tion or installation, operation, upgrade, repair or removal of facilities to a condition as good as or better than its condition before the work per­formed by the entity that caused such disturbance or damage. If the utility does not commence such replacement or repair after 20 working days fol­lowing written notice from the city, the city or the owner of the affected structure or property may make such replacement or repair and the utility shall pay the reasonable and actual cost of the same. (Ord. No. 2009O-06, § 2, 10-13-2009) 
Sec. 22-459. Discontinuance of operations, 
abandoned and unused facili­
ties. 

(a) A utility who has discontinued or is discon­tinuing operation of any facilities in the city shall: 
(1) 	Provide information satisfactory to the city that the utility's obligations for its facilities in the rights-of-way under this chapter and any other provision in the codified ordinances or other laws have been lawfully assumed by another utility; or 
(2) 	
Submit a written proposal to re-use its facilities; or 

(3) 	
Submit a written proposal for abandon­ment of facilities. Said proposal must be approved by the director; or 

(4) 	
Remove its entire facilities within a rea­sonable amount of time and in a manner acceptable to the city; or 

(5) 	
Submit to the city, in good faith and within a reasonable amount of time, a proposal for transferring ownership of its facilities to the city. If a utility proceeds under this clause, the city may, at its option do one or more of the following: 

a. 	
Purchase the facilities; 

b. 	
Accept donation of some or all facil­ities; or 

c. 	
Require the utility to post a bond in an amount sufficient to reimburse the city for its reasonably antici­pated costs to be incurred in remov­ing the facilities. 





(b) Facilities of a utility who fails to comply with the above provision shall be deemed to be abandoned. Abandoned facilities are deemed to be a nuisance. The city may exercise any remedies or rights it has at law or in equity, including, but not limited to abating the nuisance; taking possession of the facilities, evicting the utility from the right-of-way; prosecuting the violator; and/or any other remedy provided by city ordinance or oth­erwise at law or in equity. (Ord. No. 2009O-06, § 2, 10-13-2009) 
Sec. 22-460. Termination of registration. 
(a) The registration statement shall remain in place for one year and renew each subsequent year automatically unless the utility is in default. The director shall give written notice of default to a utility if it is determined that a utility has: 
(1) 	
Violated any provision or requirement of the issuance or acceptance of a registra­tion application or any law of the city, state, or federal government; 

(2) 	
Attempted to evade any provision or re­quirement of this chapter; 



(3) 	
Practiced any fraud or deceit upon the city; or 

(4) 	
Made a material misrepresentation of fact in its application for registration. 


(b) If a utility fails to cure a default within 20 working days after such notice is provided to the utility by the city, then such default shall be a material breach and city may exercise any reme­dies or rights it has at law or in equity to terminate the approval of registration. If the director decides there is cause or reason to termi­nate, the following procedure shall be followed: 
(1) 	
City shall serve a utility with a written notice of the reason or cause for proposed termination and shall allow a utility a minimum of 15 calendar days to cure its breach. 

(2) 	
If the utility fails to cure [its breach] within 15 calendar days, the city may declare the registration terminated. 


(Ord. No. 2009O-06, § 2, 10-13-2009) 
Sec. 22-461. Penalties. 
Every utility convicted of a violation of any provision of this chapter shall be punished by a fine not exceeding $1,000.00 per violation. Each act of violation and each day upon which any such violation shall occur shall constitute a separate offense. In addition to the penalty prescribed above, the city may pursue other remedies such as abatement of nuisances, injunctive relief and revocation of licenses or permits. This shall in­clude the right to stop work which is in violation of this article, or other applicable provisions of the Code of Ordinances of the City of Rockmart and/or state law. (Ord. No. 2009O-06, § 2, 10-13-2009) 
Sec. 22-462. Other provisions. 
(a) Severability. If any section, subsection, sen­tence, clause, phrase, or portion of this chapter is for any reason held invalid or unconstitutional by any court or administrative agency of competent jurisdiction, such portion shall be deemed a sep­arate, distinct and independent provision and such holding shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions thereof. 
(b) 
Reservation of regulatory and police pow­ers. The city by issuing a written approval of registration under this chapter, does not surren­der or to any extent lose, waive, impair, or lessen the lawful powers and rights, which it has now or which may be hereafter vested in the city under the Constitution and Laws of the United States, State of Georgia, and under the provisions of the city's codified ordinances to regulate the use of the rights-of-way. The utility by applying for and being issued a written approval of registration, is deemed to acknowledge that all lawful powers and rights, regulatory power, or police power, or otherwise as are or the same may be from time to time vested in or reserved to the city, shall be in full force and effect and subject to the exercise thereof by the city at any time. A utility is deemed to acknowledge that its rights are subject to the regulatory and police powers of the city to adopt and enforce general ordinances necessary to the safety and welfare of the public and is deemed to agree to comply with all applicable general laws enacted by the city pursuant to such powers. In particular, all utilities shall comply with city zoning and other land use requirements pertain­ing to the placement and specifications of facili­ties. 

(c) 
Compliance. No utility shall be relieved of its obligation to comply with any of the provisions of this chapter by reason of any failure of city to enforce prompt compliance. 

(d) 
Appeals. All appeals provided for by this chapter and any notification to the city required by this chapter shall be in writing and sent via certified mail to the director of public service as specified in this chapter. (Ord. No. 2009O-06, § 2, 10-13-2009)

(a) The planning commission may, upon ap­peal of the denial of a building permit by the city staff, in specific cases, grant such variances from the terms of this chapter as will not be contrary to the public interest where, owing to special condi­tions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of this chapter will, in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship so that the spirit of this chapter shall be observed, public safety and wel­fare secured, and substantial justice done. Such variances may be granted in such individual cases of unnecessary hardship upon specific writ­ten findings by the planning commission that: 
(1) 	
There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the particular piece of property in question because of its size, shape, or topography; 

(2) 	
The application of this chapter to this particular piece of property would create an unnecessary hardship; 

(3) 	
Such conditions are peculiar to the partic­ular piece of property involved, and not of the making of the applicant; 

(4) 	
Relief, if granted, would not cause sub­stantial detriment to the public good or impair the purposes and intent of this chapter; provided, however, that no vari­ance may be granted for a use of land, building or structure that is prohibited by this chapter; 


(5) 	
Public hearing notices relating to the re­view of a variance will name the appli­cant, the location of the property request­ing variance, present zoning classification, the zoning district by specific article, sec­tion, and subsection to be varied, as well as the specific measurements or require­ments to the ordinance being requested. The date, time and place of the planning commission hearing will be held; and 

(6) 	
The city clerk or his designee will inform the applicant as soon as practical of the public hearing dates. The planning com­mission will convene a public hearing on each request for variance. Public notice of the hearing will appear in a newspaper of general circulation within the city no less than 15 days or more than 45 days before the date of the official public hearing. 



(b) In the event the planning commission de­termines not to grant a variance, or the variance request is unacceptable to city staff, either party may appeal for a final (and official) public hearing before the mayor and council. This appeal shall be in writing, and must be filed within five days of the decision of the planning commission. All noti­fication procedure, review, conduct of hearing and resubmittal requirements as generally contained in this chapter shall apply to a review of a variance. (Ord. No. 001-2001, § 7.11, 2-13-2001) 
Sec. 23-52. Approval period. 
No order of the planning commission permit­ting the erection or alteration of a building shall be valid for a period longer than six months unless such use is established within such period; provided, however, that where such use permitted is dependent upon the erection or alteration of a building, such order shall continue in force and effect if a building permit for said erection or alteration is obtained within such period, and such erection or alteration is started and proceeds to completion in accordance with such permit. (Ord. No. 001-2001, § 7.12, 2-13-2001) 
Sec. 23-53. Administrative assistance. 
The city shall provide such technical, adminis­trative, and clerical assistance and office space as is required by the planning commission, zoning board of appeals, and city council to carry out its function under the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. No. 001-2001, § 7.13, 2-13-2001) 
Sec. 23-54. Fees.

A listing of all applicable scheduled fees is available in the office of city hall. (Ord. No. 001-2001, § 7.14, 2-13-2001) 
Sec. 23-55. Penalty for violations of provi­sions. 
(a) 
Any person who violates, disobeys, omits, neglects or refuses to comply with, or resists the enforcement of any of the provisions of this chap­ter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and subject to a fine up to $1,000.00 after receiving 30 days' notice of the violation, and an opportunity for hearing as to any such violations. Said notice shall be in writing and issued by the city. 

(b) 
Each day that a violation is permitted to exist after due notice is given shall constitute a separate offense. (Ord. No. 001-2001, § 7.15, 2-13-2001) 


Sec. 23-56. Continuance of nonconforming uses. 
(a) Land. 
(1) 	The lawful use of land existing at the time of the enactment of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, although such use does not conform to the provi­sions of this chapter, may be continued; provided, however, that no such noncon­forming use shall be enlarged or in­creased, nor shall any nonconforming use be extended to occupy a greater area of land than that occupied by such use at the time of such enactment; and provided further that no such use is subject to any moratorium which might apply to said use. 
(2) 	If such nonconforming use shall be discon­tinued for a continuous period of 90 days, any future use of such land shall be in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. 
(b) Buildings. 
(1) 	
The lawful use of a building or structure existing at the time of the enactment of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived may be continued, although the building use does not conform to the pro­visions of this chapter. 

(2) 	
The lawful use may be extended through­out the building, provided no structural alterations, except those required by law, ordinances, or ordered by an authorized officer to assure the safety of the building, are made therein. Should any interior extension of the use include loft apart­ments or similar material building changes, the provisions governing these changes in this chapter shall apply. 

(3) 	
No use shall be extended to occupy any land outside the building. 

(4) 	
If the nonconforming building is removed or the nonconforming use of such building is discontinued for a continuous period of 90 days, every future use of the building shall be in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. 


(c) Destroyed buildings. If a nonconforming building or structure suffers damage which does not exceed 50 percent of its fair market value immediately preceding such damage, the building or structure may be reconstructed and reused (as before) if completed within 12 months from the time such damage occurred. If such damage is greater than 50 percent of its fair market value immediately preceding the damage, the building or structure may only be reconstructed and used in conformity with the standards and require­ments for the district in which it is located. Otherwise, it must be removed at the owner's expense within six months from the time such damage occurred. 
(d) Projects under construction. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require any change in the plans, construction or designated use of any building upon which actual construction was law­fully begun prior to the adoption of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived and upon which actual building construction has been dili­gently carried on; provided that the building shall be completed within one year from the date of passage and publication of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived and is not the subject of a proper enacted moratorium. (Ord. No. 001-2001, § 3.7, 2-13-2001) 
Sec. 23-57. District changes. 
(a) 
When a district shall be changed, any then existing nonconforming use in the changed dis­trict may be continued or changed to a use of similar or higher classification, provided all other regulations governing the new use are complied with. 

(b) 
Whenever a nonconforming use has been discontinued or changed to a higher classification or to a conforming use, such use shall not there­after be changed to a nonconforming use or a lower classification. (Ord. No. 001-2001, § 3.8, 2-13-2001) 


Sec. 23-58. Expiration of conditional uses, variances and planned develop­ments. 
(a) Conditional uses and variances. When con­ditional zoning or variances have been granted, but no affirmative action has been taken to per­form said conditions or to obtain a building or land disturbance permit or an occupational tax certificate, and such status shall continue for six months from the date of approval, the conditional use or variance shall expire and the property shall revert to its original status prior to such conditional zoning or variance. If the six-month expiration period has passed, the mayor and council may, upon petition by the land owner or permit holder, or on its own action, consider an extension of the time period for up to an addi­tional six months for just cause. Conditional uses or variances not built, erected or located within one year upon receiving initial approval or permit from the city shall expire and the property shall revert to its zoning before the conditional use or variance was approved. 
(b) Planned developments. When planned de­velopments have been approved, but no affirma­tive action has been taken to perform said devel­opment or to obtain a building or land disturbance permit or an occupational tax certificate, and such status shall continue for 18 months from the date of approval, the planned development plans expire and the property owner shall resubmit the planned development through the formal chan­nels and approval process used by the city. If the 18-month expiration period has passed, the mayor and council may, upon petition by the land owner or permit holder, or on its own action, consider an extension of the time period for up to an addi­tional six months for just cause. A planned devel­opment not built, erected or located within two years upon receiving their initial approval from the city shall expire and the property owner shall be required to resubmit the planned development through the formal channels and approval pro­cess used by the city.

In the absence of the ability to connect to the wastewater treatment system due to the unavailability of city sewer connec­tion, the lot can meet the requirements of the county health department for the in­stallation of a septic tank. 



When a subdivision of land or portion thereof contains lots or parcels of land that do not con­form to the lot area or lot frontage provisions of this article and such tract of land is under one ownership and has remained unimproved or un­developed for a period of two years from the effective date of the ordinance from which this chapter is derived, it shall be incumbent upon the owner of such tract to replat the tract to conform to the minimum area and frontage provisions of this article for the district in which the lands are located, in the event of a sale of any portion of the land.

Lot reduction below minimum require­ments prohibited. No parcel of land, even though it may consist of one or more adjacent lots of record, shall be reduced in size so that lot width or depth, front, side, or rear yard, inner or outer courts, lot area per unit, or other requirements of this chapter are not maintained.

How­ever, with commission approval, a slope easement may be cleared and graded where required to prevent soil erosion. This ease­ment may cover no more than 20 percent 




of the required buffer area, and shall be immediately replanted upon completion of easement improvement; and 
(6) 	Where, by reason of the topography of the land or by reason of the prior removal or lack of timber and foliage, the owner of the buffer area may be required to erect a permanent wall or fence of not less than six feet in height or screen of evergreen plantings, so designed and developed to provide visual screening. These plantings shall consist of evergreen shrubs that will, with normal growth, attain a height of six feet within three years.

As such, the follow­ing goals, at a minimum, are established: 
(1) 	
To encourage the rehabilitation/redevelop­ment of commercial areas; 

(2) 	
To encourage the use of "village concepts" whenever and wherever possible;

Trails, bikeways and other passive recre­ation activities shall be allowed within the 20 percent. Active recreational activi­ties such as ballfields, tennis courts, swim­ming pools, or cleared fields shall not be counted toward the 20 percent require­ment. Open space shall be determined at the time of development and in general shall be those lands reserved from any clearing, grubbing or grading activity. Open space may be enhanced with the planting of trees, shrubs and ground cover with the approval of the city. Said enhancements shall only be considered upon submittal of a landscape plan illustrating both exist­ing and proposed vegetation.

The O-I office-institutional districts are in­tended to promote and preserve districts with lower density office activities, institutional, clini­cal, and professional types uses. This district also allows for a mix of certain compatible residential activities. The O-I district in many cases is a practical tool for providing transition from resi­dential uses where it is elected not to use a buffer. The O-I development standards require adequate yard space and off-street parking and service facilities. Permitted uses are restricted to protect the character of the city and from encroachment of uses capable of adversely affecting the limited character of the district. (Ord.

DIVISION 17. PD PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICT 
Sec. 23-581. Purpose. 
(a) 
Planned development zoning is of a sub­stantially different character than other types of zoning. Because of the difference in character, special standards and procedures are hereby es­tablished to govern and guide the creation of planned development zoning districts. 

(b) 
Planned development zoning is a privilege to be earned and not a right which can be claimed simply upon complying with all the standards established in this division. The planning commis­sion and/or city council may require any reason­able condition or design consideration which will promote proper development of benefit to the community. It is not intended that the commis­sion and/or council automatically grant the max­imum use exceptions or density increases in the case of each planned development. The commis­sion and council shall grant only such increase or latitude which is consistent with the benefit ac­cruing to the city as a result of the planned development. As a condition for approval, each planned development must be compatible with the character and objectives of the zoning district within which it is located, and each planned development shall be consistent with the objec­tives of the city comprehensive plan and all ap­plicable laws, ordinances and regulations of the city. 

(c) 
Some specific purposes of the planned de­velopment procedures are: 

(1) 	
To take advantage of advances in technol­ogy, architectural design and functional land use design; 

(2) 	
To permit flexibility of design in the place­ment, height, and uses of buildings, open spaces, circulation facilities and off-street parking areas, and to more efficiently utilize potentials of site characterized by special features of geography, topography, size and shape; and 




(3) 	To protect floodplains from encroachment 
by development within the city. (Ord. No. 001-2001, § 23.01, 2-13-2001; Ord. No. 8-2005, § 1, 8-11-2005) 
Sec. 23-582. Types of planned development. 
The types of planned development are: 
(1)  PD-1, planned residential development;  
(2)  PD-2, planned commercial (business) de­ 
velopment; and  
(3)  PD-3, planned industrial development.  

(Ord. No. 001-2001, § 23.02, 2-13-2001; Ord. No. 8-2005, § 1, 8-11-2005) 
Sec. 23-583. General standards for planned developments. 
Before an application for planned development can be approved, the applicant must present evidence which clearly supports the following conclusions: 
(1) 	
The proposed development advances the general welfare of the community and the immediate vicinity; 

(2) 	
The plan is in conformity with the com­prehensive plan and other applicable laws, ordinances and/or regulations; 

(3) 	
The proposed development is consistent in all respects with the purpose and in­tent of this chapter; 

(4) 	
The site will be accessible from public roads that are adequate to carry the traf­fic that will be imposed upon them by the proposed development, and the streets and driveways on the site of the proposed development will be adequate to serve the residents or occupants of the proposed development; 

(5) 	
The development will not impose an un­due burden on public services and facili­ties, such as fire and police protection; 

(6) 	
The location and arrangement of struc­tures, parking areas, walks, lighting, and appurtenant facilities shall be compatible with the surrounding land uses, and any part of a planned development not used 


for structures, parking and loading areas, or accessways shall be landscaped or oth­erwise improved. The height of buildings shall be compatible with surrounding land uses as well as the general characteristics of the area to be developed and the sur­rounding area and acceptable to the cri­teria for height restrictions established by this chapter and/or applicable fire regula­tions; 
(7) 	
Natural features such as watercourses, trees and rock outcrops will be preserved, to the degree possible, so that they can be incorporated into the layout to enhance the overall design of the planned develop­ment; and 

(8) 	
The planned development can be substan­tially completed within the period of time specified in the schedule of development submitted by the developer. 


(Ord. No. 001-2001, § 23.03, 2-13-2001; Ord. No. 8-2005, § 1, 8-11-2005) 
Sec. 23-584. Procedure for approval. 
(a) Preapplication conference. Prior to filing a formal application for approval of a planned de­velopment, the developer shall request a preap­plication conference with the planning commis­sion, to include city staff and such persons as determined by the city that may provide adequate representation for the city. The purpose of such conference is to allow the developer to present a general concept of his proposed development prior to the preparation of detailed plans. For this purpose, the presentation shall include, but not be limited to the following: 
(1) 	
Written letter of intent from the developer establishing his intentions as to develop­ment of the land. 

(2) 	
Topographic survey and location map. 

(3) 	
Sketch plans and conceptual objectives regarding land use pattern, structure lo­cation and type, street and lot arrange­ment and tentative lot sizes. 


(4) 	
Tentative proposals regarding water sup­ply, sewage disposal, surface drainage, street improvements and flood control mea­sures. 

(5) 	
The planning commission shall then in­struct the developer to file an application and advise the developer to familiarize himself with the city zoning require­ments, comprehensive plan, and all other development regulations affecting the pro­posed development. A copy of this division shall be made available upon request. 



(b) Preliminary plan. Seven copies of the pre­liminary plan of the planned development and the application shall be filed with the zoning officer, who shall, in turn, forward them to the planning commission for consideration. The required pro­cedure for consideration and approval of the pre­liminary plan shall be as follows: 
(1) 	
An application for zoning amendment shall be secured from the zoning officer. The completed application shall be filed with the zoning officer accompanied by other subdivision requirements as specified in this Code. 

(2) 	
The planning commission shall study ma­terials received and confer with other agencies, as appropriate, and city officials to determine general acceptability of the proposal as submitted. In the course of such preliminary consideration, the plan­ning commission may request and the applicant shall supply additional mate­rial needed to make specific determina­tions. 

(3) 	
Following such study, the planning com­mission shall hold a conference or confer­ences with the applicant to discuss desir­able changes in the first or succeeding drafts of the preliminary development plan and report. 

(4) 	
Recommendations of the planning com­mission to the applicant shall be in writ­ing, and following any such conference, agreements between the applicant and the planning commission as to changes in the preliminary plan or other matters are 


to be recorded and acknowledged by the planning commission and the applicant in writing. Items on which no agreement is reached or on which there is specific dis­agreement shall be recorded, and the ap­plicant may place in the record his rea­sons for any disagreement. 
(5) 	Upon the occurrence of either of the fol­lowing conditions, the planning commis­sion will schedule the proposed plan for a public hearing: 
a. 	
When the preliminary development plan has been approved in principal (as a whole or with reservations spe­cifically indicated); or 

b. 	
When the applicant indicates in writ­ing that no further negotiations with the planning commission are desired before proceeding. 


Regardless of which subsection (b)(5)a or (b)(5)b of this section is satisfied, the planning commission must schedule the proposed plan for the public hearing within 60 days from the submission of the pre­liminary plan application. 
(3) 	
Following the public hearing, the plan­ning commission shall make its recom­mendations to the city council. Such rec­ommendations shall indicate approval, approval with specific reservations or dis­approval with reasons. 

(4) 	
Within 60 days from the public hearing for the preliminary plan and respective planned development zone designation, the city council shall approve the proposal outright, approve the proposal subject to conditions, or deny the proposal. Council approval shall be by ordinance. If condi­tions are attached to council approval, there shall be no change in the zoning map until such conditions are formally accepted in writing by the developer. When approved, the area of land proposed for development shall be designated PD-1, PD-2, or PD-3, and shall be used only in accordance with the uses and densities shown on the planned development ap­proved and adopted preliminary plan. 



(c) Approval and recording of final develop­ment plan. 
(1) 	
The purpose of such recording is to desig­nate with particularity the land subdi­vided into conventional lots, as well as the dimension of other lands not so treated, into common open areas and building areas, and also to define each building site as well as the use of the land in general. 

(2) 	
The approval and recording of the final development plan may be accomplished in stages if the stages have been specified in the construction schedule approved with the preliminary plan. 

a. 	
Upon the designation of the planned development district by council, the final development plan shall be pre­sented and approved in a form suit­able for recording with the county clerk's office. 

b. 	
The proposed plat (the final develop­ment plan in a form suitable for re-zoning) shall then be forwarded to the planning commission for review and, if approved, shall be forwarded to the city manager, who shall make appropriate arrangement with the applicant to ensure the accomplish­ment of public improvements at the applicant's expense and as provided by this Code. The city manager shall consult with the council concerning any land to be publicly or commonly owned and shall arrange for the nec­essary legal deeds. 

c. 	
The final plat shall be presented by the city manager and the proposed developers to the city council for formal approval and recording. 

d. 	
The approved record plat shall then be submitted to the county clerk's office for recording within six months after approval by council. 

e. 	
No final development plan within the corporate limits of the city shall be so recorded unless it shall have 




the approval of council, as indicated by the signatures of the mayor and the city clerk, inscribed thereon. 
(d) Zoning permit. No zoning permit shall be issued by the zoning officer until the final devel­opment plan has been approved and duly re­corded. 
(e) Certificate of zoning compliance. 
(1) 	
The zoning officer shall issue no certifi­cate of zoning compliance until all utili­ties have been accepted by the city in accordance with the final development plan. 

(2) 	
If all utilities, including roadways, have not been accepted by the city, the zoning officer may issue a temporary certificate of zoning compliance upon certification by the city manager that the existing public utilities are functionally acceptable and adequate for the use of the premises. Should the city manager find, while the temporary certificate of zoning compli­ance is in force, that the existing utilities are no longer functionally acceptable and adequate, the city manager may order the cancellation of the temporary certificate of zoning compliance and direct the devel­oper to vacate the premises of occupants. 

(3) 	
The temporary certificate of zoning com­pliance remains in effect until all utilities, including roadways, are accepted by the city, at which time the zoning officer will issue a permanent certificate of occu­pancy. 


(f) Changes in the planned development. 
(1) 	A planned development shall be devel­oped only according to the approved and recorded final plan, and all recorded amendments shall be binding on the ap­plicants, their successors, grantees and assignees and shall limit and control the use of premises (including the general internal use of buildings and structures) and location of structures in the planned development as set forth therein. Any deviation from the approved and recorded final plan must have planning commis­sion review and city council approval in writing and as an amendment to the plan. 
(2) 	All requested changes or revisions to an approval and recorded final plat must be made to the planning commission. The commission must determine if these pro­posed changes are deemed "minor" or "ma­jor" plan revisions, as hereinafter defined. For purposes of this chapter, these terms are defined as follows: 
a. 	
Major changes. Changes which alter the concept or intent of the planned development, including, but not lim­ited to, increases in the number of units per acre; change in location or amount on nonresidential land use; more than ten percent modification in proportion of housing types; reduc­tions of proposed open space; signif­icant redesign of roadways, utilities or drainage may be approved only by submission of a new preliminary plan and supporting data, and following the "preliminary approval" steps and subsequent amendment of the final planned development plan. 

b. 	
Minor changes. A minor change is any change not defined as a major change. The city zoning officer and the planning commission may jointly approve minor changes in the planned development which do not change the concept or intent of the develop­ment without repeating the "prelim­inary approval" steps. The zoning officer shall enter in detail all minor changes on the official final develop­ment plan on record with the city. 



(g) Schedule of construction. A modification of the schedule may be approved by the city council if the developer shall present satisfactory evi­dence of reasonable effort toward meeting the initial schedule and justification for the modifica­tion. If construction falls more than one year behind schedule, as determined by the city engi­neer, and the developer fails to justify the delay to the council's satisfaction, council may proceed to complete all or any part of such improvements and recover the costs thereof by laying claim to the guarantee specified in section 23-589(b)(2). 
(h) Effect of denial of a planned development. 
(1) 	
If an application for a planned develop­ment is denied wholly or partly, then for a period of one year from the date of sub­mission thereof, the planning commission need not consider any resubmission there­fore. 

(2) 	
If a preliminary development plan is ap­proved and the final development plan is thereafter disapproved, the applicant, or his successor in interest, may at any time submit one or more new versions of the final development plan, so long as the new versions are in full compliance with the approved preliminary development plan, including any conditions attached to said plan.

Sec. 23-585. PD-1 planned residential devel­opment. 
(a) Policies guiding development. This district is intended to provide flexibility in the arrange­ment and design of residential dwellings, based upon a unified development plan conceived and carried out for an entire area. Within this district, appropriate and reasonable population density is maintained while a variety of dwelling unit types is encouraged. Natural features such as topogra­phy, trees and drainageways are encouraged to remain in their natural state to the degree possi­ble. Such developments are generally character­ized by a significant proportion of usable open space and a unified design concept with particu­lar attention devoted to the periphery of the development, the overall objective being the com­patibility of the development with its surround­ings. 
(b) Permitted uses. 
(1) 	Permitted uses are those included as per­mitted and accessory uses in residential zones R-1 to R-7, as established by this chapter. 

(2) 	Convenience establishments as condi­tional uses are those established as nec­essary for the proper development of the community and to be so located, desig­nated and operated to serve primarily the needs of the persons within the planned development plot. Uses shall be generally limited to those uses permitted in the C-2 district, with no direct access or advertis­ing signs for such uses to be visible from the exterior of the development. Such convenience establishments and their park­ing areas shall not occupy more than five percent of the total area of the develop­ment. No separate building or structure designed or intended to be used, in whole or in part, for business purposes shall be constructed within a residential planned development until not less than 30 per­cent of the dwelling units proposed in the development plan are certified for occu­pancy. 
(c) 
Area requirements. The minimum land area required for a planned residential development shall be five acres. This area requirement may be reduced at the discretion of the planning commis­sion and city council if it can be demonstrated that a waiver is necessary to achieve an improved site design and that surrounding neighborhoods and public facilities will not be adversely affected. 

(d) 
Density requirements. Any combination or cluster of housing units is permitted, provided that the average lot area per family or dwelling unit contained in the site, exclusive of the area of street rights-of-way, parking areas and commer­cial areas, must be at least 80 percent of the average lot area per family required in the sur­rounding nonagricultural districts. This density requirement may be varied at the discretion of the planning commission and city council if it can be demonstrated that a waiver is necessary to achieve an improved site design and that sur­rounding neighborhoods and public facilities will not be adversely affected. 


(e) Site design. 
(1) 	All housing shall be sited to preserve privacy and to ensure natural light. 
(2) 	
Lot widths may be varied to permit a mixture of structural designs. Varied set­back is encouraged. 

(3) 	
Where feasible, housing units should be situated to abut common open space or similar areas. A clustering of dwellings is encouraged. 


(f) 
Structure spacing. A minimum of 20 feet shall be maintained between principal structures. 

(g) 
Length. There shall be no continuous struc­ture of townhouses, attached dwellings or apart­ments containing more than 12 dwelling units on ground floor level. 

(h) 
Height. The building height of any residen­tial structure within a planned development shall not exceed 45 feet or 31/2 stories. However, the planning commission may grant an exception if it is demonstrated that additional height can be achieved with concurrent expansion of suitable open space to protect adjacent structures from adverse reduction of light and air. 

(i) 
Setback and screening. A minimum setback of 50 feet shall be provided along the entire perimeter of the development and retained in natural woods, or be suitably landscaped with grass and/or ground cover, shrubs and trees. Projects located adjacent to commercial or indus­trially zoned areas shall provide suitable screen­ing to the residential development as adjudged by the planning commission. Screening shall not obscure traffic visibility within 50 feet of an intersection. 


(j) Common open space. 
(1) 	
A minimum of 25 percent of the total land in any planned residential development shall be reserved for permanent common open space and recreational facilities for the residents or users of the area being developed. In extreme topographical con­ditions, at the discretion of the planning commission, this requirement may be re­duced. 

(2) 	
Only area having minimum dimensions of 50 feet by 100 feet shall qualify for com­putation as usable open space. 


(k) 
Parking requirements. A minimum of two spaces per unit, with two extra spaces for each building with multiple units. 

(l) 
Signs. Permitted sizes and locations of signs within the PD-1 development shall be in compli­ance with the standards established in article III of chapter 5. 

(m) 
Utilities. All utilities, including electric, telephone, gas, water and sewer lines must be buried, except when deemed unfeasible as deter­mined by the city engineer. (Ord. No. 001-2001, § 23.05, 2-13-2001; Ord. No. 8-2005, § 1, 8-11-2005) 


Sec. 23-586. PD-2 planned commercial devel­opment. 
(a) 
Policies guiding development. This district is provided in recognition that many commercial establishments seek to develop within unified commercial areas, usually under single owner­ship and control and typically called "shopping centers." Within the premises of the zone, such centers would have all the necessary services and facilities comprehensively provided in accordance with an approved development plan. Provisions of this zone are formulated to achieve harmoniously designed structures upon a well landscaped site, achieving a high degree of pedestrian-vehicular separation, all of which would be compatible with surrounding land uses. 

(b) 
Permitted uses. Uses included are those permitted, accessory and conditional uses in all commercial districts and O-I office-industrial dis­trict developed in accordance with the approved development plan, but subject to review of the planning commission and the approval of the city council. 


(c) Arrangement and design of commercial uses. 
(1) 	
Commercial buildings and establishments shall be planned as groups having com­mon parking areas and common ingress and egress points in order to reduce the number of potential accident locations at intersections with thoroughfares. 

(2) 	
The plan of the project shall provide for the integrated and harmonious design of buildings and for adequate and properly 


arranged facilities as may be necessary to make the project attractive and efficient from the standpoint of the adjoining and surrounding existing or potential develop­ments. 
(3) 	
The buildings, all facade areas and gen­eral design shall be presented, by com­puter model or artist rendering, so that the concept of the design may be thor­oughly reviewed by the planning commis­sion and city council. This shall include, but not necessarily limited to, the use of brick, hardy plank, or other appropriate construction material on the front facade and side views as might be necessary to enhance the overall appearance of all build­ings proposed to be constructed in the plan. In addition, the plan shall provide information concerning the overhang ad­jacent to the building, common walkways, color schemes to be used, and other simi­lar enhancement features for the develop­ment. 

(4) 	
The construction of buildings shall main­tain a general common theme or design, so as to protect the special integration of the project as much as practicable. Con­crete block shall not be exposed, unless approved. The developer shall furnish a general specification list of materials to be used in the construction of improve­ments to all commercial building and es­tablishments planned for the develop­ment. 



(d) 
Area requirements. The minimum land area for a planned commercial development shall be two acres. 

(e) 
Structure spacing. A minimum of 20 feet shall be required between adjacent principal build­ings. 


(f) Setback and screening. 
(1) 	A setback of at least 50 feet shall be provided along the entire perimeter of the development. However, where the planned development adjoins a business or indus­trial district, the setback and screening requirements shall be at the discretion of the planning commission. 

(2) 	
Where situated adjacent to a residentially zoned area, a minimum of 20 feet along the exterior property line shall be planted with an evergreen hedge or dense plant­ing of evergreen shrubs not less than three feet in height at the time of plant­ing. A landscaped mound adequate to pro­vide screening may be substituted for hedge or shrubs. 

(3) 	
In no case shall screening be placed within 50 feet of a curb cut or intersection. 

(4) 	
Vehicular access through such landscaped strip when leading from residential areas shall be permitted only for convenience of residents of adjoining residential areas, and not designed for use by the general public. 


(g) 
Parking requirements. Standards for park­ing shall be as established in article V, division 3 of this chapter. 

(h) 
Loading and unloading areas. Standards for loading and unloading areas shall be as estab­lished in article V, division 3 of this chapter. 

(i) 
Signs. Standards for the sizes and locations of signs shall be as established in article III of chapter 5. 

(j) 
Utilities. Wherever possible, utilities shall be housed in structures compatible with the de­velopment so as not to detract from the overall aesthetic design. (Ord. No. 001-2001, § 23.06, 2-13-2001; Ord. No. 8-2005, § 1, 8-11-2005) 


Sec. 23-587. PD-3 planned industrial dis­trict. 
(a) Policies guiding development. The provi­sions of this district are provided in recognition that many industrial establishments seek to de­velop within unified industrial areas having all necessary services and facilities comprehensively provided in accordance with a predetermined development plan. As in the planned business zone (PD-2), provisions of this zone are formu­lated to encourage a high degree of coordinated development upon well landscaped premises. Par­ticular attention is devoted to design of the pe­riphery of the development with the objective of achieving compatibility with existing and poten­tial surrounding land uses. 
(b) Permitted uses. The following uses will be permitted in accordance with the approved devel­opment plan:
