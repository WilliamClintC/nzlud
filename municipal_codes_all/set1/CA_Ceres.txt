CERES, CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL CODE 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of 
the City of Ceres, California 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 18, 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation

PREFACE 
The Ceres, California Municipal Code, originally published by Sterling Codifiers, Inc. in 1988, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Municipal Code Corporation, its successor in interest. 
The Code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the title, chapter, and section. Thus, section 2.12.040 is section .040, located in chapter 2.12 of title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by "tens" (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the Code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 18, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific Code provisions by individual section numbers. 
This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance 2017-1043 , passed November 13, 2017.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
This Code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this Code. 
Numbering System. 
The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the Code section number. For example, section 2.04.010 is section .010, in chapter 2.04 of title 2. 
Title. 
A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This Code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, Code adoption and definitions. The titles in this Code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are "Reserved" for later use. 
Chapter. 
Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between Chapter 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
Each section of the Code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the Code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
There are many tables of contents in this Code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the Code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
At the end of each Code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992)) Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the beginning. These history notes can be cross-referenced to the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
The statutory references direct the Code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
When a Code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" Code references in the new Code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the Code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior Code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new Code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
As of Supplement No. 18, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
To find a specific ordinance in the Code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This table tells the reader the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the Code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04)) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the Code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
Beginning with Supplement No. 18 this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
Beginning with Supplement No. 18, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the Code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the Code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this Code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
The index will be updated as necessary when the Code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
Each supplement to the new Code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. This guide will tell the Code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the Code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the Code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
When originally published, this Code was numbered with consecutive page numbers. As it is amended, new material may require the insertion of new pages that are numbered with decimals. (Example: 31, 32, 32.1.) Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) are left unnumbered but the number is "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. We prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM.

2.04.030. - ESTABLISHMENT OF COUNCIL DISTRICTS. 
A.  The districting plan establishing four Council districts shall be approved by the voters of the city at large. The districting plan shall be adjusted by ordinance of the City Council to equalize population among the districts within one year after each census has been completed and the census data provided to the City. The boundaries and the number of each of the four (4) electoral districts for City Council are set forth in Exhibit A, including a map of the districts, which is incorporated herein by reference. Any districting plan shall be adopted by ordinance subject to referendum. The City Clerk is authorized to make non-substantive technical adjustments to the district boundaries not affecting the population of any district, the eligibility of candidates, or the residence of elected officials within any district. 
B.  Each Council district shall be assigned a district number, with districts numbered one through four as indicated in Exhibit A. The districting plan adjusted for census data shall include boundaries for each of the four (4) Council member election districts for use in the November 2017 and November 2019 regular municipal elections. The Council members in districts One and Two shall be elected by district in November of 2017 for a term of four (4) years. The Council members in districts Three and Four shall be elected by district in November 2019 for a term of four (4) years. After the approval of the ordinance from which this Section derived, at the regular municipal election of November 2015 all persons appointed to fill vacancies on the City Council and all persons elected to fill vacancies on the City Council at a special municipal election shall reside within the district to which they are appointed or elected. 
C.  Consistent with the addition of Section 2.04.020B. above, the terms of office of those Council members presently serving whose terms would have expired in 2019, shall instead continue until the certification of the results and administration of the oaths of office after the November 2020 general municipal election. The terms of office of those Council members who would have expired in November 2017, shall instead continue in their offices until certification of the results and administration of the oaths of office after the November 2018 general municipal election. 
D.  A period of transition from at-large elections to District elections will occur from the time of adoption of the first districting plan to the time that the by-district elections are held for all Council member districts. During this period of transition, each Council member elected at-large in the regular municipal election of November 2013 will be designated by the Council as the Council member representing one of Districts One and Two in the districting plan whether or not that Council member resides in the district. The first by-district elections for Districts Three and Four shall occur during the regular municipal election in November 2015. The first by district elections for Districts One and Two shall occur during the regular municipal election in November 2017. Nothing contained herein shall prevent an incumbent Council member at the time of the effective date of the ordinance from which this section derived from running for a Council district in which that Council member resides other than the district for which that member currently holds office, if the councilmember is otherwise eligible to run in that district and vacates the office of Council member for the district of non-residency if elected. No Council member may hold office in more than one district. Each incumbent Council member elected at-large shall be allowed to complete the term for which they were elected regardless of the district of residency so long as they otherwise remain eligible to hold the office and have not been removed for cause or elected to another office. For purposes of this section, "by-district" shall mean that the Council member shall reside within the district and be elected by the voters of that district only. 
(Ord. No. 2017-1038 , § 2, 1-23-2017; Ord. No. 2015-1029, § 1, 12-3-2015)  
2.04.040. - METHOD OF ELECTION. 
A.  Mayor. The Mayor shall continue to be elected at the regular municipal election in November of 2015 and every four (4) years thereafter, by the voters of the City at-large, and must reside within the City boundaries. Beginning in November of 2020, the Mayor shall be elected every four (4) years thereafter, by the voters of the City at-large, and must reside within the City boundaries. The term of the Mayor which would have previously expired in November of 2019, shall instead continue until the certification of the results and administration of the oaths of office after the November 2020 general municipal election. 
B.  District Council members. One member of the City Council shall reside in each of the four (4) electoral districts established by the ordinance from which this Section derived and shall be elected by a vote of the voters of that district only. Each district shall elect one Council member. A Council member of each district must live in that district and must be a registered voter in that district to be eligible to hold the office of Council member for that district, and a candidate for any district must live in that district and must be a registered voter in that district to be eligible to run for the office of Council member for that district. Only voters who live in a district shall be eligible to vote in the election for Council member of that district. Each Council member must reside within the district for the full term of office; termination of residency within the district shall create an immediate vacancy for that Council district unless a substitute residence within the district is established within thirty (30) days of termination of residency. 
C.  The members of the Council in office at the time the ordinance from which this Section derived takes effect shall continue in office until the expiration of their terms and until their successors are elected and qualified. If a tie vote makes it impossible to determine which of two (2) or more candidates has been elected, said tie shall be settled by the drawing of lots, the procedure for which shall be determined by the Council. No candidate shall file for more than one elective office. Any member of the Council may run for the office of Mayor, and upon election as Mayor shall forfeit the office of Council member of any district.

Chapter 3.24 - TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX 
Sections: 
 
3.24.010 - TITLE. 
This tax shall be known as the "uniform transient occupancy tax of the City of Ceres." 
(Ord. 248 § 1, 1964)  
3.24.020 - DEFINITIONS. 
Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this Section govern the construction of this Chapter. 
HOTEL: Any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging house, rooming house, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, mobilehome or house trailer at a fixed location, or other similar structure or portion thereof. 
OCCUPANCY: The use or possession, or the right to the use or possession of any room or rooms or portion thereof, in any hotel for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes. 
OPERATOR: The person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his functions through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this Chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this Chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both. 
PERSON: Any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate, or any other group or combination acting as a unit. 
RENT: The consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and property and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever. 
TAX ADMINISTRATOR: The City Clerk. 
TRANSIENT: Any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other agreement for a period of thirty (30) consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of thirty (30) days has expired unless there is an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy. In determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date of this tax may be considered. 
(Ord. 248 § 2, 1964)  
3.24.030 - TAX IMPOSED. 
For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to and shall pay a tax in the amount of ten percent (10%) of the rent charged by the operator. This tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the City which is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the City. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient's ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the Tax Administrator may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the Tax Administrator. 
(Ord. 2015-1028, § 1, 12-3-2015, eff. 7-1-2016; Ord. 71-377, 1971: Ord. 248 § 3, 1964)

(Ord. 248 § 4, 1964)  
3.24.050 - OPERATOR'S DUTIES. 
Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this Chapter to the same extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent charged, and each transient shall receive a receipt for payment from the operator. No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner provided in Section 3.24.120. 
(Ord. 248 § 5, 1964)  
3.24.060 - REGISTRATION REQUIRED. 
Within thirty (30) days after the effective date of this tax, or within thirty (30) days after commencing business, whichever is later, each operator of any hotel renting occupancy to transients shall register the hotel with the tax administrator and obtain from him a transient occupancy registration certificate to be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on the premises. The certificate shall, among other things, state the following: 
A.  The name of the operator; 
B.  The address of the hotel; 
C.  The date upon which the certificate was issued; 
D.  This transient occupancy registration certificate signifies that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the uniform transient occupancy tax by registering with the Tax Administrator for the purpose of collecting from transients the transient occupancy tax and remitting this tax to the Tax Administrator. This certificate does not authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business or to conduct any lawful business in an unlawful manner, nor to operate a hotel without strictly complying with all local applicable laws, including but not limited to those requiring a permit from any lawful business in an unlawful manner, nor to operate a hotel without strictly complying with all local applicable laws, including but not limited to those requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or office of this City. This certificate does not constitute a permit. 
(Ord. 248 § 6, 1964)  
3.24.070 - REPORTING; REMITTING. 
Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following the close of each calendar quarter, or at the close of any shorter reporting period which may be established by the Tax Administrator, make a return to the Tax Administrator, on forms provided by him, of the total rents charged and received and the amount of tax collected for transient occupancies. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the Tax Administrator. The Tax Administrator may establish shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder if he deems it necessary in order to insure collection of the tax and he may require further information in the return. Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this Chapter shall be held in trust for the account of the City until payment thereof is made to the Tax Administrator.

C.  Fraud: If the Tax Administrator determines that the nonpayment of any remittance due under this Chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of twenty five percent (25%) of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties stated in subsections A and B. 
D.  Interest: In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this Chapter shall pay interest at the rate of one-half of one percent per month or fraction thereof on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until paid. 
E.  Penalties Merged With Tax: Every penalty imposed and such interest as accrues under the provisions of this Section shall become a part of the tax herein required to be paid. 
(Ord. 248 § 8, 1964)  
3.24.090 - FAILURE TO COLLECT AND REPORT. 
Determination of Tax by Tax Administrator: If any operator shall fail or refuse to collect the tax and to make, within the time provided for in this Chapter, any report and remittance of the tax or any portion thereof required by this Chapter, the Tax Administrator shall proceed in such manner as he may deem best to obtain fact and information on which to base his estimate of the tax due. As soon as the Tax Administrator shall procure such facts and information as he is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this Chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect it and to make such report and remittance, he shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by this Chapter. In case such determination is made, the Tax Administrator shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his last known address. Such operator may within ten (10) days after the serving or mailing of such notice make application in writing to the Tax Administrator for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the Tax Administrator shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the Tax Administrator shall give not less than five (5) days' written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in the notice why the amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing the Tax Administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen (15) days unless an appeal is taken as provided in Section 3.24.100. 
(Ord. 248 § 9, 1964)  
3.24.100 - APPEAL PROCEDURE.

The City Council shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and the City Clerk shall give notice in writing to such operator at his last known place of address. The findings of the City Council shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed above for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of notice. 
(Ord. 248 § 10, 1964)  
3.24.110 - PRESERVATION OF RECORDS. 
It shall be the duty of every operator liable for the collection and payment to the City of any tax imposed by this Chapter to keep and preserve, for a period of three (3) years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of such tax as he may have been liable for the collection of and payment to the City, which records the Tax Administrator shall have the right to inspect at all reasonable times.

The claim shall be on forms furnished by the Tax Administrator. 
B.  An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner prescribed by the Tax Administrator that the person from whom the tax has been collected was not a transient; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to the transient or credited to rent subsequently payable by the transient to the operator. 
C.  A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the City by filing a claim in the manner provided in subsection A if tax was paid by the transient directly to the Tax Administrator, or when the transient having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the satisfaction of the Tax Administrator that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax. 
D.  No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this Section unless the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing entitlement thereto.

The tax applicable to gas or gas transportation provided by nonutility suppliers shall be based on the sale price of the gas or gas transportation if that is derived from an arms-length transaction between a nonaffiliated nonutility supplier and the service user.

Chapter 3.46 - NEW RESIDENTIAL DEVELOPMENT SERVICE OPERATIONS FEE 
Sections: 
 
3.46.010 - FINDINGS AND INTENT. 
A.  The goals and policies of the Ceres General Plan include City policies 1.B.1 and 1.B.5 stating that new growth within the City should maintain a positive fiscal balance for the City and mitigate one hundred (100) percent of any operating deficit for the cost of the services and facilities necessary to support such growth. 
B.  The City Council is concerned that new residential development within the City does not generate sufficient revenue to fully pay the cost of providing the City services necessitated by such development. To more accurately identify and quantify the projected service cost of new residential development and its impact upon the City's budget, the City Council engaged the professional services of Economic and Planning Systems Inc. (E.P.S.) for the purpose of preparing a citywide fiscal impact analysis to summarize and analyze the annual operating costs and revenue related to new residential development occurring in the City through the year 2015. 
C.  The final report and analysis of E.P.S. has been completed, and their report entitled, "Ceres Citywide Fiscal Impact Analysis," dated July 14, 2000, (the report) is on file in the office of the City Clerk. The said report is approved, adopted and incorporated into this chapter by reference as though fully set forth herein, including all conclusions and supportive findings. 
D.  The report establishes that City operations and maintenance General Fund expenses to serve new residential development will exceed General Fund revenue generated from new development through the year 2015 based on the provision of current levels of municipal services, thereby creating a shortfall in revenue to provide City services. In addition, the City has determined to increase municipal service levels for certain City services. As a result of the existing shortfall in revenue, and the projected increased service levels, a total shortfall between the cost of services and the revenue generated by new residential development to fund such services in the approximate sum of six hundred fifteen dollars ($615.00) per residential unit will exist, all of which is more fully explained in the reports from the Director of Planning and Community Development dated November 22, 1999 and January 18, 2000, which are on file in the office of the City Clerk and incorporated herein by this reference. 
E.  It is the intent and purpose of the City Council of the City of Ceres that new residential development within the City must pay for the cost of providing services to such development so that existing development will not be subject to a reduced level of service, the financial resources of the City will not be unduly burdened, and the City may continue to maintain orderly residential growth which guarantees the maintenance of essential City services to all citizens. 
F.  To accomplish the City's intent and purpose, and in order to promote and provide for the general health and welfare of its citizens, the City Council finds that it is necessary to impose an annual service operations fee upon new residential development in an amount determined by the City Council and consistent with the "Ceres Citywide Fiscal Impact Analysis" dated July 14, 2000, or any future update or replacement of that analysis. 
(Ord. 939 §§ 1, 2, 2005; Ord. 2000-893 § 1 (part), 2000)  
3.46.020 - IMPLEMENTATION OF RESIDENTIAL SERVICE OPERATIONS FEES. 
A.  In order to mitigate the negative impact of the cost of providing services to new residential development, each new subdivision, parcel map, or other discretionary approval for the development of real property for residential use shall be required, as a condition of development, to participate in the establishment of a community facilities district for the purpose of imposing a residential service operations fee, or if such district has been previously established, to annex the proposed residential project to the existing district. 
B.  The community facilities district shall be established, or properties shall be annexed to an existing district, pursuant to the provisions of California Government Code Sections 53318, et seq. The precise amount of the annual residential services operations fee to be levied against those properties included within the district shall be determined at the time of the initial formation of the district and in accordance with the statutes and laws applicable to the levying of such fees.

Chapter 4.05 - DISPOSAL OF PHARMACEUTICAL CONTROLLED SUBSTANCES 
 
4.05.010 - DECLARATION OF PURPOSE. 
Unwanted, unused or expired pharmaceutical controlled substances, and commonly known prescription drugs are a public safety, public health and environmental hazard because they can fall into the hands children or criminals, or be introduced to the environment through improper disposal. 
Experience has shown that parents, patients, and others in possession of such prescription drugs will take advantage of opportunities for the safe and secure disposal of such prescription drugs. 
One way in which citizens can be provided an opportunity is to place a secure drop box in the lobby of the Ceres Police Department or any other facility designated by the Chief of Police, for the safe disposal of unwanted, unused or expired pharmaceutical controlled substances. 
The Department of Justice has advised that for the purposes of Federal Regulation of Controlled Substances, the City Council, pursuant to Title 21 Code of Federal Regulation part 1301.24(a)(2) may authorize the Chief of Police and his/her designees to possess pharmaceutical controlled substances in the performance of his/her duties. This Chapter will enable the Chief of Police to operate a prescription drug drop box inside the lobby of the Ceres Police Department or other facilities designated by the Chief of Police, upon Council approval by Resolution. 
(Ord. No. 2017-1042 , § 1, 7-24-2017)  
4.05.020 - OPERATION OF PRESCRIPTION DRUG DROP BOX. 
In accordance with the purpose and provisions of Title 21 Code of Federal Regulation part 1301.24(a)(2), the Chief of Police and his/her designee are authorized to possess pharmaceutical controlled substances in the performance of his/her duties.

5.04.020 - PURPOSE. 
This Chapter is enacted solely to raise revenues for Municipal purposes, and is not intended for regulation. 
(Ord. 69-310, 1969)  
5.04.030 - EFFECT ON OTHER LICENSE LAWS. 
Persons required to pay a license tax for transacting and carrying on any business under this Chapter shall not be relieved from the payment of any license tax for the privilege of doing such business required under any other ordinance of the City, and shall remain subject to the regulatory provisions of other ordinances. 
(Ord. 69-310, 1969)  
5.04.040 - REQUIRED; EXCEPTION. 
There are imposed upon the businesses, trades, professions, callings and occupations specified in this Chapter license taxes in the amounts hereinafter prescribed. It is unlawful for any person to transact and carry on any business, trade, profession, calling or occupation in the City without first having procured a license from the City so to do and paying the tax hereinafter prescribed or without complying with any and all applicable provisions of this Chapter. 
This Section shall not be construed to require any person to obtain a license prior to doing business within the City if such requirement conflicts with applicable statutes of the United States or of the State of California. Persons not so required to obtain a license prior to doing business within the City nevertheless shall be liable for payment of the tax imposed by this Chapter. 
(Ord. 69-310, 1969)  
5.04.050 - BRANCH ESTABLISHMENTS. 
A separate license must be obtained for each branch establishment or location of the business transacted and carried on and for each separate type of business at the same location, and each license shall authorize the licensee to transact and carry on only the business licensed thereby at the location or in the manner designated in such license; provided that warehouses and distributing plants used in connection with and incidental to a business licensed under the provisions of this Chapter shall not be deemed to be separate places of business or branch establishments; and provided further that any person conducting two (2) or more types of businesses at the same location and under the same management, but which businesses use a single set or integrated set of books and records, may, at his option, pay only one tax calculated on all gross receipts of the businesses under the schedule that applies to the type of business of such person which requires the highest percentage payment on such gross receipts as set pursuant to Section 5.04.400. 
(Ord. 92-800, 1992: Ord. 69-310, 1969)  
5.04.060 - EVIDENCE OF BUSINESS ACTIVITY. 
When any person shall, by use of signs, circulars, cards, telephone book, or newspapers, advertise, hold out, or represent that he is in business in the City, or when any person holds an active license or permit issued by a governmental agency indicating that he is in business in the City, and such person fails to deny by a sworn statement given to the collector that he is not conducting a business in the City, after being requested to do so by the collector, then these facts shall be considered prima facie evidence that he is conducting a business in the City. 
(Ord. 69-310, 1969)  
5.04.070 - CONSTITUTIONAL APPORTIONMENT. 
None of the license taxes provided for by this Chapter shall be so applied as to occasion an undue burden upon interstate commerce or be violative of the equal protection and due process clauses of the Constitutions of the United States and the State of California. 
In any case where a license tax is believed by a licensee or applicant for a license to place an undue burden upon interstate commerce or be violative of such constitutional clauses, he may apply to the collector for an adjustment of the tax. Such application may be made before, at, or within six (6) months after payment of the prescribed license tax. The applicant shall, by sworn statement and supporting testimony, show this method of business and the gross volume or estimated gross volume of business and such other information as the collector may deem necessary in order to determine the extent, if any, of such undue burden or violation. The collector shall then conduct an investigation, and, after having first obtained the written approval of the City Attorney, shall fix as the license tax for the applicant, an amount that is reasonable and nondiscriminatory, or if the license tax has already been paid, shall order a refund of the amount over and above the license tax so fixed. In fixing the license tax to be charged, the collector shall have the power to base the license tax upon a percentage of gross receipts or any other measure which will assure that the license tax assessed shall be uniform with that assessed on businesses of like nature, so long as the amount assessed does not exceed the license tax as prescribed by this Chapter. Should the collector determine the gross receipts measure of license tax to be the proper basis, he may require the applicant to submit, either at the time of termination of applicant's business in the City, or at the end of each three (3) month period, a sworn statement of the gross receipts and pay the amount of license tax therefor, provided that no additional license tax during any one calendar year shall be required after the licensee shall have paid an amount equal to the annual license tax as prescribed in this Chapter. 
(Ord. 69-310, 1969)  
5.04.080 - EXEMPTIONS. 
Nothing in this Chapter shall be deemed or construed to apply to any person transacting and carrying on any business exempt by virtue of the Constitution or applicable statutes of the United States or of the State of California from the payment of such taxes as are herein prescribed. 
Any person claiming an exemption pursuant to this Section shall file a sworn statement with the collector stating the facts upon which exemption is claimed, and in the absence of such statement substantiating the claim, such person shall be liable for the payment of the taxes imposed by this Chapter. 
The collector shall, upon a proper showing contained in the sworn statement, issue a license to such person claiming exemption under this Section without payment to the City of the license tax required by this Chapter. 
The collector, after giving notice and a reasonable opportunity for hearing to a licensee, may revoke any license granted pursuant to the provisions of this Section upon information that the licensee is not entitled to the exemption as provided herein. By a majority vote, the Council may waive fees for nonprofit organizations. 
Any public utility or franchisee possessing a franchise granted by the City, and making an annual payment under the franchise, shall not be subject to the provisions of this Chapter.

The collector shall not issue to any such person another license for the same or any other business, until such person shall have furnished to him the sworn statement and paid the license tax as herein required.

(the '"Act"), and the rules of the California Public Utilities Commission promulgated thereunder that are applicable to a "local franchising entity" or a "local entity" as defined in Sections 5830(h) and 5830(k) of the California Public Utilities Code, respectively. Consistent with that purpose, the provisions of this Chapter are to be construed in a manner that is consistent with the California Public Utilities Code and the applicable rules of the Commission promulgated thereunder.

However, the three (3) month period shall be tolled by any period during which the designation or provision of PEG channel capacity is technically infeasible, including any failure or delay of the incumbent cable operator to make adequate interconnection available, as required by the Act. Any state franchise holder who believes that the designation or provision of PEG channel capacity is technically infeasible, shall provide to City, in writing, its reasons therefore and its plan for correcting or solving the infeasibility. City may hold a hearing on the claim of infeasibility and, thereafter, take such action as City deems proper to require the designation and provision of the PEG channels on the state franchise holder's system.

Chapter 5.34 - CHARITABLE SOLICITATIONS* 
Sections: 
 
5.34.010 - PURPOSE. 
The City Council finds: 
A.  That numerous persons have been and are soliciting funds and property in the City on the representation that such funds are to be used for charitable purposes when in truth and in fact such funds and property are being used either wholly or in a large part for the private profit of individuals making or promoting such solicitations; that a number of fraudulent and misleading representations are employed in many solicitations; that deliberate imitations of the names, slogans, and familiar devices of great and worthy charities are fraudulently imposed upon the public; that, as the result of pernicious activities, honest and needed charities are suffering from a suspicion engendered by these practices and that residents in this City have in many cases been defrauded and imposed upon for lack of adequate protection. 
B.  That access to information concerning persons making charitable solicitations, and to information which fully discloses the uses for which contributed funds are proposed to be used or have been used by persons making charitable solicitations will provide a means for residents of the City to protect themselves from being misled and from making contributions to unworthy persons; that there is no good or compelling reason why persons soliciting charitable contributions should not fully and fairly disclose the convictions for fraud or dishonesty of persons making charitable solicitations, the method of conducting charitable solicitations, the use of funds obtained and related matters; that such information concerning persons making charitable solicitations, their activities and their purposes, should be obtained by the coordinator and be made freely available to any interested person; and that, to promote the purposes of this Section, the coordinator should publicize the availability of such information as well as publicizing the general nature and extent of charitable solicitation activity in the City. 
C.  That the public safety, peace, comfort, and convenience demands the exercise of the police power of this City to prevent fraudulent solicitations and to promote legitimate solicitations for charitable purposes.

5.34.020 - DEFINITIONS.

CHARITABLE CONTRIBUTION: The transfer or giving of anything of value intended by the donor to be a gift to a charitable organization or for a charitable purpose and includes a gift under the guise of a loan and any payment in excess of the "direct benefit cost" of an item received in return.

It does not mean an appeal for contributions if the appeal: 
A.  Is confined and directed exclusively to the membership of an organization which is the recipient of the contributions; or 
B.  Is for the relief of an individual specified by name at the time of solicitation where the solicitor represents that the entire amount collected, without any deductions whatever, shall be turned over to the name beneficiary; or 
C.  Is made for a contribution to be used for the direct aid or support of a church or religion, or for a political party or organization; however, a request by a religious or political organization for a contribution to be used for charitable purpose is a "charitable solicitation."

PERSON: Any individual, firm, partnership, corporation, association, society or other organization, and includes any trustee, receiver, assignee, agent, or other similar representative thereof.

A.  The furnishing of water and sewer service, and the collection and disposal of municipal solid waste, as provided in this Code, shall constitute municipal services and shall be charged as such. Each consumer of municipal services shall receive a common bill for water, sewer and municipal solid waste, which bill shall designate the amount charged for each such municipal service.

A penalty often percent (10%) of the amount of the bill shall be added and the service shall be subject to termination as provided in this Section. 
C.  1.  If all or a part of the bill for municipal services is not paid, the City may terminate any and all service for which the bill is rendered, provided notice and opportunity to present objections to the bill is first given as provided in this subsection. 
2.  Prior to the termination of water, sewer or municipal solid waste services for the nonpayment of all or part of any bill for municipal services, the Director of Finance shall cause a notice to be mailed to the user at his or her last known address. The notice shall state the amount of the delinquent account and shall advise the user that services will be terminated within fifteen (15) days from the date of the notice unless the account is paid in full by that date. The notice shall further provide that the user may request a hearing before the Director of Finance to present any objections to the bill, provided the hearing is requested in writing and presented to the Director of Finance with the fifteen (15) day period required by the notice. If a request for hearing is presented in the manner and within the time required by the notice, service shall not be terminated until the hearing has been held and a determination has been made by the Director of Finance. 
Immediately upon the receipt of a request for hearing, the Director of Finance shall set a date and time for the hearing and shall notify the user of the date and time of hearing either personally or by mail at the last known address. The hearing shall be set not less than five (5) days and not more ten (10) days from the receipt of the written request for hearing. 
At the hearing the user shall be afforded an opportunity to present any objections to the bill or the termination of service. At the conclusion of the hearing, the Director of Finance shall rule on the objections, make any corrections to the bill that are warranted, and determine if service should be terminated. If the Director of Finance determines that the objections are without merit and that the bill is correct, services shall be terminated within twenty-four (24) hours of the ruling. If the Director of Finance determines that the bill is incorrect, the user shall be advised of the correct amount of the bill, and if the adjusted bill is not paid within twenty-four (24) hours, service shall be terminated. 
If services are terminated, they shall not be resumed until all delinquent charges are paid plus a reasonable service charge for reconnection of service, which shall be set from time to time by resolution of the City Council. 
D.  The procedure for terminating utility services for nonpayment as provided in this Section shall not apply to the termination of water service of residential customers.

E.  Owner ResponsibilityLien: Unpaid fees for municipal solid waste services shall be a charge against the owner of the property if the services are in the name of the owner, and a lien against the property for which the services were rendered. Such charge may be added to and collected with the tax charges or assessments for the current year, and the property may be sold in the same manner as sale of property pursuant to the laws of the State. 
F.  Alternative Connection: In lieu of filing a lien on the property of owner-occupied residences and for all other customers receiving municipal services, the City may hire a collection agency to secure payment of the bill and any applicable charges.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has determined that tobacco smoke is a major source of indoor air pollution, and the Surgeon General's 1986 report on "The Health Consequences of Involuntary Smoking," concludes that exposure to tobacco smoke places healthy nonsmokers at increased risk for developing lung cancer. Other health hazards of involuntary smoking include respiratory infection, bronchoconstriction and bronchospasm. While all members of the population are truly at increased risk due to exposure to sidestream tobacco smoke, it constitutes a special health hazard for children, the elderly, and people with chronic lung disorders. 
B.  The Surgeon General labels smoking "the largest single preventable cause of death and disability for the U.S. population." 
C.  Employees subject to prolonged exposure to sidestream smoke in the workplace have been found in scientifically conducted studies to experience a loss of job productivity and some have been forced to take periodic sick leave because of reactions to secondhand smoke. Furthermore, studies have shown higher costs to the employer are associated with smoking in the workplace due to increases in absenteeism, accidents, costs of medical care, loss of productivity and cleaning and maintenance requirements. A recent scientific study has reported that sidestream smoke from tobacco may cause a significant amount of cardiovascular disease in the United States and that the number of deaths from this cause may exceed the deaths caused by lung disease associated with sidestream smoke. Smoking in public places and workplaces is a major cause of fires and damage to merchandise and equipment, as well as costly maintenance and repairs to furniture and fixtures. 
D.  The health care costs produced by smoking-related ailments and diseases constitute a heavy and avoidable financial drain on our community. 
E.  Air pollution caused by smoking is an offensive annoyance and irritant. Smoking results in serious and significant physical discomfort to nonsmokers and constitutes a health hazard in public places and workplaces.

9.40.015 - SPECIAL PROVISIONS FOR REGULATION OF VACANT AND BOARDED BUILDINGS/ PURPOSE. 
The Council finds that neglected, vacant buildings are a major cause of blight in residential and non-residential neighborhoods. Vacant buildings often attract transients and criminals, including drug users and prostitutes. Use of vacant buildings by transients and criminals, who may employ primitive cooking or heating methods, creates a risk of fire for the vacant building and adjacent properties. Vacant properties are often used as dumping grounds for drug paraphernalia, furniture, tires, garbage, junk and debris and are often overgrown with weeds and grass creating a wide variety of health and safety concerns. In addition, vacant buildings which are simply boarded up for long periods of time with plywood or other materials to prevent entry by transients or vandals very often discourage economic development, disrupting neighborhood stability, retarding appreciation of property values and promoting blight conditions, all of which interfere with the rights of neighboring property owners and occupants to the full use and enjoyment of their property. 
The City currently expends resources monitoring and responding to vacant buildings, because of the numerous health, welfare, safety and economic problems caused by neglected, vacant buildings. There is already a substantial cost to the City for monitoring neglected, vacant buildings (whether or not those buildings are boarded up) as well as substantial toll on the citizens who are affected by the nuisance conditions created. Therefore the City Council finds there is an urgent need to refine the process by which these buildings are monitored and remediated. 
Boarded buildings are a major cause and source of crime and blight in both residential and non-residential neighborhoods. In addition, vacant buildings which are boarded and unkept, and which are vacant for long periods of time, discourage economic development and retard appreciation of property values. 
A.  Boarded BuildingDefined: For the purpose of this Chapter, the term "boarded building" shall mean a vacant building some or all of whose doors and windows and other openings have been covered with plywood or other material for the purpose of preventing entry into the building. 
B.  Method of Boarding: If an owner or responsible party chooses or is required to board up the windows and doors and other openings of a building in order to prevent entry by others, the materials used to board up the building shall be painted to match the color of the existing building. 
All windows, doors and openings shall be secured as per the board up specifications maintained by the City's Community Development Department. All plywood used must be five-eights ( 5/8 ) inch except the security door which shall be three-fourths (¾) inch. Removable glass sections must be removed and placed inside the house. 
C.  Boarded or Vacant BuildingTime Period/Maintenance: 
1.  No responsible party shall allow a building to stand vacant for more than sixty (60) days, unless one of the following applies: 
a.  The building is the subject of an active building permit and the owner is progressing diligently to repair the premises for occupancy. 
b.  The building meets all codes, and is actively being offered for sale, lease, or rent. 
c.  The building is being maintained in a safe and orderly manner and does not contribute to blight conditions. 
d.  Maintenance in a sate and orderly manner shall include: 
(1)  Maintenance of any landscaping and plant materials in good condition. 
(2)  Maintenance of the exterior of the building, including but not limited to paint and finishes, in good condition. 
(3)  Regular removal of all exterior trash, debris and graffiti. 
(4)  Maintenance of the building in continuing compliance with all applicable codes and regulations. 
D.  Vacant Building Monitoring Fee: 
1.  Fee Imposed: There is imposed upon every owner of a vacant building an annual vacant building monitoring fee in an amount to be set by resolution of the City Council. The fee shall not exceed the estimated reasonable cost of monitoring the vacant building. The fee shall be payable as to any building, residential or nonresidential, which is vacant for more than one hundred twenty (120) days for any reason. 
2.  Fee Waiver: The vacant building monitoring fee may be waived by the building official upon a showing by the owner that: 
a.  The owner has obtained a building permit and is progressing diligently to repair the premises for occupancy, or 
b.  The building meets all applicable codes and is actively being offered for sale, lease or rent, or 
c.  Imposition of the fee would impose a substantial economic hardship on the owner or would hinder the rehabilitation of the building. 
d.  The building is being maintained in a safe and orderly manner and does not contribute to blight conditions. 
3.  Procedure: The vacant building monitoring fee shall be billed to the owner of the property and mailed to the owner's address as set forth on the last equalized assessment roll of the county assessor. 
Any owner billed may apply for a waiver on the grounds set forth in subsection Db of this section by submitting a written statement of the grounds for the waiver, and the owner's daytime telephone number, to the building official within thirty (30) days after the billing is mailed to the owner. The building official shall review the written statement and may contact the owner to discuss the application for waiver. The building official shall prepare a written decision which shall be mailed to the owner. 
Any owner who disagrees with the decision of the building official may submit a written notice of appeal to the building official within thirty (30) days of receipt of the building official's decision. Failure to timely appeal the decision of the building official relating to a denial of a waiver constitutes a waiver of all rights to an administrative hearing and determination of the matter subject only to review pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.5. 
If the fee is not paid within sixty (60) days after billing, or within sixty (60) days after the decision of the building official or after the decision upon appeal by the owner becomes final, the fee may be specially assessed against the property involved and made a personal obligation of the owner. If the fee is to be specially assessed against the property, a hearing officer, as designated by the City Manager, shall confirm the assessment and thereafter said assessment may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary real property taxes are collected and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary real property taxes. All laws applicable to the levy, collection, and enforcement of real property taxes are applicable to the special assessment. 
The designated hearing officer may also cause a notice of lien to be recorded. The notice shall, at a minimum, identify the record owner or possessor of the property, set forth the last known address of the record owner or possessor, a description of the real property subject to the lien, and the amount of the fee. 
(Ord. 2000-891 § 3, 2000)  
9.40.120 - SEVERABILITY. 
If any section, subsection, sentence, clause, phrase or other part of this Chapter is for any reason held to be unconstitutional or otherwise invalid such decision shall not affect the validity of the remaining portions of this Chapter. The Council of the City of Ceres hereby declares that it would have enacted this Chapter and each section, subsection, sentence, clause and phrase thereof irrespective of the fact that any one or more sections, subsections, sentences, clauses or phrases or other parts be declared unconstitutional or otherwise invalid. 
(Ord. 96-854, 1996)  
Chapter 9.42 - ADULT BUSINESSES* 
Sections: 
 
9.42.010 - FINDINGS. 
The City Council hereby finds that: 
A.  The City Council, in adopting this Ordinance, takes legislative notice of the existence and content of the following studies concerning the adverse secondary side effects of adult businesses in other cities: Garden Grove, California (1991); Tucson, Arizona (1990); Seattle, Washington (1989); Austin, Texas (1986); Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (1986); Indianapolis, Indiana (1984); Houston, Texas (1983); Beaumont, Texas (1982); Minneapolis, Minnesota (1980); Phoenix, Arizona (1979); Whittier, California (1978); Amarillo, Texas (1977); Cleveland, Ohio (1977); Los Angeles, California (1977). The City Council finds that these studies are relevant to the problems addressed by the City in enacting this Chapter to regulate the adverse secondary side effects of adult businesses, and more specifically finds that these studies provide convincing evidence that: 
1.  Adult businesses are linked to increases in the crime rates in those areas in which they are located and in surrounding areas. 
2.  Both the proximity of adult businesses to sensitive land uses and the concentration of adult businesses tend to result in the blighting and deterioration of the areas in which they are located. 
3.  The proximity and concentration of adult businesses adjacent to residential, recreational, religious, educational and other adult business uses can cause other businesses and residences to move elsewhere. 
4.  There is substantial evidence that an increase in crime tends to accompany, concentrate around, and be aggravated by adult businesses, including, but not limited to, an increase in the crimes of narcotic distribution and use, prostitution, pandering, and violence against persons and property. The studies from other cities establish convincing evidence that adult businesses which are not regulated as to permissible locations often have a deleterious effect on nearby businesses in residential areas, causing, among other adverse secondary effects, an increase in crime and a decrease in property values. 
B.  Based on the foregoing, the City Council finds and determines that special regulation of adult businesses is necessary to ensure that their adverse secondary side effects will not contribute to an increase in crime rates or to the blighting or deterioration of the areas in which they are located or surrounding areas. The need for such special regulations is based upon the recognition that adult businesses have serious objectionable operational characteristics, particularly when several of them are concentrated under certain circumstances or located in direct proximity to sensitive uses such as parks, schools, churches, thereby having a deleterious effect upon the adjacent areas. It is the purpose and intent of these special regulations to prevent the concentration of adult businesses and thereby prevent such adverse secondary side effects. 
C.  The locational requirements established by this Chapter do not unreasonably restrict the establishment or operation of constitutionally protected adult businesses in the City, and a sufficient reasonable number of appropriate locations for adult businesses are provided by this Chapter. 
D.  In developing this Chapter, the City Council has been mindful of legal principles relating to regulation of adult businesses and does not intend to suppress or infringe upon any expressive activities protected by the First Amendments of the United States and California Constitutions, but instead desires to enact reasonable time, place, and manner regulations that address the adverse secondary effects of adult businesses. The City Council has considered decisions of the United States Supreme Court regarding local regulation of adult businesses, including, but not limited to: Young v. American Mini Theaters, Inc. , 427 U.S. 50 (1976) (Reh. denied 429 U.S. 873); Renton v. Playtime Theaters , 475 U.S. 41 (1986) (Reh. denied 475 U.S. 1132); FW/PBS, Inc. v. Dallas, 493 U.S. 215 (1990); Barnes v. Glenn Theater , 501 U.S. 560 (1991); United States Court of Appeals 9th Circuit decisions, including, but not limited to: Topanga Press, et al. v. City of Los Angeles , 989 F.2d 1524 (1993); several California cases including, but not limited to: City of National City v. Wiener , 3 Cal.4th 832 (1993); People v. Superior Court Lucero) , 49 Cal.3d 14 (1989); and City of Vallejo v. Adult Books, et al. , 167 Cal.App.3d 1169 (1985); and other Federal cases including Lakeland Lounge v. City of Jacksonville (5th Cir. 1992) 973 F.2d 1255, Hang On, Inc. v. Arlington (5th Cir. 1995) 65 F.3d 1248, Mitchell v. Commission on Adult Entertainment (3rd Cir. 1993) 10 F.3d 123, International Eateries v. Broward County (11th Cir. 1991) 941 F. 2d 1157, and Star Satellite v. City of Biloxi (5th Cir. 1986) 779 F.2d 1074. 
E.  The City Council also finds that locational criteria alone do not adequately protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of the City, and thus certain requirements with respect to the ownership and operation of adult businesses are in the public interest. In addition to the findings and studies conducted in other cities regarding increases in crime rates, decreases in property values and the blighting of areas in which such businesses are located, the City Council also takes legislative notice of the facts recited in the case of Kev, Inc. v. Kitsap County , 793 F.2d 1053 (1986), regarding how live adult entertainment results in secondary effects such as prostitution, drug dealing, and other law enforcement problems. 
F.  The City Council finds the following, in part based upon its understanding of the documents and judicial decisions in the public record: 
1.  Evidence indicates that some dancers, models and entertainers, and other persons who publicly perform specified sexual activities or publicly display specified anatomical parts in adult businesses (collectively referred to as "performers") have been found to engage in sexual activities with patrons of adult businesses on the site of the adult businesses; 
2.  Evidence has demonstrated that performers employed by adult businesses have been found to offer and provide private shows to patrons who, for a price, are permitted to observe and participate with the performers in live sex shows; 
3.  Evidence indicates that performers at adult businesses have been found to engage in acts of prostitution with patrons of the establishment; 
4.  Evidence indicates that fully enclosed booths, individual viewing areas, and other small rooms whose interiors cannot be seen from public areas of the establishment regularly have been found to be used as a location for engaging in unlawful sexual activity; 
5.  As a result of the above, and the increase in incidents of AIDS and hepatitis B, which are both sexually transmitted diseases, the City has a substantial interest in adopting regulations which will reduce, to the greatest extent possible, the possibility for the occurrence of prostitution and casual sex acts at adult businesses. 
G.  Zoning, licensing and other police power regulations are legitimate, reasonable means of accountability to help protect the quality of life in the community of Ceres and to help assure that all operators of adult businesses comply with reasonable regulations and are located in places that minimize the adverse secondary effects which naturally accompany the operation of such businesses. 
H.  The City Council recognizes the possible harmful effects on children and minors exposed to the effects of such adult businesses and the deterioration of respect for family values, and the need and desire of children and minors to stay away from and avoid such businesses, which causes children to be fearful and cautious when walking through or visiting the immediate neighborhood of such businesses; and the City Council desires to minimize and control the adverse secondary side effects associated with the operation of adult businesses and thereby protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of Ceres; protect the citizens from increased crime; preserve the quality of life; preserve property values and the character of surrounding neighborhoods and businesses; deter the spread of urban blight and protect against the threat to health from the spread of communicable and sexually transmitted diseases. 
I.  It is not the intent of the City Council in enacting this Chapter, or any provision thereof, to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material, and the City recognizes that State law prohibits the distribution of the obscene materials and expects and encourages law enforcement officials to enforce State obscenity statutes against such illegal activities in the City. 
J.  Nothing in this Chapter is intended to authorize, legalize, or permit the establishment, operation, or maintenance of any business, building, or use which violates any City ordinance or any statute of the State regarding public nuisances, unlawful or indecent exposure, sexual conduct, lewdness, obscene or harmful matter or the exhibition or public display thereof. 
K.  The City finds the following in part, based upon its understanding of the documents and judicial decisions in the public record: 
1.  Evidence indicates that some dancers, models and entertainers, and other persons who publicly perform specified sexual activities or publicly display specified anatomical parts in adult businesses, as those terms are defined in Section 9.42.020 of this Chapter, (collectively referred to as "performers") have been found to engage in sexual activities with patrons of adult businesses on the site of the adult business; 
2.  Evidence has demonstrated that performers employed by adult businesses have been found to offer and provide private shows to patrons who, for a price, are permitted to observe and participate with the performers in live sex shows; 
3.  Evidence indicates that performers at adult businesses have been found to engage in acts of prostitution with patrons of the establishment; and 
L.  In prohibiting public nudity in adult businesses, the City Council does not intend to proscribe the communication of erotic messages or any other communicative element or activity, but rather only to prohibit public nudity due to the secondary impacts associated with such public nudity; and 
M.  The City Council also finds, as a wholly independent basis, that it has a substantial public interest in preserving societal order and morality and that such interest is furthered by a prohibition on public nudity; and 
N.  While the City Council desires to protect the rights conferred by the United States Constitution to adult businesses, it does so in a manner that ensures the continued and orderly development of property within the City and diminishes, to the greatest extent feasible, those undesirable secondary effects which the aforementioned studies have shown to be associated with the development and operation of adult businesses; and 
O.  In enacting a nudity limitation, the City declares the limitation is a regulatory licensing provision and not a criminal offense. The City has not provided a criminal penalty for a violation of the nudity limitation. The City adopts such a limitation only as a condition of issuance and maintenance of an adult business permit issued pursuant to this Code; and 
P.  The City Council finds that preventing the exchange of money between entertainers and patrons also reduces the likelihood of drug and sex transactions occurring in adult businesses; and 
Q.  Requiring separations between entertainers and patrons reduces the likelihood that such persons will negotiate narcotics sales and/or transact sexual favors within the adult business. 
R.  Enclosed or concealed booths and dimly lit areas within adult businesses greatly increase the potential for misuse of the premises, including unlawful conduct of a type which facilitates transmission of disease. Requirements that all indoor areas be open to view by management at all times, and that adequate lighting be provided, are necessary in order to reduce the opportunity for, and therefore the incidence of, illegal conduct within adult businesses, and to facilitate the inspection of the interior of the premises thereof by law enforcement personnel. 
(Ord. 97-867, 1997: Ord. 96-859, 1996)  
9.42.015 - PURPOSE. 
It is the intent of this Chapter to prevent community-wide adverse economic impacts, increased crime, decreased property values, and the deterioration of neighborhoods which can be brought about by the concentration of adult businesses in close proximity to each other or proximity to other incompatible uses such as schools for minors, churches, and residentially zoned districts or uses. The City Council finds that it has been demonstrated in various communities that the concentration of adult businesses causes an increase in the number of transients in the area, and an increase in crime, and, in addition to the effects described above, can cause other businesses and residents to move elsewhere. It is, therefore, the purpose of this Chapter to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the concentration of adult businesses or their close proximity to incompatible uses, while permitting the location of adult businesses in certain areas. 
It is also the purpose of this Chapter to regulate adult businesses in order to promote the health, safety, morals, and general welfare of the citizens of the City. The provisions of this Chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including adult-oriented materials. Similarly, it is not the intent nor effect of this Chapter to restrict or deny access by adults to adult-oriented materials protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors and exhibitors of adult-oriented entertainment to their intended market. Neither is it the intent nor effect of this Chapter to condone or legitimize the distribution of obscene material.

Chapter 9.44 - GRAFFITI 
Sections: 
 
9.44.010 - PURPOSE. 
The purpose of this Chapter is to provide programs for removal of graffiti from public and private property within the City and to establish regulations designed to prevent and control the spread of graffiti in Ceres. 
The City finds and determines that the increase of graffiti on public and private buildings, structures and other places creates a condition of blight within the City which can result in the deterioration of property values, business opportunities and enjoyment of life for persons using adjacent and surrounding properties. The City further finds and determines that graffiti is inconsistent with the City's property maintenance goals, crime prevention programs and aesthetic standards, and unless graffiti is quickly removed from public and private properties, other properties soon become the targets of graffiti. 
The City finds and declares that it is the right of every person, regardless of race, color, creed, religion, national origin, sex, age or handicap to be secure and protected from intimidation and physical harm caused by the activities associated with the application of graffiti and/or tagging and the property destruction done by said graffiti and/or tagging. It is not the intent of this Chapter to interfere with the exercise of the constitutionally protected rights of freedom of expression and association.

B.  If none of the operators on the rotation list have the necessary skills or equipment to handle a specific task, the Department may request service from any other person or company capable of handling the request. A deviation from the normal rotation for such reason shall not cause a loss of rotation turn by either the operator who was determined to be incapable or not properly equipped for handling the request or by another rotation operator who does respond. In the event that the Director, or his authorized representative, determines that there is an emergency, the provisions of this Chapter shall not apply and the Department may obtain towing service from any source deemed appropriate.

(Ord. 95-838, 1995)  
12.16.060 - REMOVAL. 
A.  No person shall remove or relocate any street tree without prior authorization issued by the Public Works Department of the City. A street tree may be removed by the City for any of the following reasons: 
1.  Visual Obstruction: A tree obstructing sight distance necessary for safe operation of vehicles at street intersections, or obscuring in an otherwise incurable manner any traffic or railroad crossing signal or other safety device;

B.  Upon removal of such tree (or trees), the City shall replace the tree with a tree of a species approved by the Department. Tree replacement may not be required when the location would be in conflict with drives, walks or other construction permitted in public rights of way, planting strips, or which is not suitable for planting. A written release signed by the City, stating the reason for not requiring a replacement, shall be issued. 
C.  In the event a property owner desires to remove a tree from the planting strip or easement abutting his property, he or his authorized agent shall make application to the Department. The Director shall determine whether or not such tree is required to be retained in order to preserve the intent and purpose of this Chapter. In making his determination, the Director shall consider the inconvenience or hardship which retention of the tree would cause the property owner, and consider also the condition, age, desirability of variety and location of the tree. If the Director finds that the tree may be removed without violating the intent and spirit of this Chapter, he may authorize the property owner to remove such tree at his own expense and liability. If a permit is granted for removal of a street tree, all removal work shall be completed within sixty (60) days from the date of issuance of the permit, and shall be under the general supervision of, and in accordance with, rules established by the Director.

Any tree or part thereof growing upon private property that is not a City tree and interferes with the use of any street and, in the opinion of the Director, endangers the life, health, safety or property of the public utilizing the street shall be declared a public nuisance. If the owner of such private property does not correct or remove such nuisance within ten (10) days after receipt of written notice thereof from the Director, the Director may cause the nuisance to be abated. The cost of the abatement shall be paid by the owner within ten (10) days after being notified of the cost thereof. Nothing contained in this Section shall be deemed to impose any liability upon the City, its officers or employees, nor to relieve the owner of any private property from the duty to keep any tree upon his property or under his control in such a condition as to prevent it from constituting a public nuisance as defined in this Section. Nothing in this Section shall preclude the immediate removal or abatement by City forces of any obstruction, nuisance or overhang that is a public safety hazard. 
(Ord. 95-838, 1995)

13.05.050 - CLASSIFICATION OF WELLS. 
All wells within the City of Ceres will be placed into one of the three following classifications: "Active Well," "Inactive Well," "Abandoned or Unused Well." 
A.  Active Well: An active well is a well that has been utilized at least once in the preceding twelve months for the extraction of groundwater. If the pump from an active water well has been removed for repair or replacement, the well is still considered to be an active well. During the repair period, the well shall be adequately covered to prevent injury to people and to prevent the entrance of undesirable water or foreign matter. 
B.  Inactive or Standby Well: An inactive or standby well means a well that has not been used for a period of one year or more for the production of groundwater, but is maintained in such a condition that it could be so used, or a monitoring well maintained for such use, or a cathodic protection well maintained for such use. 
1.  Wells used for monitoring are considered inactive wells so long as they are maintained for this purpose. However, such wells shall be in compliance with this chapter and bear an appropriate cap with the label, "Monitoring Well," and the name of the agency or organization using the well. It shall be securely locked when not in use. 
2.  Cathodic protection wells or test wells deep enough to promote interaquifer transfer of groundwater shall be considered inactive wells as long as they remain functional. 
C.  Abandoned or Unused Well: An abandoned or unused well may be defined under one or more of the following: 
1.  A well, other than a monitoring well, which has been out of service continuously for one year or more, and does not meet the definition of a standby well. 
2.  A monitoring well from which no measurement or sample has been taken for a period of three years. 
3.  A well which is in such a state of disrepair that it cannot be made operational for its intended purpose. 
4.  A test hole or exploratory boring twenty-four (24) hours after construction and testing work has been completed. 
5.  A cathodic protection well that is no longer functional for its original purpose. 
6.  Any boring that cannot be satisfactorily completed as a well. The final determination as to the status of a well will be made by the City.

A.  The purpose of this Chapter is to facilitate the maximum beneficial use of the City's sewer services and facilities while preventing blockages of the sewer lines resulting from discharges of fats, oils, and grease (FOG) into the public sewer, and to specify appropriate fog discharge requirements for food service establishments (FSES) as defined herein. 
B.  This Chapter shall apply to both direct and indirect discharge of wastewater containing FOG carried to the public sewer. 
C.  The provisions set forth in this Chapter are designed to ensure compliance with federal, state and local laws and regulations, and to allow the City to meet applicable standards. 
D.  This Chapter also establishes quantity and quality standards of all discharges containing FOG, which may alone or collectively cause or contribute to FOG accumulation in the sewer facilities causing or potentially causing or contributing to the occurrence of sanitary sewer overflows (SSOs). 
(Ord. No. 2009-995, § 1, 10-12-2009)  
13.14.020 - DEFINITIONS. 
Unless otherwise defined herein, terms related to water quality shall be as adopted in the latest edition of Standard Methods for Examination of Water and Wastewater, published by the American Public Health Association, the American Water Works Association and the Water Environment Federation. Testing procedures for waste constituents and characteristics shall be as provided in 40 Code of Federal Regulations 136. 
Subject to the foregoing, the meaning of the terms used in this Chapter shall be as follows: 
BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES (BMPs): Activities, prohibitions, maintenance procedures and other management practices to prevent or reduce the direct or indirect introduction of FOG into the public sewer. 
CHANGE IN OPERATIONS: Any change in the ownership, food types, or operational procedures that have the potential to change the amount of FOG discharged by FSEs in an amount that alone or collectively causes or creates a potential for SSOs to occur. 
CITY: The City of Ceres, a municipal corporation. 
COLLECTION SYSTEM: Portions of the public sewer consisting of all pipes, sewers and conveyance systems conveying wastewater to the publicly owned treatment works (POTW), excluding privately owned sewer service lateral line connections. 
COMPLIANCE SCHEDULE: A time schedule, enforceable under the provisions of this Chapter, that contains increments of progress (e.g., milestones, in the form of dates). These milestones shall be for the commencement and/or completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment facilities or the implementation of policies, procedures or operational management techniques required for permittees to comply with all applicable federal, state or local environmental regulations which may directly or indirectly affect the quality of the permittee's wastewater. 
COMPOSITE SAMPLE: A collection of individual samples obtained at selected intervals based on an increment of either flow or time. The resulting mixture (composite sample) forms a representative sample of the waste stream discharged during the sample period. 
DIRECTOR: The City's Director of Public Works or his or her authorized representative. 
DISCHARGER: Any person who discharges or causes a discharge of wastewater directly or indirectly to the public sewer. 
EFFLUENT: Any wastewater outflow from a FSE or privately owned sewer service lateral that is discharged into the public sewer. 
ENFORCEMENT OFFICER: Any City employee or agent of the City with authority to enforce the provisions of this Chapter and the authority to make any decision, on behalf of the Director, required or called for by this Chapter. 
FATS, OILS, AND GREASE (FOG): Any substance such as vegetable or animal product that is used in, or is a byproduct of, the cooking or food preparation process, and that becomes or may become viscous, or solidifies or may solidify, with a change in temperature or other conditions. 
FOG WASTEWATER DISCHARGE PERMIT (FOG WDP): A permit issued by the City, subject to the requirements and conditions established by the City, authorizing a permittee to discharge wastewater from a FSE into the public sewer. 
FOOD GRINDER: Any device installed in the plumbing or sewage system for the purpose of grinding food or food waste. 
FOOD SERVICE ESTABLISHMENT (FSE): A facility, including but not limited to, any commercial entity within the boundaries of the City, operating in a permanently constructed structure such as a room, building or place, or portion thereof, maintained, used or operated for the purpose of storing, preparing, service or manufacturing, packing or otherwise handling food for sale to other entities, or for consumption by the public, its members or employees, and which has any process or device that uses or produces FOG, or grease vapors, steam, fumes, smoke or odors that are required to be removed by an exhaust hood pursuant to California Health and Safety Code section 114149.1 or in accordance with the California Uniform Retail Food Facilities Law (CURFFL) (California Health and Safety Code sections 113700 et seq.). A limited food preparation establishment is not considered an FSE when engaged only in reheating, hot holding, or assembly of ready to eat food products, provided that there is no wastewater discharge containing a significant amount of FOG. 
GRAB SAMPLE: A sample taken from a waste stream on a one-time basis without regard to the flow in the waste stream and without consideration of time.

No person shall discharge, or cause to be discharged, any wastewater from FSEs directly or indirectly into the public sewer without first obtaining a FOG WDP pursuant to this Chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2009-995, § 1, 10-12-2009)  
13.14.040 - FOG DISCHARGE LIMITATION. 
No FSE shall discharge FOG, or cause FOG to be discharged into the public sewer that causes an SSO or that may accumulate and/or cause or contribute to blockages in the public sewer or the public sewer lateral which connects the FSE to the public sewer. 
(Ord. No. 2009-995, § 1, 10-12-2009)  
13.14.050 - PUBLIC SEWER OVERFLOWS; PUBLIC NUISANCE; ABATEMENT ORDERS AND CLEANUP COSTS. 
Any FSE determined by the Director to have contributed to a sewer blockage, SSO or any public sewer obstruction resulting from the discharge of wastewater or waste containing FOG, shall be ordered to install and maintain a grease interceptor, and may be subject to a plan to abate the nuisance created by sewer line failures and blockages, SSOs or any other public sewer obstruction. SSOs may cause threat and injury to public health, safety, and welfare of life and property and are hereby declared public nuisances. Furthermore, sewer lateral failures and SSOs caused by FSEs alone or collectively, are the responsibility of the private property owner, FSE, and individuals who are responsible officers or owners of the FSE. If the Director determines that the public health and safety require the City to act immediately to contain and clean up any SSO caused by blockage of a private or public sewer lateral or system serving an FSE, or if the City so acts at the request of the property owner or operator of the FSE, or because of the failure of the property owner or FSE to abate the condition causing immediate threat of injury to the health, safety, welfare, or property of the public, the City's costs for such abatement may be entirely borne by the property owner or the owner/operator of the FSE, and individuals who are responsible officers or owners of the FSE and may constitute a debt to the City, due and payable upon the City's request for reimbursement of such costs depending upon the Director's determination of the cause of the SSO. 
(Ord. No. 2009-995, § 1, 10-12-2009)  
13.14.060 - BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES (BMPS) REQUIRED. 
Every FSE shall implement BMPs in its operations, in accordance with the requirements and guidelines established by the Director, to minimize the discharge of FOG to the grease control device and/or the public sewer. Detailed requirements for BMPs shall be specified in the FOG WDP and all FSEs are required, at a minimum, to comply with the BMPs set forth therein as well as any additional BMPs established by the Director. BMPs may include, but are not limited to, kitchen practices and employee training procedures that are essential in minimizing FOG discharge to the public sewer.

D.  No FOG that has accumulated in a grease interceptor shall be allowed to pass into any sewer lateral, public sewer, storm drain or public right-of-way, or onto the surface of any street or parking area. 
E.  The Director may require any FSE with a grease interceptor to submit data and information necessary to establish the required maintenance frequency of the grease interceptor. 
F.  The required maintenance frequency for every FSE with a grease interceptor shall be determined in one of the following methods: 
1.  Grease interceptors shall be fully pumped out and cleaned at a frequency such that the combined FOG and solids accumulation in the grease interceptor does not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the total designed hydraulic depth of the grease interceptor. This is to ensure that the minimum hydraulic retention time and required available hydraulic volume is maintained to effectively intercept and retain FOG from being discharged to the public sewer. 
2.  Every FSE with a grease interceptor shall fully pump out and clean its grease interceptor not less than once every six (6) months. 
3.  Grease interceptors shall be fully pumped out and cleaned quarterly when the frequency described in Subsection 13.14.120F.1. has not been established. The maintenance frequency shall be adjusted when sufficient data have been obtained to establish an average frequency based on the requirements described in Subsection 13.14.120F.1. and guidelines adopted by the City pursuant to the FOG control program. The City may change the required maintenance frequency at any time to reflect changes in actual operating conditions in accordance with the FOG control program. Based on the actual generation of FOG from the FSE, the required maintenance frequency may increase or decrease. 
4.  The owner, operator or FOG WDP permittee of an FSE may submit a request to the Director for a change in the required maintenance frequency at any time. The FSE has the burden of responsibility to demonstrate that the requested change in frequency reflects actual operating conditions based on the average FOG accumulation over time and meets the requirements described in Subsection 13.14.120F.1., and that it is in full compliance with the conditions of its FOG WDP and this Chapter. Upon determination by the Director that the requested revision is justified, the FOG WDP shall be revised accordingly to reflect the change in required maintenance frequency. 
5.  If the grease interceptor, at any time, contains FOG and solids accumulation exceeding the requirements described in Subsection 13.14.120F.1., the FSE shall be required to have the grease interceptor serviced immediately such that all FOG, and other materials are completely removed from the grease interceptor. If deemed necessary, the Director may also increase the required maintenance frequency of the grease interceptor. 
G.  Wastewater, accumulated FOG, floating materials, sludge/solids, and other materials removed from the grease interceptor shall be disposed of by waste haulers at an approved disposal site in accordance with all applicable federal, state, and/or local laws. 
H.  The Director may direct City staff to service an FSE's grease interceptor if, in the opinion of the Director, the FSE has failed to comply with the terms of the FOG WDP or with this chapter. The FSE shall be responsible for any and all expenses of the City in undertaking such work. 
(Ord. No. 2009-995, § 1, 10-12-2009)  
13.14.130 - VARIANCE AND WAIVER OF GREASE INTERCEPTOR OR GREASE TRAP REQUIREMENT. 
A.  Variance From Grease Interceptor or Grease Trap Requirements. An FSE may request that the Director grant a variance from the grease interceptor or grease trap requirement to allow alternative pretreatment technology in lieu of a grease interceptor or grease trap, if the FSE demonstrates that the alternative equals or exceeds the effectiveness of a grease interceptor or grease trap, and that it is impossible or impracticable to install, operate or maintain a grease interceptor or a grease trap. The Director's determination to grant a variance will be based upon, but not limited to, evaluation of the following conditions: 
1.  There is no adequate space for installation and/or maintenance of a grease interceptor or a grease trap. 
2.  There is no adequate slope for gravity flow between kitchen plumbing fixtures and the grease interceptor or the grease trap and/or between the grease interceptor or the grease trap and the private collection lines or the public sewer. 
3.  The FSE can prove that the alternative pretreatment technology is equally or more effective than a grease interceptor or a grease trap in controlling its FOG discharge. In addition, the FSE must be able to demonstrate, after installation of the proposed alternative pretreatment, its effectiveness to control FOG discharge through downstream visual monitoring of the public sewer, for at least three (3) months, at its own expense. A variance may be granted if the results show no visible accumulation of FOG in its lateral and/or tributary downstream sewer lines. Any variance issued pursuant to this Section may be revoked at any time in the discretion of the Director. 
B.  Conditional Waiver of Requirement to Install Grease Interceptor or Grease Trap. A conditional waiver of the requirement to install a grease interceptor or a grease trap may be granted for FSEs that the Director determines to have negligible FOG discharge and insignificant impact to the public sewer. Although a waiver from installation of a grease interceptor or a grease trap may be granted, the FSE may be required to provide space and plumbing segregation for future installation of a grease interceptor or a grease trap. The Director's determination to grant or revoke a conditional waiver shall be based upon, but not limited to, evaluation of the following conditions: 
1.  Quantity of FOG discharge as measured or indicated by the size of the FSE based on water usage, menu, seating capacity, number of meals served, amount of on-site consumption of prepared food, number of plumbing fixtures and other conditions that may reasonably be shown to contribute to FOG discharges; 
2.  Adequacy of implementation of BMPs and compliance history; 
3.  Sewer size, grade, condition based on visual and other information, FOG deposition in the sewer by the FSE, and history of maintenance and SSOs caused by FOG from the FSE; 
4.  Changes in operations that significantly affect FOG discharge; and 
5.  Any other condition that the Director deems reasonably related to the generation of FOG discharges. 
C.  Waiver of Grease Interceptor or Grease Trap Installation Requirement With a Grease Disposal Mitigation Fee. Where the installation of a grease interceptor or a grease trap is not feasible and no equivalent alternative pretreatment can be installed, an FSE may be granted a waiver of the grease interceptor or grease trap requirement upon the payment of a grease disposal mitigation fee as described in Section 13.14.160. Additional requirements may also be imposed to mitigate the discharge of FOG into the public sewer. The Director's determination to grant the waiver upon the payment of a grease disposal mitigation fee will be based upon, but not limited to, evaluation of the following conditions: 
1.  There is inadequate space for installation and/or maintenance of a grease interceptor or a grease trap. 
2.  There is inadequate slope for gravity flow between kitchen plumbing fixtures and the grease interceptor or the grease trap and/or between the grease interceptor or grease trap and the private collection lines or the public sewer. 
3.  A variance from grease interceptor or grease trap installation to allow alternative pretreatment technology cannot be granted. 
D.  Application for Variance or Waiver of Requirement for Grease Interceptor or Grease Trap. 
An FSE may submit to the City of Ceres Wastewater Division an application for waiver or variance from the grease interceptor or grease trap requirement. The FSE bears the burden of demonstrating that the installation of a grease interceptor or a grease trap is not feasible or otherwise required. Upon determination by the Director that reasons are sufficient to justify a variance or waiver, the FOG WDP will be issued or revised to include the variance or waiver and relieve the FSE from the requirement. 
E.  Terms and Conditions of Variance or Waiver. 
A variance or waiver shall contain the terms and conditions that serve as the basis for its issuance. A variance or waiver may be revoked by the Director at any time upon his or her determination that any of the terms or conditions for its issuance is not satisfied or if the conditions upon which the variance or waiver was based have changed so that the justification for the variance or waiver no longer exists. The variance or waiver shall be valid so long as the FSE remains in compliance with the terms and conditions until the expiration date specified in the variance or waiver. 
(Ord. No. 2009-995, § 1, 10-12-2009)

13.14.160 - GREASE DISPOSAL MITIGATION FEE. 
Any FSE that operates without a grease control interceptor or a grease trap may be required to pay an annual grease disposal mitigation fee to equitably cover the costs of increased maintenance of the public sewer as a result of the FSE's inability to adequately remove FOG from its wastewater discharge. This Section shall not be interpreted to allow new construction or an existing FSE undergoing remodeling and/or a change in operations to operate without an approved grease interceptor or a grease trap unless the Director has determined that it is impossible or impracticable to install and/or operate a grease control interceptor or a grease trap for the subject facility under the provisions of Section 13.14.130 of this Chapter. 
A.  The grease disposal mitigation fee shall be established annually by the Director, and shall be based on the estimated annual increased cost of maintaining the public sewer for inspection and removal of FOG and other viscous or solidifying agents attributable to the FSE resulting from the lack of a grease interceptor and/or a grease trap. 
B.  The grease disposal mitigation fee may be waived or reduced, not more frequently than annually, when the discharger demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the Director that the discharger has used BMPs and waste minimization practices on a regular basis that have significantly reduced the introduction of FOG into the public sewer. 
C.  The grease disposal mitigation fee may not be waived or reduced when the FSE does not comply with the minimum requirements of this Chapter and/or its discharge into the public sewer in the preceding twelve (12) months has caused or potentially caused or contributed, alone or collectively, sewer blockage or SSOs in the sewer downstream, or in the area surrounding the FSE, in the twelve (12) months prior to the waiver request.

(Ord. No. 2015-1030, § 1, 6-22-2015)  
13.18.120 - REDUCTION OF POLLUTANTS IN STORM WATER. 
Any person engaged in activities that may result in pollutants entering the storm water conveyance system shall, to the maximum extent practicable, undertake the measures set forth below to reduce the risk of non-storm water discharge and/or pollutant discharge. 
A.  Business-related Activities. 
1.  Storm Water Pollution Prevention Plan. The enforcement official may require any business in the City engaged in activities that may result in pollutant discharges to develop and implement a storm water pollution prevention plan, which shall include an employee training program. An employee training program is a documented employee training program that may be required to be implemented by a business pursuant to a storm water pollution prevention plan, for the purpose of educating its employees on methods of reducing discharge of pollutants to the storm water conveyance system. Business activities that may require a storm water pollution prevention plan include, but are not limited to, maintenance, storage, manufacturing, assembly, equipment operations, vehicle loading or fueling, or cleanup procedures carried out partially or wholly out of doors. 
2.  Coordination with Hazardous Materials Release Response Plans and Inventory. Any business requiring a hazardous materials release response and inventory plan, under Chapter 6.95 (commencing with Section 25500) of Division 20 of the California Health and Safety Code, shall include in that plan provisions for compliance with this Chapter, including the provisions prohibiting non-storm water discharges and illegal discharges, and requiring the release of pollutants to be reduced to the maximum extent practicable. 
3.  Coordination with Hazardous Waste Generator Contingency Plan and Emergency Procedures. Any business requiring a hazardous waste generator contingency plan and emergency procedures, pursuant to California Code of Regulations, Title 22, Sections 66265.51 to 66265.56, shall include in that plan provisions for compliance with this Chapter, including the provisions prohibiting non-storm water discharge and illegal discharges, and requiring the release of pollutants to be reduced to the maximum extent practicable. 
B.  Construction. 
1.  Any person performing construction activities in the City shall prevent pollutants from entering the storm water conveyance system and comply with all applicable Federal, State and local laws, ordinances or regulations, including but not limited to, the current California NPDES General Permit for storm water discharges associated with construction activity (Construction General Permit) and the City Storm Water Management and Discharge Control Ordinance. All construction projects, regardless of size, having soil disturbance or activities exposed to storm water must, at a minimum, implement BMPs for erosion and sediment controls, soil stabilization, dewatering, source controls, pollution prevention measures, and prohibited discharges. 
2.  Any person subject to a construction activity NPDES storm water discharge permit shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the enforcement official prior to, or as a condition of, a subdivision map, site plan, building permit, grading permit, or development or improvement plan, upon inspection of the facility, during any enforcement proceeding or action, or for any other reasonable cause. Prior to issuance of a construction permit or approval of the proposed improvement plans, for projects subject to the State's current Construction NPDES General Permit, the WDID number and the SWPPP shall be submitted to the City. For projects with less than an acre of soil disturbance or not subject to the Construction General Permit, an erosion and sediment control plan (ESCP) and the ESCP worksheet must be submitted to the City. 
3.  As required by its Phase II MS4 NPDES Permit, the City will conduct storm water compliance inspections at applicable construction sites that have areas of soil disturbance exposed to storm water. The inspection will be conducted by a City Inspector or agent working for the City who is a Qualified SWPPP Practitioner (QSP) or is supervised by a QSP. The inspection will evaluate the construction site's compliance to the City's storm water ordinances. Inspections will be billed by the City to the project owner. The following is the risk rating system and inspection frequency the City will use, which is analogous to the risk rating used by the California Construction General Permit. 
 Projects not subject to the CGP or that have an erosivity waiver will have a pre-soil disturbance inspection and a project completion inspection. 
 Projects that are Risk 1/LUP Type I or Risk 2/LUP Type 2 will have a pre-soil disturbance inspection, monthly inspections, and a project completion inspection. 
 Projects that are Risk 3/LUP Type 3 will have a pre-soil disturbance inspection, bimonthly (twice per month) inspections, and a project completion inspection. 
If a project has been issued two (2) consecutive notices of violation or does not correct a previously issued notice of violation by the due date set by the inspector, the project's "threat to water quality" will be elevated by the City to the next highest category. This elevation of risk will not affect the risk rating for the Construction General Permit. 
C.  Development. The enforcement official may require controls as appropriate to minimize the long-term, post-construction activity discharge of storm water pollutants from new development(s) or modifications to existing development(s). Controls may include source control measures to prevent pollution of storm water, treatment controls designed to remove pollutants from storm water, low-impact development measures, and/or hydro modification measures to offset the difference between the pre- and post-construction peak flow runoff rates and volumes. Proponents of all applicable development and redevelopment projects will be required to meet the requirements and design standards specified in the current State of California Phase II MS4 NPDES Permit and as described in further detail in the City's Storm Water Design Standards Manual for New Development and Redevelopment. 
At the earliest planning stages, project proponents shall assess and evaluate how site conditions, such as soils, vegetation, and flow paths will influence the placement of buildings and paved surfaces. The evaluation will be used to optimize the site layout to meet the goals of capturing and treating runoff. Each project proponent will submit a map of the project dividing the site into discrete drainage management areas to show in each how runoff will be managed using site design measures, source controls, treatment controls, and hydro modification measures as defined by the current MS4 permit. All site design measures, source controls, treatment controls, and hydro modification measures must be selected, sized, and situated in accordance with the guidance provided in the current MS4 permit and the City's Storm Water Design Standards Manual for New Development and Redevelopment. Documentation of the site's post-construction storm water design measures must be submitted to the City's Planning Department for review and approval prior to the commencement of the project. 
Project proponents must sign an operation and maintenance agreement in which they legally bind themselves to maintain the installed post-construction design measures in an effective and good operational condition until the property ownership is transferred. A written operation and maintenance plan for the proposed storm water design measures is required to be submitted to and approved by the City with the signed agreement. The agreement will be recorded with the deed by the County Clerk making it transferrable to the new owner; or, when there are multiple property owners responsible for the maintenance of the control measures, the agreement will consist of a legally binding covenant between the City and the homeowners' association or maintenance district. The owner or association responsible for the maintenance of the control measures may be required by the City to submit an annual self-certification that the storm water control measures are effective and are being maintained in accordance with the submitted and approved operation and maintenance plan. 
D.  Compliance with Industrial or Construction Activity Storm Water Permit. 
1.  Any person subject to the State's current Industrial NPDES General Permit for storm water discharge shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the enforcement official upon inspection of the facility; during any enforcement proceeding or action; or for any other reasonable cause. 
2.  Any person subject to the State's current Construction NPDES General Permit for storm water discharge shall comply with all provisions of such permit. Proof of compliance with said permit may be required in a form acceptable to the enforcement official prior to or as a condition of a subdivision map, site plan, building permit, and development or improvement plan; upon inspection of the facility; during any enforcement proceeding or action; or for any other reasonable cause. 
E.  Compliance with Best Management Practices. Every person or entity, including the above-listed categories, undertaking any activity or use of premises that may cause or contribute to storm water pollution or contamination or illicit discharges shall comply with best management practice (BMPs) consistent with the California Storm Water Quality Association (CASQA) Best Management Practice Handbooks or equivalent guidelines. 
(Ord. No. 2015-1030, § 1, 6-22-2015)  
13.18.130 - CONTAINMENT AND NOTIFICATION OF SPILLS. 
Any person owning or occupying a premises, who has knowledge of any release of pollutants or non-storm water discharge from or across those premises that might enter the storm water conveyance system, other than a release or discharge that is permitted by this Chapter, shall immediately take all reasonable action to contain and abate the release of pollutants or non-storm water discharge, and shall notify the enforcement official at City of Ceres within twenty-four (24) hours of the release of pollutants or non-storm water discharge. 
(Ord. No. 2015-1030, § 1, 6-22-2015)  
13.18.140 - INSPECTION AUTHORITY. 
A.  Right of Entry.

The special assessment may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary County taxes are collected, and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as are provided for ordinary County taxes. A notice of abatement lien shall be recorded and shall become a lien on the property pursuant to the provisions of California Government Code Section 25845. The Director of Public Works is authorized to prepare and record a notice of release of lien against the legal title of the subject property(ies), if the administrative fine or penalty is paid in full. 
4.  Emergency Orders and Abatements. 
a.  The enforcement official may order the immediate abatement of any discharge from any source to the storm water conveyance system when, in the opinion of the enforcement official, the discharge causes or threatens to cause a condition that presents an imminent danger to the public health, safety, welfare or environment, or a violation of a NPDES permit. Abatement and cleanup of spills, illicit discharges, or dumping to the storm drainage system must occur within seventy-two (72) hours of notification; or sooner for high risk spills or discharges. For areas of uncontrolled pollutant sources, abatement must be performed within thirty (30) days of notification. 
b.  In emergency situations where the property owner or other responsible party is unavailable and time constraints are such that service of a notice and order to abate cannot be effected without presenting an immediate danger to the public health, safety, welfare or environment, or a violation of a NPDES permit, the City may perform or cause to be performed such work as shall be necessary to abate the threat or danger, or permit violation. 
c.  The costs of any such abatement shall be borne by the property owner, and shall be collectable in accordance with the provisions of subsection C.6. 
d.  The enforcement official may order the immediate cessation of any activities that cause an illicit discharge or cause or potentially cause uncontrolled pollutants to enter the storm water conveyance system when, in the opinion of the enforcement official, the activities present an imminent danger to the public health, safety, welfare or environment, or a violation of a NPDES permit. Activities may not resume until the enforcement official has verified that the threat to the environment and the City's MS4 has been abated. 
5.  Appeal. 
a.  Any person served with a notice and order to abate, or administrative citation, or required to perform monitoring, analyses, reporting and/or corrective activities by an authorized enforcement official, or disputing the costs of enforcement, or otherwise grieved by the decision of the authorized enforcement official, may file a written appeal with the Public Works Director within ten (10) days following the effective date of the notice and order, administrative citation, the enforcement official's decision or the delivery of an invoice for enforcement costs. 
b.  Upon receipt of the written appeal, the Director of Public Works shall request a report and recommendation from the authorized enforcement official, and shall set the matter for hearing at the earliest practical date. 
c.  Due notice of the hearing shall be provided to the person appealing. 
d.  At the hearing, the Director of Public Works may hear additional evidence, and may reject, affirm or modify the authorized enforcement official's decision, or the costs of enforcement. 
e.  Upon conclusion of the hearing, the director shall serve written notice of his or her decision in the manner provided for service of a notice and order to abate herein. The Director of Public Works shall present the decision to the City Council, and the board may adopt such decision, with or without modification, without further notice of hearing. 
f.  If all parties involved (at a minimum, the discharger and the City enforcement official) agree that clean-up activities cannot be completed within the original timeframe, a new timeframe may be set as long as notification is made by the City to the Regional Water Quality Control Board in writing within five (5) business days of the determination that the timeframe requires revision. 
6.  Enforcement Costs Recovery. 
a.  The cost of enforcement, abatement and restoration shall be borne by the owner of the property, and the costs therefore shall be invoiced to the owner of the property. Costs recoverable herein include all costs of abatement incurred by the City, including, but not limited to, administrative costs, and any and all costs incurred in the physical abatement (California Government Code Section 25845). 
b.  If the owner of the property fails to pay the costs upon demand by the City, the City Council may order the costs to be specially assessed against the parcel. The special assessment may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary County taxes are collected, and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as are provided for ordinary County taxes. The City Council may also authorize a notice of abatement lien to be recorded. The costs shall become a lien on the property pursuant to the provisions of California Government Code Section 25845.

PERMIT ISSUANCE. The application, plans and specifications filed by an applicant for a permit shall be checked by the Building Official. Such plans may be reviewed by other departments of the City to check compliance with the laws and ordinances under their jurisdiction. If the Building Official is satisfied that the work described in an application for a permit and the plans filed therewith conform to the requirements of this Code and other pertinent laws and ordinances, and that the fee established by the City Council has been paid, he/she shall issue a permit therefore to the applicant. 
When the Building Official issues the permit, he/she shall endorse in writing, or stamp, on both sets of plans and specifications, "ACCEPTED FOR CONSTRUCTION." Such approved plans and specifications shall not be changed, modified, or altered without authorization from the Building Official, and all work shall be done in accordance with the approved plans. 
The Building Official may issue a permit for the construction of part of a building or structure before the entire plans and specifications for the entire building or structure have been submitted to be approved, provided adequate information and detailed statements have been filed complying with all pertinent requirements of this Code. The holder of such permit shall proceed at his or her own risk, without assurance that the permit for the entire building or structure will be granted. 
A permit shall not be issued for any new building or structure, or for any building or structure which changes the occupancy as herein defined, when said building is located on property abutting a public road, street, or alley for which improvement standards have been fixed and designated, until additional right of way for the improvement of all roads, streets, or alleys adjoining the property shall be dedicated and the improvements installed and accepted by the City, except as follows:

On garages or carports of four hundred (400) square feet or less, the dedications and improvements shall be constructed on the full street and/or alley frontage(s) to be used by the vehicle when entering and/or exiting the garage or carport. Where improvements are required pursuant to this Section, the Building Official may issue a permit to the applicant, if an agreement to dedicate right of way with an approved security is given to insure the construction of improvements, which is accepted by the City Engineer.

PERMIT EXPIRATION AND EXTENSION: Every permit issued by the Building Official under the provisions of this Code shall expire by limitation and become null and void if the building or work authorized by such permit is not completed within two (2) years from date of issuance. After expiration and before such work can be recommenced, a new permit shall first be obtained to do so, and the fee therefore shall be one-half the amount required for a new permit for such work, provided no changes have been made or will be made in the original plans and specifications for such work; and provided further, that such expiration has not exceeded one year. In order to renew action on a permit after expiration of more than one year, the permit holder shall pay a new full permit fee. 
Any permit holder, holding an unexpired permit may, prior to the expiration of such permit, submit a request in writing to the Building Official for an extension of the permit. Upon the timely receipt of such request by the Building Official, the Building Official may grant a one-year extension of the permit upon the payment of the required fee for the extension, which fee shall be established by resolution of the City Council. No permit shall be extended more than twice.

2.  EXPIRATION OF PLAN CHECK: Applications for which no permit is issued within one hundred eighty (180) days following the date of application shall expire by limitation, and plans submitted for checking may thereafter be returned to the applicant or destroyed by the Building Official. The Building Official may extend the time for issuance of a permit for a period not exceeding one hundred eighty (180) days, upon written request filed by the applicant, prior to the expiration of the initial one hundred eighty (180) days, showing that circumstances beyond the control of the applicant have prevented action from being taken. In order to renew action on an application after expiration, the applicant shall resubmit plans and pay a new plan check fee. 
The Building Official may extend the time for issuance of a permit beyond three hundred sixty (360) days, provided no changes have been made or will be made in the original plans and specifications for such work; no changes have been made or will be made in the building codes that are applicable to such work; no changes have been made or will be made in development plans which would affect such work; and provided that such extensions will not prevent the addition of new City fees.

Chapter 16.08 - PUBLIC FACILITIES FEES 
Sections: 
 
16.08.010 - PURPOSE, FINDINGS, AND DECLARATION OF INTENT. 
A.  In order to implement the goals and objectives of the Ceres General Plan and to mitigate impacts caused by new development within the City, public facilities fees are necessary. The fees are needed to finance public facilities and to assure that new developments pay their fair share for these improvements. 
B.  Title 7, chapter 5, section 66000 et seq. of the California Government Code provides that public facilities fees may be enacted and imposed on development projects. The City Council finds and determines that: 
1.  New development projects cause the need for construction, expansion or improvement of public facilities within the City. 
2.  Funds for construction, expansion or improvement of public facilities are not available to accommodate needs caused by development projects which results in inadequate public facilities within the City. 
C.  The City Council finds that the public health, safety, peace, morals, convenience, comfort, prosperity and general welfare will be promoted by the adoption of public facilities fees for construction, expansion or improvement of public facilities. 
D.  Failure to enact public facilities fees will subject City residents to conditions detrimental to their health and/or safety. 
(Ord. 90-769, 1990: Ord. 90-763, 1990)  
16.08.012 - ADMINISTRATION OF PUBLIC FACILITY FEES.

Chapter 18.15 - PARKING AND STORAGE OF RECREATIONAL VEHICLES IN RESIDENTIAL ZONES 
 
18.15.010 - PURPOSE. 
The purpose of this Chapter is to establish reasonable rules and regulations regarding the parking and storage of recreational vehicles on both existing and new residential properties in order to promote to general health, safety and welfare of the citizens of this community. 
It is the intention of the City Council to make a distinction between existing residential properties and new residential properties regarding the degree to which the parking and storage of recreational vehicles is restricted. 
In this regard, to City Council has determined that existing residential properties typically have less or inadequate area for the parking and storage of recreational vehicles because to homes located thereon were often constructed on smaller lots with minimal side yard setback areas. In addition, the Council further finds that residents of existing residential properties have made substantial investments in recreational vehicles and desire to park and store their vehicles at their residence in the same fashion that they have done over many years. 
The City Council also finds: (1) that new residential properties within residential zones which are required to have a minimum twelve foot (12¢) interior side yard setback and are often constructed on larger lots, typically have ample space on the side yard and/or in a third garage for the parking and storage of recreational vehicles; (2) that purchasers of new residential properties within the PC zones are often on smaller lots and have covenants, conditions and restrictions to specifically prohibit on-site parking and storage of recreational vehicles; and (3) that purchasers of new residential properties are able to determine in advance of their purchase of the property whether or not they will acquire a recreational vehicle given the restrictions on parking and storage of such vehicles. 
Therefore, it is the intention of the City Council to provide in this Chapter rules and regulations which are less strict for existing residential properties, and rules and regulations which are more strict for new residential properties.

The above enumerated architectural features may also extend into any rear yard up to fifty percent (50%) of the rear yard area if the total yard requirements are met. 
C.  Accessory Structures: 
1.  Lot Coverage Calculation: The maximum allowable square footage for accessory structures which may be permitted on a single-family lot shall be based on the following: 
a.  Step 1: Maintain the current lot coverage percentage per the residential zone district where it only applies to the dwelling footprint. When the dwelling footprint has reached the maximum percentage per the zone district, an additional ten percent (10%) shall be permitted for accessory structures.

(Ord. 78-515, 1978)  
18.50.220 - TIME LIMITS FOR DEVELOPMENTS. 
A.  Time Limit: An approved use permit shall be valid for a period of eighteen (18) months from the effective date of approval or for the same period of time as any tentative map or parcel map approved in conjunction with the use permit unless a different time period is specified by the Planning Commission in its action approving the use permit. During this period an applicant must exercise the use permit by taking those actions needed to develop the property (e.g., obtain a building permit) or use the property (e.g., occupy the property) as authorized by and in accordance with the approved use permit or apply for a time extension. The approved use permit shall be deemed expired and rendered null and void if no action is taken to exercise the use permit by the applicant at the end of this period. Once exercised by completing those actions needed to develop or use the property in accordance with the approved use permit, the development, use or activity authorized by the approved use permit shall be considered to be established and shall be permitted to continue for an indefinite period of time or for that period of time specified in the Planning Commission's approval; provided, that the development, use or activity is consistent with the conditions of approval and all other applicable regulations. A determination regarding whether an approved use permit has been fully exercised and is considered to be established shall be determined on a case by case basis where an approved use permit authorizes more than one development, use or activity on a property, or where an approved use permit authorizes a phased development project and the actions taken by the applicant to exercise the permit are limited in scope to only a portion of the property. 
B.  Extension of Time Limit: Provided that an application is made prior to the expiration of the approved use permit, an approved use permit may be extended by 1) the Planning Manager for a period not to exceed ninety (90) days, or 2) the Planning Commission for a period not to exceed twelve (12) months without further hearing upon showing of good cause. The Planning Manager shall report any such time extensions to the Planning Commission at its next regularly scheduled meeting. The Planning Commission may at its discretion, add or revise the original conditions of approval when approving a time extension of a previously approved use permit. The filing of an application to extend the time period of an approved use permit shall automatically extend the life of the approved use permit for a period of sixty (60) days or until a decision is reached by either the Planning Manager or Planning Commission to authorize an extension of time, whichever comes first. The term of the approved use permit shall automatically be extended for that period of time during which a development moratorium, defined in Government Code Section 66452.6, prevents the approved use permit from being exercised. 
C.  For any previously approved development project, whether the project is approved by a use permit, architectural and site plan approval, or other discretionary approval document, the approval of which is set to expire prior to March 1, 2014, the Planning Commission shall have the discretionary power to approve up to a three-year extension of the project approval date. Application for an extension must be requested in writing prior to the expiration of the project approval. This subsection C. of Section 18.50.220 shall automatically become null and void on March 2, 2014, unless extended by Ordinance of the Ceres City Council prior to that date.

Chapter 18.100 - FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT AND FLOOD HAZARD IDENTIFICATION REGULATIONS 
 
18.100.010 - STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION AND PURPOSE. 
A.  Statutory Authorization: The legislature of the State has in Government Code sections 65302, 65560, and 65800 conferred upon local government units authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City Council does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations. 
B.  Findings of Fact: 
1.  The flood hazard areas of Ceres are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
2.  These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities also contribute to the flood loss. 
C.  Statement Of Purpose: It is the purpose of this Chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
1.  Protect human life and health; 
2.  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
3.  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
4.  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
5.  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
6.  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage; 
7.  Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and 
8.  Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. 
D.  Methods Of Reducing Flood Losses: In order to accomplish its purposes, this Chapter includes methods and provisions to: 
1.  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities; 
2.  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
3.  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters; 
4.  Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
5.  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. 
(Ord. 97-869, 1997)  
18.100.020 - DEFINITIONS. 
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this Chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this Chapter its most reasonable application. 
ACCESSORY USE: A use which is incidental and subordinate to the principal use of the parcel of land on which it is located. 
ALLUVIAL FAN: A geomorphologic feature characterized by a cone or fan-shaped deposit of boulders, gravel, and fine sediments that have been eroded from mountain slopes, transported by flood flows, and then deposited on the valley floors, and which is subject to flash flooding, high velocity flows, debris flows, erosion, sediment movement and deposition, and channel migration. 
APEX: The point of highest elevation on an alluvial fan, which on undisturbed fans is generally the point where the major stream that formed the fan emerges from the mountain front. 
APPEAL: A request for a review of the Floodplain Administrator's interpretation of any provision of this Chapter. 
AREA OF SHALLOW FLOODING: A designated AO or AH Zone on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). The base flood depths range from one to three feet (13'); a clearly defined channel does not exist; the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; and velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
AREA OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD: See definition of Special Flood Hazard Area. 
BASE FLOOD: A flood which has a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (also called the "100-year flood"). "Base flood" is the term used throughout this Chapter. 
BASEMENT: Any area of the building having its floor subgradei.e., below ground levelon all sides. 
BUILDING: See definition of Structure. 
DEVELOPMENT: Any manmade change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but not limited to, buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials. 
ENCROACHMENT: The advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill, excavation, buildings, permanent structures or development into a floodplain which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain. 
EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured home are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by a community. 
EXPANSION TO AN EXISTING MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: The preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
FLOOD BOUNDARY AND FLOODWAY MAP (FBFM): The official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the floodway. 
FLOOD, FLOODING, OR FLOOD WATER: 
A.  A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from: the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source; or mudslides (i.e., mudflows) which are proximately caused by "flooding" as defined herein and are akin to a river of liquid and flowing mud on the surfaces of normally dry land areas, as when earth is carried by a current of water and deposited along the path of the current. 
B.  The collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical levels or suddenly caused by an unusual and unforeseeable event which results in "flooding" as defined in this definition. 
FLOOD HAZARD BOUNDARY MAP: The official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated the areas of flood hazards. 
FLOOD INSURANCE RATE MAP (FIRM): The official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
FLOOD INSURANCE STUDY: The official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the Flood Insurance Rate Map, the Flood Boundary and Floodway Map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood. 
FLOODPLAIN ADMINISTRATOR: The individual appointed to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations. 
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT: The operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including, but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans. 
FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT REGULATIONS: This Chapter and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other application of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes Federal, State or local regulations in any combination thereof which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. 
FLOODPLAIN OR FLOOD-PRONE AREA: Any and area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see definition of Flood, Flooding, or Flood Water). 
FLOODPROOFING: Any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents. (Refer to FEMA Technical Bulletins TB1-93, TB 3-93, and TB7-93 for guidelines on dry and wet floodproofing.) 
FLOODWAY: The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot (1'). Also referred to as "regulatory floodway." 
FLOODWAY ENCROACHMENT LINES: The lines marking the limits of floodways on Federal, State, and local floodplain maps. 
FLOODWAY FRINGE: That area of the floodplain on either side of the "regulatory floodway" where encroachment may be permitted. 
FRAUD AND VICTIMIZATION: As related to Section 18.100.060 of this Chapter, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the City Council will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty (50) to one hundred (100) years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates. 
FUNCTIONALLY DEPENDENT USE: A use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, and does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
GOVERNING BODY: The local governing unit, i.e. county or municipality, that is empowered to adopt and implement regulations to provide for the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. 
HARDSHIP: As related to 18.100.060 of this Chapter, means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The City Council requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. 
HIGHEST ADJACENT GRADE: The highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
HISTORIC STRUCTURE: Any structure that is: 
A.  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
B.  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
C.  Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of Interior; or 
D.  Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either by an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states with approved programs. 
LEVEE: A manmade structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
LEVEE SYSTEM: A flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accord with sound engineering practices. 
LOWEST FLOOR: The lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area (see definition of Basement) is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable nonelevation design requirements of this Chapter. (Note: This definition allows attached garages to be built at grade. Below grade garages are not allowed as they are considered to be basements.) 
MANUFACTURED HOME: A structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle." 
MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two (2) or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
MARKET VALUE: shall be determined by estimating the cost to replace the structure in new condition and adjusting that cost figure by the amount of depreciation which has accrued since the structure was constructed. The cost of replacement of the structure shall be based on a square foot cost factor determined by reference to a building cost estimating guide recognized by the building construction industry. The amount of depreciation shall be determined by taking into account the age and physical deterioration of the structure and functional obsolescence as approved by the floodplain administrator, but shall not include economic or other forms of external obsolescence. Use of replacement costs or accrued depreciation factors different from those contained in recognized building cost estimating guides may be considered only if such factors are included in a report prepared by an independent professional appraiser and supported by a written explanation of the differences. 
MEAN SEA LEVEL: For purpose of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced. 
NEW CONSTRUCTION: For floodplain management purposes, means structures for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by this community, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
NEW MANUFACTURED HOME PARK OR SUBDIVISION: A manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by this community. 
OBSTRUCTION: Includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried downstream. 
ONE HUNDRED YEAR FLOOD OR 100-YEAR FLOOD: See definition of Base Flood. 
PRINCIPAL STRUCTURE: A structure used for the principal use of the property as distinguished from an accessory use. 
PUBLIC SAFETY AND NUISANCE: As related to 18.100.060 of this Chapter, means that the granting of a variance must not result in anything which is injurious to safety or health of an entire community or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin. 
RECREATIONAL VEHICLE: A vehicle which is: 
A.  Built on a single chassis; 
B.  Four hundred (400) square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
C.  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-duty truck; and 
D.  Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
REGULATORY FLOODWAY: The channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot (1'). 
RIVERINE: Relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc. 
SHEET FLOW AREA: See definition of Area Of Shallow Flooding. 
SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD AREA (SFHA): An area having special flood hazards and shown on an FHBM or FIRM as Zone A, AO, A1-A30, AE, A99, or AH. 
START OF CONSTRUCTION: Includes substantial improvement and other proposed new development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty (180) days from the date of the permit. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
STRUCTURE: A walled and roofed building that is principally above ground; this includes a gas or liquid storage tank or a manufactured home. 
SUBSTANTIAL DAMAGE: Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before-damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other proposed new development of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage," regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
A.  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations or State or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
B.  Any alteration provided that preclude the designation as of a "historic structure," provided the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
VARIANCE: A grant of relief from the requirements of this Chapter which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this Chapter. 
VIOLATION: Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this ordinance [chapter]. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this ordinance [chapter] is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
WATER SURFACE ELEVATION: The height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, (or other datum, where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas. 
WATERCOURSE: A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, arroyo, channel or other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. "Watercourse" includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may occur. 
(Ord. No. 2012-1011, § 1, 10-22-2012; Ord. 2002-914 (Exhibit A (part)) 2002: Ord. 97-869, 1997)  
18.100.030 - GENERAL PROVISIONS. 
A.  Lands To Which This Chapter Applies: This Chapter shall apply to all areas identified as flood-prone within the jurisdiction of Ceres. 
B.  Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard: The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the "Flood Insurance Study (FIS) for Stanislaus County, California and Incorporated Areas" dated September 26, 2008, with accompanying flood insurance rate maps (FIRMs) and flood boundary and floodway maps (FBFMs), dated September 26, 2008, and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions, are hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this ordinance [chapter]. This FIS and attendant mapping is the minimum area of applicability of this ordinance [chapter] and may be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation of this ordinance [chapter] and which are recommended to the City of Ceres City Council by the Floodplain Administrator. The study, FIRMs and FBFMs are on file at Engineering Services Department located at 2220 Magnolia Street, Ceres, CA 93507. 
C.  Compliance: No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the term of this Chapter and other applicable regulations. Violation of the requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Nothing herein shall prevent the City Council from taking such lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. 
D.  Abrogation And Greater Restrictions: This Chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this Chapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
E.  Interpretation: In the interpretation and application of this Chapter, all provisions shall be: 
1.  Considered as minimum requirements; 
2.  Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and 
3.  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under State statutes. 
F.  Warning And Disclaimer Of Liability: The degree of flood protection required by this Chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This Chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This Chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City Council, any officer or employee thereof, the State, or the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this Chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 
G.  Severability: This Chapter and the various parts thereof are hereby declared to be severable. Should any section of this Chapter be declared by the courts to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of the Chapter as a whole, or any portion thereof other than the section so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid.

18.100.040 - ADMINISTRATION. 
A.  Establishment Of Development Permit: A development permit shall be obtained before any construction or other development begins within any area of special flood hazard established in subsection 18.100.030B of this Chapter. Application for a development permit shall be made on forms furnished by the Floodplain Administrator and may include, but not be limited to: plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevation of the area in question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities; and the location of the foregoing. Specifically, the following information is required: 
1A.  Site plan, including but not limited to: 
a.  For all proposed structures, spot ground elevations at building corners and twenty foot (20') or smaller intervals along the foundation footprint, or one foot contour elevations throughout the building site; and 
b.  Proposed locations of water supply, sanitary sewer, and utilities; and 
c.  If available, the base flood elevation from the Flood Insurance Study and/or Flood Insurance Rate Map; and 
d.  If applicable, the location of the regulator floodway; and 
1B.  Foundation design detail, including but not limited to: 
a.  Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor (including basement) of all structures; and 
b.  For a crawl-space foundation, location and total net area of foundation openings as required in Section 18.100.050A3c of this ordinance and FEMA Technical Bulletins 1-93 and 7-93; and 
c.  For foundations placed on fill, the location and height of fill, and compaction requirements (compacted to ninety five (95%) percent using the Standard Proctor Test method); and 
2.  Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any structure will be floodproofed, as required in subsection 18.100.050A3c of this Chapter and FEMA Technical Bulletin TB 3-93; and 
3.  All appropriate certifications listed in subsection 18.100.040C4 of this Section; and 
4.  Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development. 
B.  Designation of the Floodplain Administrator: The City Engineer, or his/her designee, is hereby appointed to administer, implement, and enforce this Chapter by granting or denying development permits in accord with its provisions. 
C.  Duties And Responsibilities Of The Floodplain Administrator: The duties and responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator shall include, but not be limited to, the following: 
1.  Permit Review: Review all development permit applications to determine that: 
a.  Permit requirements of this Chapter have been satisfied; 
b.  All other required State and Federal permits have been obtained; 
c.  The site is reasonably safe from flooding; and 
d.  The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a floodway has not been designated. For purposes of this Chapter, "adversely affects" means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot (1') at any point. 
2.  Review And Use Of Any Other Base Flood Data: When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with subsection 18.100.030B of this Chapter, the Floodplain Administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a Federal or State agency, or other source, in order to administer Section 18.100.050 of this Chapter. Any such information shall be submitted to the City Council for adoption. 
If no base flood elevation data is available from a federal or state agency or other source, then a base flood elevation shall be obtained using one of two methods from the FEMA publication "Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A AreasA Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base (100 year) Flood Elevations" dated July 1995 in order to administer Section 5: 
a.  Simplified method 100 year or base flood discharge shall be obtained using the appropriate regression equation found in a U.S. Geological Survey publication, or the discharge-drainage area method; and base flood elevation shall be obtained using the Quick-2 computer program developed by FEMA; or 
b.  Detailed method. The 100 year or base flood discharge and the base discharge and the base flood elevation shall be obtained using detailed methods identified in FEMA Publication 265, published in July 1995 and titled: "Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A AreasA Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base (100 year) Flood Elevations." 
3.  Notification of Other Agencies: 
a.  In alteration or relocation of a watercourse: 
(1)  Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of Water Resources prior to alteration or relocation; 
(2)  Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency; and 
(3)  Assure that the flood-carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained. 
b.  Base flood elevation changes due to physical alterations: 
(1)  Within six (6) months of information becoming available or project completion, whichever comes first, the Floodplain Administrator shall submit or assure that the permit applicant submits technical or scientific data to FEMA for a letter of map revision (LOMR). 
(2)  All LOMRs for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMRs). Approved CLOMRs allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the "start of construction" definition. 
Such submissions are necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain management requirements are based on current data. 
4.  Documentation Of Floodplain Development: Obtain and maintain for public inspection and make available as needed the following: 
a.  Certification required by subsection 18.100.050A3a of this Chapter (floor elevations); 
b.  Certification required by subsection 18.100.050A3b of this Chapter (elevation of floodproofing of nonresidential structures); 
c.  Certification required by subsection 18.100.050A3c of this Chapter (wet floodproofing standard); 
d.  Certification of elevation required by subsection 18.100.050C of this Chapter (subdivision standards); and/or 
e.  Certification required by subsection 18.100.050F of this Chapter (floodway encroachments). 
5.  Map Determinations: Make interpretations where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard, for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions, grade and base flood elevations shall be used to determine the boundaries of the special flood hazard area. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in Section 18.100.060 of this Chapter. 
6.  Remedial Action: Take action to remedy violations of this Chapter as specified in subsection 18.100.030C of this Chapter. 
D.  Appeals: The City Council shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the Floodplain Administrator in the enforcement or administration of this Chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2012-1011, §§ 3, 4, 10-22-2012; Ord. 2002-914 (Exhibit A (part)) 2002: Ord. 97-869, 1997)  
18.100.050 - PROVISIONS FOR FLOOD HAZARD REDUCTION. 
A.  Standards Of Construction: In all areas of special flood hazards, the following standards are required: 
1.  Anchoring: 
a.  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy. 
b.  All manufactured homes shall meet the anchoring standards of subsection D of this Section. 
2.  Construction Materials And Methods: All new construction and substantial improvement shall be constructed: 
a.  With flood resistant materials, and utility equipment resistant to flood damage for areas below the base flood elevation. 
b.  Using methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
c.  With electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; and if 
d.  Within Zones AH or AO, so that there are adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures. 
3.  Elevation And Floodproofing:* 
a.  Residential construction, new or substantial improvement, shall have the lowest floor, including basement: 
(1)  In an AO zone elevated above the highest adjacent grade to a height exceeding the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM by at least two feet (2'), or elevated at least four feet (4') above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified. 
(2)  In an A Zone, elevated to or above the base flood elevation; said base flood elevation shall be determined by one of the methods in Section 18.100.040C.2 of this ordinance. The state of California recommends the lowest floor be elevated at least two feet (2') above the base flood elevation, as determined by the community. 
(3)  In all other zones, elevated at least one foot (1') above the base flood elevation. 
Upon completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor including basement shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor, or verified by the community building inspector to be properly elevated. Such certification or verification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator. 
b.  Nonresidential construction shall either be elevated to conform with subsection A3a of this Section or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities: 
(1)  Be floodproofed below the elevation recommended under subsection A3a of this Section so that the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water; 
(2)  Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and 
(3)  Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the standards of this subsection A3b of this Section are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator. 
c.  Flood openings. All new construction and substantial improvements of structures with fully-enclosed areas below the lowest floor (excluding basements) that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and which are subject to flooding, shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwater. Designs for meeting this requirement must meet the following minimum criteria: 
For non-engineered openings: 
(1)  Have a minimum of two (2) openings on different sides having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
(2)  The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade; 
(3)  Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwater; and 
(4)  Buildings with more than one enclosed area must have openings on exterior walls for each area to allow floodwater to directly enter; or 
Be certified by a registered civil engineer or architect. 
d.  Manufactured homes shall also meet the standards in subsection D of this Section. 
B.  Standards For Utilities: 
1.  All new and replacement water supply and sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate: 
a.  Infiltration of flood waters into the systems; and 
b.  Discharge from the systems into flood waters. 
2.  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them, or contamination from them during flooding. 
C.  Standards For Subdivisions: 
1.  All new subdivisions proposals and other proposed development, including proposals for manufactured home parks and subdivisions, greater than fifty (50) lots or five (5) acres, whichever is the lesser, shall: 
a.  Identify the special flood hazard areas (SFHA) and base flood elevations (BFE). 
b.  Identify the elevations of lowest floors of all proposed structures and pads on the final plans. 
c.  If the site is filled above the base flood elevation, the following as-built information for each structure shall be certified by a registered civil engineer or licensed land surveyor and provided as part of an application for a letter of map revision based on fill (LOMR-F) to the Floodplain Administrator: 
(1)  Lowest floor elevation. 
(2)  Pad elevation. 
(3)  Lowest adjacent grade. 
2.  All subdivision proposals and other proposed development shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage. 
3.  All subdivision proposals and other proposed development shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage. 
4.  All subdivisions and other proposed development shall provide adequate drainage to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
D.  Standards for Manufactured Homes: 
1.  All manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved on sites located: (1) outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; (2) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision; (3) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or (4) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision upon which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood shall: 
a.  Within Zones Al 30, AH, and AE on the community's flood insurance rate map, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be securely fastened to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
2.  All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within Zones A1 30, AH, and AE on the community's flood insurance rate map that are not subject to the provisions of subsection D1 of this Section will be securely fastened to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, and be elevated so that either the: 
a.  Lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation; or 
b.  Manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than thirty-six inches (36") in height above grade. 
Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor including basement shall be certified by a registered civil engineer or licensed land surveyor, and verified by the community building inspector to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall be provided to the Floodplain Administrator. 
E.  Standards For Recreational Vehicles: 
1.  All recreational vehicles placed on sites within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's Flood Insurance Rate Map will either: 
a.  Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days; 
b.  Be fully licensed and ready for highway usea recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions; or 
c.  Meet the permit requirements of Section 18.100.040 of this Chapter and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes in subsection D1 of this Section. 
F.  Floodways: Located within areas of special flood hazard established in subsection 18.100.030B of this Chapter are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply: 
1.  Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvement, and other new development unless certification by a registered professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in the base flood elevation during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
2.  If subsection F1 of this Section is satisfied, all new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this Section. 
(Ord. No. 2012-1011, §§ 57, 10-22-2012; Ord. 2002-914 (Exhibit A (part)) 2002: Ord. 97-869, 1997) 
*  See Section 18.100.020 of this Chapter, for "new construction," "substantial damage," and "substantial improvement."  
18.100.060 - VARIANCE PROCEDURE. 
A.  Nature Of Variances: The variance criteria set forth in this Section are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this Chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, nor the property owners. 
It is the duty of the City Council to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this Chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. 
B.  Appeal Board: 
1.  In passing upon requests for variances, the City Council serves as the appeal board and shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this Chapter, and the following: 
a.  Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
b.  Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
c.  Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property; 
d.  Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
e.  Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
f.  Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
g.  Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
h.  Relationship of the proposed use to the Comprehensive Plan and a floodplain management program for that area; 
i.  Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
j.  Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and 
k.  Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges. 
2.  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice by the City Manager that: 
a.  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage; and 
b.  Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. It is recommended a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain Administrator in the office of the Stanislaus County Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land. 
3.  The Floodplain Administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
C.  Conditions For Variances: 
1.  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half (½) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the procedures of Sections 18.100.040 and 18.100.050 of this Chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half (½) acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
2.  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "historic structures" (as defined in Section 18.100.020 of this Chapter) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
3.  Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
4.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the "minimum necessary," considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this Chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the City Council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the City Council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of this Chapter. 
5.  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
a.  Showing of good and sufficient cause; and 
b.  Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional "hardship" (as defined in Section 18.100.020 of this Chapter) to the applicant; and 
c.  Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance (as defined in Section 18.100.020 of this Chaptersee definition of "Public Safety And Nuisance"), cause fraud or victimization (as defined in Section 18.100.020 of this Chapter) to the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
6.  Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsection C1 through 5 of this Section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance. 
7.  Upon consideration of the factors of subsection B of this Section and the purposes of this Chapter, the City Council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this Chapter.

Chapter 18.110 - REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS POLICY AND PROCEDURES 
 
18.110.010 - TITLE, PURPOSE, AND APPLICABILITY. 
A.  Title and Intent. The provisions of this Chapter shall be known as the Reasonable Accommodations Policy and Procedure Regulations. The intent of the Reasonable Accommodations Policy and Procedure Regulations is to provide flexibility in the application of the Zoning Ordinance for individuals with a disability, when flexibility is necessary to eliminate barriers to housing opportunities. This Chapter will facilitate compliance with Federal and State fair housing laws, and promote housing opportunities for residents of Ceres. 
B.  Purpose. The purpose of this Chapter is to establish a procedure for persons with disabilities seeking fair access to housing to make requests for reasonable accommodation in the application of Ceres' zoning laws, rules, policies, practices and procedures pursuant to Section 3604(f)(3)(b) of Title 42 of the United States Code ("the Fair Housing Act") and Section 12955 et seq. of the California Government Code (the "California Fair Employment and Housing Act"), which prohibit local governments from refusing to make reasonable accommodations in policies and practices when these accommodations are necessary to afford persons with disabilities equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. 
C.  Applicability. A request for reasonable accommodation may include a modification or exception to the rules, standards and practices for the siting, development and use of housing or housing related facilities that would eliminate regulatory barriers and provide a person with a disability equal opportunity to housing of their choice. 
(Ord. No. 2015-1027, § 1, 3-9-2015)  
18.110.020 - DEFINITIONS.

ACTS: the "Fair Housing Act (Section 3601 et seq. of Title 42 of the United States Code) and the "California Fair Employment and Housing Act" (Section 12955 et seq. of the California Government Code). 
PERSON WITH A DISABILITY: any person who has a physical or mental impairment that limits one or more major life activities; anyone who is regarded as having such impairment; or anyone who has a record of such impairment. Federal and State fair housing laws do not protect an individual's current unlawful use of controlled substances or other drugs, unless that individual has a separate disability. 
REQUEST FOR REASONABLE ACCOMMODATIONS: a request to modify land use, zoning and building regulations, policies, practices, or procedures in order to give people with disabilities an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling. 
(Ord. No. 2015-1027, § 2, 3-9-2015)  
18.110.030 - REVIEW AND AUTHORITY. 
A.  The Director of Community Development is designated to approve, conditionally approve, or deny all applications for reasonable accommodation. 
B.  If the project for which the request for a reasonable accommodation is made requires another discretionary permit or approval that is subject to Planning Commission action (as per subsection 18.120.040C.), then the Planning Commission shall act as the decision maker for both the request for a reasonable accommodation and the discretionary permit or approval at the same time. 
C.  If an applicant making a request for a reasonable accommodation does not agree with the decision rendered by the Director of Community Development and/or Planning Commission, the applicant may appeal the decision per the applicable requirements listed under Chapter 18.58, Administration and Enforcement. 
(Ord. No. 2015-1027, § 3, 3-9-2015)  
18.110.040 - APPLICATION FOR A REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION. 
A.  Applicant. A request for reasonable accommodation may be submitted to the Director of Community Development by any person with a disability, their representative, or a developer or provider of housing for individuals with a disability. A reasonable accommodation may be approved only for the benefit of one or more individuals with a disability. 
B.  Application. An application for a reasonable accommodation from a zoning regulation, policy, or practice shall be made on a form provided by the Community Development Division. No fee shall be required for a request for reasonable accommodation, unless the project requires approval of another discretionary permit, then the prescribed fee shall be paid for all other discretionary permits. 
C.  Other Discretionary Permits. If the project for which the request for reasonable accommodation is made requires another discretionary permit or approval (i.e., conditional use permit, subdivision, variance, or planned development plan review, etc.), then the applicant shall file the request for reasonable accommodation together with the application for the other discretionary permit or approval. The processing procedures of the discretionary permit shall govern the joint processing of both the reasonable accommodation and the discretionary permit. 
D.  Required Information. In addition to materials required under applicable provisions of this Code, application for reasonable accommodation shall include the following: 
1.  Documentation that the applicant is: 
a.  An individual with a disability; 
b.  Applying on behalf of one or more individuals with a disability; or 
c.  A developer or provider of housing for one or more individuals with a disability. 
2.  The specific exception or modification to the zoning ordinance provision, policy, or practices requested by the applicant; 
3.  Documentation that the specific exception or modification requested by the applicant is necessary to provide one or more individuals with a disability an equal opportunity to use and enjoy the dwelling; and 
4.  Any other information that the Director of Community Development reasonably concludes is necessary to determine whether the findings required by Section 18.110.050, hereof, can be made, so long as any request for information regarding the disability of the individuals benefited complies with fair housing law protections and the privacy rights of the individuals affected. 
5.  Any information submitted as part of a reasonable accommodations request shall be kept confidential and shall be retained in a manner so as to respect the privacy rights of the applicant and shall not be made available for public inspection. 
(Ord. No. 2015-1027, § 4, 3-9-2015)  
18.110.050 - FINDINGS NECESSARY FOR A REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION. 
A.  The written decision to approve, conditionally approve, or deny a request for a reasonable accommodation shall be based on the following findings, all of which are required for approval: 
1.  That the housing, which is the subject of the request for reasonable accommodation, will be used by one or more individuals with a disability protected under the fair housing laws; 
2.  The requested accommodation is necessary to provide one or more individuals with a disability an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling; 
3.  The requested accommodation will not result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of the City's zoning laws, rules, policies, practices, and procedures; 
4.  The requested accommodation will not, under the specific facts of the case, result in a direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals or substantial physical damage to the property of others. 
5.  The requested accommodation will not impose an undue financial or administrative burden on the City as "undue financial or administrative burden" is defined in fair housing laws and interpretive case law. 
In making these findings, the decision maker may approve alternative reasonable accommodations which provide an equivalent level of benefit to the applicant. 
B.  The City may consider, but is not limited to, the following factors in determining whether the requested accommodation is necessary to provide one or more individuals with a disability an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling: 
1.  Whether the requested accommodation will affirmatively enhance the quality of life of one or more individuals with a disability; 
2.  Whether the individual or individuals with a disability will be denied an equal opportunity to enjoy the housing type of their choice absent the accommodation; 
3.  In the case of a residential care facility, whether the requested accommodation is necessary to make facilities of a similar nature or operation economically viable in light of the particularities of the relevant market and market participants; and/or 
4.  In the case of a residential care facility, whether the existing supply of facilities of a similar nature and operation in the community is sufficient to provide individuals with a disability an equal opportunity to live in a residential setting. 
C.  The City may consider, but is not limited to, the following factors in determining whether the requested accommodation would require a fundamental alteration in the nature of the City's zoning laws, rules, policies, practices, and procedures: 
1.  Whether the requested accommodation would fundamentally alter the character of the neighborhood; 
2.  Whether the accommodation would result in a substantial increase in traffic or insufficient parking; 
3.  Whether granting the requested accommodation would substantially undermine any purpose of either the City's general plan or applicable specific plan; and/or 
4.  In the case of a residential care facility, whether the requested accommodation would create an institutionalized environment due to the number of and distance between facilities that are similar in nature or operation. 
D.  Rules while decision is pending. While a request for reasonable accommodation is pending, all laws and regulations otherwise applicable to the property that is the subject of the request shall remain in full force and effect. 
E.  Effective Date. No reasonable accommodation shall become effective until the decision to grant such accommodation shall have become final by reason of the expiration of time to make an appeal. In the event an appeal is filed, the reasonable accommodation shall not become effective unless and until a decision is made by the Planning Commission or City Council, as applicable on such appeal. 
(Ord. No. 2015-1027, § 5, 3-9-2015)  
18.110.060 - AMENDMENTS, EXPIRATION, VIOLATION, AND DISCONTINUANCE. 
A.  Amendments. A request for changes in conditions of approval of a reasonable accommodation, or a change to plans that would affect a condition of approval shall be treated as a new application. The Director of Community Development may waive the requirement for a new application if the changes are minor, do not involve substantial alterations or addition to the plan or the conditions of approval, and are consistent with the intent of the original approval. 
B.  Expiration of Approval. Any reasonable accommodation approved in accordance with the terms of this Chapter shall expire within twenty-four (24) months from the effective date of approval or at an alternative time specified as a condition of approval unless: 
1.  A building permit has been issued and construction has commenced; 
2.  A certificate of occupancy has been issued; or 
3.  The use is established. 
C.  Violation of Terms. Any reasonable accommodation approved in accordance with the terms of this Code may be revoked if any of the conditions or terms of such reasonable accommodation are violated, or if any law or ordinance is violated in connection therewith. 
D.  Discontinuance. A reasonable accommodation shall lapse if the exercise of rights granted by it is discontinued for one hundred eighty (180) consecutive days. If the persons initially occupying a dwelling vacate, the reasonable accommodation shall remain in effect only if the Director of Community Development determines that: 
1.  The modification is physically integrated into the residential structure and cannot easily be removed or altered to comply with the code; and 
2.  The accommodation is necessary to give another disabled individual an equal opportunity to enjoy the dwelling. 
The Director of Community Development may request the applicant or his or her successor in interest to the property to provide documentation that subsequent occupants are persons with disabilities. Failure to provide such documentation within ten (10) days of the date of a request by the City shall constitute grounds for discontinuance by the City of a previously approved reasonable accommodation.

19.11.020 - CODE ENFORCEMENT LIEN. 
A.  Once a final administrative decision or judicial order establishes the amount of administrative civil penalties, administrative citation, abatement costs, or fees and costs, assessed against a responsible party for Code violations, the Code Enforcement Officer may record a code enforcement lien against the real property owned by the responsible party. 
B.  Before recordation, the Code Enforcement Officer shall provide to the responsible party a written notice informing him or her that a code enforcement lien will be recorded unless the City receives full payment for the outstanding amount(s) due within the time period prescribed in the notice. Payment shall be due a minimum of forty-five (45) calendar days from the date of the mailing. 
C.  The Code Enforcement Officer shall serve this notice by the method of service set forth in Section 19.02.080(A) of this Title. 
D.  If the City does not receive payment of the outstanding amount(s) due within the prescribed time period, the Code Enforcement Officer may record the code enforcement lien.

The code enforcement lien shall include the name of the property owner and any affected financial institution, assessor's parcel number, the parcel's legal description, the total amount of administrative civil penalties, administrative citations, abatement costs, and code enforcement fees and costs due, including a breakdown of said items, and a copy of the administrative or judicial order which awarded the administrative civil penalties, administrative citations, abatement costs, and code enforcement fees and costs. 
F.  A copy of the recorded code enforcement lien shall be served upon the responsible party by the method of service set forth in Section 19.02.080(A) of this Title.

(Ord. 2008-987 § 3 (part), 2008)  
19.11.030 - NUISANCE ABATEMENT LIEN. 
A.  Confirmation of Costs Hearing: 
1.  After the City has abated a public nuisance, the Code Enforcement Officer shall request that the City Manager schedule a confirmation of costs hearing before the City's Administrative Hearing Officer in accordance with the administrative enforcement hearing procedures set forth in Chapter 19.10 of this Title. A confirmation of cost hearing is also appropriate if the City incurred abatement preparation costs before a responsible party voluntarily abated the public nuisance. 
2.  A notice of the date, time and place of the confirmation of costs hearing shall be served on the responsible party at least ten (10) calendar days prior to the scheduled hearing by the method set forth in Section 19.02.080(A) of this Title. 
3.  A copy of the report describing the work performed and an itemized account of the total abatement costs shall also be served on the responsible party at least ten (10) calendar days prior to the scheduled hearing by the method set forth in Section 19.02.080(A) of this Title. 
4.  The Administrative Hearing Officer at the confirmation of costs hearing shall limit the scope of review to the Code Enforcement Officer's report describing the work performed and the itemized account of costs, together with any objections to its accuracy. The Administrative Hearing Officer may make such revisions, corrections or modifications in the report or the account as may be just and reasonable. 
5.  Should the Administrative Hearing Officer confirm the abatement costs, he or she shall further order that the costs be assessed as a personal obligation of the responsible party, if the responsible party is not the owner of the real property abated. If the responsible party is the owner of the property abated, he or she shall order that the abatement costs are a special assessment against the real property abated by the City. 
6.  At the confirmation of costs hearing, the Administrative Hearing Officer shall not consider evidence regarding the merits of any previous abatement hearing or review the decision ordering the administrative or summary abatement. 
7.  The Administrative Hearing Officer's order confirming or modifying the amount of costs incurred by the City in performing the abatement shall be final. 
B.  Nuisance Abatement Lien: 
1.  Once a final administrative decision or judicial order establishes the amount of the abatement costs and related administrative costs, the Code Enforcement Officer may assess a nuisance abatement lien pursuant to Government Code Section 38773.1 by following the following procedures: 
a.  The Code Enforcement Officer shall give the owner of the parcel abated at least forty-five (45) days' notice of the City's intent to record a nuisance abatement lien. The notice shall advise the owner that if full payment of the abatement and related administrative costs are not paid within forty-five (45) days of service of the notice, a nuisance abatement lien will be recorded. 
b.  The notice shall be served in the same manner as summons in a civil action. 
c.  If the owner cannot be found after a diligent search, the notice may be served by posting it on the property for a period of ten (10) calendar days and by publication thereof in a newspaper of general circulation published in the county in which the property is located. 
d.  A nuisance abatement lien shall be recorded in the County Recorder's Office in the county in which the parcel of land is located and from the date of recording shall have the same force, affect, and priority of a judgment lien. 
e.  A nuisance abatement lien shall specify the amount of the lien, the name and address of the responsible City department, the date of the abatement order, the street address, legal description and assessor's parcel number of the parcel on which the lien is imposed, and the name and address of the recorded owner of the parcel. 
f.  In the event that the lien is discharged, released, or satisfied, either through payment or foreclosure, notice of the discharge containing the information specified in subsection (B)(1)(e) above shall be recorded by the Code Enforcement Officer. 
g.  A nuisance abatement lien may be foreclosed by an action brought by the City for a money judgment. 
h.  The City may recover from the property owner any costs incurred regarding the processing and recording of the lien and providing notice to the property owner as part of its foreclosure action to enforce the lien. 
C.  Recovery of Abatement Costs as a Personal Obligation: If the Administrative Hearing Officer orders that abatement costs be charged as a personal obligation of the responsible party, the Code Enforcement Officer shall collect the obligation by use of all appropriate legal means. This may include the recordation of a code enforcement lien against any real property owned by the responsible party pursuant to the provisions set forth in Section 19.11.020. If unable to collect this obligation, the matter may be referred to the City Attorney to file a court action to recover the costs. 
D.  Recovery of Abatement Costs by Special Assessment: 
1.  If the Administrative Hearing Officer orders that abatement costs shall be charged against the property, the Code Enforcement Officer may prepare a notice of special assessment approved as to form by the City Attorney. 
2.  The Code Enforcement Officer shall deliver the notice of special assessment to the County Auditor who shall place it on the County Assessment Roll pursuant to Government Code Section 38773.5. 
3.  The notice of special assessment shall include a copy of the Administrative Hearing Officer's confirmation of costs order and shall summarize the abatement action. The Code Enforcement Officer may record a copy of this special assessment notice to inform any subsequent purchasers or owners about this abatement action and costs. 
4.  The notice of special assessment shall also be mailed to the property owner, if the property owner's identity can be determined from the County Assessor's or County Recorder's records. The notice shall be sent by certified mail and shall specify that the property may be sold after three (3) years by the tax collector for unpaid delinquent assessments. 
5.  The Code Enforcement Officer shall file a withdrawal of this notice with the County Recorder when either: (1) the responsible party pays in full the abatement costs; or (2) the County Auditor or Tax Collector posts a lien on the property pursuant to Government Code Section 38773.5. 
6.  Collection of AssessmentPenalties and Foreclosure. Pursuant to the provisions of Government Code Section 38773.5, the County Tax Collector may collect the amount of the assessment at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes, and impose the same penalties and procedures, including the sale of the property, in case of delinquency, as provided for ordinary municipal taxes. All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of property taxes shall be applicable to the special assessment. The provisions of Government Code Sections 38772 through 38773.5, and any amendments to those sections, are hereby incorporated by reference and made a part of this Section. 
As an alternative to the recovery of abatement costs by special assessment, the Code Enforcement Officer can record a nuisance abatement lien pursuant to the provisions set forth in this Section.
