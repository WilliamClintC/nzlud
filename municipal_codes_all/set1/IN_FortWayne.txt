   11.02   City flag



§ 11.01  CORPORATE SEAL.



   (A)   The seal of the city is a representation of Mercury's Wand,
entwined with two serpents on the right, a sword on the left and a pair of
scales on the top with the word "Ke-ki-on-ga" with the inscription "City of
Fort Wayne, Indiana," around the outer edge. The seal's inside circle shall
be white, the outside circle shall be blue and the remainder, gold.



   (B)   A facsimile of such seal is reproduced below:



      



('74 Code, § 1-10) (Am. Ord. G-95-72, passed - -72)



§ 11.02  CITY FLAG.



   The official flag of the city shall be of the following design and
proportion:



   (A)   The field shall be blue, in the center of which shall be
superimposed a white, circular center.



   (B)   From the outer circumference of the white center three white
bands shall extend: a horizontal band from the circumference of the white
center to the middle of the hoist end of the blue field, a diagonal band from
the circumference of the white center of the lower free corner of the blue
field. The position of the inner edges of the two diagonal white bands shall
coincide with the corner diagonals of the blue field from the circumference
of the white center to the corner of the free end of the blue field, upper
and lower, respectively.



   (C)   Superimposed upon the white center and contained within its
circumference shall be a red block-fort silhouette. Superimposed upon the
lower blue hoist field shall be a red fleur-de-lis silhouette. Superimposed
upon the free-end blue field shall be a red conventional Indian head
silhouette.



   (D)   The proportion scale of the flag and its several devices shall
be as follows: Total length 36 units; total width, 24 units; diameter of the
white center 12 units; width of the horizontal wide bands three units each;
height of the block-fort in white center, eight units; height of the rampant
lion, four units;height of the fleur-de-lis four units and height of the
Indian head, five units.



   (E)   The shades of blue and red shall be those of the flag of the
United States.



   (F)   The block house silhouette shall follow the conventional form
made familiar by the late B.J. Griswold and frequently employed by him to
depict the pioneer days of the city.  One pattern which will be preserved
and permanently available appears on the binding edge of the 1917 edition of
Griswold's "The History of Fort Wayne," on record in the Fort Wayne Public
Library.



   (G)   The rampant lion shall be the conventional design commonly
known as the "British Lion."



   (H)   The fleur-de-lis shall be the conventional design commonly
employed with reference to the French monarchy of the eighteenth century.



   (I)   The Indian head shall be the conventional profile commonly
employed to represent an Indiana chief, with feather but no other head-dress.



   (J)   The words "Fort Wayne" or the abbreviation "Ft. Wayne" in
standard block letters, blue upon the white band (or bands) or white upon
either of the three blue fields, may be used at the discretion of the maker,
but neither the word nor the abbreviation shall constitute a part of the
official specifications of the emblems.



   (K)   The flag may be specially formed for vertical hanging, in
which case the hoist end shall be the upper or bar end of the banner.  When
manufactured specially for vertical suspensions from the hoist (bar) end, the
block-fort, the fleur-de-lis, the lion and the Indian head silhouettes may be
rotated in such a manner that they appear in an upright position upon the
vertically suspended fields.



   (L)   When used in connection with the United States flag, at any
time or occasion whatsoever, the Fort Wayne flag shall be subordinated at the
left or below the national colors.

Councilmembers pursuant to state law and/or ordinance or resolution of this
city.  However, defense and indemnification shall not be provided in those
situations in which a Councilmember would have individual and/or personal
liability as provided, from time to time, by state law, whether same be
statutory or case law.



      (3)   Division (D) is necessary to ensure that Councilmembers
may freely exercise their legislative responsibilities as charged to them by

§ 32.58  DISPOSITION WITHIN COUNCIL AND COMMITTEE.



   (A)   No ordinance shall be placed for passage the same day it is
introduced except by suspension of the rules, requiring seven affirmative
votes.  At least two-thirds of the members of the Council must vote in the
affirmative for passage of any ordinance on the same day it is introduced. 
The vote to suspend the rules shall take place during the committee session
immediately prior to the regular session where the bill shall be formally
introduced and then placed on consideration for passage.  This division does
not apply to a zoning ordinance or amendment to a zoning ordinance that is
adopted under IC 36-7.



   (B)   An ordinance introduced pursuant to § 32.57 above shall:



      (1)   Be read by its title by the Chair of the Committee who
signed that ordinance for introduction pursuant to § 32.56, and that Chair
shall make a motion for formal introduction for said ordinance.



      (2)   Upon passage of the motion for introduction of an
ordinance or ordinances, the Chair of the committee shall move to refer said
ordinance or ordinances to his/her committee for discussion and
recommendation (other than amendments to the Zoning ordinance, street and
alley vacations and the like, which are required by law to be first referred
to the City Plan Commission).



      (3)   The committee to which it is referred after discussion
of an ordinance shall have the power to amend an ordinance and shall vote
upon that committee's recommendation as to whether the ordinance shall pass,
not pass, or come out of said committee with no recommendation.



      (4)   At the next regular session of the Council, the
committee chair shall report as to the recommendation of his/her committee,
as well as any amendments to the ordinance passed by that committee.  At
such time, the ordinance shall then be subject to further amendment by the
Council.



      (5)   Thereafter, upon motion duly presented, it shall be
placed upon its passage, and in such instance shall thereafter be subject to
a final vote thereon.



   (C)   Any ordinance failing to receive a sufficient number of votes
on final passage will be considered as lost; provided that the vote thereon
may be reconsidered within the time and in the manner set forth in § 32.39.



   (D)   Final vote for passage of a resolution may be taken at the
meeting at which it is introduced, or said resolution may be referred to the
appropriate committee as determined by a majority of the Council present;
provided that a resolution requiring affirmative action on behalf of the city
shall be processed the same as an ordinance.  In the event that the majority
of the Common Council votes during Committee session that final passage of
the resolution shall take place during regular session, the ordinance shall
be discussed during Committee session, immediately prior to the regular
session when the bill will be formally introduced and then placed on
consideration for passage.



   (E)   Once properly introduced, no proposed ordinance or proposed
resolution shall be eligible for further action after the last day of the
calendar year following the year of introduction.  Any such ordinance or
resolution which has not been finally disposed of by the last day of the
calendar year following the year of introduction will expire and be
considered withdrawn.

   Whenever any ordinance or part of an ordinance shall be repealed or
modified by a subsequent ordinance, the part of an ordinance thus repealed or
modified shall continue in force until the due publication of the ordinance
repealing or modifying the same, when the publication shall be required to
give effect thereto, unless therein otherwise expressly provided; but no
suit, proceeding, right, fine, forfeiture or penalty instituted, created,
given secured or accrued, under any ordinance previous to its repeal, shall
in any way be affected, released or discharged, but may be prosecuted,
enjoyed and recovered, as fully as if such ordinance had continued in force,
unless it shall be therein otherwise expressly provided.



('74 Code, § 2-37) (Am. Ord. G-18-92, passed



4-26-92)



§ 32.62  REPEAL NOT TO REVIVE FORMER ORDINANCE.



   When any ordinance repealing a former ordinance, clause or provision
shall be itself repealed, the repeal shall not be construed to revive the
former ordinance, clause or provision, unless it shall be therein so
expressly provided.



('74 Code, § 2-38; Am. Ord. G-18-92, passed 4-26-92)



§ 32.63  EFFECTIVE DATE.

effectiveness proclaimed by the Mayor is posted in the manner prescribed in
IC 36-4-6-14(b)(2), unless therein otherwise expressly provided.  An
ordinance not requiring publication shall take effect from its passage, after
it is signed by the Presiding Officer of the Council, and either it is signed
by the Mayor or passed over his veto by the Council in accordance with IC
36-4-6-16.



('74 Code, § 2-39; Am. Ord. G-18-92, passed 4-26-92)



§ 32.64  REQUESTS FOR PRIOR APPROVAL.



   (A)   From time to time the Common Council of the city is requested
by various departments of the executive branch of government of the city to
give its promise that it will, on presentation of a properly drawn ordinance
or resolution affecting a particular subject matter, pass an ordinance or
resolution thereon at a future regular meeting of the Common Council.  Such
action is customarily referred to as “prior approval.”  Such “prior
approval” is in derogation of the strict letter of the law regarding
presentation and passage of ordinances and resolutions but is in the best
interest of the city.



   (B)   Any request for a “prior approval” presented to the Common
Council shall require two-thirds vote of the members of the Council.  All
“prior approval” requests must be passed at a committee session on a
second or fourth Tuesday meeting of the Council.  The only exception to this
requirement shall be with the approval of the Council President, or by the
City Clerk if the President is not available.

§ 32.65  SPECIAL PROVISIONS CONCERNING UTILITY BOND ISSUANCE ORDINANCES.



   (A)   Whenever the  Board of Public Works of the city has
determined and the Common Council thereof finds that any utility is in need
of improvements, extensions, additions, expansions or repairs and that funds
for said project should be provided by the issuance and sale of revenue bonds
payable solely out of said utility's revenues and not constituting a general
obligation of the city, and that rates and charges are increased as a result
thereof, the Council shall provide in the ordinance authorizing said bond
issue that when said bond issue is paid off that the Board of Public Works
shall notify in writing the Council within 90 days of the terminal payment of
such bond issue.



   (B)   Said ordinance shall provide that concurrently with said
written notification the Board of Public Works shall make a written showing
as to why in its opinion said city utility rates or other special revenue
requirements should not be reduced because of the reduced debt service
requirement arising from satisfaction of their outstanding debt.



('74 Code, § 2-39.2)  (Ord. S-190-83, passed 9-27-83; Am. Ord. G-18-92,

      (2)   The resolution thesis shall pertain to:



         (a)   Activities of a local governmental entity, such as
food and beverage tax use, parks and recreation, and local judicial system,
which will directly affect the citizens of the city; or



         (b)   If the resolution is in support of legislation for
the Indiana General Assembly or the United States Congress, the resolution
thesis shall have sponsorship by a member of the local delegation to the
Indiana General Assembly, i.e. nine Senators and Representatives from Fort
Wayne/Allen County; and/or two Senators and one Representative to the United
States Congress which have a direct  effect on the citizens of the city.



   (B)   This protocol shall assist elected officials and citizens in
judging acceptance of, or guidance in writing of, certain resolutions.  The
Common Council will be able to make a strong and effective stand in their
support of certain regional and national legislation that will directly and
primarily affect those people the Councilmembers have been elected to serve.



   (C)   This protocol shall not affect resolution theses that may be

issues, economic development issues, police and fire issues, other department
policies and responsibilities that may be set forth by state statute.



   (D)   This protocol does not stand as an impediment to any member of

circulated amongst the body for signature.  An announcement shall be made at
the beginning of a committee session that such letter of support shall be
circulated, but no formal action shall be taken.  Each elected official may
sign or not, as he/she chooses.



   (E)   Certain resolutions that are introduced, discussed and passed
by the Common Council are non-binding.  They reflect the opinion of the
elected official who signs the document.



   (F)   Other requests for written documents honoring certain persons
shall meet the following protocol:



      (1)   A “certificate of honor” shall be written to
organizations, groups or individuals that may request a resolution for
recognition.



      (2)   The organization, group or individual shall provide
written material about their subject for language composition at least two
weeks before the certificate is needed.



      (3)   There shall be no public presentation at a City Council
meeting; however, if a Councilmember is invited to read such certificate at
an event honoring said organization, group or individual, the certificate of
honor shall be given to the Councilmember for that purpose.



      (4)   Visiting dignitaries such as a sister city delegation,
or a city employee who has had a longstanding, significant relationship with
the City Council, will receive, upon request, this recognition in a public
presentation of the certificate of honor at a City Council meeting.



      (5)   All other certificate of honor documents that are
written according to this protocol shall be mailed to the appropriate
person(s) or given to a City Councilmember or presentation at an outside
event.



      (6)   A certificate of honor is a document printed on
parchment, signed by Councilmembers, dated appropriately, with the city seal
and ribbon affixed.

   (A)   Such Commission shall establish rules and regulations to
implement the provisions of this subchapter affecting rating and promotion of
all Police Officers below the rank of Captain, but which shall not in any way
limit or circumscribe the power and duties delegated to the Board of Public

(‘74 Code, § 20-132)  (Ord. S- 233-82, § 2, 12-28-82; Am. Ord. G-3-19,
passed 1-22-19)



§ 34.03  ELIGIBILITY FOR PROMOTION.



   (A)   Such rules and regulations shall prescribe that the following
four factors shall be the basic components in rating a member of the Police
Department, and that such rating shall determine the eligibility of all
police personnel for promotion to new positions or to fill vacancies in all
ranks below Captain.  All police personnel interested in promotion under the
provision of this chapter are eligible to take a written competitive
examination for a rating, as hereinafter provided:



      (1)   The grade received by a member on a written competitive
examination pertaining to police work in said city.



      (2)   The past performance record of a member of the Police
Department.



      (3)   The seniority rights of a member of the Police
Department.



      (4)   A personal interview by the Commission.



   (B)   The grade received on the written competitive test shall count
as 40% of the rating.  Past performance shall count as 40% of the rating. 
Seniority rights will be based on the number of years of service as a member
of the Police Department, at the rate of .5% for each year's service up to
and including 20 years, and the personal interview by the Commissioners shall
be considered 10% of the rating.



   (C)   To prescribe the manner of determining a rating for past
performance, such rules and regulations shall contain a provision requiring
that performance ratings shall be made every three months for each member of
the Police Department, not including Captains and higher ranks. These ratings
shall be made by the immediate superior officer of the member and shall be
given to the member in person by his superior officer so that the member has
full knowledge of his rating. Such ratings shall then be submitted to the
Chief of Police and kept on file permanently in this office; provided
further; that such rules and regulations shall provide that the chief of the
Police Department shall allow any member to see his rating upon request. If 
then  any  member  is  dissatisfied with his rating, he may  submit 
a  written  statement  to  be  attached permanently to such report and
may request a hearing with the Commission within 30 days of such rating being
disclosed to the officer. The Commission will then hear his case and the
report with his immediate superior officer present. The Commission shall have
the authority to affirm the rating or to increase same. All promotions to any
rank shall be made from the next immediate lower rank, except Captain through
Chief of Police, as hereinafter provided. No acting or temporary rank shall
exceed three months. The Commission shall not have the authority to appoint
or remove from rank any member of the Police Department from Captain through
Chief of Police, but the Mayor, or the Board of Safety shall have the
authority to promote or demote any member of the Police Department from
Captain through Chief of Police. Demotion of any member of the Police
Department from Captain through Chief of Police shall be demotion from rank
only and not removal from the Department. Any person demoted from the rank of
Captain or above shall be assigned to a rank determined by the board of
safety, but in no event to a rank below Sergeant. Provided further that said
examination papers shall be made a part of the permanent file of the
individual officer taking the examination, and they shall be retained in the
office of the Chief of Police, and said individual shall have access to
examine the same any time in the presence of the Chief of Police.

§ 34.04  EVALUATION REPORT.



   There shall be an evaluation report that shall be maintained on all
police personnel which shall be considered in determining their past
performance record. The report shall be made up of at least five descriptive
areas, including their initiative, loyalty, appearance, conduct and
efficiency and each descriptive area shall contain five grading levels based
on proficiency. The evaluation report shall also contain a comment section.
This comment section shall be used by the immediate superior for further
evaluation. This evaluation shall be limited to overall description.

through Chief of the Department, shall be required to have served
continuously as an active member of the department for at least five years

§ 35.05  RULES; ADOPTION; NOTICE AND HEARING.



   (A)   Within 90 days after the commission is selected, the
commission shall adopt rules governing:



      (1)   The selection and appointment of persons to be employed

§ 35.06  DEPARTMENT MEMBERS; TENURE; CHIEF; APPOINTMENT AND QUALIFICATIONS.



   (A)   The commission may appoint and remove members of the
department, except for a member in an upper level policymaking position. The
Mayor shall appoint and may remove a member in an upper level policymaking
position. For the purposes of this subsection, the term "upper level
policymaking positions shall mean the fire chief and the two ranks below the
fire chief. To the extent this in conflict with any other definition
contained in this chapter, this definition shall be controlling.



   (B)   The removal of a member from an upper level policymaking
position is removal from rank only and not from the Fire Department. When the
member is removed, the member shall be appointed by the commission to the
rank in the Fire Department that the member held at the time of the member's
upper level appointment or to any rank to which the member had been promoted
during the member's tenure in the upper level position. If such a rank is not
open in either case, the member is entitled to the pay of that rank and shall
be promoted to that rank as soon as an opening is available.

§ 35.07  DEPARTMENT MEMBERS; APPOINTMENT; QUALIFICATIONS; APPLICATION;
GENERAL APTITUDE TEST; RATINGS; ELIGIBILITY LIST; VACANCIES; PHYSICAL AGILITY

      (1)   A citizen of the United States;



      (2)   A high school graduate or equivalent; and



      (3)   At least 21 years of age, but under 36 years of age.



However, the age requirements do not apply to a person who has been
previously employed as a member of the Fire Department.



   (B)   A person may not be appointed, reappointed, or reinstated if
the person has a felony conviction on the person's record.



   (C)   Applications for appointment or reappointment to the Fire
Department must be filed with the commission. The applicant must produce
satisfactory proof of the date and place of the applicant's birth.



   (D)   Applicants for appointment or reappointment to the Fire
Department must pass the general aptitude test required under state law. The
general aptitude test shall:



      (1)   Reflect the essential functions of the job;



      (2)   Be conducted according to procedures adopted by the
commission; and



      (3)   Be administered in a manner that reasonably accommodates
the needs of disabled applicants.



The results of the general aptitude test shall be filed with the commission.
If the commission finds that the applicant lacks the proper qualifications,
it shall reject the applicant.



   (E)   The applicants shall then be rated on the selection criteria
and testing methods adopted by the commission, which may include mental
alertness, character, habits, and reputation. The commission shall adopt
rules for grading the applicants, including the establishment of a passing
score. The commission shall place the names of applicants with passing scores
on an eligibility list by the order of their scores and shall certify the
list to the City Board of Public Safety.



   (F)   If an applicant for original appointment reaches the
applicant's thirty-sixth birthday, the applicant's name shall be removed from
the eligibility list.



Applicants remain on the list for two years from the date of certification.
After two years a person may reapply as an applicant.



   (G)   When a vacancy occurs in the department, the commission, upon
a written request of the chief of the department, shall administer the
physical agility test required under state law to the applicant having the
highest score on the eligibility list. After the first four applicants with
the highest test scores have been administered the physical agility test, the
Chief may choose an applicant for agility testing that the Chief feels is
particularly worthy. However, at no time may the Chief's choices exceed 20%
of applicants selected to take the physical agility test. If the appointed
applicant successfully completes the physical agility test, the applicant
shall then be enrolled as a member of the Fire Department to fill the vacancy
if:



      (1)   The applicant is still of good character; and



      (2)   The applicant passes the required examinations
identified in state law.



   (H)   All appointments are probationary for a period not to exceed
one year from being sworn in. If the commission finds, upon the
recommendation of the Fire Department during the probationary period, that
the conduct or capacity of the probationary member is not satisfactory, the
commission shall notify the probationary member in writing that the
probationary member is being reprimanded, that the probationary member is
being suspended, or that the probationary member will not receive a permanent
appointment. If a probationary member is notified that the probationary
member will not receive a permanent appointment, the probationary member's
employment immediately ceases. Otherwise, at the expiration of the
probationary period the member is considered regularly employed.

§ 35.08  PROMOTIONS; RULES; REQUISITES; ELIGIBILITY LIST.



   (A)   Rules governing promotions must provide that the following

competitive examination.



      (2)   The score received by the member on an oral competitive
interview.



      (3)   The performance record of the member in the Fire
Department.



      (4)   The member's length of service.



The commission shall determine the weight to be given to each of the factors.
However, neither a member's length of service nor the score received on the
oral interview may comprise more than 20% each of the rating.



   (B)   Promotions to a rank must be from the next lower rank. In
addition, the member being promoted must have served at the lower rank for a
period determined by the commission.



   (C)   Only members who are qualified in rank and length of service
may be given the competitive examinations and placed on an eligibility list.
The eligibility list for a position consists of members who have been placed
on the list in order of their cumulative score on all rating factors. The
eligibility list shall be maintained for two years from the date of
certification, after which time the list shall be retired and a new list
established. The retired list shall be kept for five years and then destroyed.



(Ord. G-09-08, passed 9-9-08)



§ 35.09  PROMOTIONS; COMPETITIVE EXAMINATIONS; PROCEDURES.



   (A)   Before a written competitive examination may be held to fill a
current or expected vacancy in the ranks, the members eligible to take the
examination must be notified of the written materials from which the
questions will be taken. The commission may employ instructors, purchase
materials, and make other expenditures to provide information for applicants
for promotion examinations.



   (B)   The identity of a member taking the written examination shall
be withheld from the person or persons grading the examination, and all
written examinations are confidential. The commission shall notify each
member in writing of the score that the member received on the examination.
The score received by a member on the written examination becomes a part of
the permanent file of the member, and the member is entitled to access to
this file for examination at any time.



   (C)   The examination papers shall be kept under the commission's
supervision. A member who is aggrieved with the score received on the written
examination may appeal to the commission for review of the score. The appeal
must be filed within ten days after notice of the score has been sent to him.
The member may review the questions incorrectly answered by the member and
challenge the answer considered correct by the examiner. The commission shall
either affirm the score or correct the score according to the findings of a
review. The examination papers shall be retired after the two year period
during which the eligibility list is valid. The retired papers shall be kept
for five years and then destroyed.

rating. The rules must require that a performance rating be made at least
once every 12 months for each member of the department, including
probationary members. The rating shall be made by one or more of the member's
superiors, as defined in the commission's rules. Probationary members shall
be rated in the same manner as other members of the department. The ratings
shall be submitted to the Chief of the Fire Department and kept on file in
the Chief's office under the Chief's supervision. The Chief shall notify each

   (B)   A member who is aggrieved with the performance rating given to

§ 35.11  PROMOTIONS; CERTIFICATION OF ELIGIBLE MEMBERS; PROBATION;
PROCEDURES.



   (A)   When a vacancy in rank occurs, the commission shall certify to
the Chief of the Fire Department the three members with the highest scores on
the eligibility list for that particular rank. Within six months the
commission, upon the recommendation of the Chief, shall promote one of those
members to fill the vacant position.



   (B)   All promotions are probationary for a period not to exceed one
year. At the end of the period, a probationary member's superior shall review
the member's performance and recommend to the commission that:

      (2)   The promotion be revoked.



   (C)   The commission shall prepare a rating chart for the superior's
use in making the report. The commission shall review the report and decide

before the commission and be heard on any matter detrimental to the member in
the member's superior's report. The member is also entitled to be represented
by counsel or another representative of the member's choice. If the promotion
is finally revoked the member may not be returned to a rank lower than that
the member held before the probationary promotion.



   (D)   Actions by the commission other than making the promotion
permanent may be appealed within 30 days to the Circuit or Superior Court of
Allen County, with the city being named as the sole defendant, as provided by
IC 36-8-3.5-16(d).

member's remuneration and allowances for insurance benefits to which the
member was entitled before the suspension. In addition, the city may provide
the member's allowances for any other fringe benefits to which the member was

         (b)   Violation of commission rules;

         (f)   Immoral conduct;



         (g)   Conduct injurious to the public peace or welfare;



         (h)   Conduct unbecoming a member; or



         (i)   Furnishing information to an applicant for
appointment or promotion that gives that person an advantage over another
applicant.



   (C)   If the Chief of the Fire Department, after an investigation
within the department, prefers charges against a member of the department for
an alleged breach of discipline under subsection (B), including any civilian
complaint of an alleged breach of discipline under division (B)(2)(f),
(B)(2)(g), or (B)(2)(h), a hearing shall be conducted upon the request of the
member. If a hearing is requested within five days of the Chief preferring
charges, the parties may by agreement designate a hearing officer who is
qualified by education, training, or experience. If the parties do not agree
within this five day period, the commission may hold the hearing or designate
a person or board to conduct the hearing, as provided in the commission's
rules. The designated person or board must be qualified by education,
training, or experience to conduct such a hearing and may not hold an upper
level policy making position. The hearing conducted under this subsection
shall be held within 30 days after it is requested by the member.



   (D)   Written notice of the hearing shall be served upon the accused
member in person or by a copy left at the member's last and usual place of
residence at least 14 days before the date set for the hearing. The notice
must state:



      (1)   The time and place of the hearing;



      (2)   The charges against the member;



      (3)   The specific conduct that comprises the charges;



      (4)   That the member is entitled to be represented by counsel
or another representative of the member's choice;



      (5)   That the member is entitled to call and cross-examine
witnesses;



      (6)   That the member is entitled to require the production of
evidence; and



      (7)   That the member is entitled to have subpoenas issued,
served, and executed.



   (E)   The commission may:



      (1)   Compel the attendance of witnesses by issuing subpoenas;



      (2)   Examine witnesses under oath; and



      (3)   Order the production of books, papers, and other
evidence by issuing subpoenas.



   (F)   If a witness refuses to appear at a hearing of the commission
after having received written notice requiring the witness's attendance, or
refuses to produce evidence that the commission requests by written notice,
the commission may file an affidavit in the Circuit Court of Allen County
setting forth the facts of the refusal as provided in IC 36-8-3.5-17(f).



   (G)   Disobedience of a summons constitutes contempt of the circuit
court from which the summons has been issued. Expenses related to the filing
of an affidavit and the issuance and service of a summons shall be charged to
the witness against whom the summons has been issued, unless the circuit
court finds that the action of the witness was taken in good faith and with
reasonable cause. In that case, and in any case in which an affidavit has
been filed without the issuance of a summons, the expenses shall be charged
to the commission.



   (H)   A decision to discipline a member may be made only if the
preponderance of the evidence presented at the hearing indicates such a
course of action.



   (I)   A member who is aggrieved by the decision of a person or board
designated to conduct a disciplinary hearing under subsection (C) may appeal
to the commission within ten days of the decision. The commission shall on
appeal review the record and either affirm, modify, or reverse the decision
on the basis of the record and such oral or written testimony that the
commission determines, including additional or newly discovered evidence.



   (J)   The commission, or the designated person or board, shall keep
a record of the proceedings in cases of suspension, demotion, or dismissal.
The commission shall give a free copy of the transcript to the member upon
request if an appeal is filed.

§ 35.13  APPEAL TO COURT; SUSPENSION OR DISMISSAL; PROCEDURE.



   A member who is aggrieved by a decision of the commission to suspend
the member for a period greater than ten calendar days, demote the member, or

in IC 36-8-3.5-18, subject to the time limitations and procedural
requirements set forth in said statute.



(Ord. G-09-08, passed 9-9-08)



§ 35.14  SUMMARY DISCIPLINARY ACTIONS; REPRIMAND OR SUSPENSION.



   (A)   In addition to the disciplinary powers of the commission, the
Chief of the Fire Department, may, without a hearing, reprimand or suspend
without pay a member, for a maximum of five working days. For the purposes of
this subsection, eight hours of paid time constitutes one working day.



   (B)   If the Chief reprimands a member in writing or suspends a
member, the Chief shall, within 48 hours, notify the commission in writing of
the action and the reasons for the action. A member who is reprimanded in
writing or suspended under this section may, within 48 hours after receiving
notice of the reprimand or suspension, request in writing that the commission
review the reprimand or suspension and either uphold or reverse the Chief’s
decision. At its discretion, the commission may hold a hearing during this
review. If the board holds a hearing, written notice must be given either by
service upon the member in person or by a copy left at the member's last and
usual place of residence at least 14 days before the date set for the
hearing. The notice must contain the information listed under § 35.12(D) of
this chapter. If the decision is reversed, the individual who was suspended
is entitled to any wages withheld as a result of the suspension.

serve until the end of calendar year 2009.



(Ord. G-09-08, passed 9-9-08)



§ 35.16  TEMPORARY LEAVE OF ABSENCE; SENIORITY; REINSTATEMENT.



   (A)   If it is necessary for the Board of Public Safety to reduce
the number of members of the Fire Department, the reduction shall be made by
granting a temporary leave of absence, without pay or financial obligation to
the city, to the appropriate number of members. The last member appointed
shall be put on leave first, with other members also put on leave in reverse
hiring order, until the desired level is achieved.



   (B)   If the Fire Department is increased in number again, the
members of the Fire Department who have been granted leaves of absence under
this section shall be reinstated before an applicant on the eligibility list
is appointed to the Fire Department. The reinstatements begin with the last
member granted a leave.



   (C)   A member on leave of absence shall keep the commission advised
of the member's current address. A member shall be informed of the member's
reinstatement by written notice. Within ten calendar days after a member
receives notice of reinstatement, the member must advise the commission that
the member accepts reinstatement and will be able to commence employment on
the date specified in the notice. All reinstatement rights granted to a
member terminate upon the member's failure to accept reinstatement within
that period.



(Ord. G-09-08, passed 9-9-08)



§ 35.17 RULES; PRINTING; COPIES TO DEPARTMENT MEMBERS; EFFECTIVE DATE.



   The Fire Department shall print all rules of the commission and furnish
a copy to each member of the Fire Department. Amendments to the rules take
effect 30 days after their adoption if copies have been furnished to all
members of the Fire Department within that period. Otherwise, they do not
take effect until copies are furnished to all members of the Fire Department.

§ 37.20  PROCEDURES FOR PROPOSED PROJECT REQUIRING PROFESSIONAL SERVICES
WHEN COMPETITIVE SEALED PROPOSALS METHOD OR QBS METHOD UTILIZED.



   (A)   When a project requiring professional services is proposed by
the city, the City Selection Committee shall:



      (1)   Transmit a request for statements of qualifications to
firms which appear on the city's vendor list; and



      (2)   Give adequate public notice of the proposed project,
which may include posting on the city's website, a third party internet site
used by the city, or in a newspaper advertisement, requesting firms to submit
a statement of qualifications for the proposed project. This notice must
appear for at least two weeks with one additional week allowed for response
before receipt of firm qualifications. As indicated in IC 5-16-11.1-4, the
public notice must include:



         (a)   The location of the project;



         (b)   A general description of the project;



         (c)   The general criteria to be used in selecting
professional services firms for the project;



         (d)   The place where any additional project description
or specifications are on file;



         (e)   The hours of business of the public agency; and



         (f)   The last date for accepting statements of
qualifications from interested parties.



   (B)   The City Selection Committee may establish a list of
pre-qualified firms on an annual basis to use on an on-call basis or for
projects that do not meet the cost threshold requirements of § 37.18. If the
firms are prequalified for the particular project specified, the city may
move directly to Request for Proposals as indicated in § 37.  .



(Ord. G-13-12, passed 5-8-12)



§ 37.21  CRITERIA FOR EVALUATION OF INTERESTED FIRM.



   (A)   The City Selection Committee shall individually evaluate those
firms submitting statements of qualification for a proposed project according
to the selection criteria requested in the RFQ and past performances with the
city.



   (B)   The City Selection Committee shall establish a reasonable
weight (points) associated with each of these criteria. Office location may
be considered as a criteria to be evaluated. The weighting must be sent out
with each RFQ so every firm will understand the basis for ratings.



   (C)   The City Selection Committee shall compile the statement of
qualifications submitted for a proposed project, determine which firms have
qualifications and past performance history that is reasonably acceptable and
qualified for award of the project, and determine an initial ranking of most
qualified firms by reference to the selection criteria identified in
statement of qualifications; interviews also may be conducted as part of the
selection process.



   (D)   The City Selection Committee will then proceed to the
competitive sealed proposals process for most projects or to the
qualifications based selection process unless exceptions listed in § 37.18
apply.



   (E)   Competitive sealed proposals. For those projects for which
professional services are to be selected by the competitive sealed proposals
process the following procedure shall be followed:



      (1)   Issuance of RFP. A RFP will be issued to those firms
whose qualifications were deemed acceptable by the City Selection Committee.
The RFP shall include desired specifications, all contractual terms, and
conditions applicable to the procurement. The RFP shall state the relative
importance of price and other evaluation factors. Specific numerical
weighting is required. Evaluation factors may include but are not limited to
categories such as price, quality, experience, expertise, qualifications,
method of approach, responsiveness, financial strength, any other factors the
City Selection Committee considers pertinent, etc. The RFP shall include the
last date for accepting competitive sealed proposals from interested parties.
The RFP shall include the time and place where the proposals will be opened
publicly. No public notice need be given of this invitation to submit
competitive sealed proposals because such notice was previously given and
this is a unique professional services hiring process explicitly dictated by
this subchapter.



      (2)   Receipt of proposals.  Proposals shall be opened
publicly in the presence of one or more witnesses at the time and place
designated in the RFP. The name of each offeror shall be read. All other
information contained in the proposals shall be confidential so as to avoid
disclosure of contents prejudicial to competing offerors during the
negotiation process. Proposals shall be open for public inspection only after
contract award. A proposal, modification, or withdrawal is late if it is
received at the location designated in the RFP after the time and date set
for proposal opening. A late proposal, late modification, or late withdrawal
shall be rejected, unless the proposal, modification or withdrawal would have
been timely received but for the action or inaction of city personnel and is
received before contract award. Prior to the scheduled opening, the
responsible department may open an offer to identify the offeror. If this
occurs, the staff member shall record the reason for opening the offer, the
date and time the offer was opened, and the solicitation number. The offer
shall be secured and retained for public opening.



      (3)   Clarifications of offers.  The purpose for
clarifications is to provide for a greater mutual understanding of the offer.
Clarifications are not negotiations and material changes to the RFP or offer
shall not be made by clarification. The project manager may request
clarifications from any offeror(s) at any time after receipt of offers.
Clarifications may be requested orally or in writing. If clarifications are
requested orally, the offeror shall confirm the request in writing. A request
for clarifications shall not be considered a determination that the offeror
is susceptible for award. Any clarifications shall be retained in the
procurement file.



      (4)   Determination if not susceptible for award.  A project
manager may determine at any time during the evaluation period and before
award that an offer is not susceptible for award. The project manager shall
notify the offeror in writing of the final determination that the offer is
not susceptible for award unless the project manager determines that
notification to the offeror would compromise the city's ability to negotiate
with other offerors. A determination of non-susceptibility shall be based on,
but not limited to, the following:



         (a)   A legal offer has not been submitted due to the
lack of an authorized signature on the designated offer form; or



         (b)   The offer is not within the competitive range in
comparison to other offers based on the scoring of evaluation criteria as set
forth in the solicitation.



         (c)   The offeror has submitted an incomplete proposal
including, but not limited to, failure to provide requested documents and/or
attend mandatory meeting(s).



      (5)   Negotiations with responsible offerors. Negotiations
must be conducted with all offerors determined to be reasonably susceptible
and qualified for award. Negotiations may be conducted orally or in writing.
If oral negotiations are conducted, the offeror shall confirm the
negotiations in writing. Offerors may revise offers based on negotiations
provided that any revision is confirmed in writing. The city may conduct
negotiations with responsible offerors to improve offers in such areas as
cost, price, further define and refine scope, performance, or terms, to
achieve the best value for the city based on the requirements and the
evaluation factors set forth in the solicitation. Once negotiations are
initiated, an offeror may withdraw an offer at any time before the final
proposal revision due date and time by submitting a written request to the
project manager. The project manager shall ensure there is no disclosure of
one offeror's price or any information derived from competing offers to
another offeror.



      (6)   Final proposal revisions/best and final offer.  The
project manager shall request written final proposal revisions from any
offeror with whom negotiations have been conducted. Final proposal revisions
shall be requested only once, unless the city project manager makes a written
determination that it is advantageous to the city to conduct further
negotiations or change the city's requirements. The project manager shall
include in the written request:



         (a)   The date, time, and place for submission of final
proposal revisions; and



         (b)   A statement that if offerors do not a submit a
written notice of withdrawal or a written final proposal revision, their last
revision shall be accepted as their final proposal revision.



   (F)   Qualifications based selection. For those projects for which
professional dervices are to be selected by the qualifications based
selection process, the following procedure shall be followed.



      (1)   The City Selection Committee may conduct discussions,
check references, and require interviews with firms deemed to be the most
qualified according to statement of qualifications. Information regarding the
cost of professional services for the proposed project shall not be a factor
in the evaluations of firms until negotiations are begun in accordance with
§ 37.  .



      (2)   The City Selection Committee shall select on the basis
of the evaluations in this section, at least three firms that are judged to
be the most qualified and rank them accordingly. If fewer than three firms
are judged to be qualified, then those firms shall be ranked in like-manner
and the City Selection Committee shall provide a detailed explanation as to
why other firms were not qualified or not available.



      (3)   On-call service.



         (a)   Projects requiring services previously identified
in § 37.  will be sent to the pre-qualified list of firms proposing to
provide professional services for proposed projects.



         (b)   Firms shall then be ranked in accordance with the
process in this section with negotiations to follow with the highest ranked
firm in accordance with § 37.  or with the highest ranked firms through a
RFP process.



      (4)   Negotiation of contract.



         (a)   Based on the ranking developed in the statement of
qualifications. The City Selection Committee shall contact the highest ranked
firm and attempt to negotiate professional services contract for a fair and
reasonable value that takes the following into account:



            1.   The estimated value of the services needed;



            2.   The scope and complexity of the proposed
project;



            3.   The business risk anticipated;



            4.   The professional nature of the services
required;



            4.   Any other criteria that the City Selection
Committee deems relevant.



         (b)   If the City Selection Committee is unable to
negotiate a satisfactory contract with the highest ranked firm, negotiations
with that firm shall be terminated. The City Selection Committee shall then
negotiate with the next firm in the rankings, continuing this procedure until
an agreement is reached or the list of ranked firms is exhausted.



         (c)   If negotiations with all of the ranked firms fail
to result in a satisfactory contract, the City Selection Committee shall
reevaluate the professional services involved in the proposed project and
proceed to comply with this subchapter until a contract is successfully
negotiated.



         (d)   On-call professional services will be obtained
using the same negotiation process with a pre-qualified group of firms unless
a RFP process is followed.



         (e)   The city shall at all times retain the right to
terminate negotiations and/or cancel the procurement of professional services.



         (f)   No firm shall be deemed to have been conferred by
the city an interest in a contract or arrangement for the provision of
professional services by participating in the processes provided in this
subchapter.

§ 37.22  CONTRACT APPROVAL.



   City Council will approve or reject the contract of the project manager
to the responsible offeror whose proposal is determined in writing to be the
most advantageous to the city, taking into consideration price and the other
evaluation factors set forth in the request for proposals. No other factors
or criteria shall be used in the evaluation. The contract file shall contain
the basis on which the award is made. After contract award, the proposals
shall be open for public inspection except to the extent that the withholding
of information is permitted or required by law. If the offeror designates a
portion of its proposal as confidential, it shall isolate and identify in
writing the confidential portions but the City is still subject to public
records law. Material portions of all finalists' proposals shall be attached
to the ordinance.

Manager's determination shall be reviewable by the Director of Public
Works.  The Director's decision shall be final and appealable.  These
administrative procedures shall be conducted consistent with IC 4-21.5-3, et

a period of greater than seven consecutive days.



      (2)   Failure to properly dispose of a Freon waste item within
a seven day period shall constitute a nuisance under this section punishable

   (G)   (1)   The Board of Public Works shall have the
responsibility and authority to adopt rules and regulations governing the
implementation of this residential municipal waste collection and disposal
program which shall include the authority to appoint an agent for the

disposal program established hereunder shall be reviewed at least annually. 
Said rate system shall be adjusted as necessary to provide sufficient funds
to pay any and all contract fees for collection, hauling and/or disposal of

shall also strive to equitably assess charges in a manner conducive to
voluntary recycling.

   City of Fort Wayne



   ADMINISTRATIVE POLICY



   for



   Enforcing Chapter 50: Garbage and Refuse



   October 1, 1996



The purpose of Chapter 50: Garbage and Refuse is to control the disposal of
waste to limit unsightly storage that blights neighborhoods and to prevent
sources of habitation and food for vectors, rodents, and other vermin that
present a hazard to the  public health.  To this end, enforcing departments
shall attempt to gain voluntary compliance with the requirements of Chapter
50: Garbage and Refuse, and will issue tickets when necessary to attain
compliance.  The authority for enforcing §§50.04 through 50.19 is with the
Fort Wayne Police Department, the Department of Neighborhood Code
Enforcement, the Energy and Environmental Services Department, and the Allen
County Department of Public Health.



Order of Primary Responsibility for Compliance



Property Owner



The property owner shall be responsible for providing sufficient refuse
storage containers for the disposal of refuse (§50.04).  If refuse storage
containers are absent, inadequate, or not rodent- proof, enforcing
authorities shall cite the property owner with a violation.



Property Occupant



The occupant of the property shall bear the primary responsibility for all
other aspects of compliance with Chapter 50: Garbage and Refuse.  Enforcing
authorities shall first cite the occupant (when property can reasonably be
assumed to be occupied) for violations other than the provision of proper
refuse storage containers.



Rental Property Move-Out Conditions



In recognition that tenants sometimes move out of properties without giving
due and proper notice to property owners, special attention shall be given to
such situations when issuing citations.  Any violations of Chapter 50:
Garbage and Refuse, except with regard to the provision of refuse storage
containers, shall first cite the occupant as the party with primary
responsibility.  If the property appears to be vacant with a recent tenant
move-out, the property owner shall be given seven days, from when the city is
notified of the problem, to comply with any and all violations.



After the property is vacant for seven days, the property owner will be
deemed to be the party with primary responsibility for compliance with
Chapter 50: Garbage and Refuse and enforcing authorities shall cite the
property owner with appropriate violations.

pretreatment standards; or



            2.   An industrial user that:



               a.    Discharges an average of 25,000 gpd or
more of process wastewater to the POTW (excluding sanitary, noncontact
cooling and boiler blowdown wastewater);

the basis that it has a reasonable potential for adversely affecting the
POTWs operation or for violating any pretreatment standard or requirement.



            3.   The City may determine that an industrial
user subject to categorical pretreatment standards is a non-significant
industrial user rather than a significant industrial user on a finding that
the industrial user never discharges more than 100 gallons per day (gpd) of
total categorical wastewater (excluding sanitary, non-contact cooling and
boiler blowdown wastewater, unless specifically included in the pretreatment
standard) and the following conditions are met:

         (b)   Pass through the treatment works or otherwise be
incompatible with such works;



         (c)   Prevent the reclamation and/or recycling of
municipal or industrial wastewaters and sludges.



   (E)   However, nothing in this section or elsewhere in this chapter
shall be read to allow the user to discharge pollutants which shall cause
interference or pass through and/or to absolve the user from liability in the
occurrence of a discharge which causes such interference or pass through.



   (F)   When requested by the City, a user must submit information on
the nature and characteristics of its wastewater within 30 days of the
request.



   (G)   No significant industrial user shall discharge wastewater into
the POTW without first obtaining a valid industrial wastewater discharge
permit, which shall contain the specific pretreatment program requirements to
be complied with by the user. The City may also require other users to obtain
an industrial wastewater discharge permit as necessary to carry out the
purposes of this chapter.



   (H)   Any violation of the terms and conditions of a valid
industrial wastewater discharge permit, including any best management

§ 51.031  PRETREATMENT FACILITIES; APPROVAL OF PROPOSED PLANS, OPERATION.



   (A)   General. Industrial users shall provide wastewater treatment
as necessary to comply with this chapter and shall achieve compliance with
all categorical pretreatment standards, local limits, and the prohibitions
set out in this chapter within the time limitations specified by EPA, the
State of Indiana, or the City, whichever is more stringent. Any facilities
necessary for compliance shall be provided, operated, and maintained at the
users' expense.



   (B)   Prior approval. Detailed plans describing such facilities and
operating procedures shall be submitted to the City for review, and shall be
acceptable to the City before such facilities are constructed. The review of
such plans and operating procedures shall in no way relieve the user from the
responsibility of modifying such facilities as necessary to produce a
discharge acceptable to the City under the provisions of this chapter.



   (C)   Operation. Where pretreatment facilities are provided pursuant
to the Superintendent's approval, they shall be maintained continuously in
satisfactory and effective operating condition at the user's expense and
shall be subject to periodic and random inspection and sampling by the City.
The user responsible for such facilities shall maintain suitable operating
records which shall be open to inspection by the City, and shall submit to
the Superintendent such summary reports of the character of the influent and
effluent of the facilities as the Superintendent may require. All 1records
and reports shall be retained for a minimum of three years.



   (D)   Pursuant to 40 CFR 403.12, the City may, at its discretion,
require that records be kept for a longer period in the case of unresolved
litigation or when requested by the approval authority.



   (E)   All industrial users, whether defined as categorical or
noncategorical industry by state and federal regulation, shall comply with
all applicable requirements of 40 CFR 403.12, including, when applicable,
baseline monitoring reports (BMRs), 90-day compliance reports, and periodic
compliance reports.



   (F)   Additional measures. Whenever deemed necessary, the City may
require users to restrict their discharge during peak flow periods, designate
that certain wastewater be discharged only into specific sewers, relocate
and/or consolidate points of discharge, separate waste streams, and such
other conditions as may be necessary to protect the POTW and determine the
user's compliance with the requirements of this chapter.



   (G)   Bypass.



      (1)   For the purposes of this section:



         (a)   BYPASS means the intentional diversion of
wastestreams from any portion of a user's treatment facility.



         (b)   SEVERE PROPERTY DAMAGE means substantial physical
damage to property, damage to the treatment facilities which causes them 19to
become inoperable, or substantial and permanent loss of natural resources
which can reasonably be expected to occur in the absence of a bypass. Severe
property damage does not mean economic loss caused by delays in production.



      (2)   A user may allow any bypass to occur which does not
cause pretreatment standards or requirements to be violated, but only if it
also is for essential maintenance to assure efficient operation. These
bypasses are not subject to the provisions of this section.



         (a)   Bypass is prohibited, and the Superintendent may
take an enforcement action against a user for a bypass, unless:



            1.   Bypass was unavoidable to prevent loss of
life, personal injury, or severe property damage;



            2.   There were no feasible alternatives to the
bypass, such as the use of auxiliary treatment facilities, retention of
untreated wastes, or maintenance during normal periods of equipment downtime.
This condition is not satisfied if adequate back-up equipment should have
been installed in the exercise of reasonable engineering judgment to prevent
a bypass which occurred during normal periods of equipment downtime or
preventive maintenance; and



            3.   The user submitted notices as required under
this section.



         (b)   The Superintendent may approve an anticipated
bypass, after considering its adverse effects, if the Superintendent
determines that it will meet the three conditions listed above.



      (3)   Bypass notifications.



         (a)   If a user knows in advance of the need for a
bypass, it shall submit prior notice to the Superintendent, at least ten days
before the date of the bypass, if possible.



         (b)   A user shall submit oral notice to the
Superintendent of an unanticipated bypass that exceeds applicable
pretreatment standards within 24 hours from the time it becomes aware of the
bypass. A written submission shall also be provided within five days of the
time the user becomes aware of the bypass. The written submission shall
contain a 20description of the bypass and its cause; the duration of the
bypass, including exact dates and times, and, if the bypass has not been
corrected, the anticipated time it is expected to continue; and steps taken
or planned to reduce, eliminate, and prevent reoccurrence of the bypass. The
Superintendent may waive the written report on a case-by-case basis if the
oral report has been received within 24 hours.

§ 51.032  FEDERAL PRETREATMENT STANDARDS.



   (A)   As part of this chapter the City shall enforce this ordinance
and all federal pretreatment standards including but not limited to
categorical pretreatment standards upon industrial users within its service
area or within the service area of any contract customers.



   (B)   Categorical industrial users must comply with all applicable
categorical pretreatment standards. All categorical pretreatment standards,
as found in 40 CFR Chapter I, Subchapter N, Parts 405-471, are hereby
incorporated by reference into this chapter, as if fully set forth herein.



      (1)   Where a categorical pretreatment standard is expressed
only in terms of either the mass or concentration of a pollutant in
wastewater, the City may impose equivalent concentration or mass limits in
accordance with 40 CFR 403.6.



      (2)   When the limits in a categorical pretreatment standard
are expressed only in terms of mass of pollutant per unit of production, the
City may convert the limits to equivalent limitations expressed as either
mass of pollutant discharged per day or effluent concentration for purposes
of calculating limitations applicable to individual industrial users in
accordance with 40 CFR 403.6.



      (3)   When wastewater subject to categorical pretreatment
standards is mixed with wastewater not regulated by the same standard, the
City shall impose an alternate limit in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6.



   (C)   Baseline monitoring reports.



      (1)   Within either 180 days after the effective date of a
categorical pretreatment standard, or the final administrative decision on a
category determination under 40 CFR 403.6(a)(4), whichever is later, existing
categorical industrial users currently discharging to or scheduled to
discharge to the POTW shall submit to the Superintendent a report which
contains the information listed below. At least 90 days prior to commencement
of their discharge, new sources, and sources that become categorical
industrial users subsequent to the promulgation of an applicable categorical
standard, shall submit to the Superintendent a report which contains the
information listed below. A new source shall report the method of
pretreatment it intends to use to meet applicable categorical standards. A
new source also shall give estimates of its anticipated flow and quantity of
pollutants to be discharged.



      (2)   Categorical industrial users described above shall
submit the information set forth below.



         (a)   Identifying information.



            1.   The name and address of the facility,
including the name of the operator and owner.



            2.   Contact information, description of
activities, facilities, and plant production processes on the premises.



         (b)   Environmental permits. A list of any environmental
control permits held by or for the facility.



         (c)   Description of operations. A brief description of
the nature, average rate of production (including each product produced by
type, amount, processes, and rate of production), and standard industrial
classifications of the operation(s) carried out by such user. This
description should include a schematic process diagram, which indicates
points of discharge to the POTW from the regulated processes.



         (d)   Types of wastes generated, and a list of all raw
materials and chemicals used or stored at the facility which are, or could
accidentally or intentionally be, discharged to the POTW.



         (e)   Number and type of employees, hours of operation,
and proposed or actual hours of operation.



         (f)   Type and amount of raw materials processed
(average and maximum per day).



         (g)   Site plans, floor plans, mechanical and plumbing
plans, and details to show all sewers, floor drains, and appurtenances by
size, location, and elevation, and all points of discharge.



         (h)   Time and duration of discharges.



         (i)   The location for monitoring all wastes covered by
the permit.



         (j)   Flow measurement. Information showing the measured
average daily and maximum daily flow, in gallons per day, to the POTW from
regulated process streams and other streams, as necessary, to allow use of
the combined wastestream formula set out in 40 CFR 403.6(e).



         (k)   Measurement of pollutants.



         (l)   The categorical pretreatment standards applicable
to each regulated process and any new categorically regulated processes for
existing sources.



         (m)   The results of sampling and analysis identifying
the nature and concentration, and/or mass, where required by the standard or
by the Superintendent, of regulated pollutants in the discharge from each
regulated process.



            1.    Instantaneous, daily maximum, and long-term
average concentrations, or mass, where required, shall be reported.



            2.   The user shall take a minimum of one
representative sample to compile that data necessary to comply with the
requirements of this paragraph. The sample shall be representative of daily
operations and shall be analyzed in accordance with procedures set out in 40
CFR 136. Where the standard requires compliance with a BMP or pollution
prevention alternative, the user shall submit documentation as required by
the Superintendent or the applicable standards to determine compliance with
the standard.



            3.   Samples should be taken immediately
downstream from pretreatment facilities if such exist or immediately
downstream from the regulated process if no pretreatment exists. If other
wastewaters are mixed with the regulated wastewater prior to pretreatment the
user should measure the flows and concentrations necessary to allow use of
the combined wastestream formula in 40 CFR 403.6(e) to evaluate compliance
with the pretreatment standards. Where an alternate concentration or mass
limit has been calculated in accordance with 40 CFR 403.6(e) this adjusted
limit along with supporting data shall be submitted to the control authority.



            4.   Sampling and analysis shall be performed in
accordance with 40 CFR 136.



         (n)   The Superintendent may allow the submission of a
baseline report which utilizes only historical data so long as the data
provides information sufficient to determine the need for industrial
pretreatment measures.



         (o)   The baseline report shall indicate the time, date
and place of sampling and methods of analysis, and shall certify that such
sampling and analysis is representative of normal work cycles and expected
pollutant discharges to the POTW.



         (p)   Compliance certification. A statement, reviewed by
the user's authorized representative as defined in § 51.001 and certified by
a qualified professional, indicating whether pretreatment standards are being
met on a consistent basis, and, if not, whether additional operation and
maintenance (O&M) and/or additional pretreatment is required to 20meet the
pretreatment standards and requirements.



         (q)   Compliance schedule. If additional pretreatment
and/or O&M will be required to meet the pretreatment standards, the shortest
schedule by which the user will provide such additional pretreatment and/or
O&M must be provided. The completion date in this schedule shall not be later
than the compliance date established for the applicable pretreatment standard.



         (r)   Signature and report certification. All baseline
monitoring reports must be certified in accordance with this chapter and
signed by an authorized representative as defined in § 51.001.



   (D)   Compliance schedule progress reports. The following conditions
shall apply to any compliance schedule required by this chapter.



      (1)   The schedule shall contain progress increments in the
form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to
the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the
user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but
are not limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final
plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing and completing
construction, and beginning and conducting routine operation);



      (2)   No increment referred to above shall exceed nine months;



      (3)   The user shall submit a progress report to the
Superintendent no later than 14 days following each date in the schedule and
the final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it
complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if
appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return to the established
schedule; and



      (4)   In no event shall more than nine months elapse between
such progress reports to [the Superintendent].



   (E)   Reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard
deadline. Within 90 days following the date for final compliance with
applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source
following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the POTW, any
user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to
the Superintendent a report containing the information described in this
chapter. For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits
established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report
shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate.
For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed
in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other
measure of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production
during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed
and certified in accordance 4with of this chapter. All sampling will be done
in conformance with 40 CFR 136.



   (F)   Periodic compliance reports.



      (1)   All significant industrial users must, at a frequency
determined by the Superintendent submit no less than twice per year (June and
December) reports indicating the nature, concentration of pollutants in the
discharge which are limited by pretreatment standards and the measured or
estimated average and maximum daily flows for the reporting period. In cases
where the pretreatment standard requires compliance with a best management
practice (BMP) or pollution prevention alternative, the user must submit
documentation required by the Superintendent or the pretreatment standard
necessary to determine the compliance status of the user.



      (2)   If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this
section monitors any regulated pollutant at the appropriate sampling location
more frequently than required by the Superintendent, using the procedures
prescribed in this chapter, the results of this monitoring shall be included
in the report. [Note: See 40 CFR 403.12(g)(6)].



   (G)   Reports of changed conditions. Each user must notify the
Superintendent of any significant changes to the user's operations or system
which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least
30 days before the change.



      (1)   The Superintendent may require the user to submit such
information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition,
including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit  application.



      (2)   The Superintendent may issue an individual wastewater
discharge permit under this ordinance or modify an existing wastewater
discharge permit in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed
conditions.



   (H)   Reports from unpermitted users. All users not required to
obtain an individual wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate
reports to the Superintendent as the Superintendent may require.



   (I)   Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting.



      (1)   If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation,
the user must notify the Superintendent within 24 hours of becoming aware of
the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and
submit the results of the repeat analysis to the Superintendent within 30
days after becoming aware of the violation. Resampling by the industrial user
is not required if the City performs sampling at the user's facility at least
once a month, or if the City performs sampling at the user between the time
when the initial sampling was conducted and the time when the user or the
City receives the results of this sampling, or if the City has performed the
sampling and analysis in lieu of the industrial user.



      (2)   If the City performed the sampling and analysis in lieu
of the industrial user, the City will perform the repeat sampling and
analysis unless it notifies the user of the violation and requires the user
to perform the repeat sampling and analysis. See 40 CFR 403.12(g)(2).



   (J)   Notification of the discharge of hazardous waste.



      (1)   Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste
shall notify the POTW, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director,
and State hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the
POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous
waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the
hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste
number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user
discharges more than 100 kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the
POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the
extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an
identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an
estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the
wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the
mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the
following 12 months. All notifications must take place no later than 180 days
after the discharge commences. Any notification under this division need be
submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However,
notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under this chapter. The
notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already
reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the
self-monitoring requirements of this chapter.



      (2)   Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of division
(1) above, during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than  15
kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes
as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than 15
kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any
quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and
261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which
the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not
require additional notification.



      (3)   In the case of any new regulations under section 3001 of
RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or Fisting any
additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the
Superintendent, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director,
and State hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance
within 90 days of the effective date of such regulations.



      (4)   In the case of any notification made under this section,
the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume
and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to
be economically practical.



      (5)   This provision does not create a right to discharge any
substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit
issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law.



   (K)   Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including
sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit
application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques
prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and amendments thereto, unless otherwise
specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part
136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in
question, or where the EPA determines that the Part 136 sampling and
analytical techniques are inappropriate for the pollutant in question,
sampling and analyses shall be performed by using validated analytical
methods or any 13other applicable sampling and analytical procedures,
including procedures suggested by the Superintendent or other parties
approved by EPA.



   (L)   Certification statements. The following certification
statement is required to be signed and submitted by users submitting permit
applications in accordance with this chapter; users submitting baseline
monitoring reports [Note: See 40 CFR 403.120]; users submitting reports on
compliance with the categorical pretreatment standard deadlines ; and users
submitting periodic compliance reports. The following certification statement
must be signed by an authorized representative as defined in § 51.001:



   "I certify under penalty of law that this document and all attachments
were prepared under my direction or supervision in accordance with a system
designed to assure that qualified personnel properly gather and evaluate the
information submitted. Based on my inquiry of the person or persons who
manage the system, or those persons directly responsible for gathering the
information, the information submitted is, to the best of my knowledge and
belief, true, accurate, and complete. I am aware that there are significant
penalties for submitting false information, including the possibility of fine
and imprisonment for knowing violations."

§ 51.035  SUBMISSION OF DATA ON INDUSTRIAL WASTE, INDUSTRIAL WASTE
DISCHARGE PERMITS.



   Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall
retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of
information 6obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this
chapter, any additional records of information obtained pursuant to
monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such
requirements, and documentation associated with best management practices
established pursuant to this chapter. Records shall include the date, exact
place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the
samples; the dates the analyses were performed; who performed the analyses;
the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses.
These records shall remain available for a period of at least three years.
This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any
litigation concerning the user or the City, or where the user has been
specifically notified of a longer retention period by the City.



   (A)   (1)   Any person proposing to discharge industrial waste
into the City's sewerage system either directly or indirectly, shall first
fill out and file, with the Superintendent, an industrial waste
questionnaire, baseline monitoring report or permit application, the form for
which will be furnished by the City, in which shall be set forth the quantity
and characteristics of the wastes discharged into the City's sewerage system.
Any owner desiring to establish a new connection to the public sewer or to
establish a new account with sewage works for the purpose of discharging
industrial or commercial waste shall 90 days prior to discharge first fill
out and file with the Superintendent such a questionnaire, baseline
monitoring report or permit application, which shall contain the actual or
predicted data relating to the quantity and characteristics of the wastes to
be discharged. The Superintendent will evaluate the data furnished by the
potential user and may require additional information, the Superintendent
will determine whether to issue an individual wastewater discharge permit.
The Superintendent may deny any application for an individual wastewater
discharge permit.



      (2)   An individual wastewater discharge permit shall include
such conditions as are deemed reasonably necessary by the Superintendent to
prevent pass through or interference, protect the quality of the water body
receiving the treatment plant's effluent, protect worker health and safety,
facilitate sludge management and disposal, and protect against damage to the
POTW.



      (3)   All rules and regulations of the sewer utility must also
be followed by a permitted user.



   (B)   Any user who plans to add, change, or modify manufacturing or

representation or certification in any application, report or other document
required by this chapter or other applicable regulations shall, upon
conviction, be punished by the imposition of a criminal penalty as required
by local and/or state statutes.



   (E)   All significant industrial users, whether categorical or
non-categorical, shall comply with the reporting requirements found at 40 CFR
403.12. Data collected to satisfy reporting requirements must be
representative of the conditions occurring during the period covered by the
report. All samples shall be collected using protocols, including appropriate
preservation, specified in 40 CFR Part 136.



   (F)   Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the
date postmarked by the United States Postal Service or the documented date
transferred to an alternate carrier such as Federal Express or UPS. For hand
delivered reports, the date of receipt shall govern.



   (G)   A penalty of $50 may be assessed to any user for each report
required by this chapter, a permit, or order that is submitted 15 days or
more after the required submittal date. Actions taken by the City to collect
late reporting penalties shall not limit the City's authority to initiate
other enforcement actions for late reporting violations.



   (H)   (1)   To be covered by a general control mechanism issued
by the Superintendent under this section for indirect dischargers of a
particular type with similar characteristics requiring the same discharge
limitations and the same monitoring requirements, a significant industrial
user must file a written request for coverage that identifies:



         (a)   Its contact information;



         (b)   Production processes;



         (c)   The types of wastes generated;

the general control mechanism;



         (e)   Any requests in accordance with 40 CFR
403.12(e)(2) for a monitoring waiver for a pollutant neither present nor
expected to be present in the discharge (waiver is not effective in the
general control mechanism until after the City has provided written notice
that the waiver has been granted);



         (f)   Any other information the City deems appropriate;
and



         (g)   Includes the signature of an authorized
representative of the user and the certification language included in §
51.032(L).



      (2)   And the significant industrial user must retain a copy
of the general control mechanism documentation to support the City's
determination that the user is involved in the same or substantially similar
type of operation, discharges the same types of wastes, requires the same
effluent limitations, and requires the same or similar monitoring as the
general control mechanism category, and a copy of the user's written request
for coverage, during the effectiveness of the control mechanism and for a 3
year period following the expiration of the general control mechanism. A
significant industrial user subject to a production-based categorical
Pretreatment Standard, a categorical Pretreatment Standard expressed as a
mass pollutant discharged per day, or based on the Combined Wastestream
Formula or Net/Gross calculations, may not be controlled through a general
control mechanism.

§ 51.036  CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION.



   Information and data furnished to the City by any person shall be made
available to the public or other governmental agency without restriction
unless the person specifically requests and is able to demonstrate in
accordance with 40 CFR 2.204 and 327 IAC 12.1 that the release of such
information would divulge information and/or methods of production entitled
to protection as trade secrets or proprietary information of said person. The
above limitation to access has no application to the EPA or the Indiana
Department of Environmental Management and other government agencies, which
shall be entitled to immediate and unlimited access to all information
collected by the City under its pretreatment program. Further, under no
circumstances may the amount, frequency, concentration, temperature, or
characteristics of the discharge (to the extent related to water quality) be
considered confidential. All requests, by the user, for confidentiality of
information shall be made in accordance to and governed by the provisions of
327 IAC 12.1 and 40 CFR 2.

that produce such discharges.



(Ord. G-5-18, passed 3-13-18)



§ 51.037  CONTROL MANHOLES.



   Any person who discharges or may discharge industrial wastes into a
public sewer via any means such as floor drains, sinks, catch basins, and the
like, shall be required by the Superintendent to construct and maintain, at
his own expense, one or more control manholes, at a specified location or
locations, to facilitate the observation, measurement and sampling of owner's
waste. Such manholes shall be constructed in accordance with the standards
and specifications of the City. The Superintendent may also require the
person to install and maintain in any such manhole, at said person's expense,
an approved volume-measuring device. Plans and/or shop drawings for the
installation of control manholes and related equipment shall be approved by
the Superintendent before any construction is begun.



(Ord. G-5-18, passed 3-13-18)



§ 51.038  GREASE AND SAND TRAPS.



   Whenever the Superintendent determines that interceptors or traps are
needed to protect the City's sewerage collection system or the City's
treatment plant from grease, oil, sand or similar substances occurring in any
person's sewage and so notifies said person, then such traps shall be
promptly installed by said person, at said person's expense and shall be so
maintained by that person that none of such substances can be discharged or
carried over into the public sewers. All traps or interceptors shall meet the
City's standards as to construction, location and installation.



(Ord. G-5-18, passed 3-13-18)



§ 51.039  INSPECTIONS; WASTE SAMPLING.



   (A)   (1)   The Superintendent or his or her authorized
representative, or agent, shall have a right to enter any user's premises to
carry out the objectives of this chapter, including, but not limited to
inspection, measuring and sampling, and records examination and copying. Any
user may be subject to periodic and random inspections by the City for the
purpose of determining compliance with permit limitations, solvent management
plans or spill prevention plans, identifying dilution streams or to
categorize regulated processes. These inspections may consist of monitoring
waste streams, inspection of the premises, inspection and/or copying of
production records, pretreatment operating records and other records or data
deemed necessary by the inspector for the purposes stated above.



      (2)   The Superintendent shall have the right to set up on the
user's property, or require installation of, such devices as are necessary to
conduct sampling and/or metering of the user's operations.



      (3)   The Superintendent may require the user to install
monitoring equipment as necessary. The facility's sampling and monitoring
equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operating
condition by the user at its own expense. All devices used to measure
wastewater flow and quality shall be calibrated at least once per year to
ensure their accuracy.



   (B)   All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's
discharge. Control manholes and or flow measurement installations shall be
properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all
times. The failure of a user to keep such facilities in good working order
shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample and or flow results
are unrepresentative if its discharge. The installation, operation and
maintenance of the sampling facilities shall be the responsibility of the
user discharging the wastes and shall be subject to the approval of the
Superintendent. Access to the sampling facilities shall be granted, at all
times, to the Superintendent.



   (C)   (1)   Where any user's operations have security measures in
force which require proper identification and clearance before entry onto
user's property is granted, such user shall make the necessary arrangements
with their security personnel that upon showing of proper identification
personnel from the City shall be permitted to enter, without delay, for the
purpose of observing or monitoring of wastes being discharged at a given
point or points or that user shall install suitable control manholes outside
of the security area or areas, which at all times will be immediately
available to City personnel.



      (2)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction to safe and easy
access to the facility to be inspected and/or sampled shall be promptly
removed by the user at the written or verbal request of the Superintendent
and shall not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access shall be borne
by the user.



      (3)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Superintendent
access to the user's premises shall be a violation of this chapter.

§ 51.040  WASTE ANALYSIS PROCEDURES AND CHARGES.



   All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, required under
this chapter or by any industrial wastewater discharge permit, shall be
performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136 and
amendments thereto unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical
pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or
analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, or where the EPA
determines that the Part 136 sampling and analytical techniques are
inappropriate for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses shall be
performed by using validated analytical methods of any other applicable
sampling and analytical procedures, including procedures suggested by the
City or other parties approved by EPA.



   (A)   Charges to users. When surveillance sampling is conducted by
the City, a split shall be made available for analysis by user upon request.
Analyses made by the City at the request of the user shall be charged to the
user according to the sewage works' standard work order billing procedure.



   (B)   Charges to governmental agencies. Analyses performed by the
Water Pollution Control Plant Laboratory for any governmental agency, or
political subdivision of a city, county or state shall be billed to such
agency or subdivision for direct labor and expenses according to the sewage
works' standard work order billing procedure. Analyses performed for other
agencies shall not have priority over the regular Water Pollution Control
Plant analyses unless in the judgment of the Superintendent the urgency of
the analyses warrants such priority.



   (C)   Charges of outside services. Analyses performed by the Water
Pollution Control Plan Laboratory for any person shall be billed at the rate
established by the Water Pollution Control Plant Laboratory for such analyses.



   (D)   Charges collected. All waste analysis charges collected under
divisions (A) through (B) above shall be recorded as credits to the operating
costs of the Water Pollution Control Plant and a quarterly accounting thereof
shall be forwarded to the Superintendent. All such charges are to be used to
defray the operation and maintenance expenses incurred by the Water Pollution
Control Plant in performing said analyses.



   (E)   Compliance reports must be based upon sampling and analysis
performed during the period covered by the report, which data are
representative of conditions occurring during the reporting period. Grab
samples must be used for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide,
and total volatile organic compounds. Frequency of monitoring will be
required as necessary to assess and assure compliance with applicable
pretreatment standards and requirements. For all other pollutants, 24-hour
composite samples must be obtained through flow-proportionate composite
sampling techniques, unless time-proportional composite sampling or grab
sampling is authorized by the control authority. Where time proportional
composite sampling or grab sampling is authorized by the control authority,
the samples must be representative of the discharge and the decision to allow
the alternative sampling must be documented in the industrial user file for
the facility. Using protocols (including appropriate preservation) specified
in 40 CFR Part 136 and appropriate United States Environmental Protection
Agency guidance, multiple grab samples collected during a 24-hour period may
be composited prior to the analysis as follows: for cyanide, total aphenols,
and sulfides the samples may be composited in the laboratory or in the field;
for volatile organics and oil and grease the samples may be composited in the
laboratory. Composite samples for other parameters unaffected by the
compositing procedures as documented in approved United States Environmental
Protection Agency methodologies may be authorized by the control authority,
as appropriate.



   (F)   For sampling required in support of baseline monitoring and
90-day compliance reports, a minimum of four (4) grab samples must be used
for pH, cyanide, total phenols, oil and grease, sulfide, and volatile organic
compounds for facilities for which historical sampling data do not exist; for
facilities which historical sampling data are available, the control
authority may authorize a lower minimum. For periodic reports for users
subject to categorical standards and reporting requirements for users not
subject to categorical pretreatment standards, the control authority shall
require the number of grab samples necessary to assess and assure compliance
by users with applicable pretreatment standards and requirements.

§ 51.041  USE OF REPRESENTATIVE ANALYSIS.



   Until an adequate analysis of a representative sample of user's wastes
has been obtained, the City may, for the purpose of this chapter, make a
6determination of the character and concentration of the wastes by using data
based on analysis of similar processes or data for this type of business that
are available from the United States Environmental Protection Agency or from
industry-recognized authoritative sources. This method, if selected by the
City, shall continue at the City's discretion or until an adequate analysis
has been made.

§ 51.067  EXEMPT WATER - GENERAL.



   (A)   Where a significant portion of the metered water does not and
cannot enter the sewerage system, either directly or indirectly, the person
having charge of the property may request permission from the city to install
at the user's expense either an approved meter or meters to determine the
quantity of water that cannot enter the sewerage system or an approved sewage
measuring device or devices to determine the volume of sewage that actually
enters the sewerage system. In any case the service charge shall be based on
the quantity of water that can or actually does enter the public sewers but
in no case shall it be less than the minimum charge for the class of user
served. Plans and specifications for all such meters shall be submitted to
the Superintendent of the Water Pollution Control Plan and approved prior to
installation.



   (B)   Unless otherwise provided in this section, the private water
exemption meters including deduct, adduct and well meter(s) shall be read by
the customer or the person having charge of the property. Exemption meter
reads shall be reported to city utilities by a date as required by city
utilities. Only exemption meter reads taken within a period of time set by
city utilities during the billing cycle will be deducted from the monthly
city utility charge.



      (1)   City utilities staff shall audit the exemption meter
reads annually. If there is a difference between the exemption meter read and
the audit, a correction bill or credit will be issued to the customer's
account.



      (2)   Customers with private water exemption meters including
deduct, adduct, and well meter(s) may request city utilities staff to read
the private water exemption meter(s) for a monthly fee of $20 for each
private exemption account and $8 for each private exemption meter associated
with the private exemption account. In the event a customer with a private
water exemption meter does not report their meter read to city utilities,
city utilities may read the private water exemption meter for a fee of $20
for each private exemption account and $8 for each private exemption meter
associated with the private exemption account.

   The city may require a person to install and maintain at the user's
expense an approved device to measure directly the volumes of wastes
discharged to the sewerage system if those volumes cannot otherwise be
determined from the metered-water consumption records. The city shall inspect
and approve such installation and no such services, once installed, shall be
removed without the city's approval.

§ 51.068.5 DEPOSIT TO ENSURE PAYMENT OF SEWER FEES; REFUNDS; FORFEITURES;
USES.



   (A)   Pursuant to IC 36-9-23-28, city utilities may require the
owner, lessee, or user of property served by the utility to pay a deposit to
ensure payment of sewer fees.



   (B)   The deposit required shall equal the estimated average payment
due from the property served by the utility for a three-month period.
Deposits shall be retained in a separate fund.



   (C)   (1)   The deposit, less any outstanding penalties and
service fees, shall be refunded to the depositor after a notarized statement
from the depositor that as of a certain date the property being served:



         (a)   Has been conveyed or transferred to another
person; or



         (b)   No longer uses or is connected with any part of
the municipal sewage system.



      (2)   A statement under division (C)(1) must include the name
and address of the person to whom the property is conveyed or transferred.



   (D)   If a depositor fails to satisfy costs and fees within 60 days
after the termination of his/her use or ownership of the property served, the
deposit and all accrued interest is forfeited. The forfeited amount shall be
applied to the depositor's outstanding fees. Any excess that remains due
after application of the forfeiture may be collected in the manner set out in
§§ 51.099 and 51.100 herein. A deposit may be used to satisfy all or part
of any judgment awarded the municipality under this chapter.



   (E)   A deposit made under this section that has remained unclaimed
by the depositor for more than seven years after the termination of the
services for which the deposit was made becomes the property of city
utilities.

§ 51.072  STRENGTH OF WASTE SURCHARGE.



   (A)   Each user discharging wastes into the collection system shall
be subject to a Strength Surcharge, in addition to other sewage service
charges imposed by this chapter, based on the following minimum strength
characteristics to the extent that such wastes are in concentrations greater
than:



      (1)   Biochemical oxygen demand of 300 milligrams per liter.



      (2)   Chemical oxygen demand of 600 milligrams per liter.



      (3)   Suspended solids content of 300 milligrams per liter.



      (4)   Phosphorus content of 10 milligrams per liter.



      (5)   Ammonia content of 25 milligrams per liter.



   (B)   Strength of waste surcharge inside city.



      (1)   In the event any inside city user in this classification
contributes waste having strength of sewage in excess of domestic waste
characteristics, as herein defined, a surcharge based on the following unit
process charges will be in effect for all waste found to be in excess of
limitations:

      (2)   The surcharge shall be determined as follows: the excess
pounds of BOD or COD (whichever results in the higher charge) suspended
solids, phosphorus and ammonia will each be computed by first multiplying the
user's billing sewage volume measured in units of 100 cubic feet for the
current billing period by the factor 0.0062321 and then multiplying this
product by the difference between, (a) the concentrations measured in
milligrams per liter, of the BOD (or COD), suspended  solids, phosphorus and
ammonia respectively in the user’s sewage, and (b) the allowed
concentrations set out in § 51.072. The surcharge for each constituent will
then be determined by using the excess pounds of each constituent by the
appropriate rate of surcharge. In the event COD measurement is used, as
hereinbefore provided, 50% of the excess pounds measured will be used to
compute the equivalent BOD charge.

§ 51.077  CONTRACT CUSTOMERS.



   (A)   Contract customer rates are applicable only to those users
that meet the criteria described in the definition of a contract customer. If
a user does not meet the criteria in the definition of a contract customer,
the user will be considered to be a retail customer and retail rates shall
apply.



   (B)   In the event City Utilities consummates a contract to serve as
a regional treatment plant to a contract customer the following fees and
charges shall apply:



      (1)   Treatment charge (per 100 cubic feet).



      (2)   Conveyance charge (per 100 cubic feet). A variable
charge for conveyance and collections costs attributable to each contract
customer's portion of the city conveyance system, operating costs associated
therewith, shall be computed by the city and added to the treatment to arrive
at the contractee's total metered rate.



      (3)   Monthly service charge.



      (4)   Surveillance/evaluation charge. All contract customers
discharging wastes into the system that require continuing surveillance
sampling and waste evaluation, shall be subject to § 51.071(A)
Surveillance/evaluation charge inside city to cover the costs of such
services.



      (5)   Excess strength of waste. In the event a contract
customer user contributes waste having a strength of sewage in excess of
domestic waste characteristics, as hereinbefore defined, a surcharge shall be
implemented per § 51.072(B) Strength of waste surcharge inside city.



      (6)   Capital surcharge. In the event a contract customer
delivers sewage for treatment to the city for three consecutive billing
periods (approximately 90 consecutive days) which is in excess of the base
volume limit guaranteed in the contract, then the customer will be subject to
a capital surcharge, computed at the capital rate per 100 cubic feet in
effect for outside the city customers set out elsewhere herein. The capital
rate per 100 cubic feet shall be multiplied by the excess percentage of
volume calculated by dividing the daily average for three billing periods by
the contracted volume limit (in gallons per day).



      (7)   Volumetric exceedance fee. The additional fee for
exceedances to the contractual volume limits to be collected from contract
customer users discharging sewage to the water pollution control utility.
This fee (also defined and specified in contracts under different
terminology, such as the "Treatment Plant Capital Surcharge") shall be
collected as specified in each contract and calculated as defined by the
contract. Such fees shall contribute to the payment of costs associated with
operation, installation, adjustment or other improvements to the water
pollution control utility intended to serve the contract customer when it
discharges flows exceeding the capacity allocated per the contract.



      (8)   Peak flow exceedance fee. The additional fee for
exceedances to the contractual peak flow limits to be collected from contract
customer users discharging sewage to the water pollution control utility.
This fee (also defined and specified in contracts under different
terminology, such as "Peak Penalty Rates") shall be collected as specified in
each contract and calculated as defined by the contract. Such fees shall
contribute to the payment of costs associated with operation, installation,
adjustment or other improvements to the water pollution central utility
intended to serve the contract customer when it discharges flows exceeding
the capacity allocated per the contract.



      (9)   Other provisions. In the event sewage received pursuant
to any contract entered into under this section exceeds any of the
limitations imposed by this chapter, City Utilities shall have the right to
impose all limitations, charges and penalties applicable to any non- contract
customer user. Each contract entered into by City Utilities pursuant to the
foregoing rate classification shall provide that the contract customer shall
agree to enact and maintain a sewer use ordinance and user charge system
acceptable to City Utilities and in conformance with City Utilities'
obligations under § 204(b)(1), Public Law 92-500 as amended and
supplemented, and guidelines and regulations promulgated thereunder by the
U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and 40 CFR 35-905-8, 35-928-1 and
35-928-2 and 35-935-13.

DELINQUENT ACCOUNTS; BILLING OF SERVICE CHARGES



§ 51.090  BILLING PERIOD.



   (A)   Charges for sewerage services shall be computed and billed by
the general office of the city utilities. Bills shall be rendered
approximately monthly, unless additional billing is required to reflect
customer changes, meter changes, service terminations, initial billings or is
otherwise required to adjust billing cycles. For the purpose of this chapter,
a month shall constitute 25 - 35 days. Service periods falling outside this
parameter shall be prorated.



   (B)   Billings for sewerage service shall be rendered with and shall
be due and payable on the same due date as billings for water service to the
same premises, if any, and if none, then within such billing cycle as the
utility may determine.



('74 Code, § 24-40)  (Ord. G-16-86, passed 4-22-86; Am. Ord. G-17-94,
passed 8-23-94; Am. Ord. G-12-09, passed 5-26-09; Am. Ord. G-6-12, passed

§ 51.091  LIABILITY FOR PAYMENT; EXAMINATION OF UTILITY RECORDS.



   (A)   Charges for sewerage service shall be billed to the person
being billed for water service, if any, unless by contract with the utility,
another person assumes responsibility for payment. Notwithstanding billing
to, and assumption of responsibility by any person, charges for sewerage
service shall remain the responsibility of the owner of the real estate, who
shall hold the utility harmless from any loss occasioned by the delinquency
of the person billed, including all penalties, recording fees, attorney's
fees, interest, and court costs, if any.



   (B)   The owner of the real estate or person billed shall have the
right to examine the utility's records of billing and collection to ascertain
whether such charges have been paid, and the amount thereof.



   (C)   Nothing herein contained shall permit any person other than
the owner, or the person being billed, to inspect, examine or otherwise
obtain confidential information including the payment/ credit history,
income, employment, finances or social security number of the person being
billed.

   The rates, charges and surcharges fixed in this chapter shall extend to
and cover any additional premises hereafter served, without hearing or

billing month, then the charges for sewerage service for such billing shall
be made in accordance with standard practice employed by the city's water
utility.

   Where an industrial, commercial or other non-residential enterprise is
operating in a unified manufacturing or service arena composed of two or more
contiguous parcels of real estate and is supplied with water through two or
more meters, upon application by the owner or his/her authorized agent, a
consolidation of the water meter readings may be made for the purpose of
calculating the sewerage service charge.

§ 51.096  DELINQUENT ACCOUNTS; PENALTIES.



   Charges for sewerage service levied pursuant to this chapter shall be
due and payable on or before the due date stated on the bill. Any charge for
sewerage and/or stormwater service not paid by the due date shall be
delinquent, and may be collected, with any applied penalty, recording fees,
service charges, attorney's fees, interest and court costs, if any, in
accordance with this chapter and with IC 36-9-23-31 through 36-9-23-34. A
penalty of 10% of the amount of the charges for sewerage service and/or
stormwater service shall be attached to the delinquent charges.

§ 51.097  TERMINATION OF WATER SERVICE DUE TO DELINQUENCY.



   Where the property having a delinquent account for charges for sewerage
service is served by the city's water utility, the utility may, after
reasonable notice to the person being billed, as provided by the rules and
regulations of the utility adopted by the Board of Public Works, shut off
water service to the property. Water service shall not be restored until the
delinquent account, together with any required deposit and the costs of
turning off/turning on the water, shall have been paid.

ADMINISTRATION AND ENFORCEMENT



§ 51.110  RULES AND REGULATIONS; BOARD OF WORKS AUTHORITY.



   The Board of Public Works of the City shall, in accordance with the
statutes of the state, and subject to the provisions and requirements of this
chapter, make and enforce appropriate rules and regulations for the safe,
economical and efficient management and operation of the City's sewage works,
for the construction and use of sewers, building sewers, appurtenances and
connections to the sewerage system; for the regulation, collection and
refunding of rates and charges for sewerage service; and for the
implementation and enforcement of the provisions of this chapter.



(Ord. G-5-18, passed 3-13-18)



§ 51.111  ENFORCEMENT.



   (A)   Those provisions of this chapter not specifically dealt with
elsewhere shall be enforced by the Director of City Utilities and such
deputies as Director, with the approval of the Board of Public Works, may be
appointed for such purposes. Whenever said Director or any such deputy shall
deem it appropriate to charge any person with a violation(s) of this chapter,
he/she shall issue to such person a notice of violation and/or summons, which
shall be processed according to the provisions of IC 34-28-5 and sewer rules
and regulations, or pursuant to an ordinance adopted in accordance with IC
36-1-6-9.



   (B)   The remedies provided for in this chapter are not exclusive.
The City may take any, all, or any combination of these actions against a
noncompliant user. Enforcement of pretreatment violations will generally be
conducted in accordance with the City's enforcement response plan as adopted
by the Board of Public Works. However, the City may take other action against
any user when the circumstances warrant. Further the City is empowered to
take more than one enforcement action against any noncompliant user.



   (C)   When the Superintendent finds that a user has violated, or
continues to violate, any provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater
discharge permit, or order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment
standard or requirement, the Superintendent may petition the Allen County
Superior Court, Misdemeanor and Traffic Division, through the City Attorney
for the issuance of a temporary or permanent injunction, as appropriate,
which restrains or compels the specific performance of the individual
wastewater discharge permit, order, or other requirement imposed by this
chapter on activities of the user. The Superintendent may also seek such
other action as is appropriate for legal and/or equitable relief, including a
requirement for the user to conduct environmental remediation. A petition for
injunctive relief shall not be a bar against, or a prerequisite for, taking
any other action against a user.



   (D)   The Superintendent may after informal notice to the
discharger, immediately and effectively halt or prevent any discharge of
pollutants to the POTW which reasonably appears to present an imminent
endangerment to the health or welfare of persons. The POTW may also, after
notice to the affected industrial users and an opportunity to respond, halt
or prevent any discharge to the POTW which presents or may present an
endangerment to the environment or which threatens to interfere with the
operation of the POTW.



   (E)   If the violation has not been corrected pursuant to the
requirements set forth in the administrative order, or after a decision
upholding the appeal of an administrative order, the Superintendent, or his
duly authorized representative, shall have the authority to enter upon the
user's premises and are authorized to take any and all measures necessary to
abate the violation, including physically severing the sewer connection,
and/or terminating water service to the facility. It shall be unlawful for
any person, owner, agent or person in possession of any premises to refuse to
allow the government agency or designated contractor to enter upon the
premises for the purposes set forth above. Penalties shall include but are
necessarily limited to those found in this chapter.



   (F)   The Superintendent shall at least annually publish notice in a
newspaper of general circulation that provides meaningful public notice in
the jurisdiction served by the POTW, the industrial users which, at any time
during the previous 12 months, were in significant noncompliance with
applicable pretreatment requirements.



(Ord. G-5-18, passed 3-13-18)



§ 51.112  SEWERAGE WORKS IMPROVEMENT FUND.



   The City Controller shall establish and maintain, for as long as user
charges and surcharges are collected under the rate schedule instituted
herein, accounts relating to the issuance of sewerage works revenue bonds now
outstanding and further in accordance with the laws of the State of Indiana
relative to the deposit and disbursement of public funds.



(Ord. G-5-18, passed 3-13-18)



§ 51.999  PENALTY FOR VIOLATION.



   (A)   Any person who violates or fails to comply with any provision
of this chapter or of the rules and regulations of the Board of Public Works
or administrative orders pertaining thereto, shall be subject to a fine of up
to $2,500 per day as set out at § 10.99 of the City of Fort Wayne Code of
Ordinances or as otherwise provided by IC 34-28-5. Each day that such
violation(s) or noncompliance continues shall constitute a separate offense.



   (B)   A user who has violated, or continues to violate, any
provision of this chapter, an individual wastewater discharge permit, or
order issued hereunder, or any other pretreatment standard or requirement
shall be liable to the City for a minimum civil penalty of $1,000 per
violation, per day. In the case of a monthly or other long-term average
discharge limit, penalties shall accrue for each day during the period of the
violation.



   (C)   The Superintendent may recover reasonable attorneys' fees,
court costs, and other expenses associated with enforcement activities,
including sampling and monitoring expenses, and the cost of any actual
damages incurred by the City.



   (D)   In determining the amount of civil liability, the Court shall
take into account all relevant circumstances, including, but not limited to,
the extent of harm caused by the violation, the magnitude and duration of the
violation, any economic benefit gained through the user's violation,
corrective actions by the user, the compliance history of the user, and any
other factor as justice requires.



   (E)   Filing a suit for civil penalties shall not be a bar against,
or a prerequisite for, taking any other action against a user.



   (F)   Upset.



      (1)   For the purposes of this section, UPSET means an
exceptional incident in which there is unintentional and temporary
noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards because of factors
beyond the reasonable control of the user. An upset does not include
noncompliance to the extent caused by operational error, improperly designed
treatment facilities, inadequate treatment facilities, lack of preventive
maintenance, or careless or improper operation.



      (2)   An upset shall constitute an affirmative defense to an
action brought for noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards if
the requirements of division (F)(3), below, are met.



      (3)   A user who wishes to establish the affirmative defense
of upset shall demonstrate, through properly signed, contemporaneous
operating logs, or other relevant evidence that:



         (a)   An upset occurred and the user can identify the
cause(s) of the upset;



         (b)   The facility was at the time being operated in a
prudent and workman-like manner and in compliance with applicable operation
and maintenance procedures; and



         (c)   The user has submitted the following information
to the  Superintendent within 24 hours of becoming aware of the upset if
this information is provided orally, a written submission must be provided
within five days:



            1.   A description of the indirect discharge and
cause of noncompliance;



            2.   The period of non-compliance, including exact
dates and times or, if not corrected, the anticipated time the noncompliance
is expected to continue; and



            3.   Steps being taken and/or planned to reduce,
eliminate, and prevent recurrence of the noncompliance.



      (4)   In any enforcement proceeding, the user seeking to
establish the occurrence of an upset shall have the burden of proof.



      (5)   Users shall have the opportunity for a judicial
determination on any claim of upset only in an enforcement action brought for
noncompliance with categorical pretreatment standards.



      (6)   Users shall control production of all discharges to the
extent necessary to maintain compliance with categorical pretreatment
standards upon reduction, loss, or failure of its treatment facility until
the facility is restored or an alternative method of treatment is provided.
This requirement applies in the situation where, among other things, the
primary source of power of the treatment facility is reduced, lost, or fails.

CROSS-CONNECTION CONTROL AND BACKFLOW PREVENTION



§ 52.30  GENERAL PROVISIONS.



   (A)   Purpose.



      (1)   To provide for the protection of the public potable
water system from the possibility of contamination or pollution by isolating
within its water customers' private water systems any contaminants or
pollutants which could, under adverse conditions, backflow into the public
potable water system.



      (2)   To provide for the maintenance of a continuing program
of cross-connection control which will, effectively, prevent or control
existing or potential cross connections.



   (B)   Authority.



      (1)   The Utility has the responsibility to supply safe,
potable water to the point of delivery from the public potable water system
to the water customer's service line. The Utility, therefore, has the
authority to prevent, by appropriate means, the backflow of contaminated or
polluted water or any other foreign substance from entering the public
potable water system and to require certain backflow prevention assemblies in
private customer water systems to prevent backflow into the public potable
water system.



      (2)   Public Health agencies have the overall responsibility
to protect the health of individuals within their jurisdiction. Therefore,
relevant regulations have been promulgated, empowering the health agency to
eliminate dangerous plumbing or piping.



      (3)   Water customers have the responsibility to test and
maintain their respective private customer water systems free of cross
connections and to comply with all federal, state, county and city laws,
ordinances and regulations pertaining to cross connections.



      (4)   The Utility shall be the interpreter of this chapter and
the arbiter and judge as to whether a backflow prevention assembly is
required. If such a backflow prevention assembly is required, the Utility
shall determine the type and the location of the assembly.



      (5)   This chapter is intended to supplement the Indiana
Plumbing Code, 675 IAC 16-1.4 and 327 IAC 8-10 and shall not be construed to
supersede any of the foregoing provisions.



   (C)   Policy. The policy of the Utility is to control backflow by
containment of all cross connections which shall be found to exist or which
may be installed in the future on private customer water systems. Containment
shall be achieved by:



      (1)   Assuring that the customer water system, or any portion
thereof, which may create or is causing backflow, is physically disconnected
from the public potable water system; or by



      (2)   Installing an approved backflow prevention assembly at
the appropriate location to isolate said customer water system from the
public potable water system.



   (D)   Definitions. As used in this chapter, the following terms have
the following meanings:



      AIR GAP.  an unobstructed vertical distance through atmosphere
between the discharge end of a pipeline supplied from a public water supply
and the overflow rim of the receiving portion of the customer water system.



      APPROVED BACKFLOW PREVENTION ASSEMBLY.  an assembly that is in
accordance with 327 IAC 8-10-7(b).



      BACKFLOW.  The flow of water or contaminants into the public
potable water system from a source other than the public water supply.



      CROSS CONNECTION.  Any physical arrangement, including cross
connection control devices not in working order, whereby the public potable
water system is directly connected, either continuously or intermittently,
with any secondary source of supply, sewer, drain, conduit, pool, piping,
storage reservoir, plumbing fixture, or other device that contains, or may
contain, and is capable of imparting to the public water supply,
contaminants, contaminated water, sewage, or other waste or liquid of unknown
or unsafe quality.



      CROSS CONNECTION CONTROL DEVICE INSPECTOR. A person that meets
the definition of 327 IAC 8-10-1(8).



      CONTAINMENT.  A method of backflow prevention which requires an
approved backflow prevention assembly at the water service entrance.



      CUSTOMER WATER SYSTEM.  All piping, fixtures, and appurtenances,
including secondary sources of supply, used by a customer to convey water on
his or her premises.



      DEGREE OF HAZARD (POLLUTANT OR CONTAMINANT).  Either a "low
hazard pollutant" which is only aesthetically objectionable (i.e., unusual
taste, odor, beverages, and the like) or a "high hazard contaminant" that
could cause illness or death if ingested (i.e., bacteriological, toxic
chemicals, radioactive materials, and the like).



      DOUBLE CHECK VALVE ASSEMBLY.  A device or assembly composed of
two tightly closing shutoff valves surrounding two independently acting check
valves, with four test cocks, one upstream of the four valves and one between
each of the four check and shutoff valves.



      HEALTH AGENCY.  The health authority having jurisdiction;
federal, state or local.



      POINT OF DELIVERY.  See SERVICE CONNECTION.



      PRIVATE FIRE SERVICE.  Refers to a privately owned arrangement
of pipes, fixtures and devices installed for the purpose of providing fire

check valves effectively divide the structure into three chambers. Pressure
is reduced in each downstream chamber allowing the pressure differential
relief valve to vent the center chamber to atmosphere should either or both
check valves malfunction.



      SERVICE CONNECTION.  The terminal end of a service connection
from the public potable water system, i.e., where the Utility loses
jurisdiction and sanitary control over the water at its point of delivery to
the customer water system.



      TESTING RESULTS.  The results of inspections or tests conducted
pursuant to section 327 IAC 8-10-8(b) on air gaps, reduced pressure principle
back-flow preventers, double check valve assemblies, and pressure vacuum
breakers.



      TEMPORARY WATER SERVICE.  Water service supplied through a fire
hydrant for short-term use, typically for construction projects or other
special purposes (excluding preparation of food and drink for human
consumption), for which a mobile or stationary meter is required.



      UTILITY.  Fort Wayne City Utilities, operator of the City of
Fort Wayne's public potable water system.



      WATER CUSTOMER.  Any person who receives water from the City of
Fort Wayne.



(Ord. G-6-18, passed 3-27-18)



§ 52.31  BACKFLOW PREVENTION REQUIRED.



   Backflow prevention is required when one or more of the following
situations apply:



   (A)   By Order of the Indiana Department of Environmental Management
in accordance with 327 IAC 8-10-4(d).



   (B)   By order of the Utility, provided that notice is given that
specifies the nature of the customer activity that necessitates designation
of the facility as a cross-connection hazard and a date by which the facility
must comply with the order.



   (C)   For new construction of any of the following types of
facilities:



      (1)   Facilities that present a cross-connection hazard as
designated in § 52.32(A)(7);



      (2)   Proposed facilities with unknown tenants, commonly known
as "spec buildings";



      (3)   Facilities that plan to use carbonated fountain soft
drink machines;



      (4)   Facilities with a secondary source of supply, including
but not limited to, emergency use, fire prevention, irrigation, or economics;
or



      (5)   Facilities that plan to use fire protection service
lines in the facility.



   (D)   For existing facilities proposing the following types of
modifications:



      (1)   Installation of a new customer service line if the
facility is one of the types of facilities identified in § 52.31(C);



      (2)   Modifications to a facility's customer service line if

      (3)   Modifications involving the installation of additional
or larger capacity meters if the facility is one of the types of facilities
identified in § 52.31(C).



   (E)   For any existing facility with a cross connection.



   (F)   For any use of temporary water service.



(Ord. G-6-18, passed 3-27-18)



§ 52.32  INSTALLATION, TESTING, REPORTING, AND ACCESS.



   (A)   Installation of approved backflow prevention assemblies.



      (1)   Use of backflow prevention assembly. When backflow
prevention is required as set forth in § 52.31, the water customer shall
install, at the water customer's expense, an approved backflow prevention
assembly that is in accordance with 327 IAC 8-10-7 and provides protection
commensurate with the degree of hazard, hydraulic conditions, and is
appropriate with the length of time the backflow prevention assembly is
subject to be under pressure.



      (2)   Location. The backflow prevention assembly shall be
located immediately downstream of the water meter and shall not be bypassed
by any means. There shall be no taps upstream of the backflow prevention
assembly that are not protected by additional backflow prevention assemblies.
The existence of backflow prevention assemblies on the water customer's
premises other than at this required location shall not negate the
requirement at this location. Exact installation, alignment and elevation
requirements shall be determined by reference to 327 IAC 8-10-7 and other
applicable state and local regulations.



      (3)   Uninterrupted service. Water customers needing
continuous service that cannot be interrupted for testing the backflow
prevention assembly shall install dual backflow prevention assemblies in
parallel so that they can be checked separately.



      (4)   Looped taps. Heat exchange loops intentionally returning
water to the public potable water system shall not be allowed. Any other loop
or set of taps into a private customer water system allowing water to return
to the public potable water system shall require approved backflow prevention
assemblies on all taps.



      (5)   Private fire service. No connection shall be made to any
fire hydrant or private fire service without an approved backflow prevention
assembly. Private fire service that is permanent in nature shall incorporate
a double check valve assembly in one hundred-percent water systems or a
reduced pressure principle backflow preventer in chemical systems. Where
domestic service is tapped into a private fire service, the domestic tap
shall be subject to all the provisions of this chapter.



      (6)   Pre-existing facilities. In general, pre-existing
backflow preventers will not be allowed simply because they were approved
before the enactment of this chapter. The Utility will review the operation

§ 53.13  DETERMINATION OF LAND DISTURBANCE.



   In calculating the total area of land disturbance, for the purposes of
determining applicability of this Chapter to the project, the following
guidelines should be used:



   (A)   Off-site construction activities that provide services (for
example, road extensions, sewer, water, and other utilities) to a land
disturbing project site, must be considered as a part of the total land
disturbance calculation for the project site, when the activity is under the
control of the project site owner.



   (B)   Strip developments will be considered as one (1) project site
and must comply with this Chapter unless the total combined disturbance on
all individual lots is less than one (1) acre and is not part of a larger
common plan of development or sale.



   (C)   To determine if multi-lot project sites are regulated by this
rule, the area of land disturbance shall be calculated by adding the total
area of land disturbance for improvements, such as, roads, utilities, or
common areas, and the expected total disturbance on each individual lot, as
determined by the following:



      (1)   For a single-family residential project site where the
lots are one-half (0.5) acre or more, one-half (0.5) acre of land disturbance
must be used as the expected lot disturbance.



      (2)   For a single-family residential project site where the
lots are less than one half (0.5) acre in size, the total lot must be
calculated as being disturbed.



      (3)   To calculate lot disturbance on all other types of
projects sites, such as industrial and commercial projects project sites, a
minimum of one (1) acre of land disturbance must be used as the expected lot
disturbance, unless the lots are less than one (1) acre in size, in which
case the total lot must be calculated as being disturbed.



   (D)   The calculation methods as well as the type, sizing, and
placement of all stormwater pollution prevention measures for construction
sites shall meet the design criteria and the technical standards and
specifications approved by the Board of Stormwater Management.

§ 53.15  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS FOR STORMWATER QUALITY CONTROL.



   All storm water quality measures and erosion and sediment controls
necessary to comply with this Chapter must be implemented in accordance with
the stormwater pollution prevention plan and comply with the technical
standards adopted by the Board of Stormwater Management.  All water quality
measures must be sufficient to satisfy the following conditions.



   (A)   Minimize the potential for soil erosion by designing a
development that fits the topography and soils of the site. Deep cuts and
fill in areas with steep slopes should be avoided wherever possible, and
natural contours should be followed as closely as possible.



   (B)   Existing natural vegetation should be retained and protected
wherever possible. Areas immediately adjacent to watercourses and lakes also
should be left undisturbed wherever possible. Unvegetated or vegetated areas
with less than 70% cover that are scheduled or likely to be left inactive for
15 days or more must be temporarily or permanently stabilized with measures
appropriate for the season to reduce erosion potential. Alternative measures
to site stabilization may be acceptable if the project site owner or their
representative can demonstrate they have implemented and maintained erosion
and sediment control measures adequate to prevent sediment discharge from the
inactive area.



   (C)   All activities on a site should be conducted in a logical
sequence so that the smallest practical area of land will be exposed for the
shortest practical period of time during development.



   (D)   The length and steepness of designed slopes should be
minimized to reduce erosion potential. Drainage channels and swales must be
designed and adequately protected so that their final gradients and resultant
velocities will not cause erosion in the receiving channel or at the outlet.



   (E)   Sediment-laden water which otherwise would flow from the
project site shall be treated by erosion and sediment control measures
appropriate to minimize sedimentation. A stable construction site access
shall be provided at all points of construction traffic ingress and egress to
the project site.



   (F)   Appropriate measures shall be implemented to prevent wastes or
unused building materials, including, garbage, debris, packaging material,
fuels and petroleum products, hazardous materials or wastes, cleaning wastes,
wastewater, concrete truck washout, and other substances from being carried
from a project site by runoff or wind. Identification of areas where concrete
truck washout is permissible must be clearly posted at appropriate areas of
the site. Wastes and unused building materials shall be managed and disposed
of in accordance with all applicable State statutes and regulations.  Proper
storage and handling of materials such as fuels or hazardous wastes, and
spill prevention and cleanup measures (including having spill response
equipment on site) shall be implemented to minimize the potential for
pollutants to contaminate surface or ground water or degrade soil quality.



   (G)   Public, or private roadways shall be kept cleared of
accumulated sediment that is a result of runoff or tracking. Bulk clearing of
accumulated sediment shall not include flushing the area with water. Cleared
sediment shall be redistributed or disposed of in a manner that is in
accordance with all applicable statutes and regulations.



   (H)   Collected runoff leaving a project site must be either
discharged directly into a well-defined, stable receiving channel, or
diffused and released to adjacent property without causing an erosion or
pollutant problem to the adjacent property owner.



   (I)   Natural features, including wetlands, shall be protected from
pollutants associated with stormwater runoff. All erosion and sediment
control measures necessary to comply with this Chapter and with other
provisions as outlined in 327 IAC 15-5-7 must be implemented in accordance
with the submitted plans.



(Ord. G-11-07, passed 4-10-07)



STORMWATER QUALITY MANAGEMENT CONTROL FOR POST-CONSTRUCTION



§ 53.20  PURPOSE AND INTENT.



   The purpose of this subchapter is to establish requirements for the
installation of permanent stormwater quality features designed to intercept
and filter pollutants in stormwater discharges from newly developed or
redeveloped construction sites of one acre or more. Through the use and
installation of stormwater quality BMPs, stormwater runoff from these sites
will be filtered and harmful amounts of sediment, nutrients and contaminants
will be removed prior to reaching regional creeks, streams and rivers. The
control of stormwater quality will be based on the management of total
suspended solids (TSS).

(Ord. G-11-07, passed 4-10-07)



§ 53.42  PROHIBITED DISCHARGES AND CONNECTIONS.



   (A)   Illicit Discharges Prohibited.   No person shall discharge or
cause to be discharged to Fort Wayne's municipal separate storm sewer system,
watercourse, or water body, directly or indirectly, any discharge that is not
composed entirely of stormwater except permitted discharges per 40 CFR
122.26(b)(2). Any person discharging stormwater shall effectively minimize
pollutants from also being discharged with the stormwater through the use of
best management practices (BMPs). The Department of Stormwater Management of
the City of Fort Wayne is authorized to require dischargers to implement
pollution- prevention measures, including BMPs, as may be necessary to
prevent or reduce the discharge of pollutants into Fort Wayne's stormwater
drainage system.



   (B)   Illegal Connections Prohibited. The construction, use,
maintenance or existence of illegal connections to the storm drainage system
is prohibited. This prohibition expressly includes, without limitation,
illegal connections made in the past regardless of whether the connection was
permissible under law or practices prevailing or applicable at the time of
connection and regardless of whether the connection was approved by an
authorized enforcement agency at the time of the connection.



   (C)   It shall be a violation of this Chapter to permit, allow or
engage in the discharge of any pollutant into any waterway of the United
States, including but not limited to, the St. Mary's River, the St. Joseph
River, the Maumee River, any of their tributaries or streams or any streets,
storm sewers or drains, ditches or drainage ways leading to any such waterway
of the United States.



(Ord. G-11-07, passed 4-10-07)



§ 53.43  STORAGE OF HAZARDOUS OR TOXIC MATERIAL.



   It shall be a violation of this Chapter to store polluting substances,
as identified by USEPA or IDEM, in a manner that violates any federal, state
or local statute, ordinance or regulation relating to the protection of the
public health, safety and welfare or environment, when such storage is shown
to have the potential of allowing discharge to any waterway of the United
States including, but not limited to the St. Mary's River, the St. Joseph
River, the Maumee River, any of their tributaries or streams or any streets,
storm sewers or drains, ditches or drainageways leading to any such waterway
of the United States.



   Storage or stockpiling of hazardous or toxic material on any site must
include adequate protection and/or containment so as to prevent any such
materials from entering any temporary or permanent stormwater conveyance or
watercourse.



(Ord. G-11-07, passed 4-10-07)



§ 53.44  MONITORING OF DISCHARGES.



   (A)   Applicability.  This section applies to all facilities that
have stormwater discharge associated with industrial activity, including
construction activity.



   (B)   Access to Facilities. 



      (1)   The Fort Wayne Department of Stormwater Management shall
have all authority provided by law and pursuant to the terms and conditions
of any applicable permit to enter and inspect facilities as often as may be
necessary to determine compliance with this Chapter. If a discharger has
security measures in force that require proper identification and clearance
before entry into its premises, the discharger shall make the necessary
arrangements to allow access by properly identified representatives of the
Department of Stormwater Management or authorized enforcement agencies.



      (2)   Facility operators shall allow the Department of
Stormwater Management ready access to all parts of the premises for the
purposes of inspection, sampling, examination and copying of records that
must be kept as part of the conditions of an NPDES permit.



      (3)   The Department of Stormwater Management shall have the
right to set up on any permitted facility such devices as are necessary in
the opinion of the Department or an authorized enforcement agency to conduct
monitoring and/or sampling of the facility's stormwater discharge.



      (4)   The Department of Stormwater Management shall have the
right to require the discharger to install monitoring equipment as necessary.
The facility's sampling and monitoring equipment shall be maintained at all
times in a safe and proper operating condition by the discharger at its own
expense. All devices used to measure stormwater flow and quality shall be
calibrated to ensure their accuracy.



      (5)   Any temporary or permanent obstruction or condition that
would obstruct the safe and easy access to the facility to be sampled or
monitored shall be promptly removed by the operator upon the oral or written
request of the Department of Stormwater Management and such obstruction shall
not be replaced. The costs of clearing such access, if any, shall be borne by
the facility.



      (6)   Unreasonable delays in allowing the Department of
Stormwater Management access to a facility regulated under this Chapter is a
violation of Chapter 53 of the Fort Wayne Municipal Code A person who is the
operator of a facility with an NPDES permit to discharge stormwater
associated with industrial activity commits an offense if the person denies
reasonable access by the Department of Stormwater Management or an authorized
enforcement agency to the permitted facility for the purpose of conducting
any activity authorized or required by this Chapter.



      (7)   If the Department of Stormwater Management has been
refused access to any part of the premises from which stormwater is
discharged, and it can demonstrate probable cause to believe that there may
be a violation of Chapter 53 or the Municipal Code, or that there is a need
to inspect and/or sample as part of a routine inspection and sampling program
designed to verify compliance with Chapter 53 of the Fort Wayne Municipal
Code or any order issued hereunder or to protect the overall public health,
safety and welfare of the community, then the authorized enforcement agency
may seek issuance of a search warrant from any court of competent
jurisdiction.



(Ord. G-11-07, passed 4-10-07)



§ 53.45  POLLUTANT REDUCTION THROUGH THE USE OF BEST MANAGEMENT PRACTICES.



   The Department of Stormwater Management will establish acceptable Best
Management Practices (BMPs) for any activity, operation, or facility that may
cause or contribute to pollution or contamination of stormwater, the
municipal storm drainage system or the waters of the United States.



   The owner or operator of a commercial or industrial establishment shall
provide, at their own expense, reasonable protection from accidental
discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes into the municipal separate
storm sewer system or watercourses, using the City's approved BMPs. Further,
any person responsible for a property or premise that is or may be the source
of an illicit discharge may be required to implement additional BMPs as
required by the Department of Stormwater Management to prevent further
discharge of pollutants into the municipal separate storm sewer system.
Compliance with all terms and conditions of a valid NPDES permit authorizing
the discharge of storm water associated with industrial activity to the
extent practicable shall be deemed to be compliance with the provisions of
this section.



(Ord. G-11-07, passed 4-10-07)



§ 53.46  PRIVATE PROPERTY MAINTENANCE DUTIES.



   (A)   Every person owning property through which a watercourse
passes, or such person's lessee, shall keep and maintain that part of the
watercourse located within their property boundaries free of trash, debris,
excessive vegetation, and other obstacles that would pollute, contaminate, or
significantly retard the flow of water through the watercourse. In addition,
the owner or lessee shall maintain existing privately owned structures within
or adjacent to a watercourse, so that such structures will not become a
hazard to the use, function, or physical integrity of the watercourse.



   (B)   Easements intended for periodic or occasional use as
conductors for the flow of surface water runoff shall be maintained in an
unobstructed condition by the owners of the properties they cross. The
utility shall have the right to determine if any obstruction exists and to
repair or maintain, or require such repair and maintenance by the property
owner, as shall be reasonably necessary to keep the conductors unobstructed.



   (C)   No property owner or occupant shall change the stormwater
runoff pattern of his property in such a way that neighboring properties or
city property is adversely affected. Consideration and provisions must be
made for drainage to and from neighboring properties when land use or
development is altered.



   (D)   No property owner or occupant shall direct stormwater runoff
from roof drains, sump pump outfalls or other building drains in such a way
that neighboring properties or city property is adversely affected.



(Ord. G-11-07, passed 4-10-07)



§ 53.47  SPILL REPORTING.



   As soon as any person responsible for a facility or operation, or
responsible for emergency response for a facility or operation, has
information about any known or suspected release of material that may result
in illegal discharges or pollutants entering the storm sewer system or
watercourses, said person shall take all necessary steps to ensure the timely
discovery, containment and cleanup of such release.



   In the event of a release of hazardous material, said person shall
immediately notify emergency response agencies of the occurrence via
emergency dispatch services.



   In the event of a release of non-hazardous materials, said person has
notify the Department of Stormwater Management or authorized enforcement
agency in person or by phone or facsimile no later than the next business day.



   If the report is made in person or by phone, the reporting party shall
confirm the notice in writing addressed to the DSM within five (5) days. The
written report shall specify:



   (A)   The composition of the discharge and the cause thereof;



   (B)   The date, time, and estimated volume of the discharge;



   (C)   All measures taken to clean up the accidental discharge, and
all measures proposed to be taken to prevent any recurrence;



   (D)   The name and telephone number of the person making the report,
and the name and telephone number of a person who may be contacted for
additional information on the matter.



   A properly reported accidental discharge shall be an affirmative
defense to a civil proceeding brought under this Chapter against a discharger
for such discharge. The report itself shall not, however, be a defense to a
legal action brought to obtain an injunction, to obtain recovery of costs or
to obtain other relief because of or arising out of the discharge. A
discharge shall be considered properly reported only if the discharger
complies with all the requirements of this section. This requirement does not
relieve the discharger from notifying other entities as required by State or
Federal regulations.

RATES, CHARGES AND BILLING



§ 53.55  STORMWATER SERVICE CHARGE.



   A stormwater service charge shall be imposed on each and every lot and
parcel of land within the city which directly or indirectly contributes to
the stormwater system of the city, which charge shall be assessed against the
owner thereof, who shall be considered the user for the purposes of this
chapter. This charge is deemed reasonable and is necessary to pay for the
repair, replacement, planning, improvement, operation, regulation and
maintenance of the existing and future city stormwater system and for
compliance with the city's NPDES stormwater discharge permit(s).



(Ord. G-11-07, passed 4-10-07)



§ 53.56  STORMWATER RATE ESTABLISHMENT PROCEDURES.



   (A)   The stormwater service rate shall be as follows:



 


Rate per Month per ERU

 

Effective Date




$4.40

 

July 1, 2017




$5.15

 

July 1, 2018




$5.90

 

July 1, 2019




 



   (B)   The stormwater service rate for non-residential properties
shall be as follows:



 


Rate per Month per ERU

 

Effective Date




$3.85

 

July 1, 2017




$4.25

 

July 1, 2018




$4.75

 

July 1, 2019




 



For the purpose of this chapter, a month shall be considered to be a period
of 25 days up through 35 days depending on billing cycles. Any billings for
stormwater service outside this time shall be on a per diem basis.



   (C)   These stormwater rates are designed to recover the cost of
rendering stormwater service to the users of the stormwater system, and shall
be the basis for assessment of the city's stormwater service charge. These
rates are established so as to maintain adequate fund reserves to provide for
reasonably expected variations in the cost of providing services, as well as
variations in the demand for services.



(Ord. G-11-07, passed 4-10-07; Am. Ord. G-5-17, passed 3-28-17)



§ 53.57  RATE STRUCTURE AND CALCULATION.



   (A)   For the purposes stated in § 53.02 and subsequent, there is
hereby assessed a stormwater service charge to each user situated with the
corporate limits of the city who contributes directly or indirectly to the
stormwater system of the city, in an amount as determined below.



   (B)   For any such property, lot, parcel of land, building or
premises which contributes directly or indirectly to the stormwater system of
the city, such charge shall be based upon the quantity of impervious area
situated thereon.



   (C)   All properties having impervious area within the city will be
assigned a number of equivalent residential units (ERUs), with all properties
having impervious surface being assigned at least one ERU.



      (1)   Residential properties. A monthly charge for stormwater
service rendered to residential properties shall be charged to each account
within the city limits according to the service address. All residential
properties are hereby assigned one ERU. This fee shall apply to all
residential properties as defined herein. Residential properties may apply
for credits as outlined at §53.60. Based on the granting of a credit, a
residential property may pay for less than one ERU. However, in no case shall
a residential property pay for less than 35% of the gross stormwater bill
owed before credits were applied.



      (2)   Non-residential properties. Non-residential properties
will be assigned a number of ERUs based upon the property's individually
measured impervious area (in square feet) divided by 2,500 square feet (one
ERU). The division will be calculated to the first decimal place.



      (3)   For the purposes of quantifying the discharge of
non-polluted groundwater into the stormwater management system via sump
pumps, geothermal heating and cooling systems or similar devices, one
equivalent residential unit (ERU) shall be equal to 7,667 gallons per month.



      (4)   Only whole ERUs shall be used in determining the
assignment of gross ERUs to a property. All rounding necessary to reach the
appropriate whole ERU shall be done according to mathematical convention (0 -
0.4 rounded down to nearest whole ERU; 0.5 - 0.9 rounded up to nearest whole
ERU).



   (D)   There shall be no exceptions or exemptions from the assignment
of gross stormwater ERUs.



(Ord. G-11-07, passed 4-10-07; Am. Ord. G-5-17, passed 3-28-17)



§ 53.58  BILLINGS; TERMS OF PAYMENT.



   (A)   Billings. All stormwater bills shall be rendered on a monthly
basis, along with the user's charges for other city utility services.



   (B)   Terms of payment. The stormwater service charges prescribed in
§ 53.56 shall be due on the payment date set out on the bill. It shall be a
violation of this chapter to fail to pay a stormwater service bill when due.
All bills for stormwater services not paid on or before the due date, which
due date shall be approximately 15 days after the bill is rendered, shall be
subject to a collection or deferred payment charge of 10% on outstanding
balance.



   (C)   Payment priority. Stormwater service charges shall take
priority over all other charges for city utility services. Partial payments
shall first be applied to satisfy the garbage user fee under Chapter 50 and
secondly, to these charges.



   (D)   Collection. Delinquent stormwater service charges may be
collected in a civil action along with other delinquent city utility charges,
reasonable attorney fees and court costs.



(Ord. G-11-07, passed 4-10-07)



§ 53.59  APPEALS OF ERU DETERMINATION.



   (A)   If, in the opinion of any user, the ERU multiple assigned to
his property is inaccurate in light of the amount of impervious area of said
property, the user shall have the right to contest the ERU determination and
thus the rate assessed in the following manner.



   (B)   User shall obtain and complete a petition to appeal stormwater
rate form (petition) which shall be returned to the DSM with verifiable
documentation supporting user's claim.



   (C)   The DSM shall investigate user's claim and, upon review
thereof, shall render a written determination that either the original ERU
determination and assessed rate should be affirmed or the user's rate should
be adjusted according to the petition.



   (D)   If user's petition is denied, said opinion shall be forwarded
to user by certified mail, return receipt requested. User shall then have
seven days from date of receipt to request a reconsideration by the
Director.  Any additional facts concerning the dispute shall be reduced to
writing and submitted, along with a copy of the original petition and
supporting documents, to the Director. The DSM shall submit a written report
of the determination in the case, along with any documents used in denying
the user's claim.



   (E)   Thereafter, the Director, or his designee, shall review all
documentation and conduct, as necessary in his opinion, an informal hearing
to determine and resolve the dispute based on the documentation submitted and
any oral testimony. A written opinion shall be rendered within 30 days after
the hearing or submission of documentation if no hearing is conducted. The
written opinion of the Director of his designee shall constitute the final
DSM determination, and may be challenged by the user by a written request to
the Board for formal consideration within 15 days of the Director's opinion.



   (F)   The Board shall conduct a hearing and issue a determination
which shall be binding on the city utilities. The hearing shall be
electronically recorded and a transcript of the hearing provided upon request
at a cost per page as determined by the City Utilities Accounting Department
and amended from time to time.



   (G)   A party or person aggrieved by the final Board determination
shall have the right to judicial review of such determination in accordance
with state law.



   (H)   If the DSM recommends the user's rate be reduced, or reduction
is ordered by the Director, Board or court of law, user shall be credited
accordingly for any overpayment made from the date of the petition.



   (I)   Dispute or appeal of an ERU determination for stormwater
service rate shall not be a valid reason for non-payment of the originally
assessed stormwater service charge by the user.



(Ord. G-11-07, passed 4-10-07)



§ 53.60  DISCOUNT AND CREDITS POLICIES AND PROCEDURE.



   (A)   This section establishes a discount for land and buildings
used for various purposes when exempt from property taxation under IC
6-1.1-10-1, 6-1.1-10-2, 6-1.1-10-4, 6-1.1-10-5, and 6-1.1-1016.



   (B)   This section also discusses some of the most common credit
considerations and requirements but is not intended to be the exclusive
authority. The Board, through the rules and regulations of the DSM shall more
fully and completely establish the credit policies and procedures for
stormwater management.



      (1)   Discounts.  The following categories of property exempt
from property taxation shall be entitled to a 25% discount off of the gross
ERUs assigned for any such land or building under § 53.57 where the

         (a)   Credit will be available to all properties for
various forms and levels of abatement.



         (b)   Maintenance requirements. Credit will only be
allowed for properties where structural controls are maintained in fully
functional condition and according to maintenance criteria and design
standards issued by the DSM.



         (c)   Existing structure credits. Credit will be allowed
for previously constructed abatement features or stormwater controls. The
amount of credit granted will be determined by the methods of design as
outlined within the rules and regulations of the DSM.



         (d)   Property location. Credit will be granted on the
basis of location of a given property in relation to a major waterway of the
United States, if it directly discharges its stormwater to that waterway in
conformance with all maintenance criteria and design standards as applicable.
The waterways covered by this section shall include the St. Mary's River, the
St. Joseph River, the Maumee River, the major tributaries of these three
rivers and other ditches and drains specified in the rules and regulations of

         (g)   Oversizing. Oversized private stormwater
facilities or improvements exceeding standard abatement design criteria and
intended to serve an area larger than the immediate project site or designed
to handle a larger than specified storm event as required by the DSM shall be
considered for additional credit.



         (h)   Industrial NPDES permit credits. No credit shall
be allowed for industries in compliance with federal laws and regulations
regarding industrial stormwater discharge permits at this time.



         (i)   Pollution reduction Credit may be granted on a
case-by-case basis for efforts to reduce the amount of pollutants in a user's
stormwater runoff or for improvements to the quality of a user's stormwater
discharge.



         (j)   Regional basins. Credit will not be granted to
properties draining into ponds or basins maintained or owned by the city.
Credit will be considered for privately owned and maintained regional
controls and will be apportioned among owners on a prearranged basis.



         (k)   Percent discounted credits for private stormwater
facilities.



            1.   Discounts and credits shall be computed on an
ERU basis. A maximum credit of less than 100% of the gross ERUs originally
assigned can be granted for the construction and maintenance of private
stormwater facilities considering the potential of each to reduce peak flow
and/or volume stormwater flow and direct discharge capabilities. Private
stormwater facilities eligible for credits listed above constitute elements
of the secondary drainage system. The secondary system is designed to drain a
limited area with benefits limited to the owners of the particular property
or owners of adjacent properties. As such, secondary elements of the system
are not eligible for 100% credit.



            2.   Further, there are administrative costs
involved with operation of the DSM that must be shared by all users,
including costs incurred to meet quality-based permit requirements, which
provide community-wide benefits, and thus cannot be credited. Discounts and
credits shall be cumulative; however, in no case shall the total amount of
discounts and credits equal more than 65% of the user's gross stormwater
service fee.



            3.   The formula for determining the applicable
credit percentage for individual parcels shall be specifically set out in the
Rules and Regulations of the DSM.



         (l)   Federal, state, city and county roadways,
publicly-owned airport movement areas. Publicly-owned streets and roads and
highway shall be given 100% credit in reliance on governmental guidance
documents which classify them as an integral part of the stormwater
conveyance system. Publicly-owned airport movement areas including runways,
taxiways, ramps and other areas of an airport which are used for taxiing or
hover taxiing, air taxiing, takeoff and landing of aircraft when constructed
and maintained similarly to public roadways, shall also qualify for this
credit. The surface water control systems incorporated in the design of
roadways and airport movement are areas engineered to convey all design
runoff without street flooding, and the like associated with frequent, small
runoff events up to about five- or ten- year recurrence intervals, and as
such, constitute elements of the primary drainage system. Primary elements of
the drainage system yield community-wide benefits and are installed to
service the general public's interests, conveying runoff from large areas
encompassing whole watershed in some cases.



      (3)   Procedure.



         (a)   Timing of applications and/or determinations. 
Application for credits shall be made on forms provided by City Utilities and
accompanied by the appropriate application fee. The fee shall be $25 for
residential users and $100 for all others. It is the intent of the city that
all applications will be reviewed and credits and discounts determined within
30 days after submittal of a complete and correct application package. The
credit will be effective on the 1st billing cycle for that property following
completion of construction, or the date of the application. Appeals. Appeals
of credit or discount determinations shall be handled consistent with the
procedures set out above for reconsideration of ERU petitions. Appeals of
credit or discount decisions will be made initially to the Director, or his
designee. Should satisfaction not be achieved, an appeal may be lodged with
the Board.



         (b)   Application for credit or discount, or appeal of
determination thereon shall not constitute a valid reason for non-payment of
the originally assessed stormwater service charge by the user.

§ 53.61  STORMWATER FUND.



   All revenues earned and fees collected for stormwater service,
including but not limited to, drainage service charges, permit and inspection
fees, direct charges and interest earnings on any unused funds shall be
deposited in an account entitled "City of Fort Wayne Stormwater Account."
Disbursements from this account will be authorized by the Board and, as
required by law, the Common Council. Such disbursements will be used
exclusively for the operation, maintenance and improvement of the city's
stormwater system. Funds from this account shall not revert to any other city
utilities or Civil City Fund and may not be transferred for any other
purpose, including to avoid a default on bonds or any city utilities fund or
the city.

§ 53.62 DELINQUENT FEES AND PENALTIES AS LIENS; DUPLICATES; COLLECTION.



   Delinquent charges for stormwater services, and applied penalties,
recording fees and service charges may be made a lien upon the property when
the delinquent party is the property owner and may be collected in accordance
with the provisions of IC 36-9-23-32 and 36-9-23-33.

animal(s) has not been adjudicated, another bond shall be posted. The renewal
bond shall be paid no later than the close of business on the thirtieth day.

weekend or holiday. The bond shall be renewed every 30 days thereafter until

first present proper credentials and request entry, explaining the reasons
therefor. If entry is refused or cannot be obtained because the attending
person(s) having ownership or control of the property cannot be found after
reasonable search, the attending officer shall have recourse to secure lawful
entry and inspect the property.

   (K)   Every horse required to be permitted under § 91.121 shall
have a general physical examination by a state-licensed veterinarian prior to
use in a rental horse business, and thereafter at least annually during such
use. The examination shall include but not be limited to: inspection of
teeth, hooves, and shoes, and the physical ability of the horse to perform
its work or duties. The examination shall also include treatment for
parasites as necessary, a record of any injury, disease, or deficiency
observed by the veterinarian, together with any prescription or
recommendation regarding humane correction or disposition. An Indiana health
certificate containing the above information and the identification number,
age and condition of the horse, signed by the examining veterinarian, shall
be maintained at the stable at which such horse is located.



   (L)   The rental horse business shall take immediate action to
obtain veterinary treatment, care and attention when a horse exhibits
evidence of sickness, disease, lameness or injury. If a horse dies while at
work or in the stable area, or is involved in an accident resulting in an
injury to a horse, the Department shall be notified immediately.



   (M)   A horse subject to this section which is or becomes lame or
experiences a physical condition or illness making such horse unsuitable for
work shall be removed from work by the owner or operator of the rental horse
business or may be ordered removed from work by the Department. In the event
of a dispute regarding such physical condition or illness, the Department may
require such horse be examined by a veterinarian to determine its ability to
safely work in a rental horse business. The cost of any such examination
shall be borne solely by the rental horse business. A horse which has been
removed from work under this division shall not return to work until it has
completely recovered from the condition causing removal from work, or until
such condition has improved sufficiently that a return to work will not
aggravate the condition or otherwise endanger the health of the horse. A
violation of this division shall be presumed if a horse is found at work
within 48 hours following such removal in the same or similar sick or
disabled condition which caused the original removal. Such presumption may be
rebutted by a written statement from the veterinarian who examined the horse
after the removal from work but prior to its return to work, which confirms
his/her professional opinion that it was suitable for the horse to return to
work prior to the expiration of the 48 hour period. Such Written statement
shall be carried with the horse during the presumed 48 hour recovery period,
and provided to the Department upon request.



   (N)   Saddles, blankets, harnesses, bridles and bits and all other
equipment shall be properly fitted to each horse and kept in good repair.



   (O)   Horses shall be kept clean while at work and in the stable.
Horses shall be trimmed and shod a minimum of once every six weeks or sooner
if necessary.

GENERAL PROVISIONS



§ 93.001 PURPOSE; FINDINGS OF FACT.



   Discrimination in social, cultural and economic life in Fort Wayne
against any person or persons because of race, sex, color, religion,
disability, ancestry, national origin, place of birth, age, or sexual
orientation, is contrary to American principles and is harmful to the social,
cultural, and economic life of the city.  Discrimination, particularly in
employment opportunities, public accommodations and housing, increases the
burden and cost of government; and, such discrimination contributes to
increased crime, vice, juvenile delinquency, fires and other evils, thereby
affecting the public safety, public health, and general welfare of the
community.  It is therefore deemed to be in the best interests of the city
to create a metropolitan Commission to administer and enforce any
anti-discrimination legislation and ordinances, all as authorized by the
Indiana Civil Rights Act.

organization providing fringe benefits to an employee of the covered entity,
or an organization providing training and apprenticeship programs);



         (c)   Utilizing standards, criteria, or methods of
administration:



            (i)   That have the effect of discrimination on
the basis of disability; or



            (ii)   That perpetuate the discrimination of
others who are subject to common administrative control;



         (d)   Excluding or otherwise denying equal jobs or

individual with whom the qualified individual is known to have a relationship
or association;

employee or applicant;



         (g)   Using qualification standards, employment tests or
other selection criteria that screen out or tend to screen out an individual

business necessity;



         (h)   Failing to select and administer tests concerning
employment in the most effective manner to ensure that, when such test is
administered to a job applicant or employee who has a disability that impairs
sensory, manual, or speaking skills, such test results accurately reflect the
skills, aptitude, or whatever other factor of such applicant or employee that
such test purports to measure, rather than reflecting the impaired sensory,
manual, or speaking skills of such employee or applicant (except where such
skills are the factors that the test purports to measure); and,



         (i)   Retaliating against an employee for reporting a
complaint to a governmental agency or otherwise engaging in a lawful exercise
of the employees rights, regardless of whether or not the employee's
complaint is determined by an agency of the government or court of law to be
without sufficient merit or evidence.



      (3)   Medical examinations and inquiries.



         (a)   In general. The prohibition against discrimination

            (ii)   Acceptable inquiry. A covered entity may
make preemployment inquiries into the ability of an applicant to perform
job-related functions.



         (c)   Employment entrance examination. A covered entity
may require a medical examination after an offer of employment has been made
to a job applicant and prior to the commencement of the employment duties of
such applicant, and may condition an offer of employment on the results of
such examination, if:



            (i)   All entering employees are subjected to such
an examination regardless of disability;



            (ii)   Information obtained regarding the medical
condition or history of the applicant is collected and maintained on separate
forms and in separate medical files and is treated as a confidential medical
record, except that supervisors and managers may be informed regarding
necessary restrictions on the work or duties of the employee and necessary
accommodations; first aid and safety personnel may be informed, when
appropriate, if the disability might require emergency treatment; and
government officials investigating compliance with this Act shall be provided
relevant information on request; and the results of such examination are used
only in accordance with this title.



         (d)   Examination and inquiry.



            (i)   Prohibited examinations and inquiries. A
covered entity shall not require a medical examination and shall not make
inquiries of an employee as to whether such employee is an individual with a
disability or as to the nature or severity of the disability, unless such
examination or inquiry is shown to be job-related and consistent with
business necessity.



            (ii)   Acceptable examinations and inquiries. A
covered entity may conduct voluntary medical examinations, including
voluntary medical histories, which are part of an employee health program
available to employees at that work site. A covered entity may make inquiries
into the ability of an employee to perform job-related functions.



            (iii)   Requirement. Information obtained under
subdivision (ii) regarding the medical condition or history of any employee
are subject to the requirements of subdivisions (c)(ii) and (iii).



   (C)   Defenses.



      (1)   In general. It may be a defense to a charge of
discrimination under this Act that an alleged application of qualification
standards, tests, or selection criteria that screen out or tend to screen out
or otherwise deny a job or benefit to an individual with a disability has
been shown to be job-related and consistent with business necessity, and such
performance cannot be accomplished by reasonable accommodation, as required
under this title.



      (2)   Qualification standards. The term "qualification
standards" may include a requirement that an individual shall not pose a
direct threat to the health or safety of other individuals in the workplace.



      (3)   Religious entities.



         (a)   In general. This title shall not prohibit a
religious corporation, association, educational institution, or society from
giving preference in employment to individuals of a particular religion to
perform work connected with the carrying on by such corporation, association,
educational institution, or society of its activities.



         (b)   Religious tenets requirement. Under this title, a
religious organization may require that all applicants and employees conform
to the religious tenets of such organization.



      (4)   Persons with infectious and communicable diseases.



         (a)   In any case in which an individual has an
infectious or communicable disease that is transmitted to others through the
handling of food, that is included on the list developed by the United States
Secretary of Health and Human Services pursuant to Section 103(d) of the
Americans with Disabilities Act, and which cannot be eliminated by reasonable
accommodation, a covered entity may refuse to assign or continue to assign
such individual to a job involving food handling.



         (b)   Construction. Nothing in this section shall be
construed to preempt, modify, or amend any state, county, or local law,
ordinance, or regulation applicable to food handling which is designed to
protect the public health from individuals who pose a significant risk to the
health or safety of others, which cannot be eliminated by reasonable
accommodation, pursuant to the list of infectious or communicable diseases
and the modes of transmissability published by the Secretary of Health and
Human Services published pursuant to Section 103(d) of the Americans with
Disabilities Act.



   (D)   Illegal use of drugs and alcohol.



      (1)   Qualified individual with a disability. For purposes of
this title, the term qualified individual with a disability shall not include
any employee or applicant who is currently engaging in the illegal use of
drugs, when the covered entity acts on the basis of such use.



      (2)   Rules of construction. Nothing in subdivision (a) shall
be construed to exclude as a  qualified individual with a disability an
individual who:

rehabilitation program and is no longer engaging in the illegal use of drugs,
or has otherwise been rehabilitated successfully and is no longer engaging in
such use;



         (b)   Is participating in a supervised rehabilitation
program and is no longer engaging in such use; or



         (c)   Is erroneously regarded as engaging in such use,
but is not engaging in such use; except that it shall not be a violation of
this Act for a covered entity to adopt or administer reasonable policies or
procedures, including but not limited to drug testing, designed to ensure
that an individual described in subdivision (a) or (b) is no longer engaging
in the illegal use of drugs.



      (3)   Authority of covered entity. A covered entity:



         (a)   May prohibit the illegal use of drugs and the use
of alcohol at the workplace by all employees;



         (b)   May require that employees shall not be under the
influence of alcohol or be engaging in the illegal use of drugs at the
workplace;



         (c)   May require that employees behave in conformance
with the requirements established under the Drug-Free Workplace Act of 1988
(41 U.S.C. 701 et seq.);



         (d)   May hold an employee who engages in the illegal
use of drugs or who is an alcoholic to the same qualification standards for
employment or job performance and behavior that such entity holds other
employees, even if any unsatisfactory performance or behavior is related to
the drug use or alcoholism of such employee.



      (4)   Drug testing.



         (a)   In general. For purposes of this title, a test to
determine the illegal use of drugs shall not be considered a medical
examination.

construed to encourage, prohibit, or authorize the conducting of drug testing
for the illegal use of drugs by job applicants or employees or making
employment decisions based on such test results.

appointed by Common Council for his or her original term and one Commissioner
appointed by the Mayor for his or her original term, and the appointee as

take this into consideration in making their respective appointments;
provided, however, that if they cannot agree upon the manner in which such
representation is to be attained, the Mayor shall make that appointment which
shall result in one of the major political parties having the greater number
of members on the Board.

(Ord. G-28-99, passed 12-28-99)



§ 94.02  PURPOSE.



   (A)   The purpose and the intent of this code is to prescribe
minimum requirements and controls to safeguard life, property or public
welfare from the hazards of fire and explosion arising from the storage,
handling or use of substances, materials or devices and from conditions
hazardous to life, property or public welfare in the use or occupancy of
buildings, structures, sheds, tents, lots or premises.



   (B)   To prescribe a course of action to be taken to gain compliance
with the state and local codes, ordinances and regulations for fire
prevention.



(Ord. G-28-99, passed 12-28-99)



§ 94.03  APPLICABILITY.



   (A)   The provisions of this code and the fire safety rules of the
Indiana Fire Prevention and Building Safety Commission shall apply to
existing buildings and conditions.

         (a)   Existing conditions which do not constitute a
distinct hazard to life or property.

the city governing the construction, alteration, addition, repair, removal,
demolition, use, location, occupancy and maintenance of buildings
specifically provided herein.  When any provision of this code is found to
be in conflict with any building, zoning, safety, health, or other applicable
law, ordinance or code of the city or rules of the Fire Prevention Building
Safety Commission existing on the effective date of this code or hereafter
adopted, except as provided for by IN 675 IAC 12, the provision which
establishes the higher standard for the promotion and protection of the
safety and welfare of the public shall prevail.



   (C)   The planning, design and construction of new  buildings

   (D)   Buildings built under and in full compliance with the building
and fire safety laws and rules in force at the time of construction or

      (2)   Exits required, except as provided for existing
buildings under this code; or

provided, however, that the fire chief shall require the installation of fire
safety devices or systems (fire extinguishers, fire alarms, fire detection
devices, or similar systems) where they are necessary to provide safety to
life.  In lieu of requiring the installation of safety devices or systems or
when necessary to secure safety in addition thereto, the fire chief shall
prescribe limitations on the handling and storage of materials or substances
or upon operations that are liable to cause fire, contribute to the spread of
fire, or endanger life or property.  Any orders issued by the fire chief to
obtain compliance with this subsection shall be governed by the provision of
IC 36-8-17-10.

EXTERIOR LIGHTING



§ 96.25  USE OF EXTERIOR LIGHTING.



   (A)   Any directional exterior lighting on residential property
should be designed, installed and maintained so as to redirect or aim any
directional light away from any adjoining residential property so as to avoid
"light trespass".



   (B)   For the purposes of this section, LIGHT TRESPASS means:



      (1)   A light source causing glare that is on a line of sight
to an observer five feet or more inside a residential property line; or



      (2)   Any outdoor light fixtures (on residential properties)
emitting 600 or more lumens.



   (C)   Compliance/avoidance of light trespass. Compliance in avoiding
light trespass for glare as defined in (B)(1) above is achieved with fixture
shielding, directional control designed into the fixture, fixture location,
fixture height, fixture aim, or a combination of these factors.



   (D)   To avoid light trespass and achieve compliance with regard to
outdoor light fixtures emitting 600 lumens or more as defined in (B)(2)
above, said outdoor light fixtures shall be frosted glass or covered by
frosted glass or other similarly translucent cover. Additionally, an outdoor
light fixture emitting more than 1,000 lumens, except motion
detector-activated lighting, shall be fully shielded to an observer at the
property line. This can be achieved with fixture location, mounting height,
natural artificial barriers on the texture owner's property, fixture
shielding and other fixture design features.

place private facilities within the public rights-of-way, subject to the
following fees:



         (a)   Initial application fee of $200.  This fee is to
reimburse the city for administrative expenses necessary for the review and
routing of the application through the engineering departments and is
non-refundable regardless of the outcome of the application.



         (b)   Contract preparation fee of $100.  This fee is to
reimburse the city for legal contract preparation expenses and will be
refunded should the final approval not be granted.



         (c)   An annual rental fee will be assessed that is
dependant on the size of the encroachment, the type of facility to be placed,
and the classification of the street right-of-way.  Base fees are as follows:



            1.   Communication cable, excluding fiber optics
cable, $0.54/l.f.;



            2.   Parking lots or other temporary structures,

      (2)   The owners of any approved encroachments will be
encouraged to join the Indiana Underground Plant Protection Service so as to
be aware of any excavations scheduled in the vicinity of their facilities. 
However, should the applicant not want to join the Indiana Underground Plant
Protection Service but desire notification of any work near their facilities,
the city - at the city's option - can provide the service for an additional
annual fee of $5,750.  This fee is to recover the administrative costs
inherent in monitoring the Indiana Underground Plant Protection Service on
behalf of the encroachment holder.



      (3)   For good and sufficient cause, the city can elect to
waive all or part of the annual fee.  If any portion of the fee is to be
waived, written documentation specifying the reasoning behind such a
determination shall be attached to the rental/encroachment agreement.



      (4)   Rental/encroachment applications are to be submitted to
the Board of Public Works, in a form as specified by the city.  Upon payment
of the application fees, the request will be routed to the engineering
departments, the Community and Economic Development department, and the Right
of Way department in order to solicit staff recommendations and comments
pertaining to the possible consequences of approving or denying the request.



      (5)   Staff recommendations will be forwarded to the Legal
department for contract preparation. The Legal department will be responsible
for negotiating and documenting any deviations from the prescribed fee
schedule.

department detailing the reasons agreement was not obtained will be forwarded

with such determination to be made at the regularly scheduled Board of Public
Works meeting.



      (7)   Any approved rental/encroachment agreements will be
conditional until such time as any and all necessary construction permits are
obtained and until such time as the first annual payment is submitted to the
city's accounting department.  Subsequent annual payments will fall due on
the anniversary date of the initial payment.  The annual invoicing and the
tracking of same will be performed by the accounting department.

§ 99.031  APPLICATION; ISSUANCE; CONDITIONS AND SPECIFICATIONS.



   (A)   Permit applications. Application for an excavation permit
shall be made to the Board of Public Works or their authorized
representative. Permit applications shall contain, and will be considered
complete only upon compliance with, the requirements of the following
provisions:



      (1)   Submission of a completed permit application, in the
form prescribed by the Board of Public Works, including all required
attachments and scaled drawings showing the location and area of the proposed
excavation and the location of all existing and proposed equipment.



      (2)   Payment of all money due to the city for prior
obstructions or excavations, including any loss, damage, or expense suffered
by the city as a result of applicant's prior excavations or obstructions of
the rights-of-way or any emergency actions taken by the city because of such
prior excavations or obstructions.



      (3)   Filing of a permit bond and liability insurance pursuant
to § 99.071.



      (4)   Payment of the permit fee pursuant to § 99.009.



   (B)   Issuance of permit; conditions.  If the Board of Public Works
or their authorized representative determines that the applicant has
satisfied the requirements of this section, an excavation permit may be
issued.



      (1)   The Board of Public Works may impose reasonable
conditions upon the issuance of an excavation permit and the performance of
the applicant thereunder in order to protect the public health, safety, and
welfare, to insure the structural integrity of the rights-of-way, and to
minimize disruption and inconvenience to the traveling public.



      (2)   A permit shall be void unless the excavation to be made
pursuant thereto is commenced within 30 days from the permit effective date
and the work diligently completed.



      (3)   Each permit shall state a purpose for the excavation and
a time period for completion of all the work to be done thereunder. The Board
of Public Works or their authorized representative may grant extensions of
time for good cause.



      (4)   The permittee shall be responsible to comply with all
current federal, state, and local laws, regulations and requirements. As used
in this chapter, the term "permittee" shall mean the person to whom an
excavation permit is issued, as well as the person owning the facility or
installation for which the excavation permit is issued.



   (C)   Permit fees; fee computation.



      (1)   The Board of Public Works or their authorized
representative shall establish the excavation permit fee after considering
the extent of the proposed excavation, as follows:



         (a)   The number of times an excavation makes a
transition between differing types of rights-of-way surfaces designated
within § 99.009(A)(1).  Each transition between pavement and non-pavement
shall be considered an additional excavation.



         (b)   The length and width of an excavation where there
is no transition between surface types. No single excavation, for permit
pricing purposes only, shall exceed 450 square feet.



         (c)   The age of any pavement being excavated. Requests
for excavations in pavement placed within the past year will not be granted
except by declaration of an emergency, as determined by the Board of Public
Works or authorized representative. If such emergency is declared,
excavations in pavement placed within one year prior to the excavation will
be assessed at five times the rate established by § 99.009. Excavations made
in pavement placed between one and two years prior to the excavation will be
assessed at four times the rate established by § 99.009. Excavations made in
pavement placed between two and three years prior to the excavation will be
assessed at three times the rate established by § 99.009. Excavations made
in pavement placed between three and four years prior to excavation will be
assessed at two times the rate established by § 99.009. Excavations made in
pavement placed more than four years prior to the excavation will be assessed
at the rate established by § 99.009.



      (2)   All permit fees collected under this section will be
receipted into the General Fund and will be used to off set the cost of
controlling and managing the public rights-of-way.



      (3)   Permit fees paid for a permit that has been revoked
pursuant to this chapter are not refundable.



   (D)   Rights-of-way restoration. The work to be done under the
excavation permit, and the restoration of the rights-of-way as required
herein, must be completed within the dates specified in the excavation
permit. In addition to its own work, the permittee must restore the general
area of the work and the surrounding areas, including trench backfill, paving
and its foundations, to the same or better condition that existed before the
commencement of the work and must inspect the area of the work and use
reasonable care to maintain the same condition for 36 months thereafter,
natural wear excepted.



      (1)   The Board of Public Works shall have the authority to
prescribe the manner and extent of the restoration and may do so in written
procedures of general application including General and Detailed
Specifications for Street and Alley Pavements, Sidewalks, Curbs, Drainage
Structures and Other Miscellaneous Items, as previously adopted by the Board
of Public Works and as amended from time to time or on a case-by-case basis.
In exercising this authority, the Board of Public Works or their authorized
representative shall be guided by the following standards and considerations:
the number, size, depth, and duration of the excavations; the traffic volume
carried by the rights-of-way; the pre-excavation condition of the
rights-of-way; the remaining life expectancy of the rights-of-way affected by
the excavation; and the likelihood that a particular method of restoration
would be effective in slowing the depreciation of the rights-of-way that
would otherwise take place. Methods of restoration may include, but are not
limited to, patching, replacement of the street base, and milling and overlay
of the entire area of the rights-of-way affected by the work.



      (2)   By accepting an approved excavation permit, the
permittee guarantees its work and shall maintain it for 36 months following
its completion and acceptance by the Board of Public Works or their
authorized representative. During this 36 month period, the permittee shall,
upon notification from the Board of Public Works or their authorized
representative and within a reasonable and acceptable time frame, correct all
restoration work to the extent necessary using the method specified by the
Board of Public Works or authorized representative.



      (3)   If the permittee fails to restore the rights-of-way in
the manner and to the condition required by the Board of Public Works or
their authorized representative, or fails to satisfactorily and timely
complete all repairs required, the Board of Public Works or authorized
representative, at its option, may perform the restoration with city forces
or hire by contract the services of an independent contractor to perform the
restoration. In that event, the permittee shall pay to the city, within 30
days of billing, the city's cost incurred in restoring the rights-of-way.



      (4)   At all times while the work is in progress, the
permittee shall maintain at the job location a sign, barricade, or other
device bearing the permittee's name in such a manner as to be clearly
visible. The permittee shall maintain traffic control in accordance with the
Indiana Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, latest edition, and all
other applicable state and federal laws.



      (5)   The permittee shall make the work site available for
inspection at all reasonable times during the performance and upon completion
of the work.



      (6)   The Board of Public Works or their authorized
representative may order stoppage of work for deviations by the permittee
from the excavation permit or may order the immediate cessation of any work
which poses a serious threat to the life, health, safety, or well being of
the public until such time as reauthorization of work is granted by the Board
of Public Works or their authorized representative.



      (7)   If the work authorized by an excavation permit begins
later or ends sooner than the date given on a permit, the permittee shall
notify the Board of Public Works or their authorized representative of the
accurate information as soon as this information is known.



   (E)   Scope of permit. An excavation permit is valid only for the
area of the rights-of-way specified in the permit. No permittee may perform
any work outside the area specified in the permit, except as provided herein.
Any permittee that determines that it must excavate in an area other than
that specified in the permit must, before working in that area, apply for a
permit extension and pay any additional fees necessitated thereby. An
excavation permit is valid only for the dates specified in the permit. No
permittee may begin its work before the permit start date or, except as
provided herein, continue working after the permit end date. If a permittee
does not finish the work by the permit end date, it must make application for
a new permit for the additional time it needs, and receive the new permit or
an extension of the old permit before working after the end of the previous
permit.



   (F)   Other obligations.



      (1)   Obtaining a permit does not relieve the permittee of its
duty to obtain all other necessary permits, licenses, and authority and to
pay all fees required by any other laws.



      (2)   A permittee shall perform all work in conformance with
all applicable law, and is responsible for all work done in the rights-of-way
pursuant to its permit, regardless of who performs the work.



      (3)   Except in case of an emergency, or with the approval of
the Board of Public Works or their authorized representative, no excavation
shall be performed when weather conditions make such work unsafe to any
person or if conditions exist that, if the excavation were performed, would
cause degradation or damage to the rights-of-way that would not normally
occur if such conditions did not exist.



      (4)   A permittee shall not obstruct any rights-of-way in a
manner that interferes with the natural passage of water through the gutters
or other waterways.



   (G)   Denial of permit.



      (1)   Mandatory denial. Except in the case of an emergency, an
excavation permit shall be denied to any applicant who has failed within the
past three years to comply or is presently not in full compliance with the
requirements of this section; to any person who has delinquent debt owed to
the city; to any person as to whom there exists grounds for the revocation of
a permit under this chapter; and, if the issuance of a permit for the
particular date or time would cause a conflict or interfere with an
exhibition, celebration, festival, or any other event. In determining whether
a conflict or interference exists, the Board of Public Works or authorized
representative shall be guided by the safety and convenience of ordinary
travel of the public over the rights-of-way, and by considerations relating
to the public health, safety, and welfare.



      (2)   Permissive denial. The Board of Public Works or
authorized representative may deny a permit in order to protect the public
health, safety and welfare, to prevent interference with the safety and
convenience of ordinary travel over the rights-of- way, or when necessary to
protect the rights-of-way or its users. The Board of Public Works or
authorized representative, in its discretion, may consider one or more of the
following factors: the capacity of the rights-of-way to accommodate
additional facilities; the availability of other locations in the
rights-of-way capable of supporting additional facilities; the degree of
disruption to surrounding communities and businesses that will result from
the proposed use of the rights-of-way; the condition and age of the
rights-of-way; whether and when such rights-of-way are scheduled for total or
partial reconstruction; this section; and other applicable ordinances and
regulations.



   (H)   Work done without a permit.



      (1)   Emergency situations. A person or entity owning
facilities previously located within the rights-of-way shall, within one
business day, notify the Board of Public Works or their authorized
representative of any event that it considers to be an emergency. Within two
business days after the occurrence of the emergency, the owner or owner's
representative shall apply for the necessary permits, pay the fees associated
therewith, and fulfill the rest of the requirements necessary to bring itself
into compliance with this section for the actions it took in response to the
emergency. In the event that the city becomes aware of an emergency regarding
facilities not owned by the city, the city may attempt to contact the local
representative of each facility affected, or potentially affected, by the
emergency. In any event, the Board of Public Works may take whatever action
it deems necessary in order to respond to the emergency, the cost of which
shall be borne by the owner of the facilities whose equipment occasioned the
emergency.



      (2)   Non-emergency situations. Except in the case of an
emergency, any person who excavates rights-of-way without a permit must
subsequently obtain a permit, pay double the computed fee for such excavation
under provisions of § 99.009 and § 99.999(C) for said permit, deposit with
the Board of Public Works or authorized representative the fees necessary to
correct any damage to the rights-of-way, and comply with all of the
requirements of this section.



   (I)   Revocation of permits. Permittees hold permits issued pursuant
to this chapter as a privilege and not as a right. The city reserves its
right, as provided herein, to revoke any excavation permit, without refund of
the permit fee, in the event of a substantial breach of the terms and
conditions of any law or any condition of the permit. A substantial breach by
permittee shall include, but shall not be limited to, the following:



      (1)   The violation of any material provision of the
excavation permit;



      (2)   An evasion or attempt to evade any material provision of
the excavation permit, or the perpetration or attempt to perpetrate any fraud
or deceit upon the city or its citizens;



      (3)   Any material misrepresentation of fact in the
application for an excavation permit;



      (4)   The failure to maintain the required bonds or insurance;



      (5)   The failure to complete the work in a timely manner; or



      (6)   The failure to correct a condition indicated on an order
issued pursuant to this chapter.



      (7)   If the Board of Public Works or their authorized
representative determines that the permittee has committed a substantial
breach of any law or any condition placed on the excavation permit, the Board
of Public Works or their representative shall make a written demand upon the
permittee to remedy such violation. The demand shall state that continued
violations may be cause for revocation of the permit. Further, a substantial
breach, as stated above, will allow the Board of Public Works or their
authorized representative to place additional or revised conditions on the
permit. Within 24 hours of receiving notification of the breach, permittee
shall contact the Board of Public Works or their authorized representative
with a plan, acceptable to the Board of Public Works, for correction of the
breach. Permittee's failure to submit an acceptable plan or permittee's
failure to reasonably implement the approved plan shall be cause for
immediate revocation of the permit.



      (8)   If a permit is revoked, the permittee shall reimburse
the city for the city's reasonable costs, including restoration costs and the
costs of collection and reasonable attorneys' fees incurred in connection
with such revocation.



   (J)   Failure to comply with obligations;  remedies. 



      (1)   If, for any reason, any person or entity, their agents
and/or their subcontractors, fail to comply with obligations under federal,
state and local regulations and the city is made aware of such failure, the
city shall have available, but not be limited to, the following remedies:



         (a)   The person or entity will be required to take all
actions necessary to repair and restore levees and/or rights-of-ways to
conditions which comply with federal, state or local regulations.



         (b)   If the person or entity does not take such action
within 30 days notice (by U.S. certified mail return receipt requested), the
city will take corrective action and invoice the person or entity for
associated costs in such restoration.



         (c)   The city reserves the right to penalize the person
or entity for such violations in accordance with § 99.999.



      (2)   This division shall be applied to all persons and
entities regardless of whether the work done is permitted or is done without
permit. All contractors working for the city, or their subcontractors, will
be responsible for understanding and complying with federal, state and local
regulations when conducting repair and/or excavation around levees. All
persons or entities must know and comply with all responsibilities under
federal law and associated requirements made by the U.S. Army Corps of
Engineers, District Engineer. The city will hold all persons and entities
personally and financially responsible for improper encroachment of any
easement, right-of-way or floodway. Of central concern, but not the only
concern, is that encroachments would not have adverse impact on floodways.



   (K)   Additional requirements, public utilities, municipally owned
utilities, and municipally owned sewer works. A public utility, as used in
this chapter, shall include public utilities as defined by IC 8-1-2-1(a) 1998
S-12 and municipally owned utilities as defined by IC 8-1-2-1(h). Municipally
owned sewer works are likewise subject to this chapter.



      (1)   Registration required. It shall be unlawful for any
public utility to install, operate, construct, or maintain within any public
rights-of-way any facilities unless such facilities are registered with the
Board of Public Works or their authorized representative by filing a
registration statement. All public utilities occupying city rights-of-way
prior to adoption of this subchapter, upon passage of this subchapter and
after receiving notice, shall have 60 days to register. The registra-tion
statement shall be in a form which shall include the following:



         (a)   The identity and legal status of the registrant,
including any affiliates who own or operate any facilities in the public
rights-of-way;



         (b)   The name, address and telephone number of the
officer, agent or employee responsible for the accuracy of the registration
statement;



         (c)   The name, address, telephone number and procedural
contact information of a local representative, who shall be available at all
times in the event of an emergency;



         (d)   A general description of services that the
registrant provides or intends to offer to persons within the city through
the utilization of facilities in the public rights-of-way;



         (e)   A statement of the authority, including pertinent
verifiable documentation, pursuant to which the registrant occupies the
public rights-of-way; and,



         (f)   Such other information as the Board of Public
Works may reasonably require.



      (2)   Registration fee.  Each registrant, at the time of
filing an initial registration statement, shall pay to the city a
registration fee of $1,000.



      (3)   Coordination of excavations.



         (a)   Each public utility shall prepare and submit to
the Board of Public Works or their authorized representative a utility master
plan, in a format specified by the Board of Public Works or their authorized
representative, that shows the horizontal and approximate vertical location
relative to the boundaries of the rights-of-way of all facilities which it
owns or over which it has control and which are located in any city
rights-of-way. The utility master plan shall also show all planned major
utility work for the next two years. Utilities shall submit an initial
utility master plan no later than one year after the effective passage date
of the ordinance adopting this section. Thereafter, each utility shall submit
annually, on the first business day of July, a revised and updated utility
master plan and an updated registration statement.  The updated registration
statement shall detail any facilities located within the rights-of-way
formerly owned by the registrant and sold to another entity since the filing
of the previous registration statement. As used in this section, the term
"planned major utility work" refers to any and all future excavations planned
by the utility when the utility master plan or update is submitted that
affects rights-of-way for more than five days, provided that the utility
shall not be required to show future excavations planned to occur more than
two years after the date that the utility master plan or update is submitted.
The city shall make all utility master plans submitted in accordance with
this section available for public inspection unless the information submitted
is clearly marked as proprietary in nature and the City Attorney concurs with
the proprietary designation.



         (b)   Each public utility shall cooperate with other
registered utilities and the city for the best, most efficient, most
aesthetic and least obtrusive use of the public rights-of-way, consistent
with safety, and to minimize traffic and other disruptions including street
cuts.



         (c)   Each public utility shall participate in joint
planning, construction and advance notification of public rights-of-way work,
including coordination and consolidation of street cut work and participation
in the monthly Utility Coordinating Committee meeting conducted by the city,
excepting such work performed in an emergency or other exigent circumstance.



         (d)   Each public utility shall be a member of the
Indiana Underground Plant Protection Service or other so designated
underground reporting service(s) so as to be aware of any excavations
scheduled in the vicinity of their facilities. In no case will the city be
responsible for notifying a utility of any excavation permits issued by the
city that could potentially conflict with the utility's facilities.



         (e)   All utility installations permitted under this
chapter shall, upon demand of the Board of Public Works or their authorized
representative, be relocated or lowered if required by the city to avoid
potential conflicts with a proper governmental use of a street, alley,
sidewalk or other public place, excluding private projects which are fully or
partially publicly funded. All expenses incurred in relocating utility
facilities shall be paid by the public utility.



         (f)   Should any utility fail, after notice, to remove
or rearrange any utility facilities located within the rights-of-way at the
Board of Public Works request, the city may, at its option and in addition to
the imposition of any penalties or other remedies hereunder, undertake or
cause to be undertaken, such necessary removal or rearrangement.  The city
shall have no liability for any damage caused by such removal or
rearrangement and the utility shall be liable to the city for all reasonable
costs incurred by the city in such removal or rearrangement.



         (g)   If any public utility, after being afforded a
reasonable opportunity for review of construction drawings and plans as
supplied by the city for a public improvement project funded in whole or in
part by the city, fails to inform the city of potential construction
conflicts with that utility's facilities and the conflicts result in
increased construction expense to the city, the city shall submit to the
public utility an itemized statement of the cost of the increase for the
public improvement project attributable to the public utility.  The public
utility shall, within 30 days after receipt of the statement, pay to the city
the entire amount thereof.



         (h)   The city may, in case of fire, disaster or other

rights-of-way, in which event the city shall not be liable therefor to a
public utility.



      (4)   Abandonment.  In the event that use of any utility
property located within the public rights-of-way is discontinued for a
continuous period of 18 months, or any utility facilities have been installed
within the public rights-of-way without complying with the requirements of
this chapter, a utility shall be deemed to have abandoned such facilities.



         (a)   The city, upon such terms as it may impose, may
give the utility permission to abandon, without removing, any utility
property located on public rights-of-way. Unless such permission is granted,
a utility shall remove all abandoned property upon written notice from the
city and shall restore any affected public rights-of-way to its former state
at the time such facilities were installed.



         (b)   Upon abandonment of any utility property in place,
a utility, if required by the city, shall submit to the city a written
instrument, satisfactory in form to the city, transferring to the city the
ownership of the utility property so abandoned.



      (5)   City use of utility facilities. The city shall have the
right to install and maintain, free of charge, upon any poles and within any
underground pipes or conduits or other facilities of any public utility,
located within the public rights-of-way, any facilities desired by the city
which specifically serve public safety purposes, provided the installation
and maintenance of such facilities does not unreasonably burden existing and
future operations of the facility owner. Each utility shall cooperate with
the city's reasonably disclosed future needs in planning, designing, and
constructing utility facilities located in the public rights-of-way so as to
accommodate the city's public safety facilities.  The city shall pay the
constructing utility all incremental costs associated with such planning,
designing, and construction of the additional capacity necessary to
accommodate the city's facilities.



      (6)   Insurance. A public utility shall take out, pay for and
maintain during the period in which a permit is in effect, a policy of public
liability and property damage insurance protecting permittee, permittee's
agents and employees against any liability, injury or death sustained or
suffered by the public or damage to public property of the public by reason
of the work carried out under the permit. Each public utility shall obtain

thereof, deliver to the city a certificate of insurance, satisfactory in form
and content to the city, evidencing that the above insurance is in force and
will not be cancelled or materially altered without first giving the city 30
days prior written notice.



      (7)   If required on the face thereof, the permit shall not be
effective for any purpose unless and until the permittee files with the Risk
Management Department a corporate surety bond or other security approved by
the Risk Management Department in the amount specified on the face of the
permit, said bond or other security to fully assure the performance by the
permittee of all obligations imposed upon the permittee under the provisions
of the permit and this chapter.



   (L)   Liability of city.  Except due to negligence by the city,
neither the city nor any officer or employee thereof shall be held
responsible for any damages caused by any excavations in any rights-of-way
made by any person under the authority of a permit issued pursuant to the
provisions of this chapter. The permittee shall be solely liable for any

§ 99.033  DISRUPTION OF ROUTINE TRAFFIC OPERATIONS; PROCEDURE.



   (A)   In streets or alleys within the area known as the central
business district (CBD), the area bounded by Superior Street, the
Pennsylvania Railroad, Clay Street, and Fairfield Avenue and in streets
defined by ordinance as “through” or “preferential,” disruptions to
existing street and alley surfaces will be regarded as routine maintenance
work, construction work or emergency work. Disruptions shall mean any cut
into existing surfaces for maintenance or improvement, any reconstruction on
or restoration of roadway or sidewalk surfaces, any resurfacing of existing
roadways and any entree into existing manholes or vaults for any purpose
whatsoever.



      (1)   For routine maintenance work which involves only entree
into existing manholes and vaults, work may be performed at any time except
between the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m. Monday
through Saturday, providing that not more than one lane of traffic is
blocked. Sidewalk vaults and manholes may be entered during any hour as long
as vehicular traffic is not disrupted.



      (2)   For construction work:



         (a)   All reasonable efforts shall be made by the
utility involved to cooperate with city authorities on closing the streets,
blocking of traffic lanes and in the use of additional shifts so as to
complete the work as readily as possible.



         (b)   All underground construction of major proportions
shall be designed so as to facilitate ease of work ensuing under traffic,
where possible.



         (c)   Underground and surface construction of minor
proportions shall be designed so as to incorporate coverage of the work area
with steel plating to facilitate traffic usage during non-work hours and
during the hours of 7:00 a.m. to 9:00 a.m. and 4:00 p.m. to 6:00 p.m.



         (d)   All utility underground construction shall be in
accordance with city general detailed specifications adopted by the Board of
Public Works on August 14, 1961, pp. 479, and any revisions made thereto.



         (e)   Utilities shall avoid initiating new construction
work wherever possible during the period starting the Saturday prior to
Thanksgiving Day and ending on New Year's Day.



      (3)   For emergency work, the utilities shall normally work on
a continuous basis and will be permitted to perform this work at any time
without any imposed restrictions except to cooperate with the city
authorities in regard to traffic control and public safety matters and to
minimize to the extent reasonably possible, any disruption to the activities
of the central business district.  The designation of an emergency for a
particular utility shall in all cases initially be left to the judgment of
the utility involved.  These situations would include those where the public
safety and welfare are involved, unrealistic economic hardships are imposed,
jeopardy to utility services exists and losses of utility services to areas
or customers would persist.



      (4)   Every effort shall be made to close only one traffic
lane at a time in any street. No disruptions shall close more than half of a
street at any one time except where necessity dictates.



      (5)   Excavation material shall not remain in the roadway when
the roadway is required to be open to traffic, unless permission is granted
to do otherwise.



   (B)   All disruptions into roadways and sidewalks shall be
barricaded and delineated with signs, flashers or lights, etc., as the
situation may require in general accordance with schematic plans on file in
the board of works offices.  Additional delineation may be utilized as the
utility or contractor desires. The job site shall be properly identified as
to the utility responsible for the work performed.



   (C)   All street openings being restored with concrete shall utilize
high-early strength proportioning. Where backfill procedures require an
asphaltic thickness over concrete or in cases of open trenches, and where
cuts are narrow and at approximate right angles to traffic lanes, steel
plating shall be used to bridge the openings.  Barricades may be used where
cuts are wide or longitudinal to the traffic lanes and in cases where the use
of plating is not necessary or appropriate.



   (D)   Where steel plating is necessary it shall be at least 3/4 inch
in thickness and must be installed to prevent rocking or shifting due to
vehicular traffic. Spiking of plates shall be permissible on asphalt surfaces
only. All spiking must be secure against vibration.



   (E)   Permits for construction work shall be sought at least 72
hours in advance of the proposed work from the Board of Public Works, after
final approval of plans by city departments. All roadway construction and
resurfacing type work shall require a permit. All permits issued by the Board
of Public Works shall require approval of the Police Department and the
Traffic Engineering Department.



   (F)   All flaggers utilized in conjunction with permit work must
wear clothing which clearly identifies their purpose to motorists. This may
include reflective fluorescent vests and hard hats.



   (G)   After city working hours all applications for permits which
due to emergency or other necessity must be secured immediately, the board of
works or police desk sergeant will be called for verbal permission and a
follow-up made through regular channels the following city working day to
secure the normal written permit.



   (H)   The Board of Public Works or their authorized representative
shall be authorized to request stoppage of work in lieu of deviation by the
permittee from the work permit.



   (I)   All construction work on state highways which requires a state
but not a city permit shall be reported to the Board of Public Works upon
receipt of such permit.

delivering. Provided, however, if any such person shall desire to receive or
deliver any such goods, wares or merchandise in any building where by
reason  of want of  an alley adjacent  to the  real estate upon which 
the building is situated there  is  no convenient access thereto other than
by passing over such sidewalk, then such person may receive or deliver such

brick alleys when a decision is made to repair or replace brick alleys in the
normal course.

forward that complaint to the Department of Neighborhood Code Enforcement.

office shall thereafter forward the complaint to the Inspector for
processing, who in turn, shall follow that case through to its resolution.



   (C)   Notice to abate.  When a complaint addresses private
property, the Inspector, through the Department of Neighborhood Code
Enforcement, shall cause a written notice to abate to be served upon the
owner of the property in question, granting that owner a minimum of five
calendar days in which to remove the environmental nuisance.  This notice
shall be served by a law enforcement officer, by certified mail to the owner,
or by a “notice” placard conspicuously posted on the property which
contains the following information:  The address of the property, the date
of the notice, the address and the telephone number of the Department of
Neighborhood Code Enforcement, and a warning that if the environmental public
nuisance is not removed within five calendar days after posting, the city
will abate the nuisance and seek recovery of the actual costs involved in the
removal of the nuisance. The notice will also contain a short and plain
statement of the owner’s or occupant’s right to object to the notice and
the manner and time for making such objection. The Inspector, after posting a
notice to abate, shall serve to the owner of the subject property a copy of
the notice by regular first class United States mail, postage prepaid, and
provided further that any failure to give such written notice shall not
constitute a defense to any action to enforce the provisions of § 100.18.



   (D)   Publication of notice.  In lieu of the notice required by §
100.19(C), the city, through the Department of Neighborhood Code Enforcement,
may publish a notice in a newspaper of general circulation in the city, on
three separate occasions, twice during the month of March and once during the
month of April, that weeds not cut by May 1 of that year will be cut by the
city and the owner of the property charged with the costs under the
provisions of § 100.19(C).  The publication shall contain all of the
information required of the “Notice to Abate.”  The city may cut weeds
as many times as is necessary and charge the actual cost to the property
owner.



   (E)   Inspection.  Following the expiration of the notice to abate,
an Inspector shall visually inspect the property to determine whether an
environmental public nuisance exists.  If an environmental public nuisance
exists, action shall be taken to abate that nuisance in accordance with this
chapter.



   (F)   Abatement by city on governmental property.  Where the
complaint addresses governmental property, and it is determined by the
Inspector that a violation exists and threatens the health and safety of the
people of the city, the Inspector may direct the city to immediately enter
upon the premises and remove the environmental public nuisance.

Inspector may cause a citation for violation of city ordinance to be issued
to the offending property owner.



   (B)   Abatement by city on private property.  In addition  to the
issuance of a citation for violation of a city ordinance under division (A)
of this section, the Inspector, in the name of the controller of the city,
may issue a request to the city to abate the environmental public nuisance,
and shall thereafter furnish the controller with a statement of the actual
cost involved in the removal of the nuisance.  The actual abatement may be
assigned to a city department or contracted out through standard procedures.



   (C)   Responsibility of offender for costs of enforcement. 
Neighborhood Code Enforcement shall make a statement of the actual cost
incurred in eliminating the environmental public nuisance. The costs shall
include: cost of removal of the public nuisance, administrative fees and 
recording fees. If the cost of removal is less than $100, the administrative
fees shall not exceed $50. If the cost of removal is greater than $100, the
administrative fees shall not exceed $100. The limitation on administrative
fees shall not limit whatever might be necessary in costs to collect the
outstanding balances. Said statement shall be delivered to the property owner
by first-class mail. The owner shall pay the amount noted to the city within
30 days after receipt, which shall be deposited to the general fund of the
department specified to enforce the ordinance.



   (D)   Failure to pay.  If the owner fails to pay the amount within
30 days after receiving a statement, a copy of all costs shall be filed in

amount claimed on the tax duplicate against the property so that the amount
claimed can be collected as taxes are collected, subject to the limitations
above.

city;



      (3)   The concentration of persons, animals and vehicles at

   (A)   The Common Council finds that excessive calls for service to

public safety resources, which may result in decreased public safety services
being provided to other geographic areas of the city.



   (B)   The regulations set forth in this chapter are designed to
protect the overall public health, safety and welfare of the city. They are
further designed to help prevent and assist in abating repeat calls for

public safety services being provided to other residents and areas of the
city. Repeat nuisance service call fees are authorized to be imposed and
collected from the owner, commercial tenant, occupant and/or operator of the
property designated as a commercial chronic problem property. Such fees are
intended to help cover costs incurred by the city which are over and above
the cost of providing services to properties not designated as a commercial
chronic problem property.

§ 111.01  INTENT.



   (A)   The city, pursuant to applicable federal and state law, is
authorized to grant one or more nonexclusive franchises to construct,
operate, maintain and reconstruct cable television systems within the city
limits.



   (B)   The City Council finds that the development of cable
television systems has the potential of having great benefit and impact upon
the residents of the city. Because of the complex and rapidly changing
technology associated with cable television, the City Council further finds
that the public convenience, safety and general welfare can best be served by
establishing regulatory powers which should be vested in the city or such
persons as the city shall designate. It is the intent of this chapter and
subsequent amendments to provide for and specify the means to attain the best
possible cable television service to the public and any franchises issued
pursuant to this chapter shall be deemed to include this finding as an
integral part thereof.

§ 111.08  FRANCHISE NONTRANSFERABLE.



   (A)   The grantee shall not sell, transfer, lease, assign, sublet or
dispose of, in whole or in part, either by forced or involuntary sale, or by
ordinary sale, consolidation or otherwise, the franchise and/or cable system
or any of the rights or privileges granted by the franchise, without the
prior consent of the Council which consent shall not be unreasonably denied
or delayed and shall be denied only upon a good faith finding by the city
that the proposed transferee lacks the legal, technical or financial
qualifications to perform its obligations under the franchise agreement. Any
attempt to sell, transfer, lease, assign or otherwise dispose of the
franchise and/or cable system without the consent of the Council shall be
null and void.  This provision shall not apply to sales of property or
equipment in the normal course of business.  No consent from the city shall
be required for a transfer in trust, mortgage or other instrument of
hypothecation, in whole or in part, to secure an indebtedness, or for a pro
forma transfer to a corporation, partnership or other entity controlling,
controlled by or under common control with the grantee.



   (B)   (1)   The following events shall be deemed to be a sale,
assignment or other transfer of the franchise and/or cable system requiring
compliance with this section:



         (a)   The sale, assignment or other transfer of all or a
majority of the grantee's assets;



         (b)   The sale, assignment or other transfer of capital
stock or partnership, membership or other equity interests in the grantee by
one or more of its existing shareholders, partners, members or other equity
owners so as to create a new controlling interest in the grantee;



         (c)   The issuance of additional capital stock or
partnership, membership or other equity interest by the grantee so as to
create a new controlling interest in the grantee; and



         (d)   The entry by the grantee into an agreement with
respect to the management or operation of the grantee and/or the system.



      (2)   The term “Controlling Interest” as used herein means
majority equity ownership of the grantee.



   (C)   Except as provided below, no grantee may sell or otherwise
transfer ownership in a franchise and/or cable system within a 36-month
period following either the acquisition or initial construction of said
system by the grantee.  In the case of a sale of multiple systems, if the
terms of the sale require the buyer to subsequently transfer ownership of one
or more such systems to one or more third parties, such transfer shall be
considered a part of the initial transaction.  The above-described 36-month
holding period shall not apply to:



      (1)   Any transfer of ownership interest in any franchise
and/or cable system which is not subject to federal income tax liability;



      (2)   Any sale required by operation of any law or any act of
any agency, any state or political subdivision or the city; or



      (3)   Any sale, assignment or transfer, to one or more
purchasers, assignees or transferees controlled by, controlling or under
common control with, the seller, assignor or transferor.



   (D)   In the case of any sale or transfer of ownership of any
franchise and/or cable system after the 36-month period following acquisition
of such system, the city shall have 111 days to act upon any request for
approval of such sale or transfer that contains or is accompanied by such
information as is required in accordance with Federal Communications
Commission Regulations, the requirements of this chapter and such other
reasonable information as the city, in its sole discretion, may request. 
If  the city fails to render a final decision on the request within 111 days
from receipt by the city of all required information, such request shall be
deemed granted unless the requesting party and the city agree to an extension
of time.



   (E)   The grantee shall notify grantor in writing of any foreclosure
or any other judicial sale of all or a substantial part of the franchise
property of the grantee or upon the termination of any lease or interest
covering all or a substantial part of said franchise property.  Such
notification shall be considered by the grantor as notice that a change in
control of ownership of the franchise has taken place and the provisions
under this section governing the consent of the grantor to such change in
control of ownership shall apply.  For the purpose of determining whether it
shall consent to such change, transfer or acquisition of control, the grantor
may inquire into the qualifications of the prospective transferee or
controlling party, and the grantee shall assist the grantor in any such
inquiry.  In seeking the grantor's consent to any change of ownership or
control, the grantee shall have the responsibility of insuring that the
transferee completes an application in form and substance reasonably
satisfactory to the grantor, which application shall include the information
required under state and federal law as well as under § 111.13(A) through
(H) of this chapter.  An application, acceptable to the city, shall be
submitted to the grantor not less than 90 days prior to the date of
transfer.  The transferee shall be required to establish that it possesses
the legal, technical and financial qualifications to operate and maintain the
system and comply with all franchise requirements for the remainder of the
term of the franchise.  If, after considering the legal, financial,
character and technical qualities of the applicant and determining that they
are satisfactory, the grantor finds that such transfer is acceptable, the
grantor shall transfer and assign the rights and obligations of such
franchise.  The consent of the grantor to such transfer shall not be
unreasonably denied.



   (G)   Any financial institution having a pledge of the grantee or
its assets for the advancement of money for the construction and/or operation
of the franchise shall have the right to notify the grantor that it or its
designee satisfactory to the grantor shall take control of and operate the
cable television system, in the event of a grantee default in its financial
obligations.  Further, said financial institution shall also submit a plan
for such operation within 30 days of assuming such control that  will insure
continued service and compliance with all franchise requirements during the
term the financial institution exercises control over the system.  The
financial institution shall not exercise control over the system for a period
exceeding one  year unless extended by the grantor in its discretion and
during said period of time it shall have the right to petition the grantor to
transfer the franchise to another grantee.



(Ord. G-15-95, passed 6-13-95)



§ 111.09  PURCHASE BY CITY UPON EXPIRATION OR REVOCATION.



   (A)   If, subject to the provisions of the Cable Act, a renewal of a
franchise is denied, the city may purchase to the extent permitted by local
law and upon payment to the grantee of the cable systems' fair market value
as a going concern, exclusive of any value allocated to the franchise itself,
that portion of grantee's cable system serving the city.



   (B)   Subject to the Cable Act, if a franchise is revoked for cause,
the city may, to the extent permitted by local law, acquire that portion of
the cable system serving the city upon payment of an equitable price.



(Ord. G-15-95, passed 6-13-95)



§ 111.10  GEOGRAPHICAL COVERAGE.



   (A)   The grantee shall design, construct and maintain the cable
television system to have the capability to pass every dwelling unit in the
service area, subject to any line extension requirements of the franchise
agreement.



   (B)   After service has been established by activating trunk and/or
distribution cables for any part of the service area, the grantee shall
provide cable service to any requesting subscriber within that service area
within 30 days from the date of request, provided that the grantee is able to
secure all rights-of-way necessary to extend service to such subscriber
within such 30-day period on reasonable terms and conditions.



(Ord. G-15-95, passed 6-13-95)



§ 111.11  NONEXCLUSIVE FRANCHISE.



   Any franchise granted shall be nonexclusive.  The grantor 
specifically  reserves  the right to grant, at any time, such additional
franchises for a cable television system or any component thereof, as it
deems appropriate,  subject  to  applicable  state and federal law;
provided, however, that no franchise shall be granted on terms materially
less burdensome or more favorable than any other franchise granted hereunder.



(Ord. G-15-95, passed 6-13-95)



§ 111.12  MULTIPLE FRANCHISES.



   (A)   The grantor may grant one or more franchises for a service
area.  The grantor may, in its sole discretion, limit the number of
franchises granted, based upon, but not necessarily limited to, the
requirements of applicable law and specific local considerations; such as:



      (1)   The capacity of the public rights-of- way to accommodate
multiple coaxial cables in addition to the cables, conduits and pipes of the
utility systems, such as electrical power, telephone, gas and sewerage.



      (2)   The impact on the community of having multiple
franchises.



      (3)   The disadvantages that may result from cable system
competition, such as the requirement for multiple pedestals on residents'
property, and the disruption arising from numerous excavations of the
rights-of-way.



      (4)   The financial capabilities of the applicant and its
guaranteed commitment to make necessary investment to erect, maintain and
operate the proposed system for the duration of the franchise term.



   (B)   Each grantee awarded a franchise to serve the entire city
shall offer service to all residences in the city, in accordance with
construction and service schedules mutually agreed upon between the grantor
and the grantee, and consistent with applicable law.



   (C)   Developers of new residential housing with underground
utilities shall provide conduit to accommodate cables for at least two cable
systems in accordance with the provisions of § 111.19(D).



   (D)   The grantor may require that any new grantee be responsible
for its own underground trenching and the costs associated therewith, if, in
the grantor's opinion, the rights-of-way in any particular area cannot
feasibly and reasonably accommodate additional cables.



   (E)   Any additional franchise granted by the city to provide cable
service in a part of the city in which a franchise has already been granted
and where an existing grantee is providing service shall require the new
grantee to provide service throughout its service area within a reasonable
time and in a sequence which does not discriminate against lower income
residents.

other cognizant public agencies.



   (B)   In those areas of the city where transmission or distributions
facilities of all the public utilities providing telephone and electric power
service are underground, the grantee likewise shall construct, operate and
maintain its transmission and distribution facilities therein underground.



   (C)   In those areas of the city where the grantee's cables are
located on the above-ground transmission or distribution facilities of the
public utility providing telephone or electric power service, and in the
event that the facilities of both such public utilities subsequently are
placed underground, then the grantee likewise shall construct, operate and
maintain its transmission and distribution facilities underground, at
grantee's cost.  Certain of the grantee's equipment, such as pedestals,
amplifiers and power supplies, which normally are placed above ground, may
continue to remain in above-ground closures.



   (D)   In new residential developments in which all the electric
power and telephone utilities are underground, the following procedure shall
apply with respect to access to and utilization of underground easements:



      (1)   The developer shall be responsible for contacting and
surveying all franchised cable operators to ascertain which operators desire
(or, pursuant to the terms and provisions of this chapter and any franchise
agreement, may be required) to provide cable service to that development. 
The developer may establish a reasonable deadline to receive cable operator
responses.  The final development map shall indicate the cable operators
that have agreed to serve the development.



      (2)   If one or two cable operators wish to provide service,
they shall be accommodated in the joint utilities trench on a
nondiscriminatory shared basis.  If fewer than two operators indicate
interest, the developer shall provide conduit to accommodate two sets of
cable television cables and dedicate to the city any initially unoccupied
conduit.  The developer shall be entitled to recover the cost of such
initially unoccupied conduit in the event that the grantor subsequently
leases or sells occupancy or use rights to any grantee.



      (3)   The developer shall provide at least ten working days
notice of the date that utility trenches will be open to the cable operators
that have agreed to serve the development.  When the trenches are open,
cable operators shall have two  working days to begin the installation of
their cables, and five working days after beginning Installation to complete
Installation.



      (4)   The final development map shall not be approved until
the developer submits evidence that:



         (a)   It has notified each grantee that underground
utility trenches are to open as of an estimated date, and that each grantee
will be allowed access to such trenches, including trenches from proposed
streets to individual homes or home sites, on specified nondiscriminatory
terms and conditions; and



         (b)   It has received a written notification from each
grantee that the grantee intends to install its facilities during the open
trench period on the specified terms and conditions, or such other terms and
conditions as are mutually agreeable to the developer and the grantee, or has
received no reply from a grantee within ten days after its notification to
such grantee, in which case the grantee will be deemed to have waived its
opportunity to install its facilities during the open trench period.



      (5)   Sharing the joint utilities trench shall be subject to
compliance with state regulatory agency and utility standards.  If such
compliance is not possible, the developer shall provide a separate trench for
the cable television cables, with the entire cost shared among the
participating cable operators.  With the concurrence of the developer, the
affected utilities and the cable operators, alternative installation
procedures, such as the use of deeper trenches, may be utilized, subject to
applicable law.



      (6)   Any cable operator wishing to serve an area where the
trenches have been closed shall be responsible for its own trenching and
associated costs and shall repair all property to the condition which existed
prior to such trenching.



      (7)   In the event that more than one franchise is awarded,
the city reserves the right to limit the number of drop cables and/or
pedestals per residence, or to require that the drop cable(s) and/or
pedestals(s) be utilized only by the cable operator selected by the resident
to provide service.

give the grantee permission to abandon, without removing, any system facility
or equipment laid, directly constructed, operated or maintained under the
franchise.  Unless such permission is granted or unless otherwise provided
in this chapter, the grantee shall remove all abandoned aboveground
facilities and equipment upon receipt of written notice from the grantor and
shall restore any affected street to its former state at the time such
facilities and equipment were installed, so as not to impair its
usefulness.  In removing its plant, structures and equipment, the grantee
shall refill, at its own expense, any excavation that shall be made by it and
shall leave all public ways and places in as good condition as that
prevailing prior to such removal without materially interfering with any
electrical or telephone cable or other utility wires, poles or attachments. 
The grantor shall have the right to inspect and approve the condition of the
public ways, public places, cables, wires, attachments and poles prior to and
after removal.  The liability, indemnity and insurance provisions of this
chapter and any security fund provided in the franchise shall continue in
full force and effect during the period of removal and until full compliance
by the grantee with the terms and conditions of this section.



   (C)   Upon abandonment of any franchise property in place, the
grantee, if required by the grantor, shall submit to the grantor an
instrument, satisfactory in form to the grantor, transferring to the grantor
the ownership of the franchise property abandoned.



   (D)   At the expiration of the term for which the franchise is
granted, or upon its revocation or earlier expiration, as provided for
herein, in any such case without renewal, extension or transfer, the grantor
shall have the right to require the grantee to remove, at its own expense,
all aboveground portions of the cable television system from all streets and
public ways within the city within a reasonable period of time, which shall
not be less than 180 days.



   (E)   Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth in this
chapter, the grantee may abandon any underground franchise property in place
so long as it does not materially interfere with the use of the street or
public rights-of-way in which such property is located or with the use
thereof by any public utility or other cable grantee.

§ 111.30  EXTENDED OPERATION AND CONTINUITY OF SERVICES.



   Upon either expiration or revocation of the franchise, the grantor
shall have discretion to permit and/or require the grantee to continue to
operate the cable television system for an extended period of time not to
exceed six months from the date of such expiration or revocation.  The
grantee shall continue to operate the system under the terms and conditions
of this chapter and the franchise and to provide the regular subscriber
service and any and all of the services that may be provided at that time.



(Ord. G-15-95, passed 6-13-95)



§ 111.31  RECEIVERSHIP AND FORECLOSURE.



   (A)   A franchise granted hereunder shall, at the option of the
grantor, cease and terminate 120 days after appointment of a receiver or
receivers, or trustee or trustees, to take over and conduct the business of
the grantee, whether in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy or other
action or proceeding, unless such receivership or trusteeship shall have been
vacated prior to the expiration of said 120 days, or unless: such receivers
or trustees shall have, within 120 days after their election or appointment,
fully complied with all the terms and provisions of this chapter and the
franchise granted pursuant hereto, and the receivership or trustees within
said 120 days shall have remedied all the faults under the franchise or
provided a plan for the remedy of such faults which is satisfactory to the
grantor; and such receivers or trustees shall, within said 120 days, execute
an agreement duly approved by the court having jurisdiction in the premises,
whereby such receivers or trustees assume and agree to be bound by each and
every term, provision and limitation of the franchise granted.



   (B)   In the case of a foreclosure or other judicial sale of the
franchise property, or any material part thereof, the grantor may serve
notice of termination upon the grantee and the successful bidder at such
sale, in which the event the franchise granted and all rights and privileges
of the grantee hereunder shall cease and terminate 30 days after service of
such notice, unless  the grantor shall have approved the transfer of the
franchise, as and in the manner that this chapter provides; and such
successful bidder shall have covenanted and agreed with the grantor to assume
and be bound by all terms and conditions of the franchise.

§ 111.32  RIGHTS RESERVED TO GRANTOR.



   (A)   In addition to any rights specifically reserved to the grantor
by this chapter, the grantor reserves to itself every right and power which
is required to be reserved by a provision of any ordinance or under the
franchise.



   (B)   The grantor shall have the right to waive any provision of the
franchise, except those required by federal or state regulation, if the
grantor determines that it is in the public interest to do so, and that the
enforcement of such provision will impose an undue hardship on the grantee or
the subscribers.  To be effective, such waiver shall be evidenced by a
statement in writing signed by a duly authorized representative of the
grantor.  Waiver of any provision in one instance shall not be deemed a
waiver of such provision subsequent to such instance nor be deemed a waiver
of any other provision of the franchise unless the statement so recites.



(Ord. G-15-95, passed 6-13-95)



§ 111.33  RIGHTS OF INDIVIDUALS.

discriminate against subscribers, channel users or general citizens on the
basis of race, color, religion, national origin, age, gender or sexual
preference. The grantee shall comply at all times with all other applicable
federal, state and local laws and regulations, relating to nondiscrimination.



   (B)   The grantee shall adhere to the applicable equal employment
opportunity requirements of federal, state and local regulations, as now
written or as amended from time to time.



   (C)   Neither the grantee, nor any person, agency or entity shall,
without the subscriber's consent, tap or arrange for the tapping, of any
cable, line, signal input device, or subscriber outlet or receiver for any
purpose except routine maintenance of the system, detection of unauthorized
service, polling with audience participating or audience viewing surveys to
support advertising research regarding viewers where individual viewing
behavior cannot be identified.



   (D)   In the conduct of providing its services or in pursuit of any
collateral commercial enterprise resulting therefrom, the grantee shall take
reasonable steps to prevent the invasion of a subscriber's or general
citizen's right of privacy or other personal rights through the use of the
system as such rights are delineated or defined by applicable law.  The
grantee shall not, without lawful court order or other applicable valid legal
authority, utilize the system's interactive two-way equipment or capability
for unauthorized personal surveillance of any subscriber or general citizen.



   (E)   No cable line, wire amplifier, converter or other piece of
equipment owned by the grantee shall be installed by the grantee in the
subscriber's premises, other than in appropriate easements, without first
securing any required consent.  If a subscriber requests service, permission
to install upon subscriber's property shall be presumed.  Where a property
owner or his predecessor has granted an easement including a public utility
easement or a servitude to another and the servitude by its terms
contemplates a use such as the grantee's intended use, the grantee shall not
be required to obtain the written permission of the owner for the
installation of cable television equipment.

         (b)   How grant dollars were used to increase the number
of access programs produced and cablecast.



         (c)   The ACO must respond to complaints or concerns
about their operations raised in an annual public hearing held by the Cable
Fund Access Board.



         (d)   Following the Cable Fund Access Board annual

Wayne in which the ACOs pledge to spend the grant money according to the
above criteria.



      (5)   Non-originator access programming grants.



         (a)   A minimum of 10% the city's "access dollars" will
be set aside annually as non-access channel originator grants for access
programming by not-for-profit agencies or educational or city governmental
which do not originate access channels.



         (b)   Non-access channel originator grants will be
available to any not-for-profit, educational or governmental agency within
the City of Fort Wayne (except Allen County government offices as Allen
County government receives cable television franchise fees).



         (c)   Grant money may be utilized for operational
expenses in the production of access programming including hiring of
production services.



         (d)   Qualified non-access channel originators  will

recipients will enter into contracts with the City of Fort Wayne in which the
grantee pledges to spend the grant money in the manner approved by City
Council and to provide proof of the expenditures.



            3.   All non-access channel originator grants will
be subject to approval by the Common Council.



   (D)   Cable television franchise management expenses.



      (1)   Ten percent of the "access dollars" will be used by the
city for cable television franchise management expenses, which would include
industry publications, travel to seminars or training, hiring of consultants
to provide federal cable law expertise and advise if the franchisor is
fulfilling its franchise commitments including the rebuilding of the cable
system.



      (2)   Any remaining amount of the ten percent not budgeted for
television franchise management expenses will be available as non-ACO grants.
Access dollars not used by the city or not utilized for non-ACO grants will
remain in fund for use the following year.



   (E)   Duties of the Cable Fund Access Board.



      (1)   Annual review.



         (a)   Before the grant application process begins, the
Cable Fund Access Board will annually meet to review the way access channel
originators and non-access channel originators have used its grant funding to
enhance the quality and quantity of local public, education and government
access programming.



         (b)   The Cable Fund Access Board will annually hold a
public hearing to review how grants have been spent and to listen to
concerns, ideas or problems the public may express regarding the operations
and programming of grant recipients.



         (c)   The Cable Fund Access Board may determine that an
access channel originator is not meeting the city's criteria and may
recommend to City Council that the ACO's annual grant be reduced. The amount
of the reduction would be distributed evenly among the remaining ACOs.



         (d)   Establish and implement a review form and grading
system which fairly evaluates each grant recipient which could also be used
when considering future grant requests.

danger to the safety and health of patients.



   (B)   Prior to revocation or suspension of a certificate, a medical
audit shall be conducted by the Medical Director or his designee. If the
audit results in a recommendation that the driver, attendant or dispatcher

Medical Director may require a physical and mental examination be conducted
prior the hearing.



   (E)   In lieu of suspension or revocation, the Medical Director may

§ 112.40  RESPONSE TIME.



   (A)   A paramedic ambulance shall be on the scene of each
life-threatening emergency call as determined by the dispatcher at the time
of the call, in accordance with regulations, within eight minutes on 90% of
all calls originating within the metropolitan area shown on the map attached
hereto as Exhibit A. In areas outside the metropolitan area the best efforts
shall be made to arrive on the scene within eight minutes. For all
presumptively designated life-threatening emergencies, through notification
of the fire or police department, best efforts will be made to place a first
responder unit on the scene within four minutes.



   (B)   For each presumptively defined life-threatening emergency call
exceeding eight minutes, the ambulance authority shall provide a general
summary and the action it has taken to reduce the number of responses beyond
eight minutes in similar circumstances in its annual report.



   (C)   To provide prompt initial care, a first responder program
shall be developed by the Medical Director with the assistance of the EMS
Foundation, the ambulance authority and other agencies and parties providing
emergency care. This system shall have a goal of on-scene response within
four minutes.

the lowest figure reasonably attainable any discrepancies in response time
throughout the city and county.



   (E)   The ambulance authority shall contractually establish response
time for all non-life-threatening emergency calls, but they shall not be more
stringent than that required for life-threatening emergency calls. ('74 Code,

taken to the nearest appropriate facility for that clinical condition in
accordance with approved medical protocols, unless otherwise directed by a
base station physician.



   (B)   For all non-life-threatening emergency calls, the patient
shall be taken to the destination of the patient's choice, or in cases where
the patient is incompetent or unable to make such a judgment, the patient
shall be delivered to the destination requested by the appropriate party
acting on behalf of the patient. If no person is available to act for the
patient, he shall be delivered to the nearest available emergency receiving
facility.

   No provider ambulance may be removed from emergency service by the
operator during the times designated above without first advising and
obtaining the permission of the EMS control center. The EMS control center
shall, upon request, allow a provider ambulance to be removed from the system
unless such removal will bring the number of paramedic units remaining in the
system below the minimum necessaryto maintain the response level stated in
the system status management plan, unless unusual conditions exist which
would reasonably necessitate maintaining a higher level emergency response
capability than would normally be required at that time.

long as life or property is not endangered; or



      (4)   Disregard ordinances or regulations of the city
governing the direction of movement or turning in specified directions.



   (B)   The three latter exemptions shall apply only when such
ambulance is making use of audible and visual signals meeting the
requirements of the regulations promulgated by the Medical Director; the
exemption listed in (1) shall apply only when such ambulance is making use of
visual signals meeting those requirements.



   (C)   The exemptions do not relieve the driver from the duty to
drive with regard for the safety of all persons.



('74 Code, § 9-55)  (Ord. G-16-82, passed 7-27-82)



§ 112.45  VOLUNTEER PROVIDERS AND DISPATCHING; RULES AND REGULATIONS.



   (A)   The public utility model envisions all ambulance service to be
provided by a single operator. However, the Common Council and the county
Commissioners recognize the valuable role that volunteer ambulance providers
may play in the system. To that end, the system adopted herein shall include
a role for volunteer providers.



   (B)   (1)   The rules and regulations contained in this section
shall be in addition to those for volunteer providers adopted by the EMS
Foundation Board of Directors. No rule relating to volunteer providers
adopted by the EMS Foundation Board of Directors shall be inconsistent with
anything in this section. All volunteer providers subject to regulation in
this subchapter shall comply with all communications and dispatching
standards and with all rules and regulations as may be adopted pursuant to
this subchapter.



      (2)   All ambulance dispatching in the city and all ambulance
dispatching originating on calls from participating townships, shall be
performed by a single EMS control center, staffed by ambulance dispatchers
certified in accordance with standards set forth in appropriates rule and
regulations. The dispatchers shall monitor continuously the status of all
emergency resources available in the Allen County EMS system, and the current
demand upon those resources. All providers shall advise the EMS control
center as to the status of the providers' ambulances at all times.



      (3)   Persons answering telephone requests for ambulance
service, if such call originates from within the city or a participating
township, whether received in the Allen County Communication Center or the
city communications center, shall immediately upon discovering that the call
is requesting ambulance service in an area served by the Three Rivers EMS
system, transfer the request to the certified ambulance dispatcher at the
authorized EMS control center. This transfer should be made in such a manner
as to allow the ambulance dispatcher to talk directly with the caller, so
that the most accurate possible assessment of the situation can be made, and
so that appropriate direction can be given the caller concerning procedures
to be taken prior to arrival of the ambulance. Ambulance requests originating
from a non-participating township shall be handled entirely by the
communications center without referral to the EMS control center.
Furthermore, should the EMS control center receive an emergency call
originating within a non-participating township said call shall be referred
to the county communications center.



      (4)   In all calls originating within a participating
township, the EMS control center shall dispatch the participating volunteer
provider in that township and in addition shall dispatch such other vehicles
as deemed necessary and appropriate pursuant to this subchapter and medical
protocols.Where the dual dispatching or other dual utilization of both a
participating volunteer ambulance unit and a paramedic emergency vehicle are
involved, the following rules concerning patient transport shall apply:



         (a)   If both a paramedic ambulance and a volunteer unit
are simultaneously dispatched on a call, and if the volunteer unit arrive
first and determines, in accordance with approved medical protocols, that
paramedic service is not required, the volunteer crew shall have the right to
cancel the paramedic unit before the arrival of the paramedic unit at the
scene.



         (b)   In the event both a paramedic unit and volunteer
provider unit appear at the scene of an emergency, the volunteer crew shall
retain the right to transport the patient except if the patient, in
accordance with approved medical protocols, is defined as being in need or
likely to be in need of paramedic services, or the patient or responsible
party prefers that transport be made by the paramedic unit, or if the
volunteer crew requests that the patient be transported by the paramedic crew.



      (c)   Any request for paramedic service by a participating
volunteer crew shall be given the highest priority possible by the ambulance
dispatch center.



   (C)   (1)   The Medical Director, in consultation with the
volunteer providers' advisory council, shall recommend to the EMS Foundation
Board reasonable rules and regulations for volunteer providers. These rules
and regulations may include on-board equipment and communications standards;
provided, however, that no standard shall be imposed that would reasonably be
expected to make it financially impossible for a volunteer provider to
operate.



      (2)   The rules and regulations covering volunteer providers
may require periodic local certification of volunteer crew members, provided
that all skills, knowledge or training requirements in excess of those
required for state certification must be determined by the EMS Foundation
Board to be reasonable and practical.



      (3)   The Medical Director and EMS Foundation may require
in-service training of volunteers in the area of basic life support skill
maintenance, new procedures adopted in medical protocols, use of new
equipment which may be required on BLS ambulances, diagnosis-specific
refresher training found necessary as a result of medical audits performed
and paramedic assistance training. The amount and kind of in-service training
required of any participating volunteer shall be as is reasonably necessary
to insure and demonstrate his or her competence in performing duties. No
training requirement shall be made mandatory until such training has been
available to volunteers for a period of 60 days.



   (D)   Participating volunteer providers shall be subject to
participation in any medical audit performed on cases in which the volunteer
crew was involved. To facilitate such audit, volunteer providers shall comply
with all data system reports standards, including but not limited to the use
of standard run report forms and dispatch report forms approved by the EMS
Foundation. Failure by a volunteer provider to cooperate with a medical audit
may result in a penalty set by the Medical Director, which may include
suspension or revocation of the volunteer provider's license; provided,
however, that no volunteer provider shall be penalized because of a volunteer
crew member's inability to be present at a medical audit if such inability is
reasonably beyond the individual's control. Any physician conducting a
medical audit should use his best efforts to schedule the audit at a time and
place convenient to any volunteer(s) who may be involved.



   (E)   In townships that consent to the Authority providing emergency
medical services in that township, but which do not become participating
volunteer providers, medical and dispatch protocols shall be established
between the township and the Authority, subject to the approval of the
Medical Director, which protocols may not require the township provider to
comply with the other terms and conditions of this chapter relating to
licensing, permits, medical audits, insurance, response time, or submitting
to the jurisdiction of the Medical Director.

schedules, and such other factors to select the lowest responsible and
responsive bidder.

§ 116.73  REQUIRED EQUIPMENT AND CONDITION OF TAXICAB.



   The Board of Public Safety is hereby empowered to promulgate the rules

necessary or desirable to aid in attaining compliance with the provisions and
purposes of this chapter. The rules and regulations shall include, but shall
not be limited to, the following minimum standards:



   (A)   Taximeter.



      (1)   Every taxicab shall be equipped with a taximeter of a
make satisfactory to the Board of Public Safety. The use of any inaccurate
taximeter or other measuring instrument for the purpose of gauging or
indicating distance traveled or waiting time, for the purpose of fixing rates
to be collected from the public is hereby prohibited; it shall be the duty of
the owner or operator using any taximeter to keep said taximeter accurate.



      (2)   Every taximeter used for the purpose of gauging or
indicating distance traveled or waiting time, or for the purpose of
collection of fares for the public shall be inspected by the city Bureau of
Weights and Measures or his designee once every six months. If any meter is
found to be inaccurate, the taxicab to which it is attached shall not be
operated until such meter is properly approved and adjusted on reinspection.
When any inspection shows that a taximeter accurately records the proper fare
it shall be sealed under the direction of the inspector of Weights and
Measures of the City, or his designee, and a written certificate of
inspection shall be issued to the owner of any such taxicab. It shall be
unlawful for any unauthorized person to tamper with, break or mutilate any
taximeter or the seal thereon, with the purpose of causing such taximeter to
register any fare incorrectly or for any other purpose whatsoever. It shall
be unlawful for any person to operate a taxicab without an operating
taximeter in compliance herewith.



      (3)   Every taximeter shall be so placed in said taxicab that
the reading dial showing the amount to be charged shall be well lighted and
readily discernible by the passenger riding in such taxicab.



   (B)   Display of names and rates.



      (1)   Rate structure. The Board of Public Safety shall
promulgate rules and regulations requiring the external display of the fare
structure of the permittee's taxicabs. The display shall include:



         (a)   The distance for which the original flag drop pays;



         (b)   The rate per mile thereafter;



         (c)   The charge per minute of waiting time;



         (d)   Any surcharges added to the fare for fuel costs,
service to specific locations or during specific hours.



      (2)   Exterior information. There shall be on the outside of
each taxicab, signs, cards or plates of a durable or permanent structure,
showing the permittee's taxicab business name, taxicab permit number and
current telephone number. The taxicab business name and telephone number
shall be displayed prominently on both sides of the taxicab in accordance
with the Board of Public Safety regulations.



   (C)   Exterior conditions.



      (1)   All taxicab vehicle bodies shall conform to the general
specifications of the manufacturer.



      (2)   All exterior paint work shall be maintained in good
conditions, free of substantial scratches, chips and abrasions.



      (3)   All doors must have operating handles that allow opening
from both the inside and outside. Handles, knobs and arm rests are to be free
of breaks and must be securely mounted.



      (4)   All suspension components affecting the ride and safety
of vehicles shall be maintained such that they comply with the manufacturer's
specifications.



      (5)   All windshield and window glass shall be maintained free
from cracks, scratches, pitting, abrasions or any other condition that
reduces clarity of vision.



   (D)   Interior conditions.



      (1)   Seat covers shall be permanently attached or fixed to
the seats of the vehicle and have no exposed wire or sharp edges either from
metal or hardened vinyl. No broken springs, sagging or horizontal slippage is
allowable in either seat.



      (2)   Seat belts are to be in operating condition and easily
accessible by all passengers.



      (3)   Every operating permit holder shall ensure that the
interior of his taxicab is maintained at all times in a reasonable, clean
condition.



   (E)   Radio. All taxicabs shall be equipped with two-way radios or
comparable communication devices such that office dispatchers may immediately
and effectively notify drivers of requests for service. No taxicab permit
holder shall possess in the place of business or dispatch operation any
device used for the monitoring of a competitor's radio frequency.



   (F)   Safety equipment. All taxicabs shall be equipped with a fire
extinguisher, flares and a first aid kit. No owner shall permit the operation

§ 116.74  ADVERTISEMENT.



   (A)   It is unlawful for any public passenger vehicles licensed
pursuant to this chapter to display any advertising sign or device, except as
permitted by this section.



   (B)   Taxicab licensees may apply for permits to display advertising
on the exterior only of the vehicle. The Board of Public Safety shall
designate its Taxi Inspector to enforce and promulgate regulations specifying
the locations on the taxicab where advertising may be displayed, as well as
describing the permissible design, construction and method of affixing the
display to the vehicle and also may include additional guidelines for such
displays and the permit process. In establishing such criteria,
considerations shall include:



      (1)   Visual clutter and aesthetics on the public way;



      (2)   The safety and comfort of passengers, drivers,
pedestrians and other motorists;



      (3)   The visibility of all information required by this
chapter to be displayed on the exterior of taxicabs, including but not
limited to vehicle numbers, ownership indicia, dome light and availability
signal.



   (C)   The Taxi Inspector shall inform applicants for an advertising
display permit under this section whether the application is approved or
disapproved within 30 business days after its receipt of the completed
application, unless the Taxi Inspector gives the applicant written notice,
sent in compliance with Indiana Trial Rules, that an additional 30 days is
needed to make the determination and set forth the reasons. If the
application is approved, the Taxi Inspector shall issue an advertising
display permit. If the Taxi Inspector denies the permit application, the Taxi
Inspector shall provide written notice, sent in compliance with Indiana Trial
Rules, of the decision within such time period, stating the specific grounds
and regulations that form the basis for such denial. If the Taxi Inspector
fails to act within 30 business days after receipt of the application, or 60
business days if it has given advance notice of the need for an additional
review period, the application shall be deemed granted and the permit shall
be issued. The Taxi Inspector has the final authority to determine the type,
scope and content of the submitted advertising.



   (D)   Where the Taxi Inspector has by rule approved any type of
advertising display device that involves the installation of a physical
apparatus on the public passenger vehicle, an inspection of the initial
installation of such device is required.

expire one year after the date of issue, unless sooner surrendered, revoked
or terminated.



   (F)   No permit for exterior advertising issued pursuant to this
section shall be transferred or assigned.



   (G)   The suspension or revocation of a public passenger vehicle

§ 130.06  REAL ESTATE USED FOR ILLEGAL USE OR SALE OF NARCOTICS, CONTROLLED
DANGEROUS SUBSTANCES, GAMBLING, PROSTITUTION.



   (A)   Purpose. The Common Council of the city finds  it to be in
the  best interests of the residents of the city and the general public to
provide for the regulation of conduct it deems to be offensive, to prevent
vice, disorder and immorality; and to promote public peace, health and

gambling or prostitution.  No owner of real estate located in the city shall
knowingly allow the real estate to be used as a site for any use or sale of
illicit narcotics or controlled dangerous substances, gambling or
prostitution. For the purposes of this section, an owner of real estate is
defined as any person who, alone, jointly or severally with others, shall
have legal or equitable title or other possessory interest in any real
property on which residential, commercial or industrial improvements of any
kind or nature are located, including a purchaser under a Contract for
Conditional Sale of Real Estate commonly known as a Land Contract, and a
lessee, sub-lessee, renter, or tenant who is allowing another person to
occupy the dwelling or dwelling unit.  The definition of owner shall not
include a mortgage lien holder or other lien holder holding an interest which
secures a debt or judgement, or third party non-employees using real estate
for illicit drug activity, gambling or prostitution before or after the
company's regular business hours.



   (C)   Discrimination forbidden.  Nothing in this section shall be
construed to encourage or authorize the discrimination by lessors against any
persons based upon race, creed, religion, sex, age or national origin. 



   (D)   Reports, investigations and notices by the Police Department.



      (1)   A complaint or report of suspected  illegal activities
constituting the use or sale of narcotics or controlled substances, or
gambling, prostitution, or conduct constituting a nuisance pursuant to state
law, by tenants, occupants and/or their visitors, guests or invitees as
observed by the lessor, third persons such as other tenants of the property,
or persons residing or working in the vicinity of the property, or city
officials, and/or representatives of agencies and/or departments of the city
shall be submitted to the office of Narcotics and Vice Division of the Police
Department of the city and each such report or complaint shall be
individually logged in that office.



      (2)   Upon receipt of any report or complaint of such
suspected illegal activities on real estate premises,the Police Department
may conduct a further investigation.



      (3)   Upon completion of investigation by the Police
Department revealing that such suspected illegal activity is taking place at
a particular premises, the Police Department may send a Notice of
Investigation  to the owner of the real estate and a copy to the
tenant/occupant whose premise is the subject of the investigation, by
certified mail, return receipt requested, informing the owner that the
investigation revealed suspected illegal activity and the fact that there is
an on-going investigation.  The Notice of Investigation shall inform the
owner that it is a violation of the Fort Wayne Code for the owner of real
estate to knowingly permit its real estate to be used as a site for any use
or sale of illicit narcotics or controlled dangerous substances, gambling or
prostitution.  The Notice of Investigation shall also state that the city
may initiate enforcement proceedings against the owner of the real estate if
the suspected illegal activity does not cease.  Finally, the Notice of
Investigation shall advise that it is a defense to a proceeding to enforce
this section if the owner of real estate institutes and completes eviction
proceedings in compliance with division (F) of this section against the
person suspected of engaging in the criminal conduct giving rise to the
Notice of Investigation.    The Notice of Investigation shall further
include a request of the property owner to whom the letter is addressed to
specify in writing information concerning the existence of any Contract for
Conditional Sale of Real Estate, commonly known as a Land Contract, setting
forth the name, address, and phone number of the purchaser under the Land
Contract, and further specifying any other person who has a legal, equitable,
or possessory interest in the dwelling or dwelling unit and the pertinent
information, including, but not limited to, name, address, and phone number
with respect to those individuals.



   (E)   Effect of giving Notice of Investigation.



      (1)   If a proceeding to enforce a violation of this section
is commenced against an owner of real estate at least 30 days after the land
owner's receipt of a Notice of Investigation and within 60 days of the
owner's receipt of a Notice of Investigation, the landowner's receipt of the
Notice of Investigation creates a presumption that the landowner has
knowledge that the tenant/occupant suspected to have been engaged in illegal
activity has in fact engaged in such activity.  Therefore, under such
circumstances, the owner of real estate will bear the burden of proving by a
preponderance of the evidence that the owner lacked knowledge of the
suspected illegal behavior.



   (F)   Eviction proceedings as a defense under certain
circumstances. 



      (1)   An enforcement action against a person charged with a
violation of this section after having received a Notice of Investigation
shall be subject to an affirmative defense as set forth in subdivision (2)
below.



      (2)   The affirmative defense shall be established if the
person charged with a violation:



         (a)   Has,  within 30 days of receipt of a Notice of
Investigation instituted eviction proceedings against  the  tenant 
whose  suspected  criminal activities would otherwise give rise to
potential liability under this section;



         (b)   Has completed the eviction proceedings within 30
days of commencement of the proceedings.



      (3)   An affirmative defense shall also be available to a
person who has instituted an eviction proceeding within 30 days of receipt of
a Notice of Investigation and has completed the eviction proceeding within 60
days of the commencement of the proceedings, so long as the person initiating
the eviction proceedings does not, by requesting a continuance, failing to
appear at a hearing, or otherwise delaying the proceedings cause the eviction
proceedings to remain open for a period of more than 30 days.



   (G)   Filing of criminal charges.  Charging an ]owner of real
estate with a violation of this section shall be an adjunct to, and not
substitution for, any criminal  charges filed as  a result of
investigation  by the Police Department against occupants or tenants of that
owner's real estate premises for use or sale of illicit drugs or controlled
dangerous  substances,  gambling,  prostitution  or  conduct
constituting a nuisance pursuant to state law.



   (H)   Limited indemnification of owners of real estate.  The city
shall provide a limited indemnification to an owner of real estate located in
the city, subject to the following conditions:



      (1)   That the owner of real estate shall have received a
Notice of Investigation from the Police Department as described in division
(D).



      (2)   That the owner of real estate has instituted eviction
proceedings with 30 days of receipt of a Notice of Investigation  against a
tenant whose suspected criminal activities would otherwise give rise to
potential liability under this section.



      (3)   That the owner of real estate shall give no less that 30
days notice to the City Attorney, by certified mail, return-receipt
requested, of the trial date for any eviction proceedings and a list
containing the names and addresses of all witnesses the owner of real estate
intends to call at the hearing.



      (4)   That the City Attorney, upon receipt of the notice and
list of witnesses shall have the right to provide the owner of real estate
with the names and addresses of additional witnesses including but not
limited to witnesses from the Police Department whose presence shall be
required at the hearing on the eviction proceedings.



      (5)   All witnesses listed by either the owner of real estate
and/or the City Attorney's office shall be subpoenaed by the owner of real
estate in proper and legal fashion, and be allowed to testify.



      (6)   The tenant involved as a defendant in the eviction
proceedings shall prevail on the merits,  not by reason of procedural
irregularities but by sole reason that a court finds after trial that the
illegal activity alleged in the notice the owner of real estate had received
pursuant to division (B) of this section, did not, in fact, take place.



      (7)   The tenant institutes legal proceedings against the
owner of real estate in the form of a counter claim or separate action and
obtains a judgment for damages against the owner of real estate by reason of
the tenant having prevailed  on the merits in accordance with subdivision
(6) above.



      (8)   The owner of real estate completes whatever steps he/she
chooses to undertake to seekreview of the judgment by Motion to Correct
Errors and/or appeal.



      (9)   The limited indemnification by the city shall be
restricted solely to those damages assessed by judgment against the owner of
real estate as set out aforesaid but shall not, in any event, include any
attorney's fees incurred by the owner of real estate in connection with the
enforcement of any of the terms of this section; but will include either the
reasonable attorney's fees incurred in the defense of legal proceedings
brought by a tenant pursuant to subdivision (7) above regardless of the
outcome of the proceedings, or the provision of the legal services by the
city, at the city's option.



   (I)   Appropriation and use of collected fines.  Any fine collected
as a result of a violation of this section shall be appropriated to the
Police Department budget for the purpose of enforcing this section.

chapter establishes legislation which provides for administration and
enforcement of, and cites minimum standards for the following:



      (1)   The determination of the responsibilities of owners,
operators, and occupants of commercial, nonresidential, and mixed-use
buildings to maintain their buildings and properties.

safe and sanitary condition, free of hazards, trash and debris, infestation,
or any issues which potentially creates a health and safety concern to the
community. All exterior and site standards of this chapter shall apply
regardless of occupancy or operation of these properties.

§ 151.010  PURPOSE.



   The purpose of historic preservation and protection is to promote the
educational, cultural, economic, and general welfare of the citizens of Fort
Wayne; to insure the harmonious and orderly growth and development of the
municipality; to maintain established residential neighborhoods in danger of
having their distinctiveness destroyed; to enhance property values and
attract new residents; to ensure the viability of the traditional Downtown
area and to enhance tourism within the City of Fort Wayne; it is deemed
essential by the City of Fort Wayne that qualities relating to its history
and the harmonious outward appearance of its properties be preserved. This
purpose is advanced through the restoration and preservation of historic
areas and buildings, the construction of compatible new buildings where
appropriate, and the maintenance and insurance of compatibility in regards to
style, form, proportion, texture, and material between historic buildings and
those of contemporary design. It is the intention of the City of Fort Wayne
through this chapter to preserve and protect historic and architecturally
worthy buildings, structures, sites, monuments, streetscapes, landscapes and
neighborhoods which impart a distinct aesthetic quality to the city and serve
as visible reminders of its historic heritage.



(Ord. G-06-08, passed 6-10-08)



§ 151.011  DEFINITIONS.



   For the purposes of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context indicates or requires a different meaning. Words in the
present tense include the future tense. The singular number includes the
plural, and the plural, the singular. The word "shall" is always mandatory.

company, or a corporation, as well as an individual. Terms not defined in
this section shall have the meanings customarily assigned to them.

as the primary building but that is clearly subordinate to and serving the
primary building or use.

   ALTERATION.  A material or color change of the external architectural
features of any building, structure, or site within a local historic district.



   APPURTENANCE. Any accessory or subordinate building, object, or
structure located on the grounds of a historic building or in a local
historic district.

designed, built or used for the enclosure, shelter or protection of people,
animals, or property.

   CLASSIFICATIONS. Local historic district properties shall be classified
in one of the following categories upon designation by the Commission.



      (1)   OUTSTANDING "O".  The "O" classification means that the
property has sufficient historic or architectural significance that is
listed, or is eligible for individual listing, in the National Register of
Historic Places. Outstanding resources can be of local, state, or national
importance.



      (2)   NOTABLE "N".  A classification of "N" means that the
property does not merit the outstanding rating, but it is still above average
in its importance. A notable property may be eligible for the National
Register.



      (3)   CONTRIBUTING "C". A "C" classification means the
property is at least 40 years old, but does not meet the criteria for an "O"
or "N" classification. Such resources are important to the density or
continuity of the area's historic fabric. Contributing properties can be
listed in the National Register only as part of a multi-property historic
district.



      (4)   NON-CONTRIBUTING "NC". Property classified as "NC" is
not included in an inventory unless it is located within the boundaries of a
multi-property historic district. Such properties may be less than 50 years
old, or they may be older properties that have been altered in such a way
that they have lost their historic character, or they may be otherwise
incompatible with their historic surroundings. These properties are not
eligible for listing in the National Register.

DISTRICT STANDARDS



§ 151.030  LOCAL HISTORIC DISTRICTS.



   (A)   All recommendations for the establishment of a local historic
district shall be in the form of a written report and must be based on the
criteria outlined in this section. A recommendation for establishing a local
historic district may be initiated from either of the following two sources:



      (1)   Based on its survey, the Commission may draw and submit
local historic district maps for City Council approval.



      (2)   Owners of property in fee simple wishing to establish a
local historic district which includes their property may petition the
Commission to consider drawing and submitting a map or maps of said
property(ies) to the City Council for its approval. The Commission may
establish in its rules criteria to be met before it considers a petition.



   (B)   Commission preparation of local historic district maps. In
order to establish a local historic district, the Commission shall first
prepare a map describing the district in accordance with the following:



      (1)   The map shall be based on a survey conducted by the
Commission which identifies historic buildings, structures, and sites located
within the city.



      (2)   A district may be limited to the boundaries of a
property containing a single building, structure, object, landscape, or site
or may contain a concentration of buildings, structures, objects, landscapes,
or sites.



      (3)   The map may divide the district into primary and
secondary areas as follows:



         (a)   Primary area. The principal area of historic and
architectural significance.



         (b)   Secondary area. An area adjacent to a primary area
which has a visual relationship to the primary area and could affect the
preservation of the primary area. The purpose of designating a secondary area
is to assure its compatibility and harmony with an adjacent primary area.



   (C)   Classifications. The Commission shall classify and designate
on the map all buildings, structures, and sites within each local historic
district described on the map.  Buildings, structures, and sites shall be
classified as historic or non-historic. Historic buildings, structures, and
sites must possess identified historic or architectural merit of a degree
warranting their preservation.  The Commission shall further classify and
designate all buildings and structures within a proposed local historic
district as follows:



      (1)   Outstanding;



      (2)   Notable;



      (3)   Contributing; or



      (4)   Non-contributing.



   (D)   Criteria for designation. A local historic district shall not
be established unless the proposed map includes a building, groups of
buildings, structures, sites, objects, streetscapes, landscape or
neighborhoods which meet at least one of the following criteria:



      (1)   Are associated with the events that have made a
significant contribution to the broad patterns of our history;



      (2)   Are associated with the lives of persons significant in
our past;



      (3)   Embody the distinctive characteristics of a type,
period, or method of construction, that represent the work of a master,
possess high artistic values, or that represent a significant and
distinguishable entity whose components may lack individual distinction;
and/or



      (4)   Have yielded, or may be likely to yield, information
important to prehistory or history.



   (E)   City Council approval of local historic districts.  Before a
local historic district is established and the building classifications take
effect, the map setting forth the district's boundaries and building
classifications must be submitted to, and approved in an ordinance by, the
City Council. The procedure for doing so shall be as follows:



      (1)   The Commission shall hold a public hearing to allow
public comment. The public hearing may be held separately or in conjunction
with the meeting where action on the district is to occur. Such hearing shall
be preceded by public notice as set forth in IC 5-3-1.



      (2)   Upon receiving a favorable recommendation for local
historic district designation from the Commission, the map will be submitted
to City Council for its approval.



   (F)   Recording the fact of designation. The map establishing
boundaries of a local historic district shall be recorded in the Office of

   Historic districts established under previous ordinances shall be
subject to this chapter but in all other respects shall remain unchanged. All
established historic districts shall be shown on the city zoning map on file
in the Office of Land Use Management as noted in § 151.030(H).



(Ord. G-06-08, passed 6-10-08)



§ 151.032  CONSERVATION DISTRICTS.



   (A)   The Commission may recommend conservation district designation
for a neighborhood or area which has a distinct historic character but does
not qualify for local historic district status due to loss of integrity or
incompatible new development. To conserve remaining character and ensure
compatibility of new construction in a conservation district, a certificate
of appropriateness will be required for the following activities: the
demolition, construction, or moving of a building, accessory building, or
structure, or any addition to an existing building, accessory building, or
structure subject to view from a public way.



   (B)   A recommendation for establishing a conservation district may
be initiated from either of the following two sources:



      (1)   Based on its survey, the Commission may draw and submit
conservation district maps for City Council approval.



      (2)   Owners of property in fee simple wishing to establish a
conservation district which includes their property may petition the
Commission to consider drawing and submitting a map or maps of said
property(ies) to the City Council for its approval. The Commission may
establish in its rules criteria to be met before it considers a petition.



   (C)   Criteria for designation. All recommendations for the
establishment of a conservation district shall be in the form of a written
report and must be based on the criteria outlined in this section:



      (1)   The area must possess unifying distinctive elements of
either exterior features or built environmental characteristics that create
an identifiable setting, character, or association.



      (2)   The area must lack sufficient historical, architectural,
or cultural significance to qualify as a local historic district based on the
criteria set forth in § 151.030(D).



    (D)   City Council approval of conservation districts.  Before a
conservation district is established, the map setting forth the district's
boundaries must be submitted to, and approved in an ordinance by, the City
Council. The procedure for doing so shall be as follows:



      (1)   The Commission shall hold a public hearing to allow
public comment. The public hearing may be held separately or in conjunction
with the meeting where action on the district is to occur. Such hearing shall
be preceded by public notice as set forth in IC 5-3-1.



      (2)   Upon receiving a favorable recommendation for
conservation district designation from the Commission, the map will be
submitted to City Council for its approval.



   (E)   Recording the fact of designation. The map establishing
boundaries of a conservation district shall be recorded in the Office of the
Allen County Recorder.



   (F)   Post designation notice. All owners of property receiving
conservation district designation shall be notified by mail of the
designation within 60 days following approval by City Council.



   (G)   Location of maps. All designations shall be recorded on a map
maintained in the Office of Land Use Management.



   (H)   Future local historic district designation. Designation as a
conservation district does not preclude future designation as a local
historic district provided sufficient integrity is restored to meet the
criteria for local historic designation.



(Ord. G-06-08, passed 6-10-08)



§ 151.033  INTERIM PROTECTION.



   (A)   When submitting a map to the City Council under § 151.030 of
this chapter, the Commission may declare one or more buildings, structures,
or sites that are classified and designated as historic on the map to be
under interim protection.



   (B)   Not more than two working days after declaring a building,
structure, or site to be under interim protection under this section, the
Commission shall, by personal delivery or first class mail, provide the owner
or occupant of the building, structure or site with a written notice of the
declaration. The written notice must:



      (1)   Cite the authority of the Commission to put the
building, structure, or site under interim protection under this section;



      (2)   Explain the effect of putting the building, structure,
or site under interim protection; and



      (3)   Indicate that the interim protection is temporary.



   (C)   A building, structure, or site put under interim protection
under division (A) remains under interim protection until the map is approved
in an ordinance or rejected by the City Council.



   (D)   While a building, structure, or site is under interim
protection under this section:



      (1)   The building, structure, or site may not be demolished
or moved; and



      (2)   The exterior appearance of the building, structure, or
site may not be conspicuously changed by:



         (a)   Addition;



         (b)   Reconstruction; or



         (c)   Alteration.



   (E)   The Commission may approve a certificate of appropriateness at
any time during the period of interim protection, provided the proposed
change meets the criteria for considering effect of actions on historic
properties in § 151.034(D) of this chapter and any proposed preservation
guidelines for the building, structure, or site. However, the certificate of

thereto, unless the map including the building, structure or site is approved
by the City Council.



(Ord. G-06-08, passed 6-10-08)



§ 151.034  CERTIFICATES OF APPROPRIATENESS.



   (A)   Certificates of appropriateness (COA) required.  A
certificate of appropriateness must be issued by the Commission before a
permit is issued for, or work is begun on, any of the following:



      (1)   Within all areas of a local historic district:



         (a)   The demolition of any building or structure;



         (b)   The moving of any building or structure;



         (c)   A conspicuous change in the exterior appearance of
any historic building or structure, or any part of or appurtenance to such a
building or structure, including walls, fences, light fixtures, steps,
paving, landscaping, and signs by additions, reconstruction, alteration, or
maintenance involving exterior color change; or



         (d)   Any new construction of a principal building or
accessory building or structure subject to view from a public way.



         (e)   Conspicuous and visible changes within the public
right-of-way.

   (B)   Application for certificates of appropriateness.  An
application for a certificate of appropriateness shall be made in the office
of the Commission or its designee on forms provided by that office. All
applications shall be subject to the rules and requirements established by
the Commission. Rules may include, but are not limited to, fees, filing
deadlines and application requirements such as sketches, drawings,

to make a decision.



   (C)   Approval or denial of certificates of appropriateness.  The
Commission may approve or deny certificates of appropriateness for any
actions covered by this chapter. If an application for a certificate of

shall be issued. The Commission may grant an extension of the 30-day limit if
the applicant agrees to it. The Commission must report its findings and the
reasons for its decision in written form, and supply the applicant with a
copy of its report. A copy of the certificate of appropriateness must be
submitted with the application for a building, demolition, or improvement
location permit; no building, demolition, or improvement location permit
shall be issued unless a copy of the certificate of appropriateness is
provided by the applicant with the application.



   (D)   Criteria for considering effect of actions on locally
designated properties. The Commission, in considering the appropriateness of
any reconstruction, alteration, major maintenance, or moving of a historic
building, structure, site or any part of or appurtenance to such building or
structure, including walls, fences, light fixtures, steps, paving, and signs
shall require that such work be done in a manner that will preserve the
historical and architectural character of the building, structure, or
appurtenance. In considering historic and architectural character, the
Commission shall consider, among other things, the following:



      (1)   Purposes of this chapter;

defined in § 151.036; and



      (7)   The position of the building, structure, site or
appurtenance in relation to the public ways and to other buildings and
structures.



      (8)   A historic building may be relocated to another site
only if it is shown that preservation on its current site is infeasible.



(Ord. G-06-08, passed 6-10-08)



§ 151.035  STAFF APPROVALS.

§ 151.036  VISUAL COMPATIBILITY.



   (A)   For new construction, contemporary design, and non-historic
buildings. To preserve and encourage the integrity of historic buildings,
structures, sites, objects, streetscapes, and neighborhoods and to ensure
their compatibility with any new work, the construction of a new building or
structure, and the moving, reconstruction, alteration, color change, major
maintenance, or repair conspicuously affecting the external appearance of any
non-historic building, structure, or appurtenance within the primary area
must be generally of a design, form, proportion, mass, configuration,
building material, texture, color, and location on a lot compatible with
other buildings in the local historic district and with places to which it is
visually related.



   (B)   Criteria for considering visual compatibility within historic
primary areas.  Within the primary area of a local historic district, new
buildings, structures, and appurtenances as well as buildings, structures,
and appurtenances that are moved, reconstructed, materially altered,
repaired, or changed in color, must be visually compatible with buildings and
places to which they are visually related generally in terms of the following
visual compatibility factors:



      (1)   Height. The height of proposed buildings must be
visually compatible with buildings to which it is visually related.



      (2)   Proportion of building's front façade. The relationship
of the width of a building to the height of the front elevation must be
visually compatible with buildings to which it is visually related.



      (3)   Proportion of openings within the building.  The
relationship of the width of the windows to the height of windows in a
building must be visually compatible with buildings to which it is visually
related.



      (4)   Relationship of solids to voids in front facades.  The
relationship of solids to voids in the front facade of a building must be
visually compatible with buildings to which it is visually related.



      (5)   Rhythm of spacing of buildings on streets.  The
relationship of a building to the open space between it and adjoining
buildings must be visually compatible with buildings, and places to which it
is visually related.



      (6)   Rhythm of entrances and porch projections.  The
relationship of entrances and porch projections of a building to sidewalks
must be visually compatible with buildings, and places to which it is
visually related.



      (7)   Relationship of materials, texture, and color.  The
relationship of the materials, texture, and color of the facade of a building
must be visually compatible with buildings, and places to which it is
visually related.



      (8)   Roof shapes. The roof shape of a building must be
visually compatible with buildings, to which it is visually related.



      (9)   Wall of continuity. Appurtenances of a building or site,
such as walls, wrought iron fences, and landscape masses, and building
facades, must form cohesive walls of enclosure along the street, if necessary
to ensure visual compatibility of the building to the buildings and places to
which it is visually related.



      (10)   Scale of the building. The size of a building, and the
mass of a building in relation to open spaces, windows, door openings,
porches, and balconies must be visually compatible with the buildings and
places to which it is visually related.



      (11)   Directional expression of front elevation. A building
must be visually compatible with buildings, to which it is visually related
in its directional character, including vertical character, horizontal
character, or non-directional character.

premises of the building or structure proposed for demolition in a location
clearly visible from the street. In addition, notice must be published in a
newspaper of general local circulation at least three times before
demolition, with the first publication not more than 15 days after the
application for a permit to demolish is filed, and the final publication at
least 15 days before the date of the permit.



   (B)   The Commission may approve a certificate of appropriateness at
any time during the notice period under division (A). If the certificate of

§ 151.045  EMERGENCY DEMOLITION.



   (A)   Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the
emergency demolition of a building, structure, site or any part thereof
within a local historic district when so ordered by an agency of government
having jurisdiction thereof provided that the following actions occur first:

      (3)   If demolition is ordered, the agency issuing such an
order shall make every effort possible to secure the property or otherwise
delay demolition until the Commission can act as designated in this section.
Demolition so ordered may occur prior to Commission action only when an
immediate hazard or danger to the health and safety of persons or property
exists and no reasonable steps can be taken to afford protection to persons
or property affected.

to meet the applicable requirements established under state statute for
buildings generally so as to prevent the loss of historic material and the
deterioration of important character defining details and features.



   (B)   Ordinary repairs and maintenance.  Nothing in this section
shall be construed so as to prevent the ordinary repairs and routine
maintenance of any building, structure, or site, provided that such repairs
or routine maintenance do not result in a conspicuous change in the design,
form, proportion, mass, configuration, building material, texture, color,
location, or external visual appearance of any structure, or part thereof.
Such work may be begun and executed without a certificate of appropriateness
issued by the Historic Preservation Commission. The Commission shall review
and act upon any case where a question exists as to whether or not a specific
action is an ordinary repair or maintenance not requiring a certificate of
appropriateness.

under-utilized land or improvement or replacement of a deteriorated or
obsolete structure designated as appropriate for industrial or commercial
development which is currently zoned appropriately for industrial or
commercial use.



   (B)   The proposed use of the real estate for which designation is
being requested is consistent with the land use policies of the city.



   (C)   The designation will encourage the improvement or replacement
of a deteriorated or obsolete manufacturing equipment, or result in
significant conversion of solid waste or hazardous waste into energy or other
useful products.



   (D)   The designation will have no negative impact on the
preservation of a historically listed structure.



   (E)   The designation will assist in the inducement of a project
providing employment opportunities for Fort Wayne area residents.



   (F)   The designation will assist in the inducement of a project
which will provide long-term benefits to the tax base of the city. It is the
policy of the Common Council, therefore, that the Common Council shall denote
in the appropriate space on the Statement of Benefits Form (State Form SB-1)
as a precondition to the receipt of economic revitalization area status the
following text: "Subject to taxpayer's non-delinquent status on any and all
property tax due to taxing jurisdictions within Allen County, Indiana". In
subsequent filings by the taxpayer and/or applicant of Compliance with
Statement of Benefits Forms (State Form CF-1), taxpayer/applicant must
self-certify its non-delinquent status with all taxing jurisdictions within
Allen County, Indiana.



   (G)   For projects located in economic development target areas
standards (A) through (F) must be met. In addition to standards (A) through
(F), projects located in the downtown economic development target areas must
conform to the downtown design guidelines.



   (H)   The applicant requesting the designation has disclosed any and
all persons of interest or business entities affiliated with the project.

§ 153.17  REVIEW OF ECONOMIC REVITALIZATION AREA ELIGIBILITY BY COUNCIL.



   (A)   After review of the information provided in the application,
the Common Council may find that the real estate under consideration meets
the definition and standards of an economic revitalization area as defined in
IC 6-1.1-12.1-1(1) as amended. In such case the Common Council shall pass a
resolution declaring the area an economic revitalization area. The declaring
resolution must:



      (1)   Contain a description of the affected area.



      (2)   Note whether the application is for real property
improvements and/or personal property improvements.



      (3)   Be filed with the Allen County assessor.



      (4)   Include a determination of the period of deduction
allowed per IC 6-1.1-12.1-3(d).



   (B)   After approval of a declaratory resolution, the Common Council
shall publish notice in accordance with IC 5-3-1, as amended. The notice must
state that a description of the affected area is available and can be
inspected in the county assessor's office. The notice must also name a date
when the Common Council will hold a public hearing for the purpose of
receiving and hearing any and all remonstrances and objections from
interested persons. In addition, the Common Council shall file this
information, and a notice containing a Statement of Benefits Form with the
officers of each affected taxing unit with authority to fix budgets, tax
rates, and tax levies under IC 6-1.1-17-5, at least ten days prior to the
date of the public hearing.



   (C)   In reviewing the evidence, the Common Council shall also
review the Statement of Benefits Form. The Common Council shall determine
whether the area should be designated an economic revitalization area and/or
whether a deduction should be allowed for the project, based on (and after it
has made) the following findings:



      (1)   Whether the estimate of the value of the redevelopment
or rehabilitation is reasonable for projects of that nature and whether the
estimate of the cost of the new manufacturing equipment and/or research and
development equipment and/or logistical distribution equipment and/or
information technology equipment (if applicable) is reasonable for equipment
of that type.



      (2)   Whether the estimate of the number of individuals who
will be employed or whose employment will be retained can be reasonably
expected to result from the proposed described project, or



      (3)   If the designation is for new manufacturing equipment
used to dispose of solid waste or hazardous waste by converting the solid
waste or hazardous waste into energy or other useful products, whether the
estimate of the amount of solid waste or hazardous waste that will be
converted into energy or other useful products can be reasonably expected to
result from the installation of the new manufacturing equipment.



      (4)   Whether the estimate of the annual salaries of those
individuals who will be employed or whose employment will be retained can be
reasonably expected from the proposed described project.



      (5)   Whether any other benefits about which information was
requested are benefits that can be reasonably expected to result from the
proposed described project.



      (6)   Whether, in the case of an economic revitalization area
designation for an eligible vacant building as defined under IC
6-1.1-12.1(17):



         (a)   The estimate of the number of individuals who will
be employed or whose employment will be retained can be reasonably expected
to result from the proposed occupation of the eligible vacant building.



         (b)   The estimate of the annual salaries of those
individuals who will be employed or whose employment will be retained can be
reasonably expected to result from the proposed occupation of the eligible
vacant building.



         (c)   Any other benefits about which information was
requested are benefits that can be reasonably expected to result from the
proposed occupation of the eligible vacant building.



         (d)   The occupation of the eligible vacant building
will increase the tax base and assist in the rehabilitation of the economic
revitalization area.



      (7)   Whether the totality of benefits is sufficient to
justify the deduction.



   (D)   After considering all evidence presented, the Common Council
shall take final action to determine whether the qualifications for an
economic revitalization area have been met and to confirm, modify and
confirm, or rescind the declaratory resolution. Such action may include:



      (1)   Adoption by confirmation of the declaratory resolution.
The confirming resolution  shall include the reasons upon which the
determination is made.



      (2)   A finding that there is insufficient information and a
deferral of action on the matter. The applicant shall be provided written
notice of the reasons for deferral within ten days of that action.



      (3)   A determination that the real estate should not be
designated as an economic revitalization area. The applicant shall be
provided with written notice thereof.



   (E)   Upon confirming, or modifying and confirming a declaratory
resolution by the procedures set forth herein, both the Allen County Auditor
and the Common Council shall keep a permanent record of the designation of
the subject economic revitalization area. Common Council shall also provide
the Allen County Auditor with a final designation packet to be utilized in
the review of applications for deduction pursuant to IC 6-1.1-12.1-5.

§ 153.19  DEDUCTION PERIODS AND ABATEMENT SCHEDULES FOR REAL PROPERTY.



   In determining whether an applicant is entitled to a deduction for real
property improvement projects, the Fort Wayne Common Council shall qualify a
designation by:



   (A)   Limiting the number of years of deduction (abatement) for
improvements to real property in areas not designated as an economic
development target area to three, five, seven, or ten years, based on the
following Review System and corresponding abatement schedules:

deduction from the assessed value of the building in accordance with the
following terms and conditions:



         (a)   If the vacant building is 50 years or older, the
owner of the building shall be entitled to a deduction as long as the
building has been vacant for at least one year.



         (b)   If the vacant building is less than 50 years old,
the owner of the building shall be entitled to a deduction as long as the
building has been vacant for at least two years.



         (c)   If the vacant building is located in an Economic
Development Target Area, the owner shall be entitled to a deduction as long
as the building has been vacant for at least one year and the property is
zoned for commercial or industrial use.



      (2)   The maximum period of a deduction awarded under this
section is two years. For deductions approved for one year, the amount of the
deduction shall be 100% of the assessed value of the building or part of the
building that is occupied by the property owner or tenant of the property
owner. For deductions approved for two years, the amount of the deduction
shall be 100% of the assessed value of the building or part of the building
that is occupied by the property owner or tenant of the property owner in the
first year, and 50% of the assessed value of the building or part of the
building that is occupied by the property owner or tenant of the property
owner in the second year.



   (C)   Projects involving the redevelopment or rehabilitation of a
speculative building may receive a ten-year phased deduction (abatement)
without adhering to the city's review system. For purposes of this division,
a SPECULATIVE BUILDING is any building development, construction, or
rehabilitation of at least 50,000 square feet that is reasonably likely to
create new jobs when the developer has no formal commitment from a buyer or
tenant to purchase or lease the end product, whether the end product is a
fully completed, move-in ready building or a partially completed shell
suitable for build-out improvements by the future owner or tenant. Additional
incentives for the final build out and personal property (equipment) may be
considered upon the identification of the end user. Any additional incentives
will adhere to the city's review system for real and personal property
abatement at the time of submittal.

§ 153.21  COMPLIANCE WITH STATEMENT OF BENEFITS.



   (A)   All deduction applications filed with the Allen County Auditor
for projects designated by the Common Council as economic revitalization
areas must include a correct and complete Compliance with Statement of
Benefits Form (CF-1) as prescribed by the Indiana Department of Local
Government Finance. For designations approved after January 1, 2012,
deduction applications must also include a Public Benefit Annual Update form
provided by the city to the applicant and affirmed to its accuracy by the
applicant that provides additional employment information by occupation
classification for Allen County under current occupational employment
statistics. The Compliance with Statement of Benefits Form must be filed with
both the Allen County Auditor and the city Community Development Division
according to the filing schedule listed in IC 6-1.1-12.1-5 and IC
6-1.1-12.1-5.5, as applicable.



   (B)   Compliance with Statement of Benefit Forms filed by an
applicant must show the extent to which there has been compliance with the
Statement of Benefits Form (SB-1) approved by the Common Council in
designating the area an economic revitalization area. The Compliance with
Statement of Benefits Form must be updated per IC 6-1.1-12.1-1 et seq. The
Common Council shall monitor for substantial compliance those projects it
designates as economic revitalization areas.



   (C)   Substantial compliance has been defined by the Common Council
as:



      (1)   Meeting 75% or more of the numbers of full-time and/or
part-time jobs stated to be created or retained as delineated in the original
Statement of Benefits Form (SB-1) approved by the Common Council; and



      (2)   Meeting 75% or more of the total payroll stated to be
created or retained as delineated in the original Statement of Benefits Form
(SB-1) approved by the Common Council, within the time frame projected in the
applicant's original approved Statement of Benefits Form.



   (D)   Within 45 days after receipt of a properly filed Compliance
with Statement of Benefits Form, the Common Council will determine whether
the applicant has substantially complied with the Statement of Benefits Form
and, if not, whether the failure to substantially comply was caused by
factors beyond the control of the applicant.



   (E)   Property owners that have not substantially complied with the
terms of their original Statement of Benefits Form may have the remainder of
their tax abatement rescinded by the Common Council.



   (F)   An applicant that has received a deduction for real and/or
personal property and:



      (1)   Ceases operations at the facility for which the
deduction was granted; and



      (2)   Is found to have intentionally provided false
information concerning plans to continue operations at the facility, may be
determined by Common Council to be subject to repayment to the Allen County
Treasurer of those property taxes that were deducted per the formula given in
IC 6-1.1-12.1-12(e).

§ 153.22  AMENDING STATEMENTS OF BENEFIT.



   (A)   Amendments to Statement of Benefits Forms are required if the
designation period initially granted is insufficient to complete the project
as stated in the initial Statement of Benefits Form.



   (B)   It is the policy of the Common Council that no application
from an applicant to amend a Statement of Benefits Form will be accepted
after the expiration of the designation period stated in the confirming
resolution granting economic revitalization area status.

by affixing its signatures and seal, and the sealed plat is recorded in the
Office of the Allen County Recorder.



   (C)   No lot in a subdivision may be sold, nor shall a permit to

      (1)   ARTERIAL STREET shall refer to either of the following
types of arterial streets.



         (a)   A PRINCIPAL ARTERIAL , which is a roadway that
provides high volume, high speed travel between major points or serves the
major centers  of  activity.  A PRINCIPAL ARTERIAL can also provide
continuity for a rural arterial that intercepts urban boundaries.  A
PRINCIPAL ARTERIAL carries most of the trips entering and leaving the urban
area as well as most through movements and intra-area travel.  The system
serves primarily through traffic and provides access to abutting properties
as a secondary function.



         (b)   A MINOR ARTERIAL is a roadway system that
interconnects with and augments the principal arterial system.  The system
carries trips to geographic areas smaller than that identified with high
classifications.  All arterials not classified as  principal shall be
classified as minor arterials.

traffic circulation and land access service.  System penetrates residential,
commercial and industrial zones distributing trips from arterials through the
area to local routes or final destinations.  The system also links
neighborhoods or areas of homogeneous land use with arterials.



      (3)   LOCAL STREETS means roadways that include all facilities
not in the higher classification; they provide direct access to abutting
lands (farm, residence, business).  Through traffic movement is usually
deliberately discouraged.  Overriding consideration is to foster a safe and
pleasant environment.  The convenience of the motorist is a secondary
consideration.



   STRUCTURE.   Anything constructed or erected which requires location
on or in the ground, or attachments to something having a location on or in
the ground.



   SUBDIVIDER. The owner or the authorized agent for the owner of a
subdivision.



   SUBDIVISION.



      (1)   Any land, vacant or improved, which is divided into
three or more lots in a 12 month period; or



      (2)   The act of creating a subdivision by the division of
land into three or more lots in a 12 month period, except:



         (a)   The sale of land as a result of legal
condemnations as defined and allowed by state statutes;



         (b)   The acquisition of street right-of-way by a public
agency;



         (c)   A land transaction with an adjoining property
owner, when the transaction is clearly not for individual development, for
example, an adjustment of lot lines, and both new parcels meet the minimum
requirements of the Zoning Code.



      (3)   For the purposes of this definition, a division shall be
deemed to occur at the time that a contract of sale, conditional or
otherwise, is executed, or a deed is executed, whichever is earliest.



      (4)   Subdivisions shall include:



         (a)   A MINOR SUBDIVISION means all subdivisions of land
fronting on, and having access to an existing improved non-arterial street,
and not requiring the creation of new right-of-way, or the creation or
extension of any city water or sewer facility, and which does not exceed a
total of six lots inclusive of the original tract.  An increase in
right-of-way width shall not constitute the creation of new right-of-way.



         (b)   MAJOR SUBDIVISION means  all subdivisions
requiring new right-of-way or the creation of any public improvement, or
which front on an arterial street, and/or which does not qualify as a minor
subdivision.



   ZONING DISTRICT.   The classification of the property under the Zoning
Code.



   ZONING CODE.   Refers to the Zoning Code of the Municipal Code of the

§ 155.021  RIGHT-OF-WAY AND STREET ALIGNMENT.



   (A)   The arrangement, character, extent, width, grade, and location
of all streets shall be coordinated with existing and planned streets,
existing topography, public convenience and safety, and in their appropriate
relation to the proposed uses of the land to be served by such streets. 
Alleys shall be discouraged except where necessary.  The general location of
trees that are to be saved should be noted and considered in the original lay
out of proposed streets.



   (B)   Where a subdivision borders on or contains a railroad
right-of-way, limited access highway right-of-way, or arterial street
right-of-way, the Commission may require a street approximately parallel to
and on each side of such right-of-way at a distance suitable for the

      (2)   All existing stub streets in abutting areas shall be
continued into the proposed street system;



      (3)   Existing stub streets in abutting areas which are to be
continued and are unimproved, shall be improved by the subdivider of the
proposed subdivision.



   (F)   No more than two streets shall intersect at any one point.



   (G)   All streets shall be dedicated and improved to city standards

(Ord. G-14-93, passed 5-4-93)



§ 155.022  LOT DESIGN.



   (A)   Minimum lot width and area requirements shall conform to the
requirements of the zoning district or districts in which the property is
located.  Lot width shall be measured between side lot lines at the required
setback from the lot front.



   (B)   Every lot shall front upon and have at least the minimum
required frontage on a dedicated public street of sufficient width and
improvement as per city standards and specifications.



   (C)   The residential lot arrangement of a subdivision shall be
accomplished in such a manner that there will be no double frontages. 
However, in circumstances where the subdivision abuts an arterial street,
double frontage lots may be approved when access from the lot is only to the
interior, local street.  Where double frontage lots are allowed, the
subdivider, the subdivider's successors and assigns shall relinquish the
right of access from the lot to the arterial street and place restrictions
upon the land to run with the land relinquishing said access.



   (D)   Lots shall be numbered consecutively throughout the entire
subdivision.



   (E)   At street intersections the property or right-of-way lines of
corner lots shall be rounded at the street intersection corner with an arc

whichever is greater.  Easements shall connect with easements in adjoining
developments in the shortest direct line consistent with good engineering
practice.



   (B)   All utility easements as dedicated on the face of the plat
shall be kept free of all permanent structures and the removal of any
obstruction by a utility company shall in no way obligate the utility company
in damages or to restore the obstruction to its original form.



(Ord. G-14-93, passed 5-4-93)



§ 155.024  PUBLIC PLACES.

§ 155.025  RECREATIONAL AREAS.



   (A)   All subdivisions shall require the creation of recreational
space within the platted subdivision.  Recreational space shall be of
suitable size, dimension, topography and general character and shall have
adequate road access, for the general purposes envisioned.  The acreage
shall be determined by the Plan Commission from the following table, which
has been prepared on the basis of providing three acres ofrecreational area
for every 100 dwelling units, and may be waived if the total required
recreational space is less than 10,000 square feet.  Said ratio shall be
applied to all sections of a subdivision, and to the combination of all
sections of a subdivision.



   TABLE OF REQUIRED RECREATIONAL SPACE



If total area of plat         Total land required

      (1)   The subdivider has entered an agreement with the Fort
Wayne Department of Parks and Recreation to improve and dedicate lands and
facilities within the subdivision, or at an acceptable location not contained
within the subdivided land, for a public park, or;



      (2)   The subdivider has made acceptable  "in lieu of"
payments to the Fort Wayne Department of Parks and Recreation for deposit in
an escrow account to be used only for public park development within the
appropriate subarea of the park service jurisdiction.



   (E)   The provisions of this section are minimum standards.  None
of the divisions above shall be construed  as prohibiting a developer from
establishing other land for recreational purposes in addition to the
requirements of this section.



(Ord. G-14-93, passed 5-4-93)



§ 155.026  SUBDIVISION WITHIN FLOODPLAIN ZONES.



   (A)   No subdivision of land shall be allowed by the city within the
defined floodway.



   (B)   There shall be no subdivision of land within the defined
floodway fringe unless the following conditions are met:



      (1)   It is determined by the city after receipt of additional
hydrological or grade studies from the subdivider or appropriate federal or
state agencies that the lands to be developed are no longer subject to being
covered by flood water of a 100-year frequency flood;



      (2)   The location, grade, and flood-proofing of all proposed
utilities which are to be extended into or through any portion of the
floodplain to serve the proposed development shall first be approved by the
city, prior to the extension of such utilities into the floodplain area;



      (3)   Additional information shall be included with the
primary plat of the subdivision in compliance with the requirements and
policies of Water Pollution Control Engineering, its assigns or successor
agency:



         (a)   All hydrological and grade information which is
necessary to determine the frequency and extent that the subdivision is
subject to inundation by flood water;



         (b)   The type and extent of the proposed use or
development of the land, along with such information as is necessary to
determine the effect flood waters will have on such development and use, and
the effect that such development and use may have upon the flood waters. All
such information shall show the location of the proposed use, areas of
habitation and employment if any, included within the subdivision, size and
floor elevations of any structures, the location and elevation of parking
areas, and the location, use, and elevation of all open land areas;



         (c)   Plans and other required information conforming to
the development standards of this chapter;



         (d)   The limits of the 100-year flood plain;



         (e)   The amount of fill material brought into the
subdivision location, and the location of the borrow area.



      (4)   The raising of ground elevation shall be accomplished in
such a manner that the general flow and storage of water is not unduly
restricted or limited and will not cause flood hazards to other lands or
developments, either within the proposed subdivision or otherwise, and that
said protection shall be accomplished without creating the need of
significant public expenditure for flood control; and



      (5)   Any area within a floodplain from which fill is taken
shall be hydrologically designed and maintained to reduce the likelihood of
becoming refilled by silt.  The subdivider must make arrangements
satisfactory to the city binding successors and/or assigns, to regrade or
remove such silt as is necessary to return any area to its approved design
after flooding has occurred.  Any area from which fill is taken within a
floodplain shall be of a grade that will continue to permit adequate drainage
into the stream or watercourse.  If a water area is to be maintained within
the floodplain, consideration shall be given to the effect the water area may
have upon the flooding of both the land within the floodplain and other lands
outside of the floodplain.

§ 155.027  MODIFICATION OF REQUIREMENTS.



   (A)   The Plan Commission may vary or modify the requirements of
this chapter whenever:



      (1)   The tract to be subdivided is of such unusual size of
shape; or



      (2)   The tract is surrounded by such development or unusual
conditions; that the strict application of the requirements contained or
referenced herein would result in actual difficulties or substantial hardship
or injustice.  Any modifications shall be to allow the subdivider to develop
the property in a reasonable manner while protecting and preserving the
public welfare, interests of the city and surrounding areas and the general
intent and spirit of these regulations.



   (B)   The minimum improvement shall be required unless specifically
and individually waived by the Plan Commission or Plat Committee.  The Plan
Commission shall not approve requests for modification unless it shall make
findings of fact based upon the evidence presented to it in each specific
case that:



      (1)   Granting approval will not be detrimental to the public
health, safety, or welfare, or injurious to other properties.



      (2)   The conditions upon which the request for modification
is based are unique to the property for which the request is sought, and are
not applicable generally to other properties.



      (3)   Because of the particular physical surroundings, shape,
or topographical conditions of the specific property involved, a particular
hardship to the owner would result, as distinguished from a mere
inconvenience, if the strict letter of these regulations is carried out.



      (4)   Financial hardship does not constitute grounds for
modifications.



   (C)   The modification shall not in any way vary the regulations of
the Zoning Code or the infrastructure construction standards as adopted by
the Board of Public Works.



   (D)   The request for modification shall be submitted in writing by
the subdivider at the same time as the primary plat is filed for
consideration.  The petition shall state fully the grounds for the
application, and all of the facts relied upon by the petitioner.



   (E)   It is not within the jurisdiction of the Board of Zoning
Appeals to grant variances to the Subdivision regulations, and all such
requests must be properly filed with the Plan Commission.

Section



   158.001   Purpose



   158.002   Subdivision recreation space policies



   158.003   Procedures

   158.005   Partial dedication



   158.006   Title opinion



§ 158.001  PURPOSE.



   This chapter is enacted to ensure that future community growth does not
deplete available recreational lands; that such lands are properly located
and preserved; and to further ensure that reasonable cost of park and
recreational facilities may be most equitably apportioned on the basis of the
additional burdens created by such subdivision developments.



(Ord. G-01-94, passed 1-11-94)



§ 158.002  SUBDIVISION RECREATION SPACE POLICIES.



   (A)   In order to satisfy the Subdivision Control Ordinance, the
developer may donate and dedicate grounds for public park development, may
establish private recreational facilities, or may pay appropriate in lieu of
fees.



      (1)   Private recreational facilities. The Fort Wayne Parks
and Recreation Department shall review and make a recommendation on all
private recreational facilities established through the subdivision
procedure.  Facilities may include active or passive uses, and shall be
coordinated with existing or proposed recreational areas.  Criteria used for
review shall be the current policies and practices of the Fort Wayne Parks
and Recreation Department.



      (2)   Park land donation and dedication. The developer may
donate and dedicate recreational areas and facilities within the subdivision,
or at acceptable location not contained within the subdivided land, for a
public park.  The Fort Wayne Parks and Recreation Department shall reserve
the right of acceptance and shall base such acceptance on current policies
and practices.



      (3)   In lieu of payment.  Where dedication of land is not
compatible with the general subdivision plan of the developer or the Park
Master Plan, the developer shall make in lieu of payments to the Fort Wayne
Parks and Recreation Department.  In this event, the developer shall pay to
the Board of Park Commissioners a cash payment as hereinafter determined
which shall be used solely for the acquisition and/or development of park and
recreational developments in the appropriate subarea of the park service
jurisdiction.



         (a)   Method of payment. The payment in lieu of land
shall be based on the average land value per acre of the acreage of land in
the development that otherwise would have been dedicated.  For purposes of
this section, average value per acre shall be determined by the following
method:  The developer will disclose to the Board of Park Commissioners the
pre-development purchase price or appraisal for said land.  The purchase
price or appraisal will then be used to determine the proportionate value of
the dedication of land required, as determined in § 155.0450 of the
Subdivision Control Ordinance not to exceed a maximum of $200 per lot.



         (b)   Criteria for requiring dedication and payment in
lieu of.  There may be situations when a combination of land dedication and
a contribution in lieu of land are both advisable.  These occasions will
arise when:



            1.   Only a portion of the land to be developed is
proposed as the location for a park site.  That portion of the land within
the subdivision falling within the park location shall be dedicated as a site
as aforesaid and a payment in lieu of shall be accepted for any additional
land that would have to be dedicated.



            2.   A major part of the local park or
recreational site has already been acquired and  only a small portion of
land is needed from the development to complete the site.  The remaining
portions shall be required by dedication, and a payment in-lieu-thereof may
be accepted.



      (4)   Special fund.  All payment in lieu of park land
dedication collected by the Board of Park Commissioners shall be deposited in
a special non-reverting fund to be known and designated as "special fund for
the acquisition and development of park and recreational facilities" and such
funds shall be used for public park development in the appropriate subarea of
the park service jurisdiction.  Any and all interest accumulated upon such
funds shall be added to the special fund and be used only for acquisition and
development of parks and recreational areas in the appropriate subarea as
determined from time to time by the Board of Park Commissioners.



(Ord. G-01-94, passed 1-11-94)



§ 158.003  PROCEDURES.



   (A)   If a pre-application conference for plat submittal is held,
the Community and Economic Development staff (C&ED), the developer, and a
representative from the Parks and Recreation Board, if applicable, shall
review the requirements for park land dedication, the plan for parks as
contained in the Master Plan, and criteria and standards as described in the
subdivision regulations.



   (B)   Primary plat. At the time of filing a primary plat with the
Plan Commission, the owner or developer of the property shall, as part of
such filing, indicate which of the three options he wishes to use to address
the recreational area requirements.  If the subdivider desires to dedicate
land for this purpose, the area shall be designated on the primary plat as
submitted.



   (C)   Review and recommendation by the Parks and Recreation planning
staff.  When the primary plat is received which proposes the dedication of
park land, a copy of said plat shall be forwarded to the Parks and Recreation
planning staff.  Upon receipt of said plat, the Parks and Recreation staff
shall review the same and make recommendations and suggestions thereon with
regard to placement, size, design, location of said park or recreational
area, topography, and access.  Within two weeks after receipt of a copy of
said plat, the Parks and Recreation staff shall forward recommendations to
the Division of Community and Economic Development.



   (D)   Pre-requisites for approval of final plat. Where a dedication
is required it shall be accomplished by providing the Board of Park
Commissioners with a properly executed warranty deed, dedicating the required
land to the Board without cost to the Board.



   (E)   In lieu of payment procedures. If the developer requests to
make a cash contribution in lieu of dedication, he must so advise the Board
of Park Commissioners which will then determine the amount of such
contribution, based on the recreational space requirement ratio established
in Section 155.0450 of the Subdivision Control Ordinance.  Where fee in lieu
of dedication is accepted, the same shall be paid in the manner hereinafter
set forth:



      (1)   By payment to the Board, prior to approval of the final
plat.



      (2)   Alternative form of payment approved by the Board.



   (F)   Development of dedicated area.  It shall be the duty of the
Park and Recreation Board to properly develop and maintain the dedicated
areas for park and recreation purposes.



(Ord. G-01-94, passed 1-11-94)



§ 158.004  APPLICABILITY TO EXISTING SUBDIVISIONS OR DEVELOPMENTS.



   The requirements of this chapter shall not be applicable to existing
subdivisions or plats where primary approval has been granted prior to
October 1, 1993.

§ 158.005  PARTIAL DEDICATION.



   (A)   The percentage of park land dedication required under Section
155.0450 of the Subdivision Control Ordinance shall be determined at the time
of the submission of the primary plat.



   (B)   If the secondary plat submitted for approval represents only a
portion or a part of the approved primary plat, the secondary plat shall not
be accepted until the developer shall deliver to the Board of Park
Commissioners a warranty deed to the parcel of land dedicated, pursuant to
the primary plat; or in-lieu-thereof, shall make in lieu of payments based
upon the secondary plat.



   (C)   Any remaining secondary plat submitted shall be in substantial
compliance with the approved primary plat.  Any land conveyed by the
developer within the approved primary plat shall be subject to these
provisions.



   (D)   No additional land shall be required for park site purposes
from the developer upon submission of subsequent partial secondary plats in
excess of that which was required in the primary plat; provided, however,
that nothing in this section shall be deemed to prevent the Board, C&ED, and
the owner, at a later time, from altering the placement, size, design or
location of the proposed park, due to a change of circumstances since the
approval of the primary plat. No changes shall be made, however, without an
agreement on the part of the developer, C&ED and the Board of Park
Commissioners.



(Ord. G-01-94, passed 1-11-94)



§ 158.006  TITLE OPINION.

(F) Interpretation of Zoning Maps
If there is uncertainty or conflict with regard to the location of a zoning district boundary, the Zoning Administrator shall determine the correct boundary location, in accordance with the following:
(1) It is intended that zoning district boundary lines follow the boundary survey perimeter lot lines or the legal description submitted as a part of an approved zoning map amendment;
(2) If no survey or legal description exists then the zoning district boundary lines are intended to follow lot lines; the centerline of any alley, street, or road right-of-way; or the centerline of any ditch, drain, river, stream, or other watercourse;
(3) If a zoning district boundary line divides a lot, the location of the boundary line shall be determined by measurement, based on the scale of the zoning map; and
(4) The Zoning Administrator may also consider existing or previous land use(s) on a lot in making such a determination.
§ 157.202 PERMITTED USES
The following uses shall be permitted as set forth in the specified zoning districts in the following sections. Land uses similar to those listed as permitted in a district, but not specifically mentioned in these sections may be permitted with the approval of the Zoning Administrator, based in part of the purpose of the applicable zoning district. However, in the absence of a determination by the Zoning Administrator that a non-mentioned use is permitted, no land shall be used for any purpose other than a use specified herein. All development proposals shall be subject to the applicable review and approval procedures as set forth in §157.301 (Development Plans), §157.302 (Site Plan Review), and §157.503(B) (Improvement Location Permit).

§ 157.218 DC DOWNTOWN CORE
(A) Purpose
The Downtown Core district is intended to recognize downtown Fort Wayne as the heart of the City and the regional economic and cultural hub for Northeast Indiana. This area should also serve as a hub for different forms of mass transit. This district is intended to be the City’s highest density district consisting of multiple story buildings with mid- to high-rise buildings being common. The district is intended to provide for a pedestrian oriented mixture of cultural, entertainment, governmental, institutional, office, personal service, recreational, residential, retail, restaurant, and similar uses along with the provision of public parks and other gathering spaces. Development following the recommendations of the Fort Wayne Downtown Design Standards and other adopted plans for the downtown area should be encouraged. The development pattern in the district should serve to promote an active, attractive and pedestrian friendly environment while maintaining the unique and historic character of the downtown. In order to promote and maintain a dense urban development pattern, certain characteristics typically associated with less dense development such as minimum building setbacks and single story buildings should be discouraged. Parking is not intended to be provided for each use on-site, but rather is to be provided through on-street parking and parking garages that serve multiple buildings.

Zoning Districts 117 DE Downtown Edge
§ 157.219 DE DOWNTOWN EDGE
(A) Purpose
The Downtown Edge district is intended to provide for a transition from the high density mixed use development within the Fort Wayne core downtown to the traditional urban residential neighborhoods that surround the downtown. The district is intended for a lower density development pattern than the DC district, but is still meant for predominately multiple story structures (typically between 2 and 6 stories). Like the DC district, this district is intended to provide for a pedestrian oriented mixture of cultural, entertainment, governmental, institutional, office, personal service, recreational, residential, restaurant, retail, and similar uses along with the provision of public parks and other gathering spaces. This district is also uniquely intended to provide opportunities for artist studios, live/work space, small offices, and other creative uses. Special attention should be paid to the primary corridors in this district as they serve as the gateways to the central downtown. Development following the recommendations of the Fort Wayne Downtown Design Standards and any adopted plans for the downtown area should be encouraged.

Chapter 157 – Zoning Ordinance 10/10/2019 § 157.220
Zoning Districts 127 UC Urban Corridor
§ 157.220 UC URBAN CORRIDOR
(A) Purpose
The Urban Corridor district is intended to recognize that certain commercial corridors have special importance to the community because of their collective, cohesive identity, historic character, urban development patterns, relationship to the surrounding neighborhood, pedestrian oriented streetscapes, and distinct urban architecture and form. In keeping with this intent, the UC district should allow for and encourage mixed uses with a focus on neighborhood oriented commercial and personal service uses at the street level. New development is encouraged to be compatible with the existing historic development patterns by locating buildings close to the street in order to enhance pedestrian activity along the corridor. New residential development is encouraged to locate on the upper floors of new and existing commercial structures. Parking standards in these areas should accommodate historic development patterns which typically allow for on-street parking, the use of alleys to access parking areas behind buildings as well as access to public transit routes and alternative transportation modes. Urban Corridor districts should generally be located along arterial streets in neighborhoods surrounding the core of the City. Examples of these streets would include, but not be limited to, portions of Broadway, Calhoun Street, West Main Street, Pontiac Street, East State Street, and Wells Street.
(B) Permitted Uses

§ 157.222 I1 LIMITED INDUSTRIAL
(A) Purpose
The Limited Industrial district is intended to provide areas in which goods are produced for direct consumption by consumers. Limited industrial uses typically involve final assembly of goods produced from prepared materials, finished products or parts; distribution of finished goods; low intensity industrial or manufacturing operations; or wholesale and/or storage activities. The I1 district may serve as a buffer between heavier industrial districts and business or residential districts.
(B) Permitted Uses
A limited industrial use creates minimal impacts outside of the buildings and includes limited outdoor storage. The following uses are permitted as a matter of right in an I1 district. Outdoor display area shall be limited to a maximum of 10% of the primary structure or tenant space. Outdoor storage shall only be permitted between the rear of the building and the rear lot line, up to the square footage of the primary structure, and shall be screened from adjacent residential zoning and public street rights-of-way.

§ 157.224 I3 INTENSIVE INDUSTRIAL
(A) Purpose
The Intensive Industrial district is intended to provide areas for intense industrial uses such as fabricating, manufacturing, processing, extraction, heavy repair and dismantling industries where outside operations and storage areas may be required. Due to the nature of these industries, districts are typically located away from residential areas and districts. I3 districts should be buffered by less intensive industrial or commercial districts to minimize adverse impacts on surrounding land uses.
(B) Permitted Uses
The following uses are permitted as a matter of right in an I3 district. Except for automobile, boat, and similar vehicle sales uses, outdoor display shall meet the building setback standards; display area shall be limited to a maximum of 10% of the primary structure or tenant space; outdoor storage shall be allowed between the required front setback line and the rear lot line and shall be screened from adjacent residential zoning districts and public street rights-of-way.

(ii) In the DC and DE districts, the Plan Commission shall also determine that the application is consistent with the provisions of §157.404 (Development Design Standards and Requirements) and the recommendations of the Downtown Design Manual and Design Review Committee.
(b) Deferral
The Commission may also defer action on the proposed Primary Development Plan if it needs more information or time to determine if the Development Plan is eligible for approval. In deferring action on a Primary Development Plan, the Commission shall notify the applicant in writing of the reasons for the deferral, in accordance with the rules of the Commission. If the reason for the deferral is a Commission determination that the application cannot be approved until specific changes are made or additional information is submitted by the applicant, the applicant shall have twenty-one (21) days to submit corrected materials or additional information (or other specific period of time, up to sixty (60) days, as established by the Commission at the time of deferral). If the corrected materials or additional information is not submitted within the Commission’s established period of time, the Commission may deny the application.

LANDSCAPE STANDARDS § 157.408
(A) Purpose
The purpose of this section is to establish standards to provide adequate landscaping and screening and buffering between buildings, structures, parking areas, driveways, and outdoor activity areas and adjacent uses, structures, and streets. The objectives of these standards are to promote compatibility between different land uses; conserve energy and moderate the effects of sun and wind; decrease storm water runoff and erosion; conserve or enhance property values; and improve the appearance of individual developments.
(B) Applicability
(1) The requirements in this §157.408 shall apply to all requests for approval of a Primary or Secondary Development Plan, Site Plan Review, certain Improvement Location Permits (including permits for new outdoor activity areas), and Public Works parking lot permits, except that only the exterior area landscape standards shall apply in the DC, DE, and UC districts.
(2) These standards shall also apply to the creation of a nonresidential outlot from an existing parking area.
(3) The Board of Zoning Appeals and Hearing Officer may also consider and use these standards as conditions for the approval of applications.
(4) If this §157.408 requires screening and buffering between two adjacent properties, and an existing property already contains screening and buffering that satisfies the applicable screening and buffering standards, a new development or use on the adjacent parcel is not required to install additional landscaping or screening.
(5) If there are multiple screening or buffering standards in the same area (for example, both a building and a parking area, or a building and an outdoor activity area are adjacent to a residential district), the standard for the item that is closest to the adjacent property shall apply.
(6) New outdoor eating/drinking/smoking areas shall always provide a solid fence to screen the area from any adjacent residential district.
(C) Landscape Plan
A landscape plan shall be submitted to show conformance with this §157.408. The plan shall be prepared by an individual knowledgeable of plant materials, landscape and site design, construction processes, and growing conditions in this region (USDA Zone 5) and shall be in a format and with supporting information as established by the Plan Commission.
(D) Standards and Requirements
(1) General Standards and Requirements
(a) Preservation of Existing Trees
The location of existing significant individual trees and tree masses should be considered by the applicant in the planning and design of site development, and locations should be avoided and trees preserved where possible. Existing trees and other existing vegetation may be used to meet the requirements of this §157.408. Existing trees intended to be preserved in order to meet the requirements of this section shall be protected during the construction of the project through the erection of a fence around the drip line of the tree.

(b) Location of Screening and Buffering Materials
Screening and buffering materials may be located either on the lot line, adjoining or within a parking area, or adjoining a building; however, screening and buffering plants and fencing may be located within a utility easement only if there is no conflict created with either existing or proposed utility facilities.
(c) Parking Area Landscape Standards Applicability
The edge buffering requirements §157.408(D)(2) and the interior parking lot landscaping requirements in §157.408(E) shall be applicable to the following:

(h) Use of Sign Removal Credits
(i) An application for Sign Removal Credits shall be submitted no later than six (6) months after the sign removal is completed.
(ii) The entire sign and any supporting structure(s) shall be removed prior to the issuance of any Sign Removal Credits. The owner of the sign being removed shall have the burden of documenting the location and area of the sign face prior to removal. For registered signs, the size of the sign removed shall be determined by the square footage of the sign as shown on the registration certificate. For non-registered signs, the sign size shall be determined by information submitted by the applicant. DPS staff may also use the permit issued for erection of the sign, or other existing sign data to determine the size of any removed signs. Sign Removal Credits evidenced by a certificate issued by DPS are transferable between parties through a written instrument signed by both the seller and buyer of the credit. The buyer of a Sign Removal Credit is responsible for notifying DPS of any sign credit transfer. Upon request and presentation of evidence of the

AIRPORT OVERLAY DISTRICTS § 157.411
(A) Purpose
The purpose and intent of the Airport Overlay Districts (AODs) is to:
(1) Promote the public health, safety, convenience, and general welfare of the residents surrounding the Fort Wayne International Airport (FWA) and Smith Field Airport (SMD); and
(2) Protect the approaches to each airport and surrounding airspace from encroachment and limit the exposure of impacts to persons, property, and facilities in proximity to each airport, located within the areas encompassed by each AOD.
(3) Protect state, federal, and local investment in FWA and SMD and surrounding facilities;
(4) Impose land use controls, which shall be in addition to the existing underlying zoning classifications, to maintain a compatible relationship between airport operations and existing and future land uses within each AOD as defined in §157.411(D)(1);
(5) Regulate and restrict the height of structures and objects of natural growth, concentrations of people (density), visual obstructions (such as dust, smoke, and steam), electrical navigational interference, noise sensitive land uses, and wildlife and bird attractants;
(6) Implement recommendations developed in the Fort Wayne International Airport Master Plan and the Smith Field Airport Master Plan;
(7) Promote compatible land uses while respecting the physical characteristics of the area, each airport, and surrounding property;
(8) Regulate and restrict building sites, placement of structures, and land uses by separating conflicting land uses and prohibiting certain land uses that would be detrimental to airport operations, navigable airspace; and
(9) Provide a uniform basis for the implementation and administration of sound airport protection regulations for all areas within each AOD;
(B) Jurisdiction
The jurisdiction of the AOD for each airport shall extend over all lands and water within the jurisdictional boundary as defined in §157.411(D)(1) shown in Figure 1 (Smith Field Airport Overlay Areas map) and Figure 2 (Fort Wayne International Airport Overlay Areas map), as those boundaries now exist and as they are amended in the future.
(C) Applicability
The Airport Overlay District regulations of the AODs shall apply to:
(1) All properties within the two (2) mile buffer area around Smith Field Airport (Areas 1, 2, 3, and 4);
(2) To all properties within the six (6) mile area buffer around Fort Wayne International Airport (Areas 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5); and
(3) To all properties within the four Area 6 areas in the 10 mile buffer area around Fort Wayne International Airport.

Chapter 157 – Zoning Ordinance 10/10/2019 § 157.411
Additional General Standards 262 Airport Overlay Districts
(D) Areas to be Regulated
(1) Airport Overlay Areas
The Fort Wayne International Airport AOD and the Smith Field AOD have specific Airport Overlay Areas (AOAs) within each which correspond to the nature of the aircraft operations at FWA and SMD, respectively. All FWA and SMD AOAs established by this ordinance are shown on Figure 1 (Smith Field Airport Overlay Areas map) and Figure 2 (Fort Wayne International Airport Overlay Areas map) on file in the office of the Department of Planning Services (DPS). No land use shall be allowed nor shall any building or structure constructed, altered, located, or permitted which creates hazards for aircraft, airport operational and aircraft overflight areas for FWA and SMD, as well as nearby properties. For the purposes of this ordinance, the areas of Fort Wayne and Allen County under the jurisdiction of the AODs are hereby divided into the areas below as shown in Figure 1 and Figure 2. The FWA AOD includes AOAs 1 through 6. The SMD AOD includes AOAs 1 through 4. Table 1 and Table 2 provide the general dimensions for the various FAR Part 77 Surfaces as well as the Runway Protection Zones (RPZs) that are used to generate the AOAs.
Four buffer areas are used to describe the AOAs. Each buffer was generated by overlapping circles measured from each existing and future runway end to create essentially oblong areas that are based upon several dimensions of radii. SMD uses a two (2) mile radius buffer area to create its AOAs. FWA uses three (3), six (6), and ten (10) mile radius buffer areas to create its AOAs.
(a) Area 1 (Inner Safety Area)
The area of all airport runways, the area off the end of each runway (including the RPZs) and the area within each runway approach, out to the inner edge of the Conical Surface.
(i) Area 1A (Runway Protection Zone)
The trapezoidal area located directly off the end of each existing or proposed runway that is established by the FAA. Additional requirements for development within this subset of Area 1 are listed in §157.411(E)(1).
(b) Area 2 (Horizontal Area)
The area outside of Area 1, out to the inner edge of the Conical Surface. This area closely reflects the Horizontal Surface of the Part 77 Surfaces.
(c) Area 3 (Outer Conical Area)
The area between the outer edge of Area 2 and the three (3) mile buffer (for FWA) or the two (2) mile buffer (for SMD), not including the Outer Approach Area (Area 4). This area generally includes the Conical Surface of the Part 77 Surfaces.
(d) Area 4 (Outer Approach Area)
The area within each airport approach, out to the six (6) mile buffer (for FWA) or to the two (2) mile buffer (for SMD). It begins at the inner edge of the conical surface and extends to the respective buffers.

(e) Area 5 (Extended Conical Area)
Area 5 applies only to the FWA AOD. This area includes the area between the three (3) mile buffer and the six (6) mile buffer, outside of the Outer Approach Area (Area 4).
(f) Area 6 (Extended Approach Area)
Area 6 applies only to the FWA AOD. This area includes the outermost area of the runway approaches, out to the ten (10) mile buffer, beginning at the six (6) mile buffer, based upon the FAR Part 77 Approach Surfaces.

(2) Compliance
Any development or use within the areas regulated by an AOD shall be in compliance with the terms of this ordinance, and other applicable local, state and federal regulations.
(a) Any existing use in an AOD will be permitted to remain, unless an expansion, reconstruction or change in use is requested; at which time, the use will be subject to §157.411(E) (General Development and Land Use Requirements).
(b) Any future use of property in an AOD shall comply with §157.411(E) (General Development and Land Use Requirements).
(c) Any future use or development of property included in Table 3 of this section or otherwise not permitted by this ordinance shall be prohibited (even if the use is permitted in the existing underlying zoning district) unless the proposed development is in compliance with the criteria in §157.411(E) (General Development and Land Use Requirements) or is reviewed through the Airport Determination process, and the Board of Zoning Appeals approves a special use or other approval for the use or development.
(3) Abrogation and Greater Restrictions
The AODs are not intended to repeal, abrogate, annul, impair, or interfere with any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, wherever an AOD imposes greater restrictions, the provisions of the AOD shall govern. The establishment of the AODs shall not preclude the Airport Authority from pursuing additional actions per IC 8-22-3-14, which allows for the provision of free air space for the safe descent and ascent of aircraft and for the proper and safe use of an airport or landing field acquired or maintained under said chapter.
(4) Warning and Disclaimer of Liability
The degree of protection provided by the AODs relative to aircraft operation and aircraft overflights is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes. This ordinance does not imply that land uses within the vicinity of FWA and SMD will be free from aircraft noise impacts, aircraft operations, and aircraft overflights. Nor does this ordinance create liability on the part of, or a cause of action against, FWA, SMD, the City of Fort Wayne, Allen County, or any officer or employee thereof, for incidents that may result from reliance on this ordinance.
(E) General Development and Land Use Requirements
(1) If the height of any proposed buildings or structures exceed 40 feet in Areas 1, 2, and 4, 75 feet in Areas 3, 5, and 6; or if the building or structure is located in Area 1A, the building or structure shall require review by Airport Authority staff through the Airport Determination process; the building or structure may also require the submittal of an FAA 7460-1 form and receipt of an Indiana Tall Structure Permit, before the issuance of an Improvement Location Permit.
(2) All proposed site lighting fixtures shall be concealed or shielded with an Illuminations Engineering Society of North America (IESNA) full cutoff style fixture with an angle not exceeding 90 degrees to minimize the potential for glare and unnecessary diffusion on adjacent property.
(3) In Areas 1, 2, 3, and 4, no new pond or similar permanent water body shall be permitted unless a wildlife mitigation plan has been approved or determined to be unnecessary by the Fort Wayne Airport Authority staff.
FORT WAYNE ZONING ORDINANCE

The ADL shall be forwarded to the Board of Zoning Appeals, Plan Commission, or Zoning Administrator as applicable for consideration as part of the appropriate decision-making process.
(2) If the request is for a future use (i.e. new development, or change in existing use), Table 3 (Airport Overlay District Special Uses) and the other permitted use provisions of this ordinance shall be referenced to determine whether the use is a permitted use based upon its location in one of the Airport Overlay Areas.
(a) If the use is determined to be permitted and complies with §157.411(E), the request may be approved by DPS staff;
(b) If the use is determined to be a permitted use but the request does not comply with §157.411(E), the applicant owner shall meet with Airport Authority staff to discuss and address compatibility issues. The airport will issue an Airport Determination Letter (ADL) with a recommendation of support or denial of the request. The ADL shall be forwarded to the Board of Zoning Appeals, Plan Commission, or Zoning Administrator as applicable for consideration as part of the appropriate decision-making process.
(c) If the use is determined to not be a permitted use, the proposed development shall not be permitted unless a special use or other approval is granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals. If a special use or other BZA approval request is filed, the property owner shall meet with airport staff for review and coordination to address compatibility issues prior to the BZA public hearing on the request. The airport will issue an ADL that either supports or denies the development. The ADL will be forwarded to the BZA for use in making its decision. This process shall apply to all contingent use, special use, use variance, and height development standards variance requests to the Board of Zoning Appeals for property within an Airport Overlay Area.
(3) For all requested buildings, structures, or uses that require an Airport Determination Letter (ADL), the request shall be evaluated based on the:
(a) Likelihood to create a significant concentration of people (density and intensity);
(b) Likelihood to create visual obstructions through the creation of smoke, steam, dust, lighting or other obstruction(s) that would adversely affect aircraft operational areas and airspace; and specifically the proximity to the ends of runways, runway surfaces and extended runway centerlines;
(c) Likelihood for noise sensitivity; when necessary, building construction methods that reduces airport-related noises may be recommended or required;
(d) Likelihood to attract wildlife with water bodies; when necessary, methods for designing water bodies to drain within 48 hours, putting water detention underground, landscaping, and other mitigation techniques to discourage entry and exit to the water body maybe recommended or required. The airport shall have the right to include deed restrictions or restrictive covenants to authorize airport to manage/mitigate wildlife issues, which will be at the property owner’s expense;
(e) Likelihood to create wildlife attractants other than bodies of water;
(f) Proposed storage of flammable or hazardous materials as defined by the International Building Code;

Notes: (1) At ordinance adoption, FWA had three runways - Runway 5/23, Runway 14/32, and Runway 9/27; however FWA’s Airport Layout Plan (ALP) shows an ultimate plan to construct a fourth runway – Runway 5R/23L which would have a precision approach on both runway ends. Therefore in order to protect the airspace for precision approaches to both ends of the future runway, the Airport Overlay Areas (specifically Area 4 and Area 6) incorporate the additional area that will become part of the precision approaches for Runway 5R/23L in the future.
(2) At ordinance adoption, Runway 14 at FWA had a non-precision approach, however it is a goal of the airport administration to establish a precision approach for this runway in the future; therefore in order to protect the airspace for this anticipated approach, the Airport Overlay Areas (specifically Area 4 and Area 6) incorporate the additional area that will become part of the precision approach for Runway 14 in the future.

Additional General Standards 273 Floodplain
FLOODPLAIN § 157.412
(A) Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact, Purpose, and Objectives
(1) Statutory Authorization
The Indiana Legislature has in IC 36-7-4 granted the power to local government units to control land within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the City of Fort Wayne does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations.
(2) Findings of Fact
(a) The flood hazard areas of the City of Fort Wayne are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare.
(b) These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which are inadequately elevated, inadequately flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from flood damages.
(3) Statement of Purpose
It is the purpose of this section to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to:
(a) Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities.
(b) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction.
(c) Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters.
(d) Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase erosion or flood damage.
(e) Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
(f) Make federal flood insurance available for structures and their contents in the City by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program.
(4) Objectives
The objectives of this section are:
(a) To protect human life and health.
(b) To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects.
(c) To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public.
(d) To minimize prolonged business interruptions.
FORT WAYNE ZONING ORDINANCE
Chapter 157 – Zoning Ordinance 10/10/2019 § 157.412
Additional General Standards 274 Floodplain
(e) To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in floodplains.
(f) To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas.
(B) Definitions
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this section its most reasonable application. The definitions listed below shall only apply to this section.
A Zone
Portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is runoff from rainfall, snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A zones, floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are usually not a significant threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE, Zones A1-A30, Zone AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone A99 on a FIRM. The definitions are presented below:
Zone A: Areas subject to inundation by the one-percent annual chance flood event. Because detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base flood elevation or depths are shown.
Zone AE and A1-A30: Areas subject to inundation by the one-percent annual chance flood event determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are shown within these zones. (Zone AE is on new and revised maps in place of Zones A1-A30.)
Zone AO: Areas subject to inundation by one-percent annual chance shallow flooding (usually sheet flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone.
Zone AH: Areas subject to inundation by one-percent annual chance shallow flooding (usually areas of ponding) where average depths are between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone.
Zone AR: Areas that result from the decertification of a previously accredited flood protection system that is determined to be in the process of being restored to provide base flood protection.
Zone A99: Areas subject to inundation by the one-percent annual chance flood event, but which will ultimately be protected upon completion of an under-construction Federal flood protection system. These are areas of special flood hazard where enough progress has been made on the construction of a protection system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it complete for insurance rating purposes. Zone A99 may only be used when the flood protection system has reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base flood elevations or depths are shown.
Accessory Structure (Appurtenant Structure)
A structure with a floor area 400 square feet or less that is located on the same parcel of property as the principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure. Accessory structures should constitute a minimal initial investment, may not be used for human habitation, and be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of accessory structures are detached garages, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds.

Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM)
An official map of a community, on which FEMA has delineated both the areas of special flood hazard and the risk premium zones applicable to the community.
Flood Insurance Study (FIS)
The official hydraulic and hydrologic report provided by FEMA. The report contains flood profiles, as well as the FIRM, FBFM (where applicable), and the water surface elevation of the base flood.
Flood Prone Area
Any land area acknowledged by a community as being susceptible to inundation by water from any source. (See “Flood”)
Flood Protection Grade (FPG)
The elevation of the regulatory flood plus two feet at any given location in the SFHA (see “Freeboard”).

Floodplain Management
The operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans.
Floodplain Management Regulations
This section and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances, and other applications of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state, or local regulations in any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. Floodplain management regulations are also referred to as floodplain regulations, floodplain ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, and floodplainmanagement requirements.
Floodproofing (Dry Floodproofing)
A method of protecting a structure that ensures that the structure, together with attendant utilities and sanitary facilities, is watertight to the floodproofed design elevation with walls that are substantially impermeable to the passage of water.

Hardship (as Related to Variances of This Section)
The exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The City of Fort Wayne Board of Zoning Appeals requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is NOT exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one’s neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended.

Regulatory Flood
A flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year, as calculated by a method and procedure that is acceptable to and approved by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The regulatory flood elevation at any location is as defined in this section (§157.412). The "Regulatory Flood" is also known by the term "Base Flood”, “One-Percent Annual Chance Flood”, and “100-Year Flood”.
Repetitive loss
Flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a 10-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equaled or exceeded 25% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.

Section 1316
That section of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, which states that no new flood insurance coverage shall be provided for any property that the Administrator finds has been declared by a duly constituted state or local zoning authority or other authorized public body to be in violation of state or local laws, regulations, or ordinances that intended to discourage or otherwise restrict land development or occupancy in flood-prone areas.
Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA)
Those lands within the jurisdiction of the City subject to inundation by the regulatory flood. The SFHAs of The City of Fort Wayne are generally identified as such on the Flood Insurance Rate Map of Allen County, Indiana dated August 3, 2009 as well as any future updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most recent date. (These areas are shown on a FIRM as Zone A, AE, A1- A30, AH, AR, A99, or AO).
Start of Construction
Includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.
Structure
A structure that is principally above ground and is enclosed by walls and a roof. The term includes a gas or liquid storage tank, a manufactured home, or a prefabricated building. The term also includes recreational vehicles to be installed on a site for more than 180 days.
Substantial Damage
Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
Substantial Improvement
Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred “repetitive loss” or “substantial damage" regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not include improvements of structures to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code requirements or any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the structures continued designation as a "historic structure".

Suspension
The removal of a participating community from the NFIP because the community has not enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain management regulations required for participation in the NFIP.
Variance
A grant of relief from the requirements of this section, which permits construction in a manner otherwise prohibited by this section where specific enforcement would result in unnecessary hardship.
Violation
The failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this section. A structure or other development without the elevation, other certification, or other evidence of compliance required in this section is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
Watercourse
A lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may occur.
X Zone
The area where the flood hazard is less than that in the SFHA. ShadedX zones shown on recent FIRMs (B zones on older FIRMs) designate areas subject to inundation by the flood with a 0.2 percent chance of being equaled or exceeded (the 500-year flood). Unshaded X zones (C zones on older FIRMs) designate areas where the annual exceedance probability of flooding is less than 0.2 percent.
Zone
A geographical area shown on a FIRM that reflects the severity or type of flooding in the area.
Zone A (see “A Zone”)
Zone B, C, and X
Areas identified in the community as areas of moderate or minimal hazard from the principal source of flood in the area. However, buildings in these zones could be flooded by severe, concentrated rainfall coupled with inadequate local drainage systems. Flood insurance is available in participating communities but is not required by regulation in these zones. (Zone X is used on new and revised maps in place of Zones B and C.)

(a) In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped floodplain (SFHA) on the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation provided on the profiles shall govern.
(b) If the elevation of the site in question is below the base flood elevation, that site shall be included in the SFHA and regulated accordingly.
(c) If the elevation (natural grade) of the site in question is above the base flood elevation and not located within the floodway, that site shall be considered outside the SFHA and the floodplain regulations will not be applied. The property owner shall be advised to apply for a LOMA.
(7) Interpretation
In the interpretation and application of this section all provisions shall be:
(a) Considered as minimum requirements.
(b) Liberally construed in favor of the governing body.
(c) Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes.
(8) Warning and Disclaimer of Liability
The degree of flood protection required by this section is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from engineering and scientific methods of study. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Therefore, this section does not create any liability on the part of The City of Fort Wayne, the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, or the State of Indiana, for any flood damage that results from reliance on this section or any administrative decision made lawfully thereunder.
(9) Penalties for Violation
Failure to obtain a Floodplain Development Permit in the SFHA or failure to comply with the requirements of a Floodplain Development Permit or conditions of a variance shall be deemed to be a violation of this section. All violations shall be considered a common nuisance and be treated as such in accordance with the provisions of the Zoning Code for the City of Fort Wayne. All violations shall be punishable by a fine not exceeding $2,500.00.
(a) A separate offense shall be deemed to occur for each day the violation continues to exist.
(b) The City of Fort Wayne Plan Commission shall inform the owner that any such violation is considered a willful act to increase flood damages and therefore may cause coverage by a Standard Flood Insurance Policy to be suspended.
(c) Nothing herein shall prevent the City from taking such other lawful action to prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall accrue to the person or persons responsible.

Floodproofing and sealing measures must be taken to ensure that toxic substances will not be displaced by or released into floodwaters. Access routes elevated to or above the FPG shall be provided to all critical facilities to the extent possible.
(5) Standards for Identified Floodways
(a) Located within SFHAs, established in §157.412(C)(2), are areas designated as floodways. The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which carry debris, potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. If the site is in an identified floodway, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and apply for a permit for construction in a floodway. Under the provisions of IC 14-28-1 a permit for construction in a floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources is required prior to the issuance of a local building permit for any excavation, deposit, construction, or obstruction activity located in the floodway. This includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing and paving etc. undertaken before the actual start of construction of the structure. However, it does exclude non-substantial additions/improvements to existing (lawful) residences in a non-boundary river floodway. (IC 14-28-1-26 allows construction of a non-substantial addition/improvement to a residence in a non-boundary river floodway without obtaining a permit for construction in the floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Please note that if fill is needed to elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior approval for the fill is required from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.)
(b) No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until a permit or letter of authorization (when applicable) has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources granting approval for construction in the floodway. Once a permit for construction in a floodway or letter of authorization has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local Floodplain Development Permit, provided the provisions contained in §157.412(E) of this section have been met. The Floodplain Development Permit cannot be less restrictive than the permit for construction in a floodway issued by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. However, a community’s more restrictive regulations (if any) shall take precedence.
(c) No development shall be allowed, which acting alone or in combination with existing or future development, that will adversely affect the efficiency of, or unduly restrict the capacity of the floodway. This adverse effect is defined as an increase in the elevation of the regulatory flood of at least fifteen-hundredths (0.15) of a foot as determined by comparing the regulatory flood elevation under the project condition to that under the natural or pre-floodway condition as proven with hydraulic analyses.

Additional General Standards 295 Floodplain
(d) For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including levees) the City shall submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency Management Agency revise the regulatory flood data per mapping standard regulations found at 44 CFR §65.12.
(6) Standards for Identified Fringe
If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local Floodplain Development Permit provided the provisions contained in §157.412(E) of this section have been met. The key provision is that the top of the lowest floor of any new or substantially improved structure shall be at or above the FPG.
(7) Standards for SFHAs without Established Base flood elevation and/or Floodways/Fringes
(a) Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile:
(i) If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined, and the drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for review and comment.
(ii) No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until either a permit for construction in a floodway (including letters of authorization) or a floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment citing the one-percent annual chance flood elevation and the recommended flood protection grade has been received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
(iii) Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper permit for construction in a floodway (including letters of authorization) or floodplain analysis/regulatory assessment approving the proposed development, a Floodplain Development Permit may be issued provided the conditions of the Floodplain Development Permit are not less restrictive than the conditions received from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources and the provisions contained in §157.412(E) of this section have been met.
(b) Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile:
(i) If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the floodway and fringe have not yet been determined and the drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to provide an engineering analysis showing the limits of the floodplain and one-percent annual chance flood elevation for the site.
(ii) Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local Floodplain Development Permit, provided the provisions contained in §157.412(E) of this section have been met.
(c) The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the regulatory flood more than 0.14 of one foot and shall not increase flood damages or potential flood damages.

All development in known flood prone areas not identified on FEMA maps, or where no FEMA published map is available, shall meet applicable standards as required per §157.412(E).
(F) Nonconforming Buildings and Structures
(1) Any building or structure existing as of March 30, 1985 that does not conform to this section or that subsequently becomes nonconforming as a result of an amendment to this ordinance shall be considered a nonconforming building or structure.
(2) Any nonconforming building or structure which is not in the floodway may be enlarged or improved at the existing grade and floor elevations, provided the addition or improvement does not constitute substantial improvement. Completion of the addition or improvement must be completed within 24 months from the date of the permit.
(3) Any nonconforming building or structure in the floodway may be enlarged or improved at the existing grade and floor elevations, provided the addition or improvement does not constitute substantial improvement and shall meet the construction in the floodway requirement in §157.412(E)(5). Only one permit for an addition or improvement per building or structure is authorized by this section. Completion of the addition or improvement must be completed within 24 months from the date of the permit.
(4) Any nonconforming building or structure may be repaired after a damage event, provided the repair does not constitute substantial improvement. For any proposed repair which constitutes substantial improvement, the addition or improvement shall conform to the applicable building protection standards in §157.412(E).
(G) Variance Procedures
(1) Designation of Variance and Appeals Board
The Board of Zoning Appeals shall hear and decide appeals and requests for variances from requirements of this section.

(e) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
(f) Variances may be granted for the reconstruction or restoration of any structure individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the Indiana State Register of Historic Sites and Structures.
(g) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying the difference between the flood protection grade and the elevation to which the lowest floor is to be built and stating that the cost of the flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation (see §157.412(G)(5)).
(h) The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the Indiana Department of Natural Resources upon request (see §157.412(G)(5)).

(1) Sexually oriented businesses, as a category of commercial uses, are associated with a wide variety of adverse secondary effects including, but not limited to, personal and property crimes, human trafficking, prostitution, potential spread of disease, lewdness, public indecency, obscenity, illicit drug use and drug trafficking, negative impacts on surrounding properties, urban blight, litter, and sexual assault and exploitation.
(2) Sexually oriented businesses should be separated from sensitive land uses to minimize the impact of their secondary effects upon such uses.
(3) Each of the foregoing negative secondary effects constitutes a harm which the City has a substantial government interest in preventing and/or abating. The City’s interest in regulating sexually oriented businesses extends to preventing future secondary effects of either current or future sexually oriented businesses that may locate in the City. The City finds that the cases and documentation relied on in this ordinance are reasonably believed to be relevant to said secondary effects.

(B) Nonconforming Lots
Any lot established by legally recorded plat or deed prior to April 3, 2014 that does not meet the minimum size or dimension requirements of this ordinance, or that subsequently becomes nonconforming as a result of an amendment to this ordinance, may still be used for any use or structure permitted in the zoning district in which the lot is located, but any buildings or structures constructed on such a lot shall comply with all applicable requirements for that building or structure. Any lot located within a recorded residential plat previously approved with lesser yard requirements shall be permitted to be developed for single family residential use, and any existing single family detached residences may be enlarged in accordance with the previously approved setbacks. If a single family detached residence on a lot with nonconforming yard requirements is damaged or destroyed, the residence shall be permitted to be rebuilt in accordance with the previously approved yard requirements.
(C) Nonconforming Uses
(1) Continuation
Except as otherwise provided in this section, a use that existed as of March 2, 1998, or that subsequently becomes nonconforming as a result of an amendment to this ordinance, may be continued.
(2) Expansion of Use
(a) A structure used for a nonconforming use shall not be added to or enlarged in any manner unless the use and the structure, including the addition or enlargement, is brought into conformance with the permitted use and setback requirements of the district in which it is located, with the following exceptions:
(i) A single family, two family, or attached single family residential structure, located in a zoning district that does not permit single family uses, may be added to or enlarged, provided the addition conforms to all applicable residential setback requirements. Residential accessory structures, such as a fence, garage, or shed, shall also be permitted.
(ii) Uses located in the DC, DE, UC, and BTI districts that have become nonconforming due to reclassification or amendment to this ordinance may be added to or enlarged on (a) the property shown on the Allen County Assessor’s Office property record card for the property at the time of the rezoning or amendment that created the nonconforming situation or (b) the development site where the building and improvements are located at the time of the rezoning or amendment that created the nonconforming situation, provided the addition conforms to all other applicable provisions of this ordinance.
(iii) For gas station use provisions, see §157.504(E)(6).
(b) A nonconforming use may be expanded or extended into any other portion of the structure that existed at the time the nonconforming use was established.

(b) A detached residential accessory building that becomes nonconforming due to the demolition or other removal of the primary residential building shall be permitted to continue. However, the failure to construct a new primary residential building on the same lot, tract, or development site within twelve (12) months of the removal of the primary building shall be construed as intent to abandon the accessory building or structure. Enforcement proceedings as provided in this ordinance may be initiated after the expiration of the twelve (12) month period.
(2) Additions or Enlargement of Buildings or Structures
(a) A building or structure that does not conform to the height limitation of the zoning district in which it is located may be added to or enlarged, provided the addition or enlargement conforms to the height limitation.
(b) A primary residential building that conforms to the permitted use requirements of this ordinance but is nonconforming with regard to front or rear setback requirements may be added to or enlarged, provided that the nonconforming front or rear yard dimension is not decreased.
(c) A primary nonresidential building not located in a DC, DE, or UC district that conforms to the permitted use requirements of this ordinance but is nonconforming with regard to front or rear setback requirements may be added to or enlarged on a one time basis of up to 50% of the square footage of the existing structure, provided that the nonconforming front or rear yard dimension is not decreased.
(d) In the DC, DE, and UC districts, primary building may be added to or enlarged provided the addition does not violate any minimum front, side or rear yard setback requirement.
FORT WAYNE ZONING ORDINANCE
Chapter 157 – Zoning Ordinance 10/10/2019 § 157.504
Administration 335 Nonconforming Situations

(f) In a C2 district that existed as of April 3, 2014, existing buildings that exceed the square footage limitation for new development permitted in that districts and buildings located on lots that contain multiple buildings as of April 3, 2014, shall be permitted to be expanded or reconstructed, provided the expansion or reconstruction conforms to the applicable setback, height and open space provisions in this ordinance.
(g) If a lot in a C2 district that existed as of April 3, 2014 did not contain multiple buildings as of that date, but had adequate space to accommodate multiple buildings as of that date, then the construction of multiple buildings on that lot shall be permitted, provided that all buildings conform to the applicable setback, height, and open space provisions in this ordinance.
(3) Maintenance or Reconstruction
(a) A nonconforming building or structure that legally existed as of March 2, 1998 or that becomes nonconforming as a result of an amendment to this ordinance, may be maintained and repaired, except as otherwise provided in this section.
(b) An undamaged nonconforming building or structure may be reconstructed if the reconstruction does not result in the removal or demolition of any exterior wall (unless such removal or demolition will result in that exterior wall meeting the requirements of the ordinance), and the reconstruction is no more than double the total value of the nonconforming building or structure.
(E) Other Nonconforming Situations
(1) Fences
Fences that are nonconforming with regard to location on the lot may be maintained and repaired as necessary.
