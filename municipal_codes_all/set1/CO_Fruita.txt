2.28.170 PENALTY ASSESSMENTS – PROCEDURE. In order to provide for the expeditious handling of certain minor criminal offenses and noncriminal municipal offenses, the Fruita Municipal Court is authorized to accept penalty assessment fines and penalties in accordance with the provisions of this Section.  This Section shall not be construed as limiting or otherwise modifying the Model Traffic Code, adopted by reference by the City of Fruita. 
A. 	At the time that any person is arrested or charged for the commission of a Class A or B criminal offense set forth pursuant to Section 2.28.180 of this Chapter, or as set forth pursuant to Court Order, the arresting officer may offer to give a Penalty Assessment Notice to the defendant.  If any person is charged with a noncriminal municipal offense, the citing officer shall issue a Penalty Assessment Notice to the defendant, unless otherwise provided by law.  This Notice shall be made by notation upon the summons and complaint issued in conformance with law. 
B. 	If a person charged with a criminal offense does not possess a valid Colorado driver's license, such person, in order to secure release, as provided in this Section, must give his written acknowledgment of guilt or give his written promise to appear in court by signing the Penalty Assessment Notice prepared by the charging officer. Should the person to whom the Penalty Assessment Notice is tendered accept the notice by acknowledging his guilt in writing, said acceptance shall constitute a promise on such person's part to pay the fine or penalty specified in the schedule issued pursuant to Section 2.28.180 of this Chapter, or specified in a schedule issued by Court order, for the violation involved at the office of the Clerk of the Municipal Court, Fruita, Colorado, either in person or by mail within ten (10) days of the date of issuance.  Any person who accepts a Penalty Assessment Notice for a criminal violation, by acknowledgment of guilt, but who does not furnish satisfactory evidence of identity, or who the officer has reasonable and probable grounds to believe  will disregard a written promise to pay the specified fine, may be taken by the officer to the nearest post office facility, and required to remit the amount of the specified fine to the City of Fruita immediately by mail in United States currency or legal tender, or by money order, or personal check. Refusal or inability to remit the specified fine by mail when required shall constitute a refusal to accept a Penalty Assessment Notice, by acknowledgment of guilt. 
Should a person cited for a criminal violation refuse to give his written acknowledgment of guilt or give his written promise to appear in Court by signing the Penalty Assessment Notice, the officer shall proceed to issue a Summons in accordance with Colorado law. Should such person accept the notice, by acknowledgment of guilt, but fail to pay the prescribed penalty within ten (10) days thereafter, the Notice shall be construed to be a Summons and Complaint, and the prosecution for said violation shall thereafter be heard in the Municipal Court, in which event such person shall be privileged to answer the charge made against him in the same manner as if he had not been tendered a Penalty Assessment Notice. In such event, the maximum penalty which may be imposed may exceed the penalty assessment amount. 
C. 	If the person cited for a criminal violation does possess a valid Colorado driver's license, the person shall not be required to give his written acknowledgment of guilt or written promise to appear on the Penalty Assessment Notice.  For the purposes of this Section, tender by an arresting officer of the Penalty Assessment Notice to such a person shall constitute notice to the violator to appear in Court at the time specified on such notice or to pay the required fine. Should such person fail to pay the prescribed penalty within ten 
(10) 
days thereafter, the notice shall be construed to be a Summons, and the prosecution for said violation shall thereafter be heard in the Municipal Court, in which event such person shall be privileged to answer the charge made against him in the same manner as if he had not been tendered a Penalty Assessment Notice. In such event, the maximum penalty which may be imposed may exceed the penalty assessment amount. 

D. 	
Payment of the prescribed penalty assessment within ten (10) days shall be deemed a complete satisfaction for the violation.  Checks tendered by the violator to, and accepted 


by the Municipal Court, and upon which payment is received by the Municipal Court, shall be deemed sufficient receipt. 
E. 	Penalty Assessment Notices issued for noncriminal violations shall also be in accordance with Section 2.28.190 of this Chapter. 
F. 	Nothing contained herein shall be construed as requiring a law enforcement officer to issue a Penalty Assessment Notice for a criminal violation.   Penalty Assessment Notices for criminal violations shall not be issued in the event of an offense involving property damage, injury to any person, or in the event the complaint is made by a private party. Penalty Assessment Notices shall be issued in all cases involving noncriminal municipal offenses, unless otherwise provided by law. 
(Ord. 2000-08, S1) 
2.28.180 PENALTY ASSESSMENT SCHEDULE FOR CRIMINAL OFFENSES.A penalty assessment schedule for criminal offenses may be established by the Fruita City Council.

2. 	
A case in which the Court did not have jurisdiction over the person of the violator;

4. 	
Where the Court finds that failure to seek relief within the applicable time period was the result of circumstances amounting to justifiable excuse or excusable neglect. 


E. 	At any time that a person is cited for the commission of any noncriminal municipal offense, the citing officer shall give a notice to such person, which notice shall be in the form of a Penalty Assessment Notice as described in Section 2.28.170 of this Chapter.

G. 	One (1) copy of the notice shall be given to the violator by the citing officer. 
H. 	The time specified in the notice to appear shall be at least fourteen (14) days, but not more than 45 days after such citation, unless otherwise provided by law or the person cited requests an earlier hearing. 
I. 	Whenever the alleged violator refuses to sign or accept the Penalty Assessment Notice, tender of such Notice by the citing officer to the alleged violator shall constitute service of a Summons and Complaint. 
J. 	If an alleged violator is cited for a noncriminal municipal offense, he shall be privileged to answer the Complaint made against him in the manner provided in the Colorado Municipal Court Rules and Procedure.  The maximum penalty which may be imposed shall not exceed the penalties set forth in the Penalty Assessment Notice. 
K. 	In the event a person who has been cited for a noncriminal municipal offense fails to pay the Penalty Assessment Notice, he shall make an appearance and answer the Complaint against him.  If the alleged violator answers that he is guilty or liable, judgment shall be entered against him and he shall be assessed the appropriate penalty and applicable court costs and fees.  If the alleged violator denies the allegations in the Complaint, a final hearing on the Complaint shall be held within the time period prescribed in Rule 248 of the Colorado Municipal Court Rules of Procedure.  If the alleged violator fails to appear for a final hearing, a default judgment shall be entered against him, and he shall be assessed the appropriate penalty and applicable court costs and fees. 
L. 	In the event a person who has been cited for a noncriminal municipal offense fails to pay the penalty assessment within the time period specified in the Penalty Assessment Notice and fails to appear at the time and place specified in the Notice, a default judgment shall be entered against him and he shall be assessed the appropriate penalty and Court costs. 
M. 	Whenever the judge of the Municipal Court imposes a monetary penalty for a noncriminal municipal offense, if the person who committed the offense is unable to pay the amount at the time of the Court hearing or if he fails to pay any penalty imposed for the commission of such offense within the time permitted by the Court, in order to guarantee the payment of such penalty, the judge may compel collection of the penalty in the manner provided in Section 18-1-110, C.R.S. 
N. 	An officer coming upon an unattended vehicle which is an apparent violation of any provision of the Model Traffic Code may place upon the vehicle a Penalty Assessment Notice indicating the noncriminal traffic offense and directing the owner/operator of the vehicle to remit the penalty assessment to the Municipal Court within ten (10) days. If the penalty assessment is not paid within ten (10) days of the issuance of such Notice, the Court shall mail a notice to the registered owner of the vehicle, setting forth the noncriminal traffic offense and the time and place where it occurred and directing the payment of the penalty assessment within twenty (20) days from the issuance of such notice.  If the penalty assessment is not paid within such twenty (20) days, the Court shall request the officer who issued the original Penalty Assessment Notice to file a Complaint with the Court and serve upon the registered owner of the vehicle a Summons to appear in Court at a time and place specified therein. 
O.

Costs shall be paid by the City when a defendant is acquitted, when charges are dismissed against a defendant, or when a defendant is convicted and the Court determines he is unable to pay them, unless otherwise provided herein.

In addition, if charges against an accused pursuant to a private person complaint are dismissed, and it appears to the Court there were no reasonable grounds for the complaint, or that it was maliciously made, the Court shall give judgment against said complainant for all applicable fees and costs. 
A. 	Docket Fee. In all proceedings before the Municipal Court, a docket fee shall be charged, which shall be payable by the defendant upon his conviction.

B. 	Jury Fee. At the time he demands a jury trial, a defendant shall pay a jury fee to the Clerk of the Court, unless the fee is waived by the judge because of the indigence of the Defendant.

A defendant who fails to file with the Municipal Court the written jury demand together with the jury fee as provided above waives the right to a jury trial.

Any witness fee collected, but not claimed by a witness within thirty (30) days, shall be paid by the Clerk of the Court to the City Treasurer.  All unclaimed witness fees shall become the property of the City and shall not be refunded.  If a fee claimed by a witness has not previously been collected by the Court Clerk, the City shall pay the witness claimant if said claim was submitted in a timely manner.

Such fee shall be in addition the applicable docket fee.  Nothing contained in this Chapter shall prevent the Court from assessing additional fees if a human services agency, mental health professional or similar professional is utilized by the Court to supervise the Defendant’s compliance with the terms of the deferred judgment, deferred prosecution, or probation.  
G. 	Bench Warrant Fee. In all actions in which a bench warrant is issued for the arrest of a defendant for failure to appear or failure to pay fines and costs as ordered by the Court, the Court shall assess against said defendant a fee in addition to all other fees and costs due and owing. 
H. 	Incarceration Fee. In all actions in which a defendant is sentenced to incarceration in the county jail, the Court may assess against said defendant an incarceration fee in an amount equal to the sum charged to the City by Mesa County for such incarceration.

Said misdemeanor fee shall also be charged in the event a defendant is granted a deferred judgment and sentence or a deferred prosecution.  
The purpose of the Misdemeanor Fee is to accumulate funds to offset costs associated with a defendant’s right to counsel in plea negotiations for misdemeanors and lesser offenses.

A. 	An application for refund of tax moneys paid in error or by mistake shall be made within three (3) years after the date of purchase of medical marijuana or medical marijuana paraphernalia for which the refund is claimed. If the Finance Director determines within three (3) years of the due date, that a vendor overpaid the medical marijuana tax, he shall process a refund or allow a credit against a future remittance from the same taxpayer. If the amount paid is less than the amount due, the difference together with interest shall be paid by the vendor within then (10) days after receiving written notice and demand from the Finance Director. The Finance Director may extend that time for good cause. 
B. If any part of the deficiency is due to negligence or intentional disregard of this Chapter, 
Revised 09/01/2010 	3-50 Revenue and Finance 
or any regulations promulgated thereunder, but without intent to defraud, there shall be added ten percent (10%) of the total amount of the deficiency, and interest, from the person required to file the return. If any part of the deficiency is due to fraud with the intent to evade the tax, then there shall be added fifty percent (50%) of the total amount of the deficiency and in such case, the whole amount of the unpaid tax, including the additions, shall become due and payable ten (10) days after written notice and demand by the Finance Director.

Applications for a refund must be made within sixty (60) days after the purchase of the medical marijuana or paraphernalia on which the exemption is claimed and must be supported by the affidavit of the purchaser accompanied by the original paid invoice or sales receipt and the statement of the claim of exemption as set forth in subsection (A) of this Section. The burden of proof that sales of medical marijuana or medical marijuana paraphernalia on which tax refunds are claimed, are exempt from taxation under this Chapter, shall be upon the one making such claim by a preponderance of the evidence. 
C. 	Upon receipt of such application, the Finance Director shall examine the same within fourteen (14) days and shall give notice to the applicant by an order in writing of the decision thereon.

The reason for termination, including as may be applicable, the unpaid charges for the services, and, if an ordinance or regulation of the City has been violated concerning the receipt or use of such services, the essential facts constituting the violation; 

2. 	
A statement that the recipient of the notice may within ten (10) days after the notice is sent contact the City Clerk, Fruita City Hall, Fruita, Colorado, to question, adjust, and settle the matters in dispute; that failure to respond within ten (10) days will give rise to the exercise of the City's rights as provided herein; 

3. 	
The right of the recipient to appeal the decision of the City Clerk to the Board of Utilities Service Appeals by filing a written notice of appeal to the City Clerk delivered not more than three (3) working days after the decision of the City Clerk concerning the matters in dispute, and upon such appeal the Board of Utilities Service Appeals shall review the matters in dispute and render a decision;

That the utility service in question will terminate unless the foregoing appeals process is utilized and if the matters in dispute are determined adversely to the appellant, such service will terminate three (3) days after the appeals process is complete; 

5. 	
The costs to be assessed for termination of utility service and for subsequent reinstatement of the service; 

6. 	
Any other matter not inconsistent with the foregoing. 


B. 	Upon the request of a recipient of a notice of termination, the City Clerk shall meet and consult with the recipient of the notice within seven (7) days after the recipient's request to do so.  If the City Clerk is unavailable, the City Manager shall appoint other City personnel to do so who shall have all powers granted herein to the City Clerk. The City Clerk shall be empowered to adjust and settle the dispute concerning charges for utilities service and violations of ordinances or regulations concerning the receipt or use of such services. At the conference, the City Clerk shall inform the recipient of the notice that the recipient has the right to appeal the decision of the City Clerk to the Board of Utilities Service Appeals. 
C. 	There is hereby created the Board of Utilities Service Appeal, which shall consist of the three (3) persons appointed by the Mayor. If a recipient of a termination notice files a written notice with the City to appeal the decision of the City Clerk rendered pursuant to Section B above within three (3) working days of such decision, then the Board of Utilities Service Appeals (Board) shall give notice of not more than five (5) days to the members of the board and to the appellant of the time and place of a meeting of the Board to affirm, review, or modify the decision of the City Clerk.  Two members shall constitute a quorum. The meeting shall be informal, and at the request of the appellant 
Revised 09/01/2010 	3-58 Revenue and Finance 
will be recorded. The City and the appellant may present any facts or data relevant to the dispute, with or without the swearing of an oath. 
The Board shall consider the data and evidence before it, and, except as set forth in Section E below, shall order termination of utility service if arrearages for such service remain unpaid or if the appellant or user of the service in question has violated any ordinance or regulation concerning the receipt or the use of such service. 
D. 	The effective date of the termination of utility service shall be the earliest of: 
1. 	
Eleven (11) days after the mailing by the City of a notice of termination, if no appeal to the City Clerk is lodged; 

2. 	
Four (4) working days after the decision of the City Clerk if no appeal of his decision is lodged to the Board; 

3. 	
Three (3) days after the decision of the Board. 


E. 	Notwithstanding the foregoing or any other part of the Fruita Municipal Code, utility service shall not be terminated if; 
1. 	
All arrearages for nonpayment of utility service have been paid in full; 

2. 	
Violations of ordinances or regulations concerning the receipt or use of utility service other than nonpayment of rates; have ceased; 

3. 	
Non payment of a bill has continued for more than thirty (30) days, but current bills {meaning that portion of the bill which is not more than thirty 

(30) days past due} are being paid when due and all past due installments are being amortized by reasonable installment payments approved by the City Clerk; 

4. 	
The utility services for which payment has been made were rendered to a previous occupant of the same premises to be served and were not ordered by the present or prospective customer, provided, however, the City may decline to furnish service at the same premises if subterfuge has occurred or if ownership of the premises has not changed. Subterfuge includes, but is not restricted to, an application for utility service at a given location in the name of another party by an applicant whose account is delinquent and who continues to reside at the premises. 


F. 	Service may be terminated without prior notice and appeal procedures if the City determines that a bypass has been installed on a customer's service meter, a short circuit exists on a user's premises or service is being received or utilized in such a manner as to create a dangerous condition for occupants of the premises or others which requires immediate discontinuance of service in the opinion of the City. 
G. 	The owner or occupant shall be liable for all costs incurred by the City in the 
Revised 09/01/2010 	3-59 Revenue and Finance 
discontinuance or resumption of any service. 
(Ord. 1989-10, S3) 
3.20.030 PROPERTY LIEN. 
A. 	If the charges for irrigation water, sewer, garbage, trash and waste material pick up service, or any combination of these, remain unpaid for sixty (60) days after payment is due, the City may send a notice of lien assessment, by first class mail, or by certified mail, return receipt requested, at the City's option, to the owner as listed on the City's records, and at the City's option, to the occupant of the premises served. The notice shall state: 
1. 	
That the City seeks a lien on the property served for the amount of the unpaid charges for the utility services; 

2. 	
That the recipient of the notice may within ten (10) days after notice is sent contact the City Clerk of the City of Fruita to question, adjust and settle the matters in dispute, that failure to respond in ten (10) days will give rise to the exercise of the City's lien rights as provided herein; 

3. 	
That the recipient may appeal the decision of the City Clerk to the Board of Utilities Service Appeals by filing a written notice of appeal to the City Clerk delivered not more than three (3) working days after the decision of the City Clerk concerning the matters in dispute, and upon such appeal, that the Board of Utilities Services Appeal shall review the matters in dispute and render a decision; 

4. 	
That a lien for unpaid charges for utilities services shall be assessed against the properties served if the arrearages remain unpaid and if the matters in dispute are determined adversely to the appellant, and that the amount of the lien shall be equal to arrearages for unpaid utilities services and other costs allowed by this ordinance. Should the owner or occupant not respond within ten (10) days, then the amount of the arrearages as determined by the City shall become a lien upon the property served which shall run in favor of the City. 


B. 	Should the owner or occupant respond within ten (10) days, the City Clerk and subsequently, if applicable, the Board of Utilities Service Appeal shall meet with the person or persons to whom the notice was sent to determine whether a lien should be asserted for arrearages for utilities services on the property served. The procedures shall follow substantially those set forth in subsections B and C of section 3.20.025 of this chapter, except that the question to be resolved shall be whether a lien should be asserted on the property to which the utility services were furnished and the extent of arrearages for nonpayment. If the City Clerk or on appeal the Board of Utilities Service Appeal, if 
an appeal is made, determines that such arrearage exists as of the date of decision of the City Clerk or the Board, if an appeal is made, then the amount of the arrearages shall become a lien on the property served and may be recorded forthwith and foreclosed 
Revised 09/01/2010 	3-60 Revenue and Finance 
pursuant to Colorado law. 
C. 	At the same time that the amount of arrearages may become a lien on the property served, it shall be the prerogative of the City Clerk to certify the property description in the amount of the charge, assessment or tax to the County Treasurer or other officer of the County having custody of the tax list, at the same time of such certification, to be by him placed on the tax list for the current year to be collected in the same manner as other taxes collected. All the laws of the State of Colorado for the assessment and collection of general taxes, including C.R.S. 31-20-105 and the laws for the sale of property for taxes and the redemption thereof, shall apply to and have full effect for the collection of charges, assessments or taxes. 
When utility service is rendered to premises occupied by a lessee or licensee, the City may require the owner as well as the lessee or licensee to agree to pay and to pay for charges for all utility, irrigation, sewer, garbage, trash and waste material pick up service. 
The City may require any such owner, lessee, or licensee to pay an advance deposit for an amount equal to but not more than the anticipated bill for two month's utility service, which may be used to satisfy unpaid arrearage for such service. The deposit shall be refunded when such person discontinues the use of the utility service for which the deposit was made, if all arrearages are fully paid. 
(Ord. 1989-10, S3) 
3.20.045 DEPOSITS. The City shall require a security deposit in the amount of twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for each and every new account concerning any services or utility provided to any parcel. (Ord. 1989-10, S3) 
3.20.050 REMEDIES. Remedies provided hereunder shall be cumulative in nature and in addition to all other remedies codified in the Fruita Municipal Code or otherwise recognized under the laws of the State of Colorado. (Ord. 1989-10, S3) 
3.20.055 DUTY OF PROPERTY OWNER TO NOTIFY CITY. It is the duty of the property owner to notify the City of the utilization of any of the City services at or about the parcel owned by him within 30 days after the commencement of the use. Failure to notify the City will subject owner of record to a penalty of fifty dollars ($50.00).  Penalties shall bear interest at the rate of one and one half percent (1.5%) per month until paid. Collection of said penalties shall be as provided in this Chapter. (Ord. 1989-10, S3) 
3.20.065 SEVERABILITY CLAUSE. If any provision of this ordinance or the application thereof to any person or circumstance is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other provisions or application of this ordinance which can be given effect without the invalid provisions or applications, and to this end, the provisions of this ordinance are declared to be severable.

5.40.010 PURPOSE  AND DESCRIPTION. The purpose of these regulations is to provide for the regulation and licensing of sexually oriented businesses within the City in a manner which will protect the property values, neighborhoods and residents from the potential adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses while providing to those who desire to patronize sexually oriented businesses the opportunity to do so.  It is not the intent of this Chapter to suppress any speech activities protected by the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution or Article II, Section 10 Colorado Constitution, but to impose content-neutral regulations which address the adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses.  Nothing in this Chapter is intended to authorize or license anything otherwise prohibited by law. 
Sexually oriented businesses are frequently used for unlawful sexual activities, including prostitution.  The concern over sexually transmitted diseases is a legitimate health concern of the City which demands reasonable regulation of sexually oriented businesses to protect the health and well-being of the citizens, including the patrons of sexually oriented businesses. Licensing of sexually oriented businesses is a legitimate and reasonable means of ensuring that operators of sexually oriented businesses comply with reasonable regulations and that operators do not knowingly allow their businesses to be used as places of illegal sexual activity or solicitation. 
Revised 9/30/2016 	5-55 Business Licenses and Regulations 
There is convincing documented evidence that sexually oriented businesses, because of their nature, have a deleterious effect on both the existing businesses around them and surrounding residential areas causing increased crime and downgrading of property values. The purpose of this Chapter is to control adverse effects from sexually oriented businesses and thereby protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens; protect the citizens from increased crime; preserve the quality of life; preserve the property values and character of the surrounding neighborhoods and deter the spread of urban blight.

The authority to contract went into effect on April 5, 1983 with approval of a majority of those voting in a special election on that date.

(Ord. 279, S2, 1973; Ord. 249, S1, 1970; Ord. 2011­01, S3)

The AQI is determined by the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. 
B. 	“Good” AQI – 24-hour value for AQI ranges between 0 – 50. Air quality is considered satisfactory, and air pollution poses little or no risk. 
C. 	“Moderate” AQI – 24-hour value for AQI ranges between 51 – 100.  Air quality is acceptable; however, for some pollutants there may be moderate health concern for a very small number of people.  For example, people who are usually sensitive to ozone may experience respiratory symptoms. 
D. 	“Unhealthy-for-sensitive-groups” AQI – 24-hour value for AQI ranges between 101 -150. Although the general public is not likely to be affected at this AQI range, exposure to ozone is a greater risk for people with lung disease, older adults and children, whereas exposure to the presence of particles in the air also affects those persons with heart disease as well as other groups.

Slope Air Watch season.  PM10 is a standard measurement of Particulate Matter that includes particles with a diameter of 10 micrometers or less (0.0004 inches or one-seventh the width of a human hair) and affects respiratory health and visibility.  PM2.5 is the standard measurement of fine particles (smaller than 2.5 micrometers in diameter) that have effects on health.

12.20.010 GRID SYSTEM -ESTABLISHED -DESCRIPTION. An overlying grid system is established following the present developed areas of Fruita and extending into the undeveloped areas and overlapping the existing irregular sized blocks. With Park Square (Circle Park) as the center, this grid will be maintained so that a uniform system exists for present and future numbering of addresses. The streets shall radiate in four directions from Park Square, with east, west, north or south prefixes assigned. The national pattern will be followed which means that all north and west thoroughfares will be odd numbered and all east and south thoroughfares will be even numbered. (Ord. 299, S1, 1974) 
12.20.020  THOROUGHFARES DESIGNATED AS STREETS OR AVENUES WHEN. All east-west thoroughfares will be designated avenues, and all north-south thoroughfares will be designated streets. (Ord. 299, S2, 1974)

Beginning at Park Square and proceeding in each of the four directions, the first block (or grid) will be numbered from 100 through 199, thence 200 through 299, etc., with a number assigned for every fifteen feet beginning at the corner of the block or grid pattern 
In areas where there are no established blocks, the numbering on a footage basis will commence with the corner of the block and continue to the beginning of the next block, making utilization, if necessary, of the street footage within the grid pattern.  (Ord. 299, S3, 1974)

13.28.020 SEWER CHARGES. 
A. 	There shall be levied and assessed upon each lot, parcel of land, building or premises in the city having any connection with the sewer system of the city, a monthly sewer service charge based on the information set out below. 
B. 	Definitions.   
1. 	Equivalent Residential Unit (EQR).  As used in this Ordinance, means a number related to the volume and treatment requirements of sewage discharged by a single-family residential unit. The volume and treatment requirements associated with an EQR are 4,000 gallons per month with BOD loading of 200 mg/L.  EQR's assigned to 
Revised 02/01/2012 13-24 	Water and Sewer 
residential customers as set forth in the Table in paragraph (D) below are directly proportional to the volume of sewage discharged by a single-family residential unit. 
2. 	Biochemical  Oxygen  Demand  (BOD).  The quantity of  oxygen  utilized in the biochemical oxidation of organic matter under standard laboratory procedure in five 
(5) days at twenty (20) degrees centigrade, expressed in milligrams per liter (mg/L). A BOD multiplier will adjust the EQR flow values assigned to residential customers to account for extra costs for treatment of excess BOD. 
3. 	
Residential Customer.   A customer/user shall be classified as residential in nature if they receive sewer service at a condominium, townhome, detached single family residence, mobile home, multi-family residential apartment building, or senior citizens apartment building. 

4. 	
Non-Residential Customer. A customer/user shall be classified as commercial in nature if they receive sewer service at any property not included in the definition of Residential Customer in subparagraph B(3) above.  Sewer service provided to hotels, motels, schools, hospitals, travel trailer or overnight mobile home parks, nursing homes, governmental agencies and commercial businesses shall be defined as non­residential in nature. 

5. 	
Total Suspended Solids (TSS).  The total suspended matter, expressed in milligrams per liter (mg/L),  that floats on the surface of, or is suspended in, water, wastewater, or other liquid, and that is removable by laboratory filtering. 


C. 	Charges for sewer service shall be set by resolution of the City Council.  
D. 	Residential sewer service charges will be a monthly rate per calculated EQR, assessed on a flat rate basis, as set forth in the table below. The minimum EQR for any service shall be 
1.00. 

Revised 02/01/2012 13-25 	Water and Sewer 
1. 	
The minimum charge is a fixed monthly charge that includes a monthly allotment of metered potable water consumption.  Customers who consume less than the full monthly allotment included in the minimum charge shall pay the full minimum charge.  Customers who consume more than the full monthly allotment included in the minimum charge shall pay the full minimum charge plus a volume charge as described on subparagraph E(2) below. The minimum charge, the monthly allotment of metered potable water consumption and the volume charge shall be set by resolution of the City Council. 

2. 	
The monthly volume charge shall be based on the customer's actual monthly volume of metered potable water consumption and assessed on a set dollar amount ($) per 1,000 gallons basis.  The monthly volume charge shall be calculated according to the following formula: 


Start: Actual Monthly Metered Potable Water Consumption (Gallons) 
Less: Monthly Volume Allotment included in the Minimum Charge (Gallons) 
Equals: Net Monthly Metered Potable Water Consumption (Gallons) 

Net Monthly Metered Potable Water Consumption (Gallons) * $ per 1,000 Gallon 1,000 
3. 	A sewer rate stabilization fund has been established to allow for a phased implementation schedule for the change in monthly non-residential sewer service charges from a flat rate to a volume based charge.  Policies for use of the sewer rate stabilization fund will be established by resolution of the City Council with the purpose of providing for an equitable recovery of the cost of service from each utility customer while taking into consideration the fiscal impacts on individual customers, equity among customer classes, and correlation between metered water consumption and actual discharges of sewage into the sewer system and rate covenant requirements. 
F. 	Determining the Total Annual Sewer System Costs:  The City shall determine the total annual cost necessary to operate, maintain and insure the financial integrity of the sewer system.  These costs shall include, but not be limited to: operations, maintenance and administration, infrastructure repair, replacement, rehabilitation and expansion, debt service, the maintenance of adequate cash and contingency reserves, and compliance with debt financing covenants. 
G. 	Review of Sewer Service Charges:  The City of Fruita shall review the total annual sewer system costs and the revenues earned from the provision of sewer service not less often than every two years and will revise the system established herein to assure that sufficient funds are obtained to adequately operate, maintain and insure the financial integrity of the sewer system. 
H. 	Extra Strength Discharges:  Non-residential customers discharging wastewater into the City sewer system with strength levels in excess of those described below may, at the discretion of 
Revised 02/01/2012 13-26 	Water and Sewer 
the City, be required pay a monthly extra strength surcharge in addition to the standard sewer charges described in paragraph (E). 
1. 	
Customers with BOD discharge strength in excess of 300 mg/L shall be required to pay an extra strength surcharge.  The assumed normal BOD discharge strength is 200 mg/L. 

2. 	
Customers with TSS discharge strength in excess of 300 mg/L shall be required to pay an extra strength surcharge. The assumed normal TSS discharge strength is 200 mg/L. 


I. 	The BOD extra strength surcharge shall be assessed on a $ per pound basis and shall be calculated pursuant to the formula show below.   
Step 1: 	[Customer BOD strength (mg/L)] -[200 mg/L assumed normal BOD discharge strength] =  Customer excess BOD strength (mg/L) 
Step 2: 	[453,592 milligrams per pound] / [Customer excess BOD strength (mg/L)] = Customer excess BOD strength (pounds/L) 
Step 3: 	[Customer wastewater volume (gallons)] / [3.785 liters per gallon] = Customer wastewater volume (L) 
Step 4: 	[Customer wastewater volume (L)] / [Customer excess BOD strength (pounds/L)] = Customer excess BOD (pounds) 
Step 5: 	[Customer excess BOD (pounds)] * [$ per pound BOD extra strength surcharge] = BOD extra strength surcharge that must be paid by the customer 
J. 	The TSS extra strength surcharge shall be assessed on a $ per pound basis and shall be calculated using the same methodology illustrated in paragraph (I) above for the BOD extra strength surcharge. 
K. 	In addition to the extra strength surcharge provided herein, customers discharging extra strength wastewater shall also be required to pay the actual costs incurred by the City to test such discharges. 
L. 	The BOD and TSS extra strength surcharge rates shall be set by resolution of the City Council.

I. INTRODUCTION TO LAND USE CATEGORIES 
17.04.010 PURPOSE. 
This Chapter classifies land uses and activities into use categories on the basis of common functional, product, or physical characteristics, as follows: 
A. 	Categorization. Uses are assigned to the category whose description most closely describes the nature of the primary use. The "Characteristics" subsection of each use category describes the characteristics of each use category. Developments may have more than one primary use. Developments may also have one or more accessory uses. It is the intent of this Chapter to group similar or compatible land uses into specific land use categories. 
B. 	Interpretation. When a use’s category is not clearly identifiable, the Community Development Director may determine the applicable use category or refer the question to the Planning Commission for a public hearing and determination following the procedure under Section 17.07.060. The following is considered to determine what use category the use is in, and whether the activities constitute primary uses or accessory uses: 
1. 	
The description of the activity(ies) in relationship to the function and characteristics of each use category; 

2. 	
The building or structure type associated with each use category, and the relative amount of site or floor space and equipment devoted to the activity; 

3. 	
Relative amounts of sales from each activity; 

4. 	
The customer type for each activity; 

5. 	
The relative number of employees in each activity; 

6. 	
Hours of operation; 

7. 	
Building and site arrangement; 

8. 	
Vehicles used with the activity; 

9. 	
The relative number of vehicle trips generated by the activity; 

10. 	
Signs; 

11. 	
How the use advertises itself; and 


Revised 10/1/2018 17-50 	Land Use Code 
12. 	Whether the activity would function independently of the other activities on the site. 
C. 	Developments with multiple primary uses. When all of the primary uses of a development fall within one use category, then the development is assigned to that use category. For example, a development that contains a retail bakery and a cafe would be classified in the Retail Sales and Service category because all the primary uses are in that category. When the primary uses of a development fall within different use categories, each primary use is classified in the applicable category and is subject to the regulations for that category. 
D. 	Accessory Uses. Accessory uses are allowed by right, in conjunction with, the use unless stated otherwise in the regulations. Also, unless otherwise stated, they are subject to the same regulations as the primary use. Typical accessory uses are listed as examples with the categories. 
E. 	Use of examples. The "Examples" subsection of each use category provides a list of examples of uses that are included in the use category. The names of uses on the lists are generic. They are based on the common meaning of the terms and not on what a specific use may call itself. For example, a use whose business name is "Wholesale Liquidation" but that sells mostly to consumers, would be included in the Retail Sales and Service category rather than the Wholesale Sales category. This is because the actual activity on the site matches the description of the Retail Sales and Service category. If the use cannot be located within one of the categories provided by this Section, the city may at its discretion refer to appropriate outside sources, such as the Land-Based Classification Standards (LBCS) of the American Planning Association or the North American Industry Classification System (NAICS); however, the City of Fruita is not obligated to consider these sources and is not liable for any damages resulting from such use, or resulting from future amendments to the LBCS or NAICS. 
(Ord. 2009-02) 
II. RESIDENTIAL USE CATEGORIES 
17.04.100 GROUP LIVING. 
A. 	Characteristics. Group Living is characterized by the residential occupancy of a structure by a group of people who do not meet the definition of Household Living. The size or composition of the group is different than that of a Household. Tenancy is arranged on a month-to-month basis, or for a longer period. Uses where tenancy may be arranged for a shorter period are not considered residential. They are considered to be a form of transient lodging (see the Retail Sales and Service and Community Service categories). Generally, Group Living structures typically have a common eating area for residents, though individual units may have a kitchen. The residents may or may not receive any combination of care, training, or treatment, as long as they also reside at the site. 
Revised 10/1/2018 17-51 	Land Use Code 
B. Accessory Uses. Accessory uses commonly found are recreational facilities, parking of autos for the occupants and staff, and parking of vehicles for the facility. 
C. 	Examples. Examples include dormitories; fraternities and sororities; monasteries and convents; nursing and convalescent homes; assisted living and similar retirement facilities where some level of daily care is provided by on-site staff; some group homes for the physically disabled, mentally retarded, or emotionally disturbed; some residential programs for drug and alcohol treatment; and alternative or post incarceration facilities.

C. 	Examples. Uses include living in houses, duplexes, apartments, condominiums, retirement center apartments (not otherwise categorized as Group Living), manufactured housing, and other structures with self-contained and permitted dwelling units. Examples also include living in Single Room Occupancy housing, if the provisions are met regarding length of stay and separate meal preparation. 
D. 	Exceptions. 
1. 	
For purposes of this code, a recreational vehicle is not considered a dwelling. 

2. 	
Lodging in a dwelling unit or Single Room Occupancy Hotel (SRO) where less than two thirds of the units are rented on a monthly basis or longer is considered a hotel or motel use and is classified in the Retail Sales and Service category. SROs which include common dining are classified as Group Living. 


3 	Guest houses that contain kitchen facilities are not accessory to Household Living uses; such houses may be allowed as Accessory Dwellings or as part of a multifamily development, subject to applicable code requirements. 
4 	In certain situations, lodging where tenancy may be arranged for periods less than one (1) month may be classified as a Community Service use, such as publicly assisted, short term housing or mass shelter in the event of an emergency declared by a government agency.

To help minimize development-planning costs, avoid misunderstandings or misinterpretation of city requirements, and ensure compliance with the requirements of this Title, a pre-application meeting between the applicant and the Community Development Department and other staff is encouraged or required as provided in this Title. For applications in which a pre-application meeting is required, a pre-submittal meeting will not be held unless a pre-application meeting has been held. Pre­application meetings are valid for a period of six (6) months from the date of the meeting, after which a new pre-application meeting may be required. Pre-application meetings may not adequately address all city requirements or requirements of outside agencies (e.g., CDOT, Health Department, Mesa County).  Applicants are encouraged to seek information on permit requirements from other agencies, as applicable.

E. 	All applications for land development approvals required under this Title must be complete before the permit issuing authority is required to consider the application. A notice of completeness or incompleteness shall be issued by the Community Development Department within fifteen (15) days of the receipt of an application.  Upon a determination that an application for a permit or approval is complete, the Community Development Department shall issue a notice of completeness to the applicant and place the application on the agenda of the Planning Commission, City Council, or Board of Adjustment if review by such body is required under this Title. If such review is not required, the Community Development Director shall act on the application pursuant to this Land Use Code. 
F. 	The burden of persuasion on the issue of whether the development or use applied for, if completed as proposed, will comply with the requirements of this Title and should be approved remains, at all times, on the applicant. The Community Development Director may request additional information from the applicant during the course of reviewing the application if, based on professional expertise or relevant input provided by the Planning Commission or City Council, the Director believes that such information would be helpful in evaluating the application for compliance with the requirements of this Land Use Code.  
G. 	The city shall make every reasonable effort to process review applications as expeditiously as possible, consistent with the need to ensure that the application conforms to the requirements of this Title.

17.07.010 ESTABLISHMENT OF ZONES. To carry out the purposes of the Master Plan and the purposes and provisions of this Title, the incorporated area of the City of Fruita is hereby divided into the following zones for the purposes set forth below: 
A. 	Agricultural Residential (AR). The purpose of the AR zone is to allow low density rural residential and agricultural uses, to preserve and enhance the rural character of the outlying areas of Fruita, and discourage inappropriate or premature urban development.  
B. 	Rural Estate (RE). The purpose of the RE zone is to preserve the natural and agricultural landscape as a transition between the Rural Residential (RR) zone, AR zone, and the community separator through minimum requirements and incentives for rural land preservation and clustered residential lots. 
C. 	Rural Residential (RR). The purpose of the RR zone is to allow low density residential uses compatible with rural areas. 
D. 	Community Residential (CR). The purpose of the CR zone is to allow for moderate density detached single-family residential neighborhoods with the inclusion of other housing types such as attached dwelling units (e.g. apartments and townhouses). 
E. 	Large Lot Residential (LLR). The purpose of the LLR zone is to allow larger lot developments in the same areas as the CR zone and other areas as appropriate. 
F. 	South Fruita Residential (SFR). The purpose of the SFR zone is to allow a variety of low to moderate density residential areas compatible with existing low density development, the Colorado National Monument and the Colorado River. 
G. 	Downtown Mixed Use (DMU). The purpose of the DMU zone is to maintain and enhance downtown as a vibrant, pedestrian-oriented commercial and residential area and as the civic heart of the community. Mixed use development, such as commercial on the ground floor and residential above the ground floor is encouraged 
Revised 10/1/2018 17-80 	Land Use Code 
within this zone. The intent of this zone with regard to housing is to allow existing residential uses and provide housing options within walking distance of commercial and civic uses without compromising the integrity of the downtown commercial core. 
H. 	Community Mixed Use (CMU). The purpose of the CMU zone is to establish walkable neighborhoods that are residential in scale and character, integrating a variety of housing, open spaces, and community services.  
I. 	Monument Preservation (MP). The MP zone is intended to provide a recreational and environmental buffer between the Colorado National Monument and Bureau of Land Management lands, and urban development with low intensity uses that preserve open space quality.  
J. 	General Commercial (GC). The GC zone is intended to accommodate commercial development in appropriate areas with appropriate access, landscaping, frontage improvements, setbacks, screening and multi-modal access and connectivity. 
K. 	Industrial (I). The purpose of the I zone is to encourage non-polluting industrial and research and development activities designed to meet acceptable state and locally established standards for noise, dust, effluent (e.g., sewage pre-treatment), odor, and other impacts typically associated with industrial uses. 
L. 	Planned Unit Development (PUD). A PUD zone provides a flexible, performance-based alternative to standard development requirements where adjustments to some of the standard requirements of this Title may be permitted in order to produce a development that is superior in its design and functionality to that which would result from the strict application of the standards under a non-PUD proposal. Applications for PUD approval must demonstrate that the proposal is consistent with the intent of the city’s Master Plan and equally or better meets the intent of the design standards for which adjustment is sought. 
M. 	Community Services and Recreation (CSR). The purpose of the CSR zone is to provide public and private recreational land, facilities, schools, fire stations, libraries, fairgrounds and other public and quasi-public lands and buildings. The zone includes open space areas, which are set aside to prevent environmental damage to sensitive areas and to limit development in areas that are unsuitable for development due to flooding or geologic hazards. The CSR zone may be applied to parks, outdoor recreation facilities, open space corridors, environmental areas, trails, recreational facilities, and similar areas. The CSR zone helps implement the open space, trails and parks policies of the city’s Master Plan.

¹ Non-residential uses in the CMU zone are subject to the supplemental zoning district standards in Section 17.07.070 (J). 
²Duplex, multi-family and attached single family developments in the CR zone are permitted only as a percentage of a detached single-family residential development. See the Density and Dimensional Standards Table in Section 17.07.060(I). 
G. 	Uses Not Itemized in Land Use/Zoning Table. When a use is proposed and no zone allows for such use under the Land Use/Zoning Table above, the applicant may request from the Community Development Department a determination of a zone in which the use may be allowed. The applicant shall submit a written request, which describes the particular use proposed. The use may be deemed an Allowed Use or a Conditional Use upon the finding of the following: 
1. 	
Such use is appropriate to the physiographic and general environmental character of the zone to which it is added; 

2. 	
Such use does not create any more hazards to, or alteration of, the natural environment than the minimum amount normally resulting from the other permitted uses, or uses conditionally allowed, in the zone to which it is added, as applicable; 

3. 	
Such use does not create any more offensive noise, vibration, dust, heat, smoke, odor, glare, or other objectionable influences or more traffic hazards than the minimum amount normally resulting from the other uses permitted in the zone to which it is added; 


Revised 9/30/16 	17-91 Land Use Code 
4. 	
Such use is generally consistent with the uses existing and permitted in the   zone to which it is added; and 

5. 	
Such use is in conformance with the goals, policies and Master Plan of the city and the purposes of this Title. 


H. 	Schedule of Density/Height/Bulk/Location Requirements in Zones. 
1. 	
The following standards apply to all uses and development, except as modified pursuant to Chapter 17.11 Design Standards or Chapter 17.17 Planned Unit Developments.  

2. 	
Maximum density may not be achievable on every lot or parcel, as the development must conform to applicable setbacks, coverage, parking, drainage, public improvements, landscaping and other code requirements including density bonus requirements. 

3. 	
Connection to the city’s wastewater collection and treatment system is required for all single-family residential lots smaller than three (3) acres in size. Larger lots may be required for multi-family and non-residential developments that do not connect to the city's wastewater collection and treatment system. All uses with existing individual sewage disposal systems that require repair or replacement, or are part of a larger development plan and are within four hundred 

(400) feet of the existing city wastewater collection system, as measured to the closest property line, shall connect to the city system. All property to be annexed with existing land uses using individual sewage disposal systems must connect to the city wastewater collection system if they are within four hundred (400) feet or will be within four hundred (400) feet of a city wastewater collection system once the development to be annexed is completed. 

4. 	
Standards containing a slash (x/y) indicate standards for primary buildings (x) and accessory buildings (y).

Revised 9/30/16 	17-95 Land Use Code 
17.07.070 SUPPLEMENTAL ZONING REGULATIONS AND STANDARDS. In addition to regulations contained elsewhere in this Title, the use of land and buildings in all zones shall be governed by the following: 
A. 	Bed and Breakfast. Where bed and breakfast uses are allowed, they must meet the following conditions and standards: 
1. 	
Where the applicable zoning district allows bed and breakfast uses as a conditional use, the use must be a residential dwelling that contains no more than four (4) guest bedrooms where overnight lodging, with or without meals, is provided for compensation. Bed and Breakfast uses with more than four (4) guest bedrooms are considered hotels or motels; 

2. 	
Kitchen and dining facilities in bed and breakfast dwellings may serve only residents and guests and shall not be operated or used for any commercial activity other than that necessary for bed and breakfast purposes; 

3. 	
The bed and breakfast use shall not change the residential character of the dwelling if located in a residential zone or area; 

4. 	
In residential zones (including residential developments in the CMU zone), there shall be no advertising display or other indication of the bed and breakfast use on the premises other than a sign that is in compliance with the provisions of Chapter 17.41; 

5. 	
A minimum of one parking space per guest bedroom and resident bedroom shall be required.  Screening may also be required; 

6. 	
The bed and breakfast facility shall comply with all Building Codes adopted by the city; 

7. 	
It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to demonstrate that any declarations, covenants, conditions or restrictions on the property allow for a bed and breakfast use; and 

8. 	
Where a bed and breakfast use is subject to Conditional Use Permit approval, any existing or proposed uses in addition to that of a dwelling unit (e.g. home occupation, accessory dwelling unit, etc.) are considered as part of the conditional use review. 


B. 	Home Occupations. A Home Occupation is a commercial or business use within a dwelling unit by the residents thereof, which is incidental or secondary to the principle use of the dwelling for residential purposes. The purpose of this Section is to allow commercial ventures, which by the nature of the venture are appropriate in scale and intensity of use to be operated within a dwelling. Home occupations require a City of Fruita Business License and any other local, state or federal permits that may be required. Two types of home occupations are authorized by this Code: 1) Home Occupations meeting the standards of this Section, as provided below, are permitted outright; and 2) Home Occupations exceeding the criteria or standards of this Section may be permitted subject to approval of a Conditional Use Permit.

4. 	
Prohibited Home Occupation Uses: 

a. 	
There shall be no advertising display, signage, or other indication of the home occupation on the premises other than that which is allowed by the applicable zone for residential uses as provided for in the Sign Code in Chapter 17.41.

Where the City of Fruita has approved construction drawings for a project, unless superseded by state or federal law, the project-specific “approved for construction” drawings and specifications shall control, followed by written criteria, or specifications published by other entities. Where local City of Fruita documents are silent, the most stringent external standard or specification shall apply. 
F. 	Exceptions to Lot Area and Dimensional Standards. Lot area and dimensions shall conform to the Schedule of Density and Dimensional Standards Table in Section 
17.07.060 (I), except as amended by the design standards of Chapter 11 of this Title, PUD zoning as per Chapter 17 of this Title, and as follows: 
1. 	
Minimum frontage. All residential lots, including cul-de-sac lots where vehicle access is provided from the abutting street, shall have a minimum street frontage width of twenty-eight (28) feet excluding areas set aside for utility pedestal installations. Flag lots and or lots with shared driveways are permitted to have less than twenty-eight (28) feet of street frontage as determined through the subdivision review process and as per Section 43.050 of this Title.  

2. 	
Utility Facilities. Electric substations, telephone switching facilities, irrigation structures, and similar limited impact facilities shall be permitted to occupy a lot area smaller than that provided for in these regulations provided such facilities are properly screened and buffered from surrounding properties and the street. 


G. 	Height Exceptions and Permitted Setback Encroachments. 
1. 	Height limits do not apply to any: chimney; spire; bulkhead,; elevator; water collection, recirculation, or storage system; geothermal heating system; solar photovoltaic equipment; wind turbine; belfry; cupola; windmill; antenna; or any similar structure or necessary mechanical appurtenance not designed for occupancy extending above the roof line, provided such structure does not extend more than ten 
Revised 9/30/16 	17-99 Land Use Code 
(10) feet above the highest roof line and does not exceed more than ten (10) percent of the area of the roof where it projects more than four (4) feet above the highest roof plane.

H. 	Fences. The purpose of this Section is to ensure fences erected within the city do not impede traffic safety, do not conflict with applicable codes, and impose no deleterious effect on any neighborhood. A Planning Clearance shall be required before erecting, moving or altering a fence in the city. Fences shall conform to the following requirements: 
1. 	
No fence shall be erected in such location upon any lot or property in a manner constituting a traffic hazard because of obstruction of view. The City of Fruita Design Criteria and Construction Specifications Manual and the City of Fruita Land Use Code shall be used as the criteria for determining compliance. No fence shall be constructed to within four (4) feet of or prevent access to any fire hydrant, utility pedestal, vault, cabinet, or similar feature.  

2. 	
Fences shall be constructed of durable materials, which may include but are not limited to, wire (e.g., chain link), vinyl-coated wire, wrought iron, wood, extruded plastic (e.g., from fence manufacturer), and other materials similar in appearance and durability. Unacceptable materials that are visible to the public include: glass, tires, razor wire, barbed wire and/or concertina wire, junk, and any material that presents a public health or safety hazard.  

The prohibition on razor wire, barbed wire, concertina wire and similar wire fences does not apply to the Industrial (I) zone provided that there are no more than three (3) strands or one (1) coil of wire and the fence is located at least five (5) feet from the public right-of-way. The wires are not counted in the height calculation. Electric and barbed wire fencing is allowed in zones which allow large animals (such as horses, cows and sheep) only when properly installed and necessary to contain large animals, and the fence must be located no closer than ten (10) feet to the public right-of-way.  

3. 	
There shall be no fence or wall erected which exceeds six (6) feet in height as measured from the natural grade except as permitted in subsection 6 below. Where the city has approved construction of a retaining wall, the height of the retaining wall shall not be included in the height of the fence. An increase of up to two (2) inches is allowed when spacing for drainage under a fence is needed. 


Revised 9/30/16 	17-100 Land Use Code 
4. 	
Except as allowed for corner lots (subsection 5 below), fences in the required front yard setback shall not exceed thirty-six (36) inches in height; however, such fences may be increased to forty-eight (48) inches maximum height if the fence material is at a ratio of not less than half open space to half closed space for every square foot for that part of the fence extending above thirty-six (36) inches in height. Examples of fence types that would typically comply include: chain link, picket, split rail, and similar fences. 

5. 	
On corner lots, solid fences up to six (6) feet in height within a front yard setback may be permitted on one street frontage provided the fence conforms to the required clear sight triangle.  

6. 	
Fences in excess of six (6) feet shall comply with applicable building codes and all required setbacks for primary buildings, as applicable. Fences in Industrial (I) zones may exceed six (6) feet as provided for in subsection 2 above.  

7. 	
Fences in zones which permit a zero building setback must meet design standard requirements of Chapter 11 of this Title. 

8. 	
A gated fence across a driveway must be designed so that the longest vehicle using the driveway can completely clear the traveled way of the public street when the gate is closed. 

9. 	
Where a fence is proposed in conjunction with a development or change in use, the location, height, materials, and detailing of the fence may be subject to other requirements or limitations to ensure consistency with the purposes of this Title. 

10. 
All fences shall be properly maintained by the owner so as to not become a public nuisance or hazard. 

11. 
For properties fronting on major arterial roadways as identified in the Fruita Master Plan, the front property line along the roadway is permitted to be fenced as long as the fencing does not encroach into the clear sight triangle.  

12. 
Any appeal of the City Manager's decision on a fence permit shall be made to the City Council as provided in Section 17.05.060 of this Title.  


I. Landscaping Requirements. 
1. 	
For single-family and duplex dwelling units with a front yard, at least one (1) tree in the front yard is required to be planted and maintained within six (6) months of issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy.  

2. 	
Except for development subject to Level One Design Standards of Chapter 11 of this Title, no less than ten (10) percent of a lot or parcel developed for multi-family or non-residential land uses must be landscaped. At least half of this landscape must be provided on the front half (street sides) of the development unless the front setback is permitted to be, and will be, fifteen (15) feet or less, in which case the required 


Revised 9/30/16 	17-101 Land Use Code 
landscaping may be located anywhere on the property provided all other requirements are met. Landscaping must include at least one (1) small tree for every five hundred 
(500) square feet, one (1) medium tree for every one thousand (1,000) square feet, or one (1) large tree for every 1,500 square feet of landscaped area along with two (2) shrubs for every tree and appropriate groundcover.

3. 	
For large industrial land uses with significant amounts of outdoor storage and/or operations, the outdoor storage/operation area(s) are not required to be used in the calculation of the minimum 10% landscaping required. 

4. 	
Landscape improvements must follow the landscaping requirements of the Appendix of the Fruita Land Use Code including quality, size, type, planting, and location considerations. Landscaping required to be installed to meet the minimum requirements of this Title (including conditions of approval on a land development application) must be maintained to continue to meet the minimum requirements of this Title.  

5. 	
The types of trees and other vegetation to be planted within public right-of-ways will be determined by the decision making body (Community Development Director or City Council) based on the requirements of the Appendix of the Land Use Code. 


J. 	Non-Residential Uses in Community Mixed Use Zones. In addition to the requirements of Chapter 17.11, Design Standards, Non-Residential Uses in the CMU zone are regulated as follows: 
1. 	Commercial uses that individually do not exceed a gross floor area of two thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet per commercial center are permitted; 
1. 	Commercial uses that individually exceed a gross floor area of two thousand five hundred (2,500) square feet per use, and commercial centers that exceed a total of twenty-five thousand (25,000) square feet for all uses in the center, may be allowed subject to Conditional Use Permit approval. For the purpose of this Section, a 
“commercial center” is defined as the aggregate of all commercial uses located within 
six hundred (600) feet of one another, regardless of property ownership. Uses not under the same ownership, or separated from one another by a street, driveway, right­of-way, easement, open space or other feature, are still considered to be in the same center if located within six hundred (600) feet of one another; 
3. 	
A new commercial use shall not be permitted where it would be located within one-half (1/2) mile of an existing or city-approved commercial use that is also zoned CMU. This provision does not apply to commercial uses existing or proposed in the GC, DMU, or I zones. 

4. 	
Compliance with the Supplemental Zoning Regulations under Section 17.07.070 and Design Standards under Chapter 17.11 is required. 


Revised 9/30/16 	17-102 Land Use Code 
K. 	Storage of Vehicles and Similar Equipment on Residential or Agricultural Property. 
1. 	
For the purposes of this section, "vehicle" is defined as any automobile, truck, tractor, or other machinery of any kind, including every device in, on, or by which any person or property is or may be transported or drawn upon a public highway, road or street, excepting devices moved by human power or used exclusively upon stationary rails or tracks.  

2. 	
Trailers, airplanes, boats, recreational vehicles, travel trailers, campers and similar items may be stored on property used mainly for residential purposes as long as the storage is at least ten (10) feet from public right-of-way, excluding alleys.

3. 	
It shall be unlawful to store or otherwise have, maintain or allow on a single parcel of land in the City of Fruita more than one (1) non-farm vehicle not having current Colorado license plates or registration unless the vehicle is in an approved junkyard or other similar use where such vehicle storage is permitted. Such vehicle must be stored within an enclosed building or stored behind the front plane of the house or other primary building on the property. 

4. 	
There shall be no limit on the number of active or serviceable agricultural vehicles on a parcel of land, regardless of whether such vehicles have current registration or license plates; however, the restrictions of one (1) vehicle per parcel of land shall apply to agricultural vehicles which are clearly abandoned or which are not in their present condition suitable for active agricultural use. 

5. 	
Work vehicles exceeding one-ton capacity, other heavy duty vehicles or heavy equipment not typically associated with a residential use shall not be stored on property under two acres in size and used or zoned primarily for residential purposes except for deliveries or for construction or maintenance work to be done at the site.

Storage, as used in this subsection, means the location of the above-mentioned items for more than forty-eight (48) hours during any seven (7) day period. 


L. 	Temporary Uses. Temporary uses are characterized by their short term or seasonal nature and by the fact that permanent improvements are not made to the site. A land use that occurs on a specific property for more than 6 months in a calendar year is not permitted as a temporary use. Temporary uses include, but are not limited to: construction trailers, leasing offices, garage sales, temporary carnivals and fairs, parking lot or sidewalk sales, mobile food vendors, seasonal sales such as Christmas tree sales, produce stands, and similar uses. Special Events such as city-wide festivals or carnivals conducted on school sites are exempt from these provisions (but a Special Event Permit may be required). Temporary uses must comply with the criteria listed below. The city may require a temporary use to cease at any time, if it is found to be in violation of any of these criteria. 
1. 	The following criteria and standards apply to all temporary uses:

Revised 9/30/16 	17-105 Land Use Code 
M. 	Wood Burning Stoves, Fireplaces, Gas Log Fireplaces and Pellet Stoves. 
1. 	
Purpose: Air pollution in the Fruita area has become an issue of concern and has been documented by the Mesa County Health Department and the Mesa County Air Quality Planning Committee. It has been found that a major contributor to the air pollution problem in the Grand Valley is the widespread use of wood stoves and fireplaces that do not have air pollution control devices. 

2. 	
Devices Prohibited: New dwellings and remodeled portions of existing structures shall not contain wood burning stoves, fireplaces, coal burning or similar heating devices not approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). 

3. 	
Devices Allowed: Only EPA approved natural gas fireplaces, EPA approved pellet stoves, and EPA approved wood burning stoves and fireplaces shall be allowed in new or remodeled structures. 


N. 	Outdoor Storage, HVAC Equipment and Other Service Functions. Outdoor storage, HVAC equipment and other service functions must be incorporated into the overall design of the building and landscaping plan. Views of these areas shall be screened from visibility from abutting public rights-of-way and the ground floor of abutting residential land uses. These requirements do not apply to single family or duplex dwelling developments. 
O. 	Waste Storage. Every use shall provide for enclosed solid waste storage, sorting, and recycling facilities, as applicable. Such facilities shall be oriented away from building entrances, setback at least ten (10) feet from any public right-of-way and screened from view of all public rights-of-way (with the exception of alleys) and abutting land uses by locating them inside buildings (as practical), or by placing them behind a sight obscuring fence, wall, landscaping, or combination thereof. The storage of oils, chemicals, wastewater and other liquid contaminants must be stored and contained in structures approved by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment to prevent them from leaking. 
P. 	Repair, Painting and Similar Uses. For non-residential land uses, all repair, painting, bodywork, and similar activities, including the storage of refuse and vehicle parts, must take place within an enclosed structure (surrounded by walls and a roof). Residential land uses must meet all other city requirements regarding such uses. 
Q. 	Dust, Noise, Odor. Each business, commercial, or industrial development is required to meet or exceed the standards for dust, noise and odor, as adopted by the City of Fruita, Mesa County Health Department, state law, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.  
R. 	New Outdoor Lighting. 
1. 	Street lighting shall be required for all new developments. All intersections shall be illuminated. If there is more than six hundred (600) feet between intersections, additional lighting shall be installed between intersections. Where a new street 
Revised 9/30/16 	17-106 Land Use Code 
intersects with an existing street that is not illuminated, the developer will be responsible for the cost of illuminating such intersection. The local electric service provider and the City of Fruita must approve street lighting plans.  
2. 	The following regulations shall apply to all new outdoor lighting on private land: 
a. 	
All fixtures shall be fully shielded. For purposes of this subsection, fully shielded shall mean fixtures constructed so that light rays emitted are projected below, and not above, the horizontal plane of the fixture. 

b. 	
Lighting shall be downcast and so placed as to prevent the light rays or illumination from being cast beyond property lines. 

c. 	
The maximum height of pole lights shall not exceed thirty-five (35) feet in height. The maximum height of lights attached to a building shall not exceed twenty (20) feet in height. Lights required by other government agencies for safety purposes, such as Federal Aviation Administration requirements for lights on certain tall structures, are exempt from these standards.   

d.

17.07.080 LAND USE COMPATIBILITY CRITERIA. 
Revised 9/30/16 	17-113 Land Use Code 
The purpose of this Section is to provide a fair and consistent manner in which to consider compatibility within the overall context of the Fruita Master Plan, existing adjacent land uses, applicable zoning district requirements, and other city codes and regulations. Nothing in this Section shall prevent the City of Fruita from denying a land use application based on relevant Code requirements or taking enforcement action against a property owner where a nuisance or other Code violation occurs.  
For all land uses, “compatibility” is provided when a proposed land use can coexist with other 
existing uses in the vicinity without one use having a disproportionate or severe impact on the other use(s). The city decision-making body may consider other uses existing and approved, and may consider all potential impacts relative to what customarily occurs in the applicable zone and those which are foreseeable, given the range of land uses allowed in the zone. The review authority may require conditions of approval to promote compatibility between uses. 
(Ord. 2016-04, S1) 
17.07. 090 LEGAL NON-CONFORMING USES, STRUCTURES, AND LOTS. Any use, structure, or lot in existence and lawful at the time of adoption of this Title or any subsequent amendment hereto, which is not in conformance with the provisions of this Title or amendment, shall be considered a legal non-conforming use, structure, or lot and may continue in existence pursuant to the following: 
A. 	A legal non-conforming use may be extended throughout the same building, provided no structural alteration of such building is made for the purpose of such extension. A legal non-conforming use of property not contained within a building shall not be expanded.  
B. 	A legal non-conforming use shall not be changed to any other use except a conforming use.   
C. 	Whenever a legal non-conforming use of land, structure, sign, or a building has been discontinued for a continuous period of one (1) year, future use of the land, structure, sign, or building shall be in conformance with all applicable city regulations. 
D. 	A structure, building or sign which does not meet the setback, height, size, or other site requirements of this Chapter may be repaired, maintained, or extended, provided any such repair, maintenance, or extension is in full compliance with all applicable city regulations. 
E. 	A non-conforming structure, building or sign which has been damaged to an extent not exceeding fifty (50) percent of its assumed market value on the day before the damage occurred may be restored in conformance with the city's building codes, provided such work is commenced within one (1) year of the date of damage. If the structure, sign, or building is damaged to the extent of more than fifty (50) percent of assumed market value, the non-conforming structure, building, or sign must be discontinued. Assumed market value for a building shall be determined by multiplying the most recent assessed value of the damaged building by four (4). This section shall not apply to single-family dwellings. Legal non-conforming single-family dwellings may be rebuilt in compliance with the current building codes.  
Revised 9/30/16 	17-114 Land Use Code 
F. 	An individual lot which was legally created but does not meet the minimum lot area or other dimensional requirement for the zone in which it is located shall be considered a legal non-conforming lot. Such legal non-conforming lot may be used provided all zoning and other applicable city regulations, including but not limited to setbacks, are met. 
G. 	Mobile and manufactured homes shall be subject to the provisions of this Code on the date they are removed from their pad or foundation; however, if a mobile or manufactured home was legally established as a single-family residential dwelling unit, the mobile or manufactured home can be replaced on the same site even if single-family residential land uses are not permitted, nor does the replacement require a Conditional Use Permit, but all other standards apply. 
H. 	Non-conformities should be brought into compliance with all city regulations before annexation and those non-conformities that are to be permitted to continue as legal non­conformities must be identified in the Ordinance annexing the property.  
I. 	A use that was legally established without a Conditional Use Permit shall not be deemed non-conforming solely because a Conditional Use Permit is now required for the use.  Any expansion or other significant changes to the land use which requires the Conditional Use Permit will require approval of a new Conditional Use Permit before the expansion or other significant change.

2) 	Trees may be grouped or clustered for compatibility with the overall site design and need not be spaced at regular intervals of forty (40) feet. 
9. 	Lighting 
a. 	
Street lighting should be provided along all streets. Generally more, smaller lights, as opposed to fewer, high-intensity lights, should be used. 

b. 	
Street-lights should be installed on both sides of the street at intervals no greater than seventy-five (75) feet. 

c. 	
Decorative light posts are recommended for free standing lights and lighting should be low in height to complement the human scale.

17.11.010 PURPOSE. It is the purpose of this Chapter to set forth the design standards under which the architecture and site design of certain developments are reviewed in order to meet the goals, objectives and design criteria set forth in the City of Fruita Master Plan.  
The 2008 Community Plan strives to promote high quality growth that preserves Fruita’s 
character and increases economic sustainability. The Plan goes on to call for the creation of vibrant neighborhoods with a diversity of housing options that allow Fruita residents to live, work, and play in their community. As such, the design standards in this chapter are proposed to meet these goal statements combining the needs for strong livable neighborhoods and long-term economic development. These standards are intended to set the course to meet the desired character of the community. Because not all development opportunities can be predicted or accommodated in even the best written code, Section 17.11.020(B) is included with this chapter in order to provide developers a tremendous level of flexibility when applying the regulations and requirements in this chapter. The purpose of this chapter is to quantify and qualify 
requirements to meet the community’s character and goals. For any project, should an applicant 
believe their project is meeting the broad goals of the Community Plan, but not necessarily specific requirements of this chapter; the applicant is encouraged to utilize 17.11.020 (B). This chapter is intended to help guide and provide direction for an applicant, and will encourage any high quality project that meets community goals and objectives. All interpretations of the requirements of this chapter shall meet this purpose.    
(Ord. 2009-02) 
17.11.020 APPLICABILITY, ADJUSTMENTS, GUIDELINES VERSUS STANDARDS. 
A. Applicability.  
In addition to other applicable regulations, the design standards of this Chapter apply to non-residential developments that are located in the following zones: Downtown Mixed 
Revised 8/31//2018 17-125 Land Use Code 
Use (DMU); Community Mixed Use (CMU); Tourist Commercial (TC); General Commercial (GC). These design standards also are applicable to all multi-family residential units and new lots in new subdivisions (subdivisions approved 4/3/2009) that include attached single family residential units; single family detached residential lots measuring less than 7,000 square feet in size, residential lots measuring less than sixty 
(60) feet in width and only those parts of new subdivisions containing these types of residential units regardless of the zone in which it is located. 
The architectural and site design standards of this Chapter are applicable to new buildings and also building additions and exterior remodels which building costs exceed 50% of the 
Mesa County Assessor’s current actual value of the current improvements in the subject 
property. 
B. Adjustments. 
The provisions of this Chapter may be adjusted at the discretion of the city decision-making body, as applicable, without the need for a variance, where the city decision-
making body finds that an applicant’s proposed alternative design meets the intent of the 
regulations which are to be adjusted, and the proposed design provides compatibility between the proposed development and uses adjacent to the subject site. Where this 
Chapter provides “Guiding Principles,” those principles are to be used in evaluating 
adjustment requests. 
C. Guidelines Versus Standards.  
The terms “shall” and “must” indicate a code standard. The standard is mandatory but may be adjusted, as described in subsection B, above. Statements of “intent” and code provisions using the word “should” or “encourage” are guidelines. “Guiding Principles” 
are guidelines. The graphics contained in this Chapter also serve as guidelines; however, some graphics also reference a quantitative standard (e.g., percentage or dimensions).  While guidelines are discretionary in nature, they must be addressed by the applicant, and the city decision-making body may apply them as mandatory requirements in situations where the applicant has requested code adjustments. 
(Ord. 2009-02, Ord. 2013-06) 
17.11.030 LEVEL ONE DESIGN STANDARDS. In addition to other applicable regulations, the following architectural and site design standards are applicable to all development other than single family detached and duplex residential developments, in the Downtown Mixed Use (DMU) and Community Mixed Use (CMU) zones with the following exceptions: 
-All properties touching Grand Avenue between Highway 6 & 50 and Sycamore Street -All properties touching Highway 6 & 50 between Pine Street and Plum Street -All properties west of Apple Street, south of Cleveland Street and north of Highway 6 &    
50 
Revised 8/31//2018 17-126 	Land Use Code 
-All property between the west end of Pabor Way and Little Salt Wash 
A. Guiding Principles 
New buildings and exterior remodels are expected to honor the historical development 
pattern and character of downtown Fruita. While many communities attempt to “create” or “re-create” an urban downtown of their own, Fruita already has a downtown containing a mixture of historic buildings and contemporary buildings, a large central plaza, and attractive residential neighborhoods in and around the downtown area. Fruita’s Mixed Use zones are intended to support traditional downtown and village commercial development. New development and redevelopment should support a walkable and attractive area with shopping, restaurants, residences, parks, and civic, office and other employment centers. The building design standards draw on historic 
elements of the downtown while allowing for a contemporary interpretation of Fruita’s 
history. It is not the intent of the City of Fruita to create an architectural theme or to freeze time, but rather to ensure that new buildings, remodels and redevelopment fit within the context of their historic surroundings, as applicable, and support compact, walkable districts. The key elements of mixed use development are summarized as follows: 
1. 	
Architecture based on local vocabulary of building styles and elements, including compatibility with historic structures, where applicable. 

2. 	
Building height and articulated facades that create a sense of street enclosure at a human scale. 

3. 	
Provide appropriate design 
standards for the Downtown Core 
(South of Pabor) and the adjacent 
Downtown Mixed Use 
neighborhood (between Pabor and 
Ottley). 


4. 	
Provide appropriate design 
standards for commercial and 
mixed use developments in the Community Mixed Use zone. 


5. 	
Transition building height between the Mixed Use zones and the adjacent residential neighborhoods. 

6. 	
Require the use of contextually appropriate materials, textures and colors. 

7. 	
Promote a storefront character (windows, pedestrian shelter, furnishings, etc.) within planned commercial centers. 

8. 	
Encourage a diversity of building facades and rooflines that fall into a consistent rhythm. 

9. 	
Promote corner lots as focal points with furnishings and public art. 


B. Building Design Standards: 
1. 	Height. 


Revised 8/31//2018 17-127 	Land Use Code 
a. 	
Maximum Height. The maximum allowable height is five (5)stories in the DMU zone Downtown Core and four (4) stories for buildings in the CMU zone that mix residential and commercial land uses, except that buildings, or portions of buildings, located less than one hundred (100) feet from Elm Street south of Pabor Ave. and north of Highway 6 & 50 shall not exceed thirty-five (35) feet in height.  The maximum height of all portions of a building that are within one hundred  

(100) feet of a single family dwelling shall step-down in roof elevation, i.e., from fifty (50) feet to thirty-five (35) feet to provide a more sympathetic scale with adjacent single family dwellings. 

b. 	
Minimum Height. New buildings constructed within the Downtown Core and abutting Aspen Avenue shall be built to a height of not less than twenty-two (22) feet to maintain an intimate, pedestrian scale relative to the street, and a sense of street enclosure. Single story buildings in the Downtown and Community Mixed Use zones shall incorporate parapets that reach the minimum required height. 


2. 	Setback. 
a. 	Zero Front Setback Required. All non-residential buildings, including mixed use buildings containing residential and non-residential uses, shall maintain a zero setback from a street property line. This standard is met when at least fifty (50) percent of the abutting street frontage has a building placed at the street property line, as generally depicted below. 
Example of Zero Setback 
Exceptions: 
An exception to the zero setback regulation may be approved or required in the following situations: 
1. 	Where a proposed building is adjacent to a single family dwelling. 

Revised 8/31//2018 17-128 	Land Use Code 
2. 	
Where the sidewalk width is extended for public use, or a public plaza is proposed to be placed between the building and public right-of-way. Exceptions may also be made for planter boxes incorporated into the building wall, provided the planter box does not exceed a height of thirty (30) inches above sidewalk grade. 

3. 	
Where a public utility easement or similar restricting legal condition makes conformance with the zero setback impracticable, the building shall instead be placed as close to the street as possible given the legal constraint, and pedestrian amenities (e.g., plaza, courtyard, landscaping, outdoor seating area, etc.) shall be provided within the street setback in said location. 


b. 	
Side and Rear Yards. Side or rear yard setbacks shall conform to applicable building codes. The city decision-making body may require additional setbacks where necessary for storm water drainage, vision clearance at intersections, access to utilities, or similar purposes. 

c. 	
Right-of-Way. The city may allow the placement of pedestrian amenities; such as, street furnishings, canopies, awnings, signs and similar features in the sidewalk right-of-way, subject to Site Design Review or a Temporary Encroachment Agreement. 


3. 	Building Form 
a. 	Overall Form. Architectural designs shall address all four (4) sides of a building in the DMU and CMU zones. The predominant form in the Downtown Core is a generally “flat” elevation with any recesses, projections, or rounded corners (“articulations”) appearing subordinate to the dominant rectangular form. The 
predominant form in the Downtown Mixed Use zone may be similar to the Core, or it may be more residential in character and contain pitched roofs, porches, bay windows and similar features. New buildings should reflect the predominant form, while expressing individuality. 
Example of Building Form (<35’ height) 

Revised 8/31//2018 17-129 	Land Use Code 
4. 	Storefront Character 
a. 	
Fenestration (Windows and Doors). Except as approved for parking structures or accessory structures, buildings shall provide display windows and windowed doors to express a store front character. The ground floor, street-facing elevation(s) of all buildings shall comprise least sixty (60) percent transparent windows, measured as a section extending the width of the street-facing elevation between the building base (or thirty (30) inches above the sidewalk grade, whichever is less) and a plane seventy-two (72) inches above the sidewalk grade. Upper floors may have less window area, but should follow the vertical lines of the lower level piers and the horizontal definition of spandrels and any cornices. Buildings without a street-facing elevation, such as those that are setback behind another building and those that are oriented to a civic space (e.g., internal plaza or court), shall meet the sixty (60) percent transparency standard on all elevations abutting civic spaces(s) and elevations containing a primary entrance. All side and rear elevations, except for zero lot line/common wall elevations (where windows are not required), shall provide no less than thirty 

(30) percent transparency. Where an exception to the window transparency requirement is made for parking garages or similar structures, the building design must incorporate openings or other detailing that resembles the window patterns (rhythm and scale) found on adjacent buildings. Storefronts that resemble suburban strip malls (e.g., picture windows extending to near grade level) and those that use reflective glass, clerestory windows and/or similar non-traditional features are not permitted. 

b. 	
Street Level Entrance. All primary building entrances shall open to the sidewalk and be ADA accessible. Primary entrances above or below grade may be allowed where ADA accessibility is provided. 

c. 	
Street Level/Upper Floor. Building elevations shall contain detailing that visually defines street level building spaces (storefronts). The distinction between street level and upper floors shall be established, for example, through the use of awnings, canopies, belt course, or similar detailing, materials and/or fenestration. 


5. 	Building Mass 
Revised 8/31//2018 17-130 	Land Use Code 
The third story, and/or any portion of a building exceeding twenty-eight (28) feet in height, shall step-back at least six (6) feet from the outer plane of the building. The purpose of the height step back is to maintain a small town appearance and scale as viewed from the street and to provide for solar gain and light filtering down to the street. (See also, subsection B.1 Height, above.) 
6. 	Openings 
a. 	
Ground Floor Windows. Ground floor elevations shall conform to subsection B.4.a, above, and must contain windows that are framed, for example, by piers or pilasters (sides); awnings, canopies or trim/hoods (tops); and kick plates or bulkheads (base). Decorative detailing and ornamentation around windows (e.g., corbels, medallions, pediments, or similar features) is encouraged. 

b. 	
Upper Floor Windows. Upper floor window orientation shall primarily be vertical, or have a width that is no greater than height, consistent with the Western vernacular. Paired or grouped windows that, together, are wider than they are tall, shall be visually divided to express the vertical orientation of individual windows. 

c. 	
Pedestrian Entrances. Ground level entrances shall be at least partly transparent to encourage an inviting and successful business environment. This standard may be met by providing a door with a window(s), a transom window above the door, or sidelights beside the door. Where ATMs or other kiosks are proposed on any street-facing elevation, they shall be visible from the street for security and have a canopy, awning, or other weather protection shelter. 

d. 	
Corner Entrances. Buildings on corner lots shall have corner entrances or the building plan shall provide for a corner plaza consistent with Section 17.11.030(C), below, or the building shall provide architectural features (e.g., alcove with seating or artwork) at the corner that emphasizes the corner as a civic space. 


7. 	Horizontal Rhythms 
a. 	Traditional Lot and Building Pattern. Buildings must respect the traditional lot pattern and building rhythm of the downtown and/or adjacent residential neighborhood, as applicable, by incorporating rhythmic divisions in all elevations. As a general guideline, front elevations should be articulated not less than once every twenty-five (25) feet. Articulation should be subtle. For example, slight offsets in a building elevation, roofline and/or the rhythmic placement of windows, pilasters, awnings, trim, art/medallions, or other detailing and ornamentation are preferred. Abrupt divisions, such as clashing paint colors, should be avoided. Side and rear elevations may be articulated less frequently but should complement the overall building design. The city may require detailing on a zero-lot line elevation to reduce 

Revised 8/31//2018 17-131 	Land Use Code 
the apparent scale and avoid blank walls (i.e., until an abutting property develops). 
b. 	Horizontal Lines. New buildings and exterior 
remodels shall follow prominent horizontal 
lines existing on adjacent buildings at similar 
levels along the street frontage. Examples of 
such horizontal lines include: the base below a 
series of storefront windows; an existing 
awning or canopy line, or belt course between 
building stories; and/or an existing cornice or 

parapet line. 
Exceptions: Where existing buildings do not 
meet the city’s current architectural standards, 
a new building may establish new horizontal 
lines. 
c. 	Ground Floor/Upper Floor Division. A clear visual division shall be maintained between the ground level floor and upper floors, for example, through the use of a belt course, transom, awnings or canopies. 
8. 	
Vertical Rhythms 

New construction or front elevation remodels shall 
reflect a vertical orientation, either through breaks in 
volume or the use of surface details, to divide large 
walls, so as to reflect the underlying historic property 
lines, as applicable. 


9. 	
Materials and Color 


a. 	Primary Materials. Exterior building materials shall 
predominately consist of those materials 
traditionally found in Fruita’s downtown or others 
indigenous to the intermountain West, including 
brick, stone (e.g., limestone, rhyolite, granite, etc.), 
adobe, adobe brick, slump block, stucco, split 
block, and painted or natural wood. (See examples 
in sidebar.) Pitched roof materials shall be wood or 
asphalt singles, or standing rib seam sheet metal-
matte finish. Roof colors must be warm earth-tones 
such as ash, light charcoal, light red (sandstone) or 
olive green, except flat roofs may be any non-
reflective color and finish. All windows and doors 
must have trim that is at least four (4) inches deep. 
Rough-hewn wood, timbers and metals may be 
used as accents but not as the primary exterior 



Revised 8/31//2018 17-132 	Land Use Code 
cladding. Substitute materials that are equal in appearance and durability may be approved. 
b. 	Change in Materials. Elevations shall incorporate changes in material that define a 
building’s base, middle and top and create visual interest and relief. Side and rear 
elevations that do not face a street, pedestrian access way or plaza may utilize changes in texture and/or color of materials in the interest of affordability, provided that the design is consistent with the overall composition of the building. 
c.  	Secondary Materials. Any of the materials listed above may also be used as secondary materials or accents. Metals; such as, copper, steel, iron, bronze and 
Examples of appropriate materials. 
similar appearance metals may be used as trims or 
accents (e.g., flashing, weather protection features, 
ornamentation, etc.) when non-reflective and compatible with the overall building 
design. 

d. 	
Color. Color schemes should be simple and coordinated over the entire building to establish a sense of overall composition. Color schemes should tie together signs, ornamentation, awnings, canopies and entrances. There shall be no more than one base color for each twenty-five (25) feet of the front elevation; one base color for the entire front elevation is preferred. Using only one or two accent colors is also preferred, except where precedent exists for using more than two colors with some architectural styles. Natural wood finishes are appropriate for doors, window sashes and trim, signs, canopies and other architectural accents. Reflective, luminescent, sparkling, and “day-glow” colors and finishes are not permitted. Metals shall be finished in mute, earth-tones or otherwise burnished to minimize glare. 

e. 	
Restoration and Rehabilitation. Restoration and rehabilitation of historically significant structures should incorporate original materials and design elements (e.g., previously covered over), to the extent practicable, and in compliance with Chapter 17.37. 


10. Pedestrian Shelters 
Awnings, canopies, recesses or similar pedestrian shelters shall be provided along at least thirty (30) percent of a building’s ground floor elevation(s) where the building abuts a sidewalk, civic space (e.g., plaza), pedestrian access way, or outdoor seating area. Pedestrian shelters used to meet the above standard shall extend at least five (5) feet over the pedestrian area, be proportionate to the building in its dimensions, and 
not obscure the building’s architectural details. Pedestrian shelters shall align with 
one another to the extent practicable. Use of colored canvas (not plastic) awnings and wood canopies, consistent with historical styles, is encouraged, though metal and plexi-glass canopies may be considered. 
Exception: The city may reduce the minimum shelter depth upon finding that existing right-of-way dimensions or building code requirements preclude a larger shelter. 
11. Mechanical Equipment 
Revised 8/31//2018 17-133 	Land Use Code 
a. 	
Building Walls. When mechanical equipment, such as utility vaults, air compressors, generators, antennae, satellite dishes, or similar equipment, must be installed on a building wall, it shall be oriented away from all streets. Where such equipment is installed on a side or rear building elevation and is adjacent to an alley, access way, or civic space, its appearance shall be minimized using materials and/or colors that are similar to those used on the subject building. Standpipes, meters, vaults and similar equipment shall not be placed on a front elevation when other practical alternatives exist; such equipment shall be placed low on a side or rear elevation to the extent practical. 

b. 	
Rooftops. Rooftop mechanical units shall not be visible from the street, pedestrian access way or civic space. Such units should be screened behind a parapet wall. 

c. 	
Ground-Mounted Mechanical Equipment. Ground-mounted equipment (e.g., generators and air compressors) shall be limited to side or rear yards and screened with fences or walls constructed of materials similar to those on adjacent buildings. Hedges may also be used as screens where there is adequate sunlight and irrigation to ensure their successful growth. The city may require additional setbacks and/or noise attenuating equipment to promote compatibility with adjacent residential uses. 

d. 	
Civic Spaces. Mechanical equipment and garbage storage areas are not permitted within the civic space(s) required under subsection C.1. The city may require that such facilities be screened completely from view and set back from a civic space for aesthetic reasons and to minimize odors or noise. 


12. Historic Preservation. 
For additions or rehabilitations to existing structures that are listed on the National, State or Local historic register, the following standards shall apply in addition to requirements of Chapter 17.37: 
a. 	
Additions and Rehabilitation. Additions and rehabilitations should match the original materials, windows, doors, trim, and colors. If the addition is a wing, it should be subordinated to the original building in design, i.e. the roof should be lower and the mass and bulk of the new addition should be less. If the addition is an extension or lengthening of the original building, introduce a setback to preserve the corner of the original and hence the design arrangement and balance of the original facade should be provided. 

b. 	
Cornices and Decorative Elements. Original members, brackets, molding, etc. should be preserved if at all possible. Replacement of missing parts should be exact copies of the original. Avoid mixing new and old original members on one facade unless the match is perfect. Aluminum and plastic awnings and door hoods are not allowed. Canvas awnings in appropriate colors are allowed. 

c. 	
False Fronts and Applied Facades. Avoid fake modernization or concealment of the original façade. When an existing building has a well developed facade and is 


Revised 8/31//2018 17-134 Land Use Code 
the product of good workmanship, efforts should be made to retain as much of the original materials and detailing as possible or restore them to maintain the 
building’s integrity.  
C. Open Space and Civic Space: 
The provision of attractive and functional civic spaces is as important as building design and centralized parking areas to the success of the downtown and Fruita’s mixed use commercial centers. Therefore, the city requires that all new commercial developments and redevelopment projects in these districts contribute their proportionate share of civic space. 



Standards:  Civic spaces should serve as focal points and gathering places, giving the downtown a unique identity and sense of place. Pedestrian amenities may include, but are not limited to outdoor seating areas or cafes, pedestrian access ways, weather protection, plazas, benches, public art, and street furnishings such as bicycle racks and pedestrian lighting (e.g., bollards) at crossings.  
1.  Civic Space Standard.  At  
least three (3) percent  of  

every development site shall be designated and improved as civic space (plaza, landscaped courtyard, or similar space), with the highest priority locations being those areas with the highest pedestrian activity (e.g., street corners and pedestrian access ways), as generally designated in the examples accompanying this subsection. Improvements shall conform to subsection C.4, below. 
Exception for Minor Projects: Building additions and remodels are not required to provide civic space when proposed building material costs are estimated to be less than fifty (50) percent of the existing Assessor's actual value of improvements on the subject site. Assessor's actual value shall be the value of record at the Mesa County Assessor’s Office. 


Revised 8/31//2018 17-135 	Land Use Code 
Exception for In Lieu Fee: The city may find that the creation of civic space is not practicable based on the project location or other relevant factors. In such cases, the city may accept an in lieu fee which shall be calculated in accordance with Chapter 
17.19. 
2. 	
Dimensions. All civic spaces shall have dimensions of not less than eight (8) feet wide and deep, and have a surface area of not less than forty-eight (48) square feet. 

3. 	
Public Access. Such areas shall abut a public right-of-way or otherwise be connected to and visible from a public right-of-way by a sidewalk or pedestrian access way; access ways shall be identifiable with a change in paving materials (e.g., pavers inlaid in concrete or a change in pavement scoring patterns and/or texture). Where a right-of-way connection is not possible, the owner shall be required to provide a public access way easement to the civic space. 

4. 	
Pedestrian Amenities Required. Where civic space is required, it shall contain pedestrian amenities such as plaza space, extra-wide sidewalks (i.e., outdoor café space), benches, public art, pedestrian-scale lighting, shade structures, way finding signs, as approved by the city decision-making body, or similar pedestrian areas. Where a civic space adjoins a building entrance it should incorporate a weather protection canopy, awning, pergola, or similar feature. 



Pedestrian amenities; example of outdoor seating areas with shade and pedestrian access way leading to internal parking area. 
Exception: Building additions and remodels that are exempt under subsection C.1 above, are not required to provide pedestrian amenities, though they are encouraged to do so. In such cases, the city may consider the voluntary provision of pedestrian amenities in approving adjustments to other applicable standards required under this Chapter. 
D. Access and Circulation: 

Revised 8/31//2018 17-136 	Land Use Code 
Access in the Downtown and Community Mixed Use zones is to be provided as follows: 
Standards: 
1. 	
Pedestrian Access. Walkways linking the pedestrian system of the block to every building entrance and civic space on a proposed development site are required. Walkways shall be constructed of scored concrete or pavers and have a width of not less than four (4) feet; additional width may be required where necessary due to projected use of the walkway. 

2. 	
Vehicle Access and Driveways. New vehicle access onto Aspen Avenue is not allowed; when new vehicle access is required, it shall be taken from streets other than Aspen Avenue. Where an existing driveway or alley provides adequate access to a site, such access must be utilized before any new street access is created. 

3. 	
Drive-up and Drive-
Through Uses. New 
drive-up/drive-through 
facilities (e.g., windows, 
ATMs, etc.) are not 
permitted in the 
Downtown Core within 
forty (40) feet of Aspen 
Avenue. 


4. 	
Off-Street Parking and Loading. Except as approved for parking structures (e.g., garages or under-ground parking), parking is to be provided primarily in on-street parking spaces and in shared parking areas internal to each block, either beside or behind buildings. Parking shall conform to the minimum parking 


Parking is to be placed beside or behind (not in front) of building. Parking must 
standards of Chapter 17.39. (Note 
be buffered from adjacent streets and pedestrian ways. 
reduced parking standards within the Downtown Core.) Parking and vehicle circulation areas abutting a sidewalk, public right-of-way, or pedestrian access way shall provide a landscape screen of not less than four (4) feet in width and three (3) feet in height, or a decorative wall, landscape wall, or other buffer. Loading docks and trash storage areas in parking lots shall be located to the side or rear of buildings and screened from public view. 
E. Landscaping.  
1. 	Plant Material. Landscaping must consist of plant material covering not less than fifty (50) percent of the non-developed areas within three (3) years of planting. Use of desert landscaping or low water usage plant species as identified by the Colorado State University Tri-River Extension Service is required. 
Revised 8/31//2018 17-137 	Land Use Code 
Exception: The required plant material coverage may be reduced to twenty (20) percent of all non-developed surfaces where a proposed building incorporates a green (landscaped) roof. 
2. 	Parking Areas. Parking area(s) shall be landscaped, as required by Section 

17.39.070.G. Landscaping must consist of desert landscaping or drought tolerant plant species as identified by the Colorado State University Tri-River Extension Service. 
(Ord. 2009-02, Ord. 2013-06) 
17.11.040 LEVEL TWO DESIGN STANDARDS. In addition to other applicable regulations, the following architectural and design standards apply to all development in the Tourist Commercial and General Commercial zones and all properties zoned DMU which are not subject to Level One Design Standards (Section 17.11.030). 
A. 	Guiding Principles 
1. 	
Create distinct commercial centers. 

2. 	
Define the edges of commercial areas with attractive landscape buffers and transitions between commercial uses and the roadway and/or non-commercial areas. 

3. 	
Orient buildings to streets or, where buildings are to be setback from Highway 6 & 50 or Highway 340, require entrances to be oriented to pedestrian ways and require appropriate landscaping between parking lots and the highway. 

4. 	
Improve on-street parking opportunities where practical. 

5. 	
Use materials and colors that blend with the desert landscape. 

6. 	
Use desert landscaping or drought tolerant landscaping for context-appropriate design and to conserve water 

7. 	
Maintain views of Colorado National Monument, Book Cliffs, Big Salt Wash, and other natural features, where practicable. 

8. 	
Facilitate the development of a continuous pedestrian network and bicycle ways connecting with adjacent neighborhoods. 

9. 	
Reduce reliance on the highway for local vehicle trips (e.g., from one store to another store in the same vicinity). 

10. 
Develop an interconnected system of driveways or alleys with shared access to minimize traffic conflicts. 


B. 	Site Design 
1. 	Primary building entrances shall be oriented to the public street right-of-way and/or public sidewalk and shall be connected to the public street right-of-way and/or public sidewalk by a concrete walkway not less than six (6) feet in width.  Primary building entrances shall be within twenty (20) feet of the public street right-of-way and/or public sidewalk. 
Revised 8/31//2018 17-138 	Land Use Code 
Where it is not practical to locate primary building entrances within twenty (20) feet of the public street right-of-way or public sidewalk, the concrete walkway connecting a primary building entrance to the public sidewalk or public street right-of-way shall be no less than ten (10) feet in width. This concrete walkway must have three-foot wide planter strips on each side and raised or textured paving at all driveway crossings. 
Primary building entrances located more than forty (40) feet from the public street right-of-way or public sidewalk will require a pedestrian plaza outdoor seating area, courtyard, or other civic amenity provided between the building and the street. 
2. 	
Where a primary building entrance is located more than twenty (20) feet from a public street right-of-way and/or public sidewalk, or where parking and/or driving aisles are provided between the primary building entrance and public street right­of-way and/or public sidewalk, a fifteen (15) foot wide minimum landscape screen shall separate all off-street parking areas from adjacent public street right­of-ways or public sidewalks. 

3. 	
Buildings shall meet transparency and weather protection standards (Subsection C, Building Design below) along all street-facing elevations and any elevations containing a primary building entrance. A landscape screen at least five (5) feet wide shall cover any blank building walls (i.e., lacking windows and weather protection) and contain materials of sufficient size/species to screen the blank wall. 


C. 	Building Design 
1. 	Intent: 
The building design standards are intended to implement following contextual values: 
a. 	
Building orientation to streets to create a sense of enclosure and human scale 

b. 	
Articulated building facades to break up large volumes and promote human scale 

c. 	
Materials, textures and colors appropriate to the desert landscape 

d. 	
Storefront character (windows, pedestrian shelter, furnishings, etc.) where applicable 


2. 	Standards: 
a. 	Overall Design. Architectural 
designs shall address all four 
sides of a building with materials, 
detailing, and color. Architectural 
elements should wrap around 
building corners. Where a 
proposed design is based on the 

applicant’s corporate style guide, 
as in formula retail stores, 

Revised 8/31//2018 17-139 	Land Use Code 
restaurants, discount outlets, or similar proposals where a similar building design has been used previously, the applicant must demonstrate that the design has been 
adapted to fit Fruita’s unique location/historical context (Colorado National 
Monument/Grand Valley) and desert environment. 
b. 	
Stepped Rooflines. Height should vary from building to building to avoid a homogenous appearance. This standard is met by using stepped parapets, gables, or slightly dissimilar height from building-to-building.  

c. 
Window Transparency. Building elevations that face a street, parking area, civic space, or open space shall comprise at least forty (40) percent transparent windows, measured as a section extending the width of the street-facing elevation between the building base (or thirty (30) inches above the sidewalk grade, whichever is less) and a plane eighty (80) inches above the sidewalk grade. Upper floors may have less window area, but should follow the vertical lines of the lower level piers and the horizontal definition of spandrels and any cornices. 


Where the Community Development Director determines, based on physical site constraints or the functional requirements of a non-residential building, that providing window transparency is not practical or does not further meet the intent of these standards as stated in Section 17.11.040 (C) above, other alternative means of breaking up large elevations (e.g., columns, belt course, and upper story 
panels/transom, with landscaping) shall be employed. See example below. 

Example of exception to window and entrance standards due to site constraints (e.g., grade change) 
d.  Primary Entrances. Buildings shall have clearly defined primary entrances that  
provide a weather-protection shelter for a depth of not less than five (5) feet (e.g.,  
either by recess, overhang, canopy, portico and/or awning) extending from the  
building entry.  
e.  Building Mass. Building elevations shall incorporate offsets or divisions to reduce  
the apparent building scale and to improve aesthetics.  Elevations of a structure  
shall be divided into smaller areas or planes to minimize the appearance of bulk as  
viewed from any street, civic space or adjacent property. When an elevation of a  
primary  structure  is  more  than  eight  hundred  (800) square  feet  in  area,  the  
elevation must be divided into distinct planes of not  more  than eight hundred  

Revised 8/31//2018 17-140 	Land Use Code 
(800) square feet. For the purpose of this standard, areas of wall planes that are entirely separated from other wall planes are those that result in a change in plane such as a recessed or projecting section of the structure that projects or recedes at least one (1) foot from the adjacent plane, for a length of at least six (6) feet. Changes in plane may include but are not limited to recessed entries, bays, stepped parapets, secondary roof forms (e.g., gables, lower roof sheds, dormers and towers), building bases, canopies, awnings, projections, recesses, alcoves, pergolas, porticos, roof overhangs, columns, or other features that are consistent with the overall composition of the building. The distinction between street level and upper floors shall be established, for example, through the use of awnings, canopies, belt course, or similar detailing, materials and/or fenestration. 
f. 	
Materials and Colors. Exterior materials shall consist of brick, stone, adobe, wood shingle or imitation wood shingle walls, slump block, adobe brick or suitable split block or brick. Wood timbers and metal (brushed steel, iron, copper, or similar architectural-grade metals) may be used on canopies, arbors, trellises, pergolas, porticos, brackets, fasteners, lighting, signage, and other detailing, as appropriate, to provide visual interest and contrast. In general, color selection should complement, not compete with, the surrounding desert landscape. Warm earth tone colors (e.g., sandstone reds, desert greens and browns) are generally preferred over cool colors, such as blue and white/off-white. Substitute materials that are equal in appearance and durability may be approved. 

g. 	
ATMs and Service Windows. Where walkup ATMs or service windows are proposed on any street-facing elevation, they shall be visible from the street for security and have a canopy, awning, or other weather protection shelter. Where drive-up windows or similar facilities are provided the drive-up window and associated vehicle queuing area shall be setback at least twenty (20) feet from all adjacent rights-of-way. The applicant may be required to install textured pavement (e.g., pavers or stamped concrete) for pedestrian crossings of any drive aisle.

17.11.050 ATTACHED SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL, MULTI-FAMILY RESIDENTIAL AND SINGLE FAMILY RESIDENTIAL LOTS MEASURING LESS THAN 7,000 SQUARE FEET IN SIZE AND LOTS LESS THAN 60 FEET IN WIDTH. In addition to other applicable regulations, the following architectural and site design standards are applicable to new lots with attached single family residential dwelling units, multi-family residential dwelling units, detached single family residential lots measuring less than seven thousand (7,000) square feet in size, and single family residential lots measuring less than sixty 
(60) 
feet in width and only those parts of new subdivisions containing these types of residential units/lots. 

A. 
Guiding Principles 


New buildings and exterior remodels should honor traditional neighborhood development principles, consistent with the desired character and form of Fruita, as expressed by the 
Revised 8/31//2018 17-141 	Land Use Code 
Community Plan. While many communities attempt to “create” traditional 
neighborhoods, Fruita already has traditional neighborhoods. The original town plat contains a variety of housing types in both historic and contemporary structures, many 
with front porches. Fruita’s historic neighborhoods contain both small and large lots, 
some with alley access and street tree planter strips, and most within walking distance of centrally located open spaces, schools, churches and other community services. However, some areas outside the historic town plat have developed in a manner that is inconsistent with the above traditional neighborhood design principles. The design standards in this section are intended to guide compatible infill development and promote the creation of new, traditional neighborhoods where new subdivisions are proposed. It is not the intent of the City of Fruita Code to create an architectural theme or to freeze time, but rather to ensure that new buildings and remodels fit within the context of their historic surroundings, as applicable, and support the development of new compact, walkable neighborhoods with a variety of housing. The key elements of this Section are summarized as follows: 
1. 	
New development and redevelopment should support walkable and attractive neighborhoods with a variety of housing types that are designed to be compatible with adjacent uses. 

2. 	
Architecture should provide for compatibility with historic structures where applicable. 

3. 	
Provide for street connectivity and pedestrian access and safety both within new developments and between new and existing subdivisions. 

4. 	
Integrate open space and parks into the design of new neighborhoods and subdivisions. 


B. Applicability 
In addition to other applicable regulations, the following site design standards are applicable only to multi-family residential dwelling units and new lots in new subdivisions that include attached single-family residential dwelling units, single-family detached residential lots measuring less than 7,000 square feet in size, residential lots measuring less than sixty (60) feet in width, and only those parts of new subdivisions containing these types of residential dwelling units. 
C. Neighborhood Structure and Street Network 
1. 	
Purpose 

Promote neighborhood circulation with convenient 
connections via streets and pedestrian and bicycle 
ways to parks, schools, churches, neighborhood 
commercial uses (where applicable) and other 
neighborhood-oriented services and amenities. 


2. 	
Guidelines and Standards 


a. 	Streets, bicycle ways and walkways or trails, as 
applicable, shall, to the maximum extent practical, 

Neighborhood Structure and Street Network 

Revised 8/31//2018 17-142 	Land Use Code 
create a unifying circulation network that provides convenient routes to destinations without needlessly forcing trips onto the surrounding collector or arterial streets. 
b. 	Street and alley networks, as applicable, shall, to 
the maximum extent practical, be configured to 
minimize cut-through traffic on local residential 
streets without relying upon the use of cul-de­sacs; where cut-through traffic is unavoidable, 
street design shall incorporate neighborhood 
traffic calming features, such as curb extensions 
(reduced width at intersections), roundabouts at 
major intersections, traffic circles, or other 
features, consistent with the City of Fruita Street 
System Design Criteria and the City of Fruita 
Traffic Calming, Pedestrian and Bicycle Plan. 

Cul-de-sacs, where allowed, are limited to a 
maximum length of four hundred (400) feet. A 
pedestrian access way or trail will be required to 
connect the end of any cul-de-sac to an adjacent 
street or trail right-of-way to minimize out-of­direction travel by pedestrians and bicyclists. 
The city decision-making body may also require 
the use of pervious paving (e.g., pavers) or 
stamped concrete on cul-de-sacs to minimize 
stormwater runoff (impervious surfaces) or to 
identify cul-de­sacs  as  community spaces  where  children play 
(e.g., basketball hoops, street hockey, etc.). 

c. 	
Streets, pedestrian ways and trails should focus on important vistas; for example, by aligning street axis to provide for views of community buildings, mountains, trees or open spaces. 

d. 	
Block lengths shall provide for at least one street connection for every three to six hundred (300 to 600) feet maximum in block length, except where topographic or access restrictions (e.g., arterial intersection spacing) preclude such connections. Where street connections are not feasible, pedestrian and bicycle pathway/trail connections shall be used to make walking and bicycling within and between developments convenient. 


D. Parks and Open Space 
1. 	
Purpose 

2. 	
Guidelines and Standards 


Promote the creative design and use of a wide variety of parks and open spaces. 
ways loading off alleys for small lots, traffic calming, street alignment to take advantage of vistas. 
Revised 8/31//2018 17-143 	Land Use Code 
a. 	
Parks and open spaces should be used to form neighborhood edges and transitions where higher density development is proposed adjacent to lower density development, and where development abuts watercourses, washes, and other natural features. 

b. 	
Parks and open spaces should be collocated with existing or planned school sites, as applicable. 

c. 	
Where a new park of two (2) acres or more in size is proposed, it should be located, configured and designed to maximize pedestrian access from the greatest number of residents in the adjacent neighborhood(s). 

d. 	
Where mixed-use projects are planned with residential and commercial uses proposed, the city decision-making body may require open space areas or parks that serve as central gathering places for residents and employees. 

e. 	
Where a proposed subdivision is adjacent to an existing park, open space or natural area (e.g., wash), the city decision-making body may require the applicant to connect to and/or augment the existing park, open space or natural area with required land dedication, trails, and/or other related improvements, consistent with the provisions of Chapter 17.19 and Chapter 17.29. 


E. Unique Fruita Characteristics 
1. 	Purpose 
Promote development that is compatible with the natural features of Fruita landscape and promotes Fruita’s traditional neighborhood development patterns, consistent with the Guiding Principles in subsection 17.11.050A. 

Development concept addressing topography, views, solar access, wash setbacks, neighborhood buffering, and trail connections. 
2. 	Guidelines and Standards 
a. 	Streets, blocks, open space areas and trails should be oriented and designed in 
response to Fruita’s location in the Grand Valley. 
View corridors to the mountains, washes, open 
space areas, and canals shall be incorporated into 


Revised 8/31//2018 17-144 	Land Use Code 
project designs, and lot orientation should allow solar access to individual home sites, to the greatest extent practical. 
b. 	Developments adjacent to the Little Salt Wash or Big Salt Wash, and those in the foothills of the Colorado National Monument, McInnis Canyon National Conservation Area or near the Colorado River, shall be designed to respond to the topographic and natural resource values of those areas by limiting grading, incorporating required setbacks and buffering, providing trail connections, and clustering development densities in less environmentally sensitive areas. Development in areas prone to flooding is subject applicable building codes and may be prohibited where an applicant has 
Historic Fruita 
requested a density bonus under Chapter 17.08 or planned unit development approval under Chapter 17.17 (i.e., development density shall be transferred from the floodplain to more suitable upland areas). 
c. 	
Development shall conform to the natural topography of the site by minimizing cuts and fills. Except as necessary for underground utilities, individual cuts and fills (i.e., for streets and foundations) are limited to no more than eight (8) feet each and no retaining wall shall exceed a height of eight (8) feet without a variance. Terracing may be allowed by the city decision-making body, as necessary, due to existing topography. 

d. 	
Developments subject to the requirements of this Section and proposed within one hundred (100) feet of a designated historic landmark are required to demonstrate compatibility with the adjacent landmark in terms of building height, setbacks, building form, architectural detailing, materials, and site design (parking, circulation and landscaping). The city decision-making body shall approve, approve with conditions, or deny a proposed development under this subsection based on its finding of compatibility as described above and also as described in Section 17.07.080, Land Use Compatibility Criteria. 


F. Alleys and Shared Driveways 
1. 	Purpose 
Enhance the safety, appearance, and overall quality of Fruita’s neighborhood streets 
by providing options and incentives for alleys and/or shared driveways serving small lot developments and multifamily projects where garages and other parking areas are setback and oriented away from neighborhood streets. Alleys or shared driveways are encouraged in new subdivisions and in redevelopment projects where the subject block has, or historically had, an alley. The following provisions are intended to reduce or eliminate traffic conflicts and aesthetic problems associated with frequent garage openings and driveway approaches abutting neighborhood streets. Alleys and shared driveways also allow homes to front onto parks and open space areas without a road 
Alley with rear backing distance, center "V" drainage and landscaping. 
Revised 8/31//2018 17-145 	Land Use Code 
separating the homes from such features.  Alleys can also provide additional off-street parking where needed. Finally, alleys can provide effective land use and density transitions in the middle of a block instead of along street frontages, where it is more desirable to have similar building types face one another. 
2. 	Guidelines and Standards 
a. 	
Alleys or shared driveways may be allowed where developments face major streets to which individual driveway access is not allowed but houses are oriented to the street (e.g., with deep front yard setbacks) is desired. 

b. 	
/The city decision-making body may require alleys or 
shared driveways to be incorporated into a subdivision 
design where lot sizes are less than seven thousand 
(7,000) square feet.   


c. 	
Alleys and shared driveways should align so that 
drivers entering an alley or shared driveway can see 
any on-coming vehicles. 


d. 	
Dead-end alleys and shared driveways shall be less 
than one hundred fifty (150) feet long, except as 
allowed with an approved emergency vehicle 
turnaround. 


e. 	
Where an alley or shared driveway also serves as a required emergency apparatus (fire) lane, it shall conform to the applicable design criteria and standards for such lanes.

17.11.060 MIXED USE DEVELOPMENTS IN THE COMMUNITY MIXED USE ZONE 

1. 	Purpose 
The following provisions are intended to supplement the commercial design standards in Chapter 17.11.030 and encourage the development of successful mixed use centers integrating a variety of housing and neighborhood-oriented commercial uses and services that are compatible with surrounding residential uses and are supported by a well-planned network of streets, blocks, pedestrian and bicycle ways, and parks and 
open spaces. For the purpose of Section 17.11.050, “commercial use,” “commercial development,” and “commercial center” refer to the commercial portions or phases of 
developments in the Community Mixed Use (CMU) zone. 
2. 	Guidelines and Standards 
a. 	Commercial mixed use developments may be permitted in the Community Mixed Use (CMU) zone, subject to the applicable provisions of Sections 17.07.050 and 
17.07.060 (Land Use), and the commercial designs standards in Section 
17.11.030. 
Revised 8/31//2018 17-146 	Land Use Code 
b. 	
Commercial uses shall be located to maximize pedestrian access by the greatest number of surrounding residents. 

c. 	
Commercial centers shall be located adjacent to arterial or major collector streets.  Secondary access should be provided to adjacent neighborhoods with traffic calming measures used to discourage neighborhood cut-through traffic. 

d. 	
Commercial uses shall be located adjacent to existing or planned residential areas containing a variety of housing types at densities of five (5) or more units per gross acre, and not adjacent to low density residential subdivisions. This guideline is intended to promote land use compatibility and transportation efficiency. 

e. 	
Commercial mixed use developments shall 
conform to the overall size restrictions and 
spacing criteria one-half (½) mile from 
another commercial center, in a CMU zone. 
For the purposes of this subsection, one-half 
(½) mile is measured as the distance from 
the geographic center of the parcel(s) on 
which commercial uses exist or are 
proposed, as applicable. 


f. 	
Street and block patterns, and pedestrian Commercial mixed use framework and bicycle connections, shall extend 


through neighborhood “commercial centers,” as defined under Section 
17.07.070.J, so that the center maintains a coherent, continuous, visually related and functionally linked pattern for commercial centers contained in Section 
17.07.070.

Consistent with Chapter 17.19, the city may require a site specific traffic impact study performed by a registered professional engineer, at the sole cost of the subdivider, when the proposed subdivision is expected to generate at least five hundred (500) daily trip ends or fifty (50) peak hour trip ends in order to determine the traffic impacts generated by the proposed subdivision and the related street improvements needed to accommodate such additional traffic. 
In the event the City Council determines that improvements to adjacent streets are necessary as a result of the traffic impacts generated by the proposed subdivision, construction of such off-site improvements shall be the responsibility of the developer. The City Council may, as a condition of approval of the subdivision: (1) require the subdivider to construct all such improvements including the full width of any expanded roadway surface; (2) require the subdivider to pay to the city the cost of constructing such improvements in which case the city shall be responsible for constructing the applicable improvements; (3) may require the subdivider to participate in a street improvement district which shall be responsible for constructing such improvements; (4) require payment of a transportation impact fee consistent with Section 17.19.130 of this Title; or 
(5) any combination of the above. 
Provided, however, in the event the City Council determines that adjacent streets providing access to the proposed subdivision are presently inadequate to handle existing levels of traffic without the proposed subdivision, the city, or a street improvement district created by the city, shall be responsible for the costs of the improvements necessary to adequately service the subject property without the proposed subdivision. The subdivider shall be responsible for all remaining costs necessitated by development of the subdivision. In the event the City Council determines that the improvements to be constructed and/or paid for by the subdivider will also benefit other properties in the area if further developed or subdivided, and if requested by the subdivider and approved by City Council, the city shall enter into recapture agreements pursuant to Section 17.15.180 
Revised 8/31//2018 17-166 	Land Use Code 
with the subdivider requiring the owner or developer of such other properties, as a condition of subdivision or development, to reimburse the subdivider for a portion of the costs incurred by the subdivider for the street improvements constructed pursuant to this subsection. Such contribution or recapture amount shall be calculated by the city and shall be roughly proportional to the traffic impacts generated by such other developments or subdivisions. 
C. 	Curbs, gutters and sidewalks, bicycle and pedestrian paths and trails. 
D. 	Wastewater laterals, and mains. 
E. 	Storm drainage system, as required. 
F. 	Water distribution system. 
G. 	Fire hydrants. 
H. 	Required street signs and other traffic control devices. 
I. 	Permanent reference monuments and monument boxes. 
J. 	Street lights. 
K. 	Irrigation System.  If the proposed subdivision is located in an area that can be reasonably serviced by an existing irrigation ditch or canal system, the subdivider shall install a fully functional, non-potable irrigation system capable of servicing the subdivision and shall convey adequate irrigation water rights to the homeowners association. 
L. 	Natural gas lines and related facilities necessary to service the subdivision. 
M. 	Cable television lines and related facilities necessary to service the subdivision. 
N. 	Telephone and other telecommunication lines and related facilities necessary to service the subdivision. 
O. 	Electrical distribution lines and related facilities. All newly constructed electrical distribution lines shall be placed underground to serve new residential subdivision areas. Exceptions to the undergrounding requirements for Minor Subdivisions may be allowed pursuant to the following conditions: 
1. 	Upon the request of the developer of a Minor Subdivision, the Community Development Director may permit said lines be constructed overhead provided that the Minor Subdivision is in compliance with all other provisions of this Title and the following conditions are met: 
Revised 8/31//2018 17-167 	Land Use Code 
a. 	
The electrical distribution lines proposed to be placed overhead shall not exceed a maximum distance of one (1) block or seven hundred fifty (750) feet, whichever is less; 

b. 	
It will not result in any endangerment of the public health or safety; 

c. 	
It will not substantially injure the value of adjoining or abutting property;

(Ord. 2009-02) 
17.15.160 PUBLIC IMPROVEMENTS TO BE THE PROPERTY OF THE CITY. Upon completion of construction of the public improvements in conformity with city standards and the plans, and any properly approved changes, a subdivider shall convey to the city, by bill of sale, all physical facilities necessary for the extension, maintenance and repair of municipal services.  Acceptance of said conveyance shall be made by the city only by a majority vote of the City Council. Approval of a subdivision shall not constitute acceptance by the city for maintenance of wastewater system facilities, parks, streets, alleyways or other public improvements required under a subdivision improvements agreement. The acceptance of such facilities for maintenance shall be by specific action of the City Council upon completion in accordance with the subdivision improvements agreement and/or adopted standards. (Ord. 2009-02) 
17.15.170 GUARANTEE OF IMPROVEMENTS. In order to secure the construction and installation of the public and other required subdivision improvements, the subdivider shall choose one of the following options prior to the recording of the subdivision Final Plat:

Before the Final Plat is recorded, an up-to-date title search is required to ensure that there are no additional liens on the property. Failure to provide clear title to land/improvements may result in vacation of the approved Final Plat. All required improvements must be inspected by staff, and accepted by the City Council before the Final Plat is recorded. Additionally, a warranty is required for the improvements before the Final Plat is recorded. The warranty shall be the same as that required in subdivision improvements agreements in Chapter 21 of this Title.  
(Ord. 2009-02) 
17.15.180 SUBDIVISION IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED PRIOR TO ISSUANCE OF PLANNING CLEARANCES.

Up to twenty percent (20%) of the Planning Clearances in a subdivision may be released when all improvements are completed excluding trails, bikeways, fencing and landscaping of common open spaces, parks and recreation areas. Once all improvements are completed, approved and accepted by the city, all other Planning Clearances can be released. Once a Planning Clearance is released, a Certificates of Occupancy for the building can be issued if all other requirements have been met. 
The city may approve an exception to this provision for a model house to be constructed, provided that the house shall not be occupied as a residence until Planning Clearances have been released for the subdivision and a Certificate of Occupancy has been issued.

17.15.190 RECAPTURE AGREEMENTS. As one of the conditions of approval of a subdivision, the city may determine that certain off-site improvements that are of general benefit to the city are required. In this event, the city, by affirmative action of the City Council, may enter into a recapture agreement with a subdivider under which proportionate engineering, surveying and construction costs of off-site water, wastewater, storm drainage and/or street improvements are repaid to the subdivider by other owners or developers who benefit from such improvements over an established period of time. The proportionate share of the cost of the improvements to be repaid by others shall be calculated in accordance with formulas approved 
by the city. It is the subdivider’s sole responsibility to request a recapture agreement, and said 
request shall be made prior to final City Council action on the development application. The City Council retains sole authority to approve or deny all recapture agreements, at its discretion. Recapture agreements shall not exceed a period of ten (10) years. (Ord. 2009-02)

17.19.010 PURPOSE. The City Council declares it is the policy of the city that dedications of real property and/or exactions in the form of monetary payments shall be required in those instances where the City Council determines that a proposed project, development or improvement:  (1) will create the need for new facilities or services, or (2) will result in increased use of existing services or facilities in such a manner as to require the expansion or eventual replacement thereof. In those instances, this Chapter shall be applied to provide a method whereby such dedication or impact fee shall be quantified to assure that a fair and equitable proportionality is established between the cost of the improvements or facilities which are attributable to the proposed development or improvement (and which are therefore the responsibility of the owner/developer), and the overall public cost of the provision of such improvements or facilities. In interpreting and implementing the provisions of this Chapter, the City Council shall give due weight to the needs of the general public, and especially the development or improvement proposed, so as not to burden disproportionately the general public and existing residents with costs or expenses to provide services or facilities, the need for which are generated by the proposed development or improvement. (Ord. 2009-02) 
17.19.020 AUTHORITY TO IMPOSE DEDICATION OR IMPACT FEE 
REQUIREMENTS. 
A. Pursuant to the provisions of applicable law, authority is specifically given to the City Council, as a part of its legislative function, to establish general schedules or formulas for 
Revised 8/31//2018 17-177 	Land Use Code 
monetary impact fees for those classes of development that are subject to real property dedications, public improvement requirements, and/or impact fees. 
B. 	Strictly by means of illustration, and not by means of limitation, dedications or impact fees are expressly authorized under the following circumstances: 
1. 	
Streets, Sidewalks, and Trails. Land may be required to be dedicated to the city for the construction, reconstruction, reconfiguration, widening or extension of on-site and off-site streets or for acceleration/deceleration lanes. Land also may be required to be dedicated to the city for the construction, reconstruction or reconfiguration of on-site and off-site sidewalks or trails for use by the general public. Payment for the construction of such sidewalks or trails also may be required. Dedication to the City of Fruita for all internal public rights-of-way shall be required and actual construction by the owner/developer shall be required for all internal streets, necessary off-site streets, sidewalks, and trails. A combination of both construction and payment of impact fees as provided in this Chapter also may be required. Fees for initial life extending surfaces for all streets internal to a subdivision also shall be required as provided in this Chapter. 

2. 	
Public Parks, Open Space, and other Public Sites. Land sufficient to enable the development of a public park, trail or other public site within a development and actual construction of such public park, trail or other public site may be required based upon compliance with the city's park and open space standards, or payment of a fee in lieu of such dedication and improvements shall be required provided that adequate standards exist for insuring that the monetary impact fee paid by the owner/developer is utilized on a project which will directly or indirectly benefit the owner/developer's property. 

3. 	
Utilities. Land or easements to the city for use by the general public, or by utility companies shall be required for utility pipelines, conduits, wires and other facilities or appurtenances. For the purposes of this Chapter, utilities include, but are not limited to: domestic water, irrigation, wastewater, storm sewer, electric, natural gas, cable television, and telecommunications services. 

4. 	
School Lands. Based upon standards adopted by the City of Fruita in conjunction with the local school district, fee title to school lands may be required to be dedicated by the owner/developer, or a fee in lieu thereof shall be required. 

5. 	
Storm Water and Drainage Management. Land sufficient to enable the development of regional storm water and drainage improvements, and actual construction thereof, 


may be required based upon an assessment of the development's impact on the city’s 
storm water quality compliance programs, and/or the need for upstream or downstream flood control measures. A fee in lieu of dedication and/or construction may be required when payment of a fee will not create or exacerbate a flooding or water quality compliance problem, and such fee in lieu of dedication and/or 
Revised 8/31//2018 17-178 	Land Use Code 
construction is based on a rational determination of the impacts generated by a development. 
6. Downtown Parking District In Lieu Fee. [Reserved] 
C. 	The City Council, in its discretion, shall accept or reject any proposed dedication of land to the city prior to final approval of a proposed development. Dedication of land to the city is required to be in fee title. 
D. Notwithstanding any provision contained in this Chapter to the contrary, any vacant platted building lot within the city created by subdivision prior to January 1, 1980, shall be subject to the impact fees/land dedications set forth in this Chapter. Fees for such lots shall be due and payable at the time of issuance of Planning Clearances for building permits for the construction of habitable structures on such lots. Impact fees assessed for developments approved after the effective date of this Chapter shall be due and payable at the time of approval of the subdivision Final Plat, Final Planned Unit Development Plan, or issuance of a Planning Clearance for a building permit, whichever shall first occur, however; Minor Subdivisions for only residential land uses can defer payment of impact fees (but not required land dedications) to the time of Planning Clearance approval for construction on individual lots. Minor subdivisions that defer the impact fees to the time of Planning Clearance are required to pay the fee in effect at the time of Planning Clearance approval. 
(Ord. 2009-02, Ord. 2010-10, S3, Ord. 2015-12) 
17.19.025 PAYMENT OF IMPACT FEES 
A. 	Notwithstanding any provision contained in this Chapter to the contrary, any vacant building lot within the city created prior to January 1, 1980, shall be subject to the impact fees/land dedications set forth in this Chapter. Fees for such lots shall be calculated based on the impact fees in effect and payable at the time of Planning Clearance approval. 
B. Impact fees assessed for developments approved after the effective date of this Chapter shall be calculated based on the impact fees in effect and payable at the time of Planning Clearance approval. 
C. 	For new subdivision development, impact fees may be paid prior to recording a plat based on the impact fees in effect at the time of plat approval. If impact fees are not paid before the plat is recorded, impact fees must be paid at the time of Planning Clearance approval for each lot based on the fees in effect at the time of Planning Clearance approval. 
D. 	Required land dedications cannot be deferred until the time of Planning Clearance approval and must be provided with the plat. 
Revised 8/31//2018 17-179 	Land Use Code 
17.19.030 CRITERIA FOR REQUIRING DEDICATIONS OR PAYMENT OF IMPACT FEES. Dedications or payment of an impact fee is required of an owner/developer based on the following: 
A. 	That a legitimate, identifiable public purpose is served by the required dedication or payment of a fee; 
B. 	That the City of Fruita is acting within its power to provide the facilities or services for which the fee or dedication is required, either directly or through such dedication/impact fee process, for the benefit of the residents of the community; 
C. 	That, but for the proposed development or improvement or the proposed development or improvement in conjunction with other developments, actual or proposed, the city would not currently be considering providing or expanding either the services or facilities in question (i.e. existing facilities and services are adequate to service the existing population); 
D. 	That the proposed development or improvement, and the projected use of facilities and services generated by such development or improvement, is a contributing cause to the need for new or expended facilities or services; 
E. 	That the City of Fruita would be legally justified in declining to approve the proposed development or improvement unless the dedication or impact fee was imposed because of the negative effect of the proposed development or improvement, on either existing private property or the city's or another local government's facilities or services; 
F. 	That the City of Fruita, acting within its lawful authority, requires all owners or developers similarly situated to provide similar, in both quantity and quality, or roughly similar dedications, or to pay the same or roughly the same fees; 
G. 	That the dedication or impact fee will serve the proposed development or improvement directly, provided, however, the fact that certain services or facilities of a general nature which provide a general benefit to all residents of the community including residents of the proposed development shall not constitute a valid ground for failing to impose a dedication or fee requirement; and 
H. 	That the dedication or impact fee is required to and does address needs for capital facilities brought about by the proposed development or improvement which needs are not addressed by any other requirement of this Title.

of land may lawfully be required, the extent of such fee or dedication shall be determined using whichever of the following methods is selected by the owner/developer. 
A. 	The city has adopted local or nationally recognized general standards or formulas relating to dedications and impact fees, as contained in this Chapter, and is authorized to adjust or modify these general standards and formulas from time to time by action of the City Council. Such standards or formulas shall be applicable to all owners/developers unless the owner/developer requests the city to implement the provisions of subsection C of this Section. If an owner/developer voluntarily accepts the general standards or formulas of the city by proceeding to a hearing before the Planning Commission and/or City Council, the owner/developer shall be deemed to have waived any rights under subsection C and shall be conclusively presumed to have accepted the general standards or formulas contained in this Chapter. 
B. 	In the event no general standard or formula has been adopted relating to a certain type of dedication or impact fee, the owner/developer may voluntarily agree to comply with the dedication or fee recommended by the city staff, or request a review and determination by City Council in a public hearing. Unless the owner/developer affirmatively requests the city to implement the provisions of subsection C of this Section, at the pre-application conference prior to submittal of a subdivision Sketch Plan application, PUD Concept Plan application, or similar application, he shall be deemed to have waived any rights under subsection C and shall be conclusively presumed to have accepted the dedication or fee requirement recommended by city staff. 
C. 	Individualized Study. 
1. 	An owner/developer may request that an individualized study or report be made by the city relating solely to its proposed development or improvement in order to determine whether or not dedications or improvements shall be required, and, if so, to determine the extent thereof. Such study or report shall be individualized to the owner/developer's property or proposed development or improvements, shall fairly and accurately delineate the need for additional public services or facilities which will be generated by the owner/developer's proposed development or improvement, and shall include consideration of the following criteria: 
a. 	
Whether the proposed public improvements or facilities would be required but for the owner/developer's proposed development or improvement; 

b. 	
Whether, and to what extent, it is reasonably likely that other developments or residents thereof will utilize the public facility or improvement in question; 

c. 	
Whether existing public facilities or services can adequately serve the proposed development or improvement without the additional expense to construct, expand, or improve the public facility or service in question; and 


Revised 8/31//2018 17-181 	Land Use Code 
d. 	The conclusions of such study or report shall contain a recommendation as to the nature of the dedications(s) or impact fee(s) to be required, and the extent or amount thereof. In determining any such extent or amount of a dedication or impact fee to be required of an owner/developer, a proportion shall be established between the total cost of providing or expanding such necessary public facilities or services on the one hand, and the amount or extent of such total cost which is attributable to, or is caused or generated by, the proposed development or improvement, on the other hand. The extent of the dedication or amount of the fee due from the owner/developer must bear roughly the same proportion to the total cost of providing the public services or facilities in question as the need for such facilities or services generated by the owner/developer's development or improvement bears to the general population's need for or use of the facilities or services. 
2. 
The owner/developer shall request such an individualized study or report at the pre-application conference prior to the submittal of a subdivision Sketch Plan application, Planned Unit Development Concept Plan application, or similar application and shall pay to the city a fee established by the City Council to secure a portion of the city's review and supervision expenses. In addition, at such time the owner/developer shall submit to the city a deposit in an amount established by the city equal to the estimated costs the city will incur for any necessary engineering, consultant and planning services to be performed by persons not employed on a full time basis by the city or by city staff. The required fee and deposit shall be tendered to the City Clerk and no public hearing on the owner/developer's application shall be held unless the fee and deposit is paid in full. Unless a request for an individualized study or report is made at the time provided herein, such right shall be deemed to be waived by the owner/developer. 

3. 	
Prior to the approval of any requested rezoning, conditional use approval, subdivision approval, Planned Unit Development approval, other development approval or Planning Clearance for a building permit, if applicable, the owner/developer shall pay to the city the actual cost to the city for any engineering, consultant, or planning services provided under the direction of the city necessary to conduct the individualized study or report. 

4. 	
The owner/developer may agree with the provisions of such study or report, in which case the same shall be submitted to the Planning Commission and the City Council as a joint finding and recommendation. However, if the owner/developer disagrees with all or any part of the city's report, the owner/developer may, at his sole expense, submit a written report detailing the owner/developer's findings with regard to the criteria set forth in this Chapter, and shall submit the same to the Planning Commission and the City Council. The Planning Commission and the City Council shall consider such reports at all required public hearings, and the City Council shall ultimately determine what dedications or impact fees, if 


Revised 8/31//2018 17-182 	Land Use Code 
any, are required, and if so, the extent or amount of such dedications or fees. The decision of the City Council shall be final, subject to the owner/developer's right to appeal to the Mesa County District Court. 
D. Any owner/developer may prepare or cause to be prepared, at his sole cost and expense, a study or report described in subsection (C) above. Said report shall be in writing and, upon the submission of such study or report, the owner/developer shall pay a fee established by the City Council to compensate the city for the review time and costs of the city's staff in reviewing said study or report. In the event the city needs to obtain engineering, consultant or planning services by a person who is not a regular full time employee of the city to conduct such review, the owner/developer shall pay the costs for such services in the manner set forth in subsection (C). The city's staff shall review such study or report, and shall comment thereon in writing to the Planning Commission and the City Council. Any disagreement by the city's staff with any of the findings or conclusions of such study or report shall be delivered to the owner/developer of the development or improvement in question. In the event of disagreement between the city's staff and the owner/developer as to what dedications or impact fees should be required, the City Council shall determine what dedications or impact fees, if any, are required, and if so, the extent or amount of such dedications or fees. The decision of the City Council shall be final, subject only to the right of the owner/developer to appeal the same to the Mesa County Court. 
E. The city staff retains the right to require preparation and submittal of an individualized report or study as a condition of review of the proposed development, with said report(s) paid for solely by the owner/developer. 
(Ord. 2009-02, Ord. 2015-12) 
17.19.050 BASIS OF DETERMINATION. In deciding whether to impose a dedication or impact fee requirement, and the extent of such dedication or impact fee, the Planning Commission and the City Council shall consider the criteria set forth in Section 17.19.030, and shall be guided by the overriding principle that an impact fee or public dedication requirement is unfair, disproportionate and unconstitutional if it imposes a burden on an owner/developer which in equity and fairness should be borne by the public in general. However, an impact fee or dedication will be required in compliance with all existing constitutional requirements when the failure of the owner/developer to provide the dedication or impact fee would fail to remedy impacts to the city, other local governments or to the general public created or exacerbated by the owner/developer's proposed project or improvement to such an extent that the City Council would be justified in denying approval of the proposed project or improvement. (Ord. 2009-02) 
17.19.060 FEE FUNDS ESTABLISHED; USE OF IMPACT FEES. 
A. 	All impact fees collected pursuant to this Chapter shall be deposited in funds created by the city and shall be used for the purposes for which they were collected. All impact fees collected pursuant to this Chapter shall be accounted for in the manner required by 
Revised 8/31//2018 17-183 	Land Use Code 
Sections 29-1-801, et. seq., C.R.S. and other applicable law. 
B. 	Funds collected from impact fees shall be used to acquire additional real property necessary for the purposes for which they were collected, or for purposes of acquiring or improving capital facilities, as defined in Section 29-20-104.5, C.R.S., related to the purposes for which such funds were collected. A "capital facility" includes planning, preliminary engineering, engineering design studies, land surveys, final engineering, permitting, and the construction and installation of all the necessary features for the facilities. Funds collected from impact fees shall not be used for periodic or routine maintenance of city or other government facilities. 
C. 	If an impact fee is assessed in lieu of a dedication to address large scale impacts that are borne by the city and by the public in general, as in the case of school land dedication fees, public park, open space, and trail fees, transportation impact fees and storm water and drainage management fees, such impact fees shall be considered as directly benefiting the proposed development even if such fees are used to partially fund the mitigation of impacts that are of general benefit to the community as a whole. 
D. 	In the event that bonds or similar debt instruments are issued for the advanced provision of capital facilities for which impact fees may be expended, such fees may be used to pay debt service on such bonds or similar debt instruments.  
E. Monies in the impact fee account shall be considered to be spent in the order collected, on a first-in/first-out basis. 
(Ord. 2009-02, Ord. 2010-10, S3) 
17.19.070 CREDITS, OFFSETS, AND REIMBURSEMENTS. 
A. 	As a general policy, owners/developers that propose, or are required to physically construct improvements of a type and nature for which an impact fee would normally be assessed shall be eligible for offsets of up to one hundred (100) percent of the impact fees assessed to a particular phase or filing of a development, provided that the constructed improvements are of general benefit to the City of Fruita and general public, as determined by the city, and are not required solely because of the development. 
B. 	For constructed improvements meeting the provisions of subsection (A) above, where the construction cost exceeds the assessed impact fee, developers are eligible for additional credit against impact fees assessable at a future phase or filing, or for reimbursement by the city from previously collected impact fees. Credits for the cost of constructed improvements may be carried over or transferred to successive filings or phases within the same development, but in no case shall credits be carried over or transferred to a different development or project. 
Revised 8/31//2018 17-184 	Land Use Code 
C. 	In all cases, offsets or credits against one (1) fee, such as a transportation impact fee, cannot be used to offset or credit another type of fee, such as a Public Parks, Open Spaces and trail impact fee/Dedication. 
D. 	Constructed improvements to designated State Highways are eligible for the same offsets and credits provided for improvements to other streets and roads, provided the improvements are of benefit to the general public and not just the property being developed. By way of example, street widening and the installation of a sidewalk along a State Highway would be eligible for offsets and credits, but acceleration/deceleration lanes strictly servicing the development would not be eligible for offsets or credits. 
E. 	Specific to transportation impact fees, offsets or credits for the value of right-of-way abutting the development are specifically not allowed. 
F. 	The purpose and monetary value of any offset, credit, or reimbursement against assessed impact fees shall be specifically delineated in the appropriate section of the subdivision or development improvements agreement for the development, and the basis (e.g. cost of constructed improvements) of the offset, credit, or reimbursement shall be detailed in the improvements agreement. 
G. 	The City Council may, by an affirmative vote of at least three fourths (3/4) of all members of the Council, waive, suspend or alter all or some of the impact fees imposed by this Chapter, or agree to pay some or all of the impact fees imposed on a proposed development or redevelopment from other funds of the city that are not restricted to other uses upon finding such waiver, suspension, alteration or payment is necessary to promote the economic development of the city or public health, safety and general welfare of its residents. Any resolution adopted by the City Council providing for the waiver, suspension or altering of impact fees shall contain specific findings of fact supporting the waiver, suspension, alteration or payment. 
(Ord. 2009-02, Ord. 2010-10, S3, Ord. 2015-12) 
17.19.080 REFUND OF IMPACT FEES PAID. 
A. 	If a development approval expires without commencement of construction or development, the owner/developer shall be entitled to a refund without interest, of impact fees paid, unless otherwise agreed by the city and the owner/developer, except that the city shall retain one (1) percent of the fee to offset a portion of the cost of collection and refund. The owner/developer must submit a letter requesting a refund to the Community Development Department within thirty (30) days following expiration of the development approval granted. 
B. 	Unless otherwise provided in this Title, any funds not expended or encumbered by the end of the calendar quarter immediately following ten (10) years from the date the impact fees were paid shall, upon application of the then current land owner, be returned to such land owner with interest at the legal rate, provided that the land owner submits an 
Revised 8/31//2018 17-185 	Land Use Code 
application for a refund to the Community Development Department within one hundred eighty (180) days following expiration of such ten (10) year period. 
(Ord. 2009-02; Ord. 2015-12) 
17.19.090 PUBLIC PARKS, OPEN SPACES, AND TRAILS IMPACT FEE/DEDICATION. 
A. 	The City of Fruita has determined that new residential developments cause financial impacts to the city’s public park, open space, and trail systems necessitating capital improvements that would not be required without such development. The city has adopted a parks, open space, and trails master plan which provides general policy guidelines and planning recommendations for provision of public parks, open space, and trails. The purpose of this section is to implement and be consistent with the city’s master plan, specifically, the parks, open space, and trails section of the master plan, by requiring all new residential development to contribute a proportionate share of the public parks, open space, and trails necessary to accommodate any impacts or need for such facilities through the dedication of land and/or fees in lieu of land dedications. 
The dedication of land and/or the payment of the cash equivalent will enable the city to provide parks in the proper location and of the proper size to serve the citizens of the city. This regulation also is adopted to help discourage the proliferation of small parcels, tracts, and outlots that are ostensibly created as open space and/or parks but are not sized, located or maintained as functional sites for these uses. 
Consistent with this Section and with Chapter 17.29 of this Title, every residential development which increases the number of dwelling units above that which was approved as of the effective date of this title shall include a dedication of land to the city or other entity, as determined by the City Council, to be used for public parks, open space, and/or trails and/or payment of a public parks, open space, and/or trails fee in lieu of such dedication, as provided herein. Accessory dwelling units are not subject to this fee. 
B. 	Amount of Land Dedication Required. Land for public parks, open space, and trails shall be based on the adopted level of service standard as identified in the Parks, Open Space, and Trails Master Plan (POST Plan) as follows: 
For every 1,000 residents, the following parks and trail areas are needed to meet the level of service standard identified in the POST Plan: 
2.0 acres of neighborhood parks 
4.0 acres of community parks, and 
1.0 mile of trails 
Revised 8/31//2018 17-186 	Land Use Code 
Parkland per household is the product of the average household size multiplied by the level of service standard. Average household size is 2.52 people per dwelling unit (which is the US Census Bureau’s 2006 Colorado statewide average): 
2.52 * (2.0/1,000 = .005 acres per household for neighborhood parks 
2.52 * (4.0/1,000 = .010 acres per household for community parks 
2.52 	(1/0/1,000 = .0025 miles per household for primary trails 
C. 	Dedication and Improvement of Public Parks, Open Space, and Trails. Standards for when a fee in lieu of land dedication is required or when land is required to be dedicated, including improvements to the dedicated land, is identified in Chapter 29 of this Title. 
If credit is to be given for land and improvements dedicated for public use, the credit shall be based on the estimated cost of the improvements including installation costs and the average cost of land in the area. The average cost of land shall be set annually by the City Council by resolution. 
D. 	Payment in Lieu of Dedication and Improvements. The amount of payment to be provided in lieu of land dedication shall be based on the number of acres of land dedication which otherwise would be required. The following formula, combined with consideration of affordability issues, the goals of the city’s Master Plan, and other community issues, will be used to determine the fee required and such fee shall be set annually the City Council by resolution. 
Acquisition costs of un-subdivided development-ready land:  $57,000 per acre 
Neighborhood park development costs:  $140,000 per acre 
Community park development costs: $180,000 per acre 
Primary trails development costs: $420,000 per mile 

Neighborhood park fee calculation: .005 acres X ($57,000 + $140,000) = $985 per household 
Community park fee calculation: .010 acres X ($57,000 + $180,000) = $2,370 per household 
Primary trails fee calculation:  .0025 miles X $420,000 = $1,050 per household 
Maximum combined parkland and trail impact fee = $4,405 
The above land values and development costs are based on average land values in Fruita and data on recent park and trail construction costs in the region for 2009. 
E. 	The city may require the applicant to dedicate other land owned by the applicant for use as a public park, open space, or trail. If the city determines to accept other land not 
Revised 8/31//2018 17-187 	Land Use Code 
within the development instead of or as partial payment toward, the land dedication/fee payment required hereunder, the amount of land dedication shall be the same amount of land that would otherwise be dedicated within the proposed development. 
F. 	The proceeds from a fee in lieu of land dedication, shall be placed in a public parks, open space, and trails fund established by the city and maintained for the acquisition and improvement of land for public parks, open space, and trails, which may benefit the residents of the city in general, as well as those of the proposed development. 
(Ord. 2009-02, Ord. 2010-10, S3) 
17.19.100 SCHOOL LAND DEDICATION. 
A. 	When Required. Every subdivision or other development, which is proposed to contain residential units and which increases the number of permitted residential dwelling units over and above that approved as of the effective date of this Section shall be required to dedicate land for school purposes, based on the increased number of approved dwelling units, if the Mesa County School District No. 51 ("School District") determines that such development includes within it "suitable school lands" which are necessary for implementing a school plan. If such subdivision does not contain "suitable school lands," the fee required under Section 17.19.110 shall be paid in lieu of a school land dedication, based upon the increased number of approved residential dwelling units. The provisions of this Section and Section 17.19.110 shall be the exclusive standards for the dedication of "suitable school lands" and imposition of fees in lieu thereof as prescribed by Section 17.19.110, and in the event of any conflict between such provisions and any other provision contained in this Chapter, the requirements of this Section and Section 
17.19.110 shall control. 
In the event a dedication of land for school purposes is required under this Section, such dedication shall be made by the owner at or before the time of approval of the subdivision Final Plat Final Planned Unit Development Plan, or Planning Clearance. No such approval shall be granted until good and sufficient title to the "suitable school lands" to be dedicated under this Section, free and clear of all liens and encumbrances whatsoever, except for current general property taxes and patent reservations, is conveyed or dedicated to, and accepted by, the School District. 
B. 	Amount. The amount of "suitable school lands" which may be required to be dedicated under this Section shall be roughly proportional to the additional real property required by the School District for expansion of existing school facilities and construction of new school facilities to accommodate enrollment growth from the proposed residential subdivision and the future inhabitants thereof. Such rough proportionality shall be deemed to be met by the following formula: 
Number of dwelling units in the proposed residential development x Student generation fee factor of .023 = 
Revised 8/31//2018 17-188 	Land Use Code 
Number of acres of suitable school lands required 
The student generation fee factor is based upon a study conducted by Mesa County School District No. 51 and referenced in the Intergovernmental Agreement between Mesa County School District No. 51 and the City of Fruita, and may be modified from time to time in the manner provided in subsection 17.19.110(F) below. 
(Ord. 2009-02, Ord. 2015-12) 
17.19.110 FEE IN LIEU OF SCHOOL LAND DEDICATION. 
A. 	When Required. Except for developments where a school land dedication is required in accordance with Section 17.19.100 above, or is permitted under subsection (D) below, or an exemption under subsection (C) applies, all proposed development which increases the number of approved dwelling units over and above the number approved as of the effective date of this Section , shall pay fees in lieu of school land dedication (SLD fee) in an amount per unit, based upon the increased number of dwelling units, set forth in subsection (F) hereof. In no case shall the requirement of SLD fees or the amount thereof be subject to individualized determination as provided in subsection 17.19.040(C) or (D). SLD fees shall be collected by the city for the exclusive use and benefit of the School District, and shall be expended by such School District solely to acquire real property or an interest in real property reasonably needed for development or expansion of school sites and facilities, or to reimburse the School District for sums expended to acquire such property or interests. Revenues derived from such fees shall be used only for such purposes. 
B. 	Payment of SLD Fee. 
1. 	
No Planning Clearance for a building containing residential units shall be approved until and unless the applicable SLD fee has been paid as required by this Section based on the increased number of approved dwelling units. No SLD fee shall be required or collected under this Section with respect to any subdivision for which final approval has been granted as of the effective date of this Section.  

2. 	
In the sole discretion of the City Council, the city may elect to approve a Planning Clearance subject to payment of required SLD fees due under this Section pursuant to a deferred payment plan. Provided, however, any deferred payment plan shall provide for a performance guarantee such as a performance bond, irrevocable letter of credit, or escrow fund approved by the City Council, to assure payment of such fees. 

3. 	
Any plan for payment of SLD fees on a deferred basis in accordance with subsection (B)(2) above shall be documented in a written deferred payment plan. Such deferred payment plan shall contain, at a minimum, the following: 


a. 	The legal description of the real property subject to the deferred payment plan. 
Revised 8/31//2018 17-189 	Land Use Code 
b. 	
A detailed statement of the SLD fees owed pursuant to the condition of approval of the Planning Clearance, which remain unpaid. 

c. 	
The agreement of the owner/developer to pay all SLD fees owed with respect to such real property upon the sale of such property or upon application for a Planning Clearance for one (1) or more dwelling units to be constructed on such property, which ever first occurs. 

d. 	
A description of the performance guarantee assuring that such fees shall be paid when due and owing. 

e. 	
The notarized signature of the record owners of the property or their duly authorized agents. 

f. 	
The notarized signature of the Community Development Department Director or his or her designee, indicating approval of the deferred payment plan. 


C. 	Exemptions. The following shall be exempted from dedication of school lands or payment of the SLD fee: 
1. 	
Subdivisions or other developments containing only non-residential buildings; and 

2. 	
Subdivisions or other developments containing only nursing homes, adult foster care facilities, or specialized group care facilities; and 

3. 	
Approved residential developments that are subject to recorded covenants restricting the age of the residents of dwelling units contained within such developments in such a manner that the dwelling units may be classified as "housing for older persons" pursuant to the Federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988. 


D. 	Credits. 
1. 	
An applicant for subdivision or other development approval who owns other "suitable school lands" within the same School District may offer to convey such lands to the District in exchange for credit against all or a portion of the SLD fees otherwise due or to become due. The offer must be in writing, specifically request credit against fees in lieu of school land dedication, and set forth the amount of credit requested. If the city and the School District accept such offer, the credit shall be in the amount of the value of the "suitable school lands" conveyed, as determined by written agreement between the city, the School District and the owner/developer. 

2. 	
Credit against SLD fees otherwise due or to become due will not be provided until good and sufficient title to the property offered under this subsection is conveyed to and accepted by the School District in which the development is located. Upon such conveyance, the School District and the city shall provide the owner/developer with a 


Revised 8/31//2018 17-190 	Land Use Code 
letter or certificate setting forth the dollar amount of the credit, the reason for the credit, and a description of the project or development to which the credit shall be applied. 
3. Credits shall not be transferable from one project or development to another. 
E. Refund of Fees Paid. 
1. 	
Any SLD fee, which has not been expended by a School District within five (5) years of the date of collection shall be refunded, with all accumulated interest, if any, to the person or entity which paid the fee. Prior to such refund, such amount shall be reduced by an amount equal to three (3) percent of the principal amount to be refunded, for the costs incurred by the city in the refund of such fee. The city shall give written notice by first class mail to the person or entity, which paid the fee at the last known address as contained in the records of the city or Mesa County Clerk and Recorder. If such person or entity does not file a written claim for such refund with the city within ninety (90) days of the mailing of such notice, such refund shall be forfeited and shall be retained and used for the purposes set forth in subsection 17.19.110(A). 

2. 	
The City Council may, upon the School District's request, extend the five (5) year period of time specified in Paragraph (1) of this subsection above upon a showing that such extension is reasonable necessary in order for the School District to complete or close a purchase transaction entered into in writing by the District prior to expiration of such period, or to give the District an opportunity to exercise a purchase option it acquired prior to expiration of such period. Such request shall be made at a public hearing of the City Council. In no event shall any extension of time exceed one (1) additional five (5) year period. 


F. SLD Fees-Establishment and Application. 
1. 	
SLD fees shall be collected and held in trust for the use and benefit of the School District pursuant to Section 17.19.120. Such fees shall be expended by the School District to acquire additional real property for expansion of existing school facilities and construction of new school facilities necessitated by new residential development in the School District, or to reimburse the School District for sums expended to acquire such property. The amount of the SLD fee shall be based on a methodology which takes into account the student generation rates of new residential development, the quantity of land required to build new school facilities on a per pupil basis, and the anticipated cost of acquiring suitable school lands in the School District to expand existing school facilities and construct new school facilities to accommodate new residential development without decreasing current levels of educational services. 

2. 	
At the time SLD fees are initially adopted and annually thereafter, the City Council shall determine the average cost per acre of "suitable school lands," after a public 


Revised 8/31//2018 17-191 	Land Use Code 
hearing. The city shall give the School District sixty (60) days prior written notice of the hearing. Such hearing shall consider the School District's long range capital improvement plans and any other evidence, comments or recommendations submitted by the School District and the public in making such determination. 
3. 	The SLD fee shall then be set, by resolution of the City Council, in accordance with the following formula: 
Cost per acre of suitable school lands within the School District x Student generation fee factor of .023= SLD fee per dwelling unit 
[For example, if the average cost of "suitable school lands" is fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.00) per acre, the SLD fee per dwelling unit would be fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.00) times (X) .023, or three hundred forty-five dollars ($345.00).] 
4. 	The student generation fee factor may also be modified at the hearing, provided that either the School District gives notice to the City Council that it requests such a modification at least thirty (30) days prior to the hearing, or the City Council adopts a motion providing for consideration of a modification of said fee factor and its hearing notice to the School District pursuant to this subsection so states. Said hearing shall consider the School District's school facilities plan currently in place, the methodology and data supporting the proposed modification, and any evidence, comments or recommendations submitted by the County Community Development Department, the City's Community Development Department, the School District and interested members of the public. 
(Ord. 2009-02, Ord. 2015-12) 
17.19.120 SCHOOL LAND DEDICATION FEE TRUST FUND. 
A. 	Creation. A School Land Dedication Trust Fund ("SLD Trust Fund") shall be established for the benefit of School District. All SLD fees collected by the city, pursuant to this Chapter, for approved residential dwelling units in the city and within the boundaries of the School District shall be deposited in the SLD Trust Fund. Such SLD Trust Fund shall be governed by the provisions of this Chapter, as supplemented by the terms of the intergovernmental agreement entered into between the city and the School District. Such agreement shall substantially comply with the requirements of this Section, and shall include, but need not be limited to, provisions regarding the following: 
1. 	Maintenance and management of the SLD Trust Fund as a separate interest bearing account in accordance with Sections 24-75-601 to 605 C.R.S., apart from all other funds of the city, the funds in which are held in trust for the use and benefit of the School District; 
Revised 8/31//2018 17-192 	Land Use Code 
2. 	
The powers and fiduciary obligations of one (1) or more trustees named in the agreement with respect to the management of the SLD Trust Fund; 

3. 	
The retention of a specified portion of the SLD fees collected by the city for the reasonable costs incurred by the city in the collection of said fees; 

4. 	
An accounting system to ensure that SLD fees are expended for the provision of new or expanded school sites benefiting the School District for which such fees are paid; 

5.

17.19.130 TRANSPORTATION IMPACT FEE. 
A. 	The City of Fruita has determined that new developments and expansion, modification or redevelopment of existing developments cause financial impacts to the city’s transportation system necessitating capital improvements that would not be required without such development. These impacts include wear and tear on existing pavements requiring rehabilitation or reconstruction of existing streets, increased traffic volumes requiring widening to improve traffic flow and provide better turning movements, additional traffic control devices and safety concerns associated with the interaction of vehicular traffic with pedestrian and bicycle traffic. 
B. 	The city has further determined that typically, no single development creates enough traffic to warrant construction of off-site improvements based strictly on a traffic capacity 
Revised 8/31//2018 17-194 	Land Use Code 
analysis or a required level of service analysis. However, each development incrementally depletes existing capacity and incrementally decreases the level of service.  The cumulative impacts from new developments results in unacceptable depletions in capacity and level of service, thereby requiring the expenditure of capital funds for improvements. 
C. 	The city has also determined that irrespective of a capacity or level of service analysis for traffic flow, construction of facilities to facilitate safe turning movements for vehicles, and for the safe movement of bicycles and pedestrians are reasonable requirements for urban streets, and shall be accounted for in any impact fee calculation. 
D. 	Consistent with the city's need to plan for, engineer and construct transportation improvements resulting from the cumulative impacts of new development, including bikeways and sidewalks, the city's general policy is that the proportional impact resulting from a new development be paid by the owner/developer, and consistent with the provisions of this Chapter, a transportation impact fee shall be assessed for new development.  
1. 	For developments for which a site specific traffic impact analysis is conducted pursuant to Sections 17.19.040 and 17.15.140 of this Title, the transportation impact fee shall be calculated by the city based upon the following criteria: 
a. 	
An evaluation of the site-specific traffic impact analysis, which shall describe the percentage impact of the development on the local street network in the vicinity of the development. The traffic impact analysis shall include an estimate of twenty (20) year future traffic volumes, and use a pass-by traffic growth rate of two (2) percent or less, unless otherwise approved by the city. 

b. 	
Estimated costs of future improvements on local streets and intersections, plus a calculated pro rata cost for improvements to regional roads. The scope of future local improvements shall be based on the long term needs of the city, as determined by the city, consistent with long range planning documents, and irrespective of a strict level of service analysis. Improvements may include, but are not limited to, curb, gutter, and sidewalk; bikeways; traffic signals; pavement widening, replacement, or rehabilitation; traffic calming devices; and traffic control devices. The scope of future regional road improvements, and estimated costs thereof, shall be determined from current and future regional planning studies, including the Transportation Impact Fee Study prepared for Mesa County by Duncan & Associates, and dated September, 2002. (The "Duncan Study") 

c. 	
The roughly proportional impacts from the development on individual local streets and/or intersections multiplied by the total estimated costs for these improvements, plus a calculated pro rata amount for regional roads, shall equal the total transportation impact fee. 


Revised 8/31//2018 17-195 	Land Use Code 
2. 	The base rate for residential subdivisions with single family and duplex dwelling units for which no traffic impact analysis is performed, shall be three thousand two hundred dollars ($3,200.00) per dwelling unit. The base rate may be adjusted by resolution of the City Council annually for inflation based on the change in the Colorado Department of Transportation’s Construction Cost Index. For multi­family dwelling units in excess of two units, the base rate of three thousand two hundred dollars ($3,200.00) shall be multiplied by a factor of 0.69 per unit for the fee per dwelling unit. Said fees are based upon traffic impact analysis performed according to subsection (D)(1) of this Section and adjusted to reflect recent actual costs incurred on local road projects. The base rate may be adjusted by resolution of the City Council annually for inflation based on the change in the Colorado 
Department of Transportation’s Construction Cost Index. 
3. 	The transportation impact fee for commercial, industrial and other uses specified in the following table shall be a base rate of one thousand five hundred and eighty-nine dollars ($1,589) multiplied by the factor listed for that use. The base rate may be adjusted by resolution of the City Council annually for inflation based 
on the change in the Colorado Department of Transportation’s Construction Cost 
Index.

4. 	For specific uses not identified in the table above, the transportation impact fee factor shall be determined by the city based on an evaluation of the traffic generating characteristics of the proposed development compared to specific uses listed in the table. 
a. For non single family residential developments for which no traffic impact analysis is performed, the transportation impact fee shall be calculated based on the schedule set forth in subsection (3) above. 
Revised 06/01/09 17-197 Land Use Code 
b. 
A change of use in an existing commercial, industrial, or institutional structure that does not involve a change in the square footage of the structure shall not require a new transportation impact fee unless the use requires a site plan review, conditional use permit or rezone in which case a traffic study may be required and a transportation impact fee may be imposed based on the net increase in traffic. Alternatively, the transportation impact fee assessed shall be calculated based on the difference in Table Values for the new verses the previous use.  

c. 
In many instances, a particular structure may include auxiliary uses associated with the primary land use. For example; in addition to the actual production of goods, manufacturing facilities usually also have office, warehouse, research, and other associated functions. The impact fees generally are assessed based on the primary land use. If the applicant can document that a secondary land use accounts for over twenty-five (25) percent of the gross floor area of the structure, and that the secondary use is not assumed in the trip generation or other impact data for the primary use, then the impact fees may be assessed based on the disaggregated square footage of the primary and secondary land use. 

d. 
For an expansion, redevelopment, or modification of an existing development, the fee shall be based on the net increase in the impact of the new use and/or square footage as compared to the previous use and/or square footage. 

e. 
In the event that the proposed change of land use type, redevelopment, or modification results in a net decrease in the fee for the new use or development as compared to the previous use or development, there shall be no refund of impact fees previously paid. 

f. 
For fees expressed per one thousand (1,000) square feet, the square footage shall be determined according to gross floor area, measured from the outside surface of exterior walls and excluding unfinished basements and enclosed parking areas. The fees shall be prorated and assessed based on actual floor area, not on the floor area rounded to the nearest one thousand (1,000) square feet. 


5. All transportation impact fees shall be deposited in a fund created by the city for transportation improvements until used to construct actual capital facilities and improvements on impacted local streets and intersections, or allocated to regional road improvements. Consistent with Section 17.19.060, the total amount of deposited impact fees may be used at the discretion of the city to construct improvements to the local street network, or to regional street projects, so long as the fees are used to perform improvements to streets and/or intersections impacted by the development.

17.19.140 CHIP AND SEAL IMPACT FEE. The city has determined that the life of a new asphalt street can be extended through the use of a "chip and seal" coat within the first two (2) to five (5) years after the construction of the new street. In order to extend the life of asphalt streets in new developments and reduce initial maintenance costs to the City of Fruita, a chip and seal impact fee will be assessed for each new development that provides additional constructed public streets. The chip and seal impact fee changes annually, and is calculated based on the current square yard bid cost of chip and seal work, as contracted by the city, multiplied by the total number of square yards of new asphalt for dedicated, city maintained streets interior to a development as shown in the approved schedule of improvements contained in the applicable subdivision improvements agreement or development improvements agreement. (Ord. 2009-02, Ord. 2015-12) 
17.19.150 DRAINAGE IMPACT FEE. 
A. 	The City of Fruita had prepared a Storm Water Management Master Plan (SWMMP) (June 1998) which provides general policy guidelines and planning recommendations for storm water management, and provides specific criteria for calculating drainage impacts and associated impact fees for new developments. The City of Fruita has determined that storm water management is a desirable and necessary part of new developments, and has adopted the Storm Water Management Master Plan (SWMMP) (June 1998) as a component of its Master Plan. Technical criteria for drainage calculations are also found in the Mesa County Storm Water Management Manual (SWMM), which has also been adopted as a component of the city's Master Plan. 
B. 	Consistent with the justifications and formula found in the SWMMP, a drainage impact fee shall be assessed for all new developments when the calculated runoff volume and/or flow rate from developed conditions exceeds the runoff volume and/or flow rate from historic (pre-development) conditions. A drainage impact fee which the City Council has determined is roughly proportional to the infrastructure impacts caused by the development, shall be calculated according to the following formula: 
Drainage impact fee ($) = B x (C100d-C100h) x A0.7 where: 
B = Base Value = $15,793, as of January 1, 2009, to be adjusted annually for inflation based on the Consumer Price Index, All Items, All Urban Consumers, Western Region, size B/C, published on a monthly basis by the United States Department of Labor (Bureau of Labor Statistics) (ACPI-U). 
C100 = 100 year Rational Method composite runoff coefficient, with subscripts "d" and "h" representing developed and historic conditions respectively. 
A = Area to be developed, in acres 
C. 	Consistent with Section 17.19.060 of this Chapter, drainage impact fees shall be 
Revised 06/01/09 17-199 Land Use Code 
deposited in a fund established by the city for such purposes and shall be used to resolve drainage and flooding issues anywhere within the basin affected by the development being charged the impact fee, and may also be used for city-wide or regional studies and plans, so long as the percentage of impact fees used on city-wide or regional studies and plans is roughly proportional to the percentage of the study or plan devoted to the basin from which the fees were generated.

Revised 06/01/09 17-203 	Land Use Code 
17.21.100 PERFORMANCE GUARANTEE REQUIRED. 
A. 	Every subdivision improvements agreement or development improvements agreement shall provide that in order to secure the construction and installation of the required improvements listed in the schedule of improvements, whether on-site or off-site, including tasks not specifically itemized within the schedule of improvements but which can be reasonably considered necessary for the development and for which the property owner or developer is responsible, the property owner or developer shall furnish the city with: (1) cash to be deposited in an escrow account that is acceptable to the city pursuant to an escrow and disbursement agreement approved by the city; or (2) an irrevocable letter of credit that is acceptable to the city, or (3) a performance bond issued by a surety approved by the city, in an amount equal to one hundred ten (110) percent of the estimated cost of all required improvements. 
B. 	The developer or property owner shall deliver to the city the performance guarantee required by subsection (A) above prior to the recording of a subdivision final plat, or prior to recording of a PUD final development plan, or prior to the issuance of a conditional use permit or planning clearance, as applicable. Unless expressly authorized by the city, work shall not be commenced within the development until the approved security is furnished to the city. No lot within a subdivision shall be conveyed to any third party until the approved security is delivered to the city and the final plat has been recorded in the records of the Mesa County Clerk and Recorder. 
C. 	Upon completion of a certain class of improvements, such as wastewater facilities by way of example, evidenced by a detailed cost breakdown of the completed improvements, the amount of any security tendered may be reduced by up to one hundred (100) percent of the approved cost for the installation of such class of improvements, upon approval by the city. Upon completion of all of the improvements required by the subdivision improvements agreement or development improvements agreement, and upon final inspection and approval by the city of all such improvements, the City Council shall further authorize a reduction of the amount of the security guaranteeing the required subdivision or development improvements to ten (10) percent of the total actual cost of the improvements. 
D. 	Any performance guarantee tendered to the city shall be fully released and discharged only by express action of the City Council upon expiration of the twenty-four (24) month warranty period described in Section 17.21.080 and the correction of any defects discovered during such warranty period. In the event that the correction of defects are not satisfactorily completed upon the expiration of the twenty-four (24) month warranty period, the city will retain the existing performance guarantee and may require a new performance guarantee and withhold further planning clearances for building permits and certificates of occupancy within the subdivision or development until the new performance guarantee is tendered to the city. 
E. 	Every subdivision improvements agreement or a development improvements agreement shall provide that upon the developer's or property owner's failure to perform its 
Revised 06/01/09 17-204 	Land Use Code 
obligations under such agreement and all other applicable plans, drawings, specifications and documents, as approved, within the time periods set forth in the agreement, the city may give written notice to the developer or property owner of the nature of the default and an opportunity to be heard before the City Council concerning such default. If the default has not been remedied within thirty (30) days of receipt of the notice or of the date of any hearing before the City Council, whichever is later (or such reasonable time period as is necessary to cure the default provided that the developer or the property owner has commenced in good faith to cure the default), the city may then give written notice to the developer or property owner and any surety on a performance bond, issuer of a letter of credit, or escrow agent that the city, as agent for the developer or property owner, is proceeding with the task of installing and completing the remaining required improvements in whole or in part. 
F. 	Every subdivision improvements agreement or development improvements agreement must contain a power of attorney whereby the developer or property owner designates and irrevocably appoints the City Manager of the City of Fruita, Colorado as its attorney in fact and agent for the purpose of completing all necessary improvements required by the subdivision improvements agreement or development improvements agreement in the event of a default by the developer or property owner. The agreement shall be recorded in the office of the Clerk and Recorder of Mesa County, Colorado, and shall constitute constructive notice of the agreement and the power of attorney contained therein. The agreement and power of attorney contained therein may be enforced by the city pursuant to all legal and equitable remedies available, including an action for specific performance in a court of competent jurisdiction. 
G. 	If a substantial amount of time elapses between the time of delivery of the security and actual construction of the improvements, the city may require a reasonable increase in the amount of the applicable security, if necessary because of estimated increased costs of construction. 
(Ord. 2009-02)

17.29.010 PURPOSE. The purpose of this Chapter is to guide the planning and design of public parks, trails, open spaces, and other public sites, where such facilities are required to be provided pursuant to this Title. Where a provision of this Chapter is preceded by the word “shall” or “must,” the provision is mandatory; absent the word “shall” or “must,” the provision is a guideline. However, the city decision-making body may invoke guidelines as requirements where the applicant has requested approval of a Density Bonus under Chapter 17.08, Planned Unit Development approval under Chapter 17.17, or where the applicant has requested one or more adjustments pursuant to Chapter 17.11 and/or other provisions of this Title. The intent of this Chapter is to implement the city’s Master Plan by providing for a comprehensive, integrated network of public parks, trails, recreation facilities and open spaces to be developed and preserved as the community grows. (Ord. 2009-02, Ord. 2010-10, S4) 
17.29.020 GENERAL PROVISIONS. 
A. 	The city will typically require the payment of a fee in lieu of land dedication for the parks, open space, and trail impact fee/dedication requirement as outlined in Section

For residential developments with less than 1,000 residents, public parks, open space, and/or trails may be provided or a fee in lieu of this dedication requirement may be paid as determined by the city decision making body through the land development review process and based on the approval criteria of Section 17.29.030. 
B.       	Land to be dedicated for parks, open space, and/or trails must be contained in an outlot 
dedicated to either the City of Fruita or a Property Owners’ Association and the outlot 
must include an easement for public access/use on the same basis as the land in question is available to the residents of the development in which it is located. Private open space, parks, trails, or other private recreation areas in any development shall not be a substitute for the required public parks, open space, and trails impact fee/dedication. 
Revised 10/1/2018 17-228 	Land Use Code 
C. 	In all cases, land and improvements and/or a fee in lieu of land and improvements will be required to meet the requirements set forth in Section 17.19.090.

5. 	
The land area to be dedicated should have at least twenty percent (20%) of the perimeter of the parkland area adjacent to a public right-of-way so that the park is visible to the public and to increase safety by allowing activities in the park to be easily seen from other public areas. 

6. 	
The land to be dedicated should be relatively flat and lend itself to organized recreational activities without the need for substantial improvements to accommodate facilities for recreational activities. 

7. 	
The size and shape of the land to be dedicated must lend itself to recreational activities. 

8. 	
The soil conditions and drainage must allow for development of park facilities. 

9. 	
The parkland should be used to organize and focus lot, block, and circulation patterns in a development and enhance surrounding development. Street, block, 


Revised 10/1/2018 17-229 	Land Use Code 
lot and building patterns shall respond to the views, landscape and recreational opportunities provided by such parks, open space, and trail areas.

Both the land area and the improvement to the land are eligible for credit. The minimum required width is five feet and the minimum required landscaping must consist of one large tree for every forty linear feet along the public right-of-way and appropriate groundcover and irrigation. This outlot must be owned and maintained by a Homeowners Association and contain a public access easement in order to receive credit. 


B. 	The following public trails will be required to be provided in all developments to provide an adequate bicycle and pedestrian transportation system. The land area required for the public trail is not eligible for credit against the otherwise required public parks, open space, and trails impact fee/dedication. Construction of the public trail(s) may be required and the cost of trail construction of a primary trail or an off-site trail is eligible for credits against the public parks, open space, and trails impact fee/dedication. Internal links necessary to provide an adequate bicycle and transportation network internal to the development are not eligible for credits.

5. 	
Trails proposed adjacent to a roadway should be a last resort when no other options exist. Attached sidewalks are not considered trails. If a trail is proposed 


Revised 10/1/2018 17-230 	Land Use Code 
adjacent to a roadway, the trail must be detached from the roadway and trail user safety shall be a primary consideration. 
6. 	
The width of land required for primary trails shall be at least 30 feet, but 50 feet or more is preferred. The width of the trail surface for a primary trail should be at least 10 feet and may be required to be wider in certain circumstances such as in areas of limited sit distance. The width of land required for local trails must be at least 16 feet for short connections (such as between cul-de-sacs) and wider for longer connections (such as a trial behind rear property lines along a block). The width of the trail surface for local trails should be at least 8 feet and may be required to be wider in certain circumstances.

Open space that is not a park as defined in this Title is not eligible for credits against the otherwise required park, open space, and trails impact fee/dedication (with the exception of five foot wide landscape strips as described in Section 17.29.030.A.13). In open space areas, the emphasis is on resource protection or preservation and public use should be balanced with the need for resource protection. Types of public use should be limited to trails, benches, picnic sites, environmental interpretation and educational areas.  Easements for a public trail, protection of natural or historical features, watersheds, wildlife, and similar resources may be required and improvements to open space areas may be eligible for credits against the otherwise required public parks, open space, and trails impact fee/dedication and will be determined on a case-by-case basis by the city decision making body through the land development review process. 
C.

Before the expiration of said year, the City Council, upon its own initiative or upon the written request of the organization previously responsible for the maintenance of the private park, recreation area or common open spaces, shall call a public hearing upon notice to such organization or to the residents of the development, at which hearing such organization or the residents of the development shall show cause why such maintenance by the city should not, at the election of the city, continue for a succeeding year.  
Revised 10/1/2018 17-234 	Land Use Code 
If the City Council determines that such organization is ready and able to maintain the private park, recreation area or common open spaces in a reasonable condition, the city shall cease to maintain such area at the end of the one (1) year period.  If the City Council determines that such organization is not ready and able to maintain said private park, recreation area or common open spaces in a reasonable condition, the city may, at its discretion, continue to maintain the private park, recreation area or common open spaces during the next succeeding year and, subject to a similar hearing and determination, in each year thereafter. 
C. 	The cost of the maintenance of a private park, recreation area, trail or common open spaces by the City of Fruita, including an administration fee equal to ten (10) percent of such cost, shall be paid by the owners of properties within the development that have a right of enjoyment of the private park, recreation area or common open spaces, and any unpaid assessments shall become a tax lien on said properties. The city shall file a notice of such lien in the office of the Mesa County Clerk and Recorder upon the properties affected by such lien within the development and shall certify such unpaid assessments to the Mesa County Board of County Commissioners and the Mesa County Treasurer for collection, enforcement and remittance in the manner provided by law for the collection, enforcement, and remittance of general property taxes.

Choosing a Soil Amendment 	no. 7.235 
by J.G. Davis and C.R. Wilson1(5/05) 
Quick Facts... 
• 	
Soil amendments improve the physical properties of soils. 

• 	
Amendments are mixed into the soil. Mulches are placed on the soil surface. 

• 	
The best soil amendments increase water-and nutrient-holding capacity and improve aeration and water infiltration. 

• 	
Wood products can tie up nitrogen in the soil. 

• 
Sphagnum peat is superior to Colorado mountain peat. 

• 
When using biosolids, choose Grade 1 biosolids. 


A soil amendment is any material added to a soil to improve its physical properties, such as water retention, permeability, water infiltration, drainage, aeration and structure. The goal is to provide a better environment for roots. 
To do its work, an amendment must be thoroughly mixed into the soil. If it is merely buried, its effectiveness is reduced, and it will interfere with water and air movement and root growth. 
Amending a soil is not the same thing as mulching, although many mulches also are used as amendments. A mulch is left on the soil surface. Its purpose is to reduce evaporation and runoff, inhibit weed growth, and create an attractive appearance. Mulches also moderate soil temperature, helping to warm soils in the spring and cool them in the summer. Mulches may be incorporated into the soil as amendments after they have decomposed to the point that they no longer serve their purpose. 
Organic vs. Inorganic Amendments 
There are two broad categories of soil amendments: organic and inorganic. Organic amendments come from something that is or was alive. Inorganic amendments, on the other hand, are either mined or man-made. Organic amendments include sphagnum peat, wood chips, grass clippings, straw, compost, manure, biosolids, sawdust and wood ash. Inorganic amendments include vermiculite, perlite, tire chunks, pea gravel and sand. 
Not all of the above are recommended by Colorado State University. These are merely examples. Wood ash, an organic amendment, is high in both pH and salt. It can magnify common Colorado soil problems and should not be used as a soil amendment. Don't add sand to clay soil --this creates a soil structure similar to concrete. 
Organic amendments increase soil organic matter content and offer many benefits. Organic matter improves soil aeration, water infiltration, and both water-and nutrient-holding capacity. Many organic amendments contain plant nutrients and act as organic fertilizers. Organic matter also is an important energy source for bacteria, fungi and earthworms that live in the soil. 
Application Rates 
If your soil has less than 3 percent organic matter, then apply 3 cubic yards of your chosen organic amendment per 1,000 square feet. To avoid salt buildup, do not apply more than this. Retest your soil before deciding whether to add more soil amendment. 
Wood Products 
Wood products can tie up nitrogen in the soil and cause nitrogen deficiency in plants. Microorganisms in the soil use nitrogen to break down the wood. Within a few months, the nitrogen is released and again becomes available to plants. This hazard is greatest with sawdust, because it has a greater surface area than wood chips. If you plan to apply wood chips or sawdust, you may need to apply nitrogen fe 
If you plan to apply wood chips or sawdust, you may need to apply nitrogen fertilizer at the same time to avoid nitrogen deficiency. 
Sphagnum Peat vs. Mountain Peat 
Sphagnum peat is an excellent soil amendment, especially for sandy soils, which will retain more water after sphagnum peat application. Sphagnum peat is generally acid (i.e., low pH) and can help Gardeners grow plants that require a more acidic soil. Colorado mountain peat is not as good a soil amendment. It often is too fine in texture and generally has a higher pH. 
Mountain peat is mined from high-altitude wetlands that will take hundreds of years to rejuvenate, if ever. This mining is extremely disruptive to hydrologic cycles and mountain ecosystems. Sphagnum peat is harvested from bogs in Canada and the northern United States. The bogs can be revegetated after harvest and grow back relatively quickly in this moist environment. 
Are Biosolids Safe? 
Biosolids are byproducts of sewage treatment. They may be found alone or composted with leaves or other organic materials. The primary concerns about biosolids are heavy metal content, pathogen levels and salts. To avoid excessive levels of heavy metals and to ensure that pathogens have been killed, always choose a Grade 1 biosolid. While Grade 1 biosolids are acceptable for food Gardens, do not use them on root Crops because they will come in direct contact with the edible portion of the plant. Do not use biosolids below Grade 1 
Manure vs. Compost 
Fresh manure can harm plants due to elevated ammonia levels. To avoid this problem, use only aged manure (at least six months old). Pathogens are another potential problem with fresh manure, especially on vegetable Gardens. Compost manure for at least two heating cycles at 130 to 140 degrees F to kill any pathogens before applying the manure to vegetable Gardens. Most home composting systems do not sustain temperatures at this level. Home-composted products containing manure are best used in flower Gardens, shrub borders and other nonfood Gardens. See fact sheets 9.369, Preventing E. coli From Garden to Plate, and 7.212, Composting Yard Waste. 
During composting, ammonia gas is lost from the manure. Therefore, nitrogen levels may be lower in composted manure than in raw manure. On the other hand, the phosphorus and potassium concentrations will be higher in composted manure. Modify fertilizer practices accordingly. Salt levels also will be higher in composted manure than in raw manure. If salt levels are already high in your Garden soil, do not apply manures. 
Other composts are available that are made primarily from leaf or wood products alone or in combination with manures or biosolids. 
Factors to Consider When Choosing an Amendment 
There are at least four factors to consider in selecting a soil amendment: 
• 	
how long the amendment will last in the soil, 

• 	
soil texture, 

• 	
soil salinity and plant sensitivities to salts, and 

• 	
salt content and pH of the amendment. 


Laboratory tests can determine the salt content, pH and organic matter of organic amendments. The quality of bulk organic amendments for large-scale landscape uses can then be determined. 
Longevity of the Amendment 
The amendment you choose depends on your goals. 
• 	
Are you trying to improve soil physical properties quickly? Choose an 
amendment that decomposes rapidly. 


• 	
Do you want a long-lasting improvement to your soil? Choose an amendment that decomposes slowly. 

• 	
Do you want a quick improvement that lasts a long time? Choose a combination of amendments. 


Table 1: Decomposition rate of various amendments. Amendment Decomposition rate Grass clippings, manures Rapid decomposition (days to weeks) Composts Moderate decomposition (about six months) Wood chips (redwood, cedar), hardwood bark, peat Slow decomposition (possibly years)  

Soil Texture 
Soil texture, or the way a soil feels, reflects the size of the soil particles. Sandy soils have large soil particles and feel gritty. Clay soils have small soil particles and feel sticky. Both sandy soils and clay soils are a challenge for Gardeners. Loam soils have the ideal mixture of different size soil particles. 
When amending sandy soils, the goal is to increase the soil's ability to hold moisture and store nutrients. To achieve this, use organic amendments that are well decomposed, like composts or aged manures. 
With clay soils, the goal is to improve soil aggregation, increase porosity and permeability, and improve aeration and drainage. Fibrous amendments like peat, wood chips, tree bark or straw are most effective in this situation. 
Use Tables 2 and 3 for more specific recommendations. Because sandy soils have low water retention, choose an amendment with high water retention, like peat, compost or vermiculite. Clay soils have low permeability, so choose an amendment with high permeability, like wood chips, hardwood bark or perlite. Vermiculite is not a good choice for clay soils because of its high water retention. 
Table 2: Permeability and water retention of various soil types. Soil Texture Permeability Water Retention Sand high low Loam medium medium Silt low high Clay low high  

Table 3: Permeability and water retention of various soil amendments. Amendment Permeability Water Retention Fibrous Peat Wood chips Hardwood bark low-medium high high very high low-medium low-medium Humus Compost Aged manure low-medium low-medium medium-high medium Inorganic Vermiculite Perlite high high high low  

Soil Salinity and Plant Sensitivity to Salts 
Some forms of compost and manures can be high in salts. Avoid these amendments in soils that are already high in salts (above 3 mmhos/cm) or when growing plants that are sensitive to salts. Raspberry, strawberry, bean, carrot, onion, Kentucky bluegrass, maple, pine, viburnum and many other landscape plants are salt sensitive. In such cases, choose sphagnum peat or ground leaves instead of compost or manures. 
Salt Content and pH of the Amendment 
Always beware of salts in soil amendments. High salt content and high pH are common problems in Colorado soils. Therefore, avoid amendments that are high in salts or that have a high pH. Amendments high in salts and/or pH include wood ash, Colorado mountain peat and composted manures. An amendment with up to 10 mmhos/cm total salts is acceptable if well mixed into low-salt soils (less than 1 mmhos/cm). Amendments with a salt content greater than 10 mmhos/cm are questionable. Choose a low-salt amendment for soils testing high in salts. 
Sphagnum peat and compost made from purely plant sources are low in salts and are good choices for amending Colorado soils. Ask for an analysis of the organic amendments that you are considering, and choose your amendments wisely. If no analysis is available, test a small amount of the amendment before purchasing a large quantity.

17.35.010  PURPOSE AND DESCRIPTION.  The purpose of this Chapter is to allow the  

reasonable location of sexually oriented businesses within the city in a manner which will protect property values, neighborhoods and residents from the potential adverse secondary effects of sexually oriented businesses, while providing to those who desire to patronize sexually oriented businesses such opportunity in appropriate areas within the city. It is not the intent of this Chapter to suppress any speech activities protected by the First Amendment to the United States Constitution but to impose content neutral regulations which address the adverse secondary effects that sexually oriented businesses may have on adjoining properties. 
It has been determined, and reflected in the land use studies of various U.S. cities, that businesses which have as their primary purpose the selling, renting or showing of sexually explicit materials have negative secondary impacts upon surrounding businesses and residences. The experience in other U.S. cities is that the location of sexually oriented businesses significantly increases the incidence of crimes, especially sex offenses, including sexual assault, indecent exposure, lewd and lascivious behavior, and child molestation. 
It has been determined, and reflected in the land use studies of various U.S. cities, that sexually oriented businesses in business districts which are immediately adjacent to and which serve residential neighborhoods have a deleterious effect on both the business and the residential segments of the neighborhood, causing blight and down-grading of property values. 
It is the intent of these regulations to allow sexually oriented businesses to exist within the city in various dispersed locations rather than to allow them to concentrate in any one business area. It is further the purpose of these regulations to require separation requirements between sexually oriented businesses and residential uses, churches, parks, and educational institutions in an effort to buffer these uses from the secondary impacts created by sexually oriented business activity.

5.40.020 (N) of Title 5 of the Fruita Municipal Code. 
(Ord. 2009-02) 
17.35.030 CONDITIONAL USE PERMIT REQUIRED. A conditional use permit is required for the operation of a sexually oriented business in the General Commercial (GC) zone and the Limited Industrial Research and Development (LIRD) zone. Additional requirements for the granting of a conditional use permit are found in Section 17.13.040, conditional use permits. (Ord. 2009-02) 
17.35.040 SEPARATION REQUIREMENTS. No sexually oriented business shall be located within one thousand (1,000) feet of another sexually oriented business, residentially zoned or used property, church, day care center, park or educational institution (whether within or without the city). A waiver of the foregoing restrictions may be applied for in accordance with subsection (B) of this Section. 
A. 	Method of Measurement. The one thousand (1,000) feet separation measurement shall be made in a straight line without regard to intervening structures or objects from the nearest property line of the proposed sexually oriented business to the nearest property line of another sexually oriented business, residentially zoned or used property, church, park, day care center or educational institution. 
B. 	Waiver Criteria. In establishing the provisions of this Section, the City Council hereby finds and determines that there may be exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions which are applicable to properties within the city or to the intended uses of properties within the city that do not generally apply to the property or class of uses in the same zone, and such that denial of an application for relief would result in an inability to reasonably utilize property. Therefore, it is necessary to provide for such extraordinary relief in the form of a waiver. In reviewing such applications for waivers, the burden shall be upon the applicant to meet the criteria set forth in this Section.

E. 	Parking Regulations in Downtown Mixed Use zone: 
1. 	
The Downtown Mixed Use (DMU) zone is subject to different parking standards than the rest of the City of Fruita.

It provides a unique pedestrian oriented environment with each building built side by side with the next building and typically small narrow lots, relatively short blocks and alley access. Parking takes place on the streets and in back of the buildings off of the alleys. To require off-street parking facilities for each use at levels required for other commercial areas would destroy the character of the area and encourage the demolition of historic structures in favor of parking lots.

No off-street parking will be required for uses in existing buildings and reconstruction of existing buildings in the DMU zone south of Pabor Avenue (“Downtown Core”).  

3.

Alternatively, upon City Council adoption of a Parking District In Lieu Fee, proponents of new buildings may pay an in lieu fee which shall be dedicated to developing public parking facilities in the Downtown Core. 

4. 	
Where new development abuts Aspen Avenue in the Downtown Core, all off-street parking shall be provided on the rear one-half (½) of the lot and not within forty (40) feet of Aspen Avenue. Alternatively, off-street parking may be placed closer than forty (40) feet to Aspen Avenue where it is provided underground, or in a multistory parking garage.

Approved permits shall not be changed without the written consent of the city. 
2. 	Exceptions. The following work and/or projects are exempt from the permit requirements of this Chapter: 
a. 	
City capital improvement projects for which construction drawings have been issued and approved by the city and for which a project specific traffic control plan has been approved by the city. 

b. 	
Work performed in or adjacent to a County, State, or federal, right-of-way shall obtain applicable permits from the appropriate governing agency. 


E. 	Street Maintenance -Notice. The city shall not be responsible for the maintenance of public streets in new subdivisions and developments until the street improvements are approved and accepted by the city. In the event such street improvements have not been accepted, the city may post at all entrances to the subdivision or other development a sign which states: "Notice: Streets within this subdivision have not been accepted by the city for maintenance". 
(Ord. 2009-02) 
17.43.020 PRIVATE STREET CONSTRUCTION AND INSPECTION. Construction of 
private streets within the city is not preferred and shall be considered on an individual basis. Private streets shall be subject to the same process and design standards for a public street.  Private streets will not be maintained by the city. (Ord. 2009-02) 
17.43.030 PLANNING PRINCIPLES FOR LOCAL CIRCULATION SYSTEMS. Basic 
considerations in the design of local circulation systems shall recognize the following factors: (1) safety for both vehicular and pedestrian traffic; (2) efficiency of service for all users; (3) liability especially as affected by traffic elements in the circulation system; and (4) economy of both construction and the use of land.  Design of streets should minimize maintenance costs. 
Revised 10/1/2018 	17-315 Land Use Code 
Each of the following principles is an elaboration on one or more of these four (4) factors. The principles are not intended as absolute criteria, since instances may appear where certain principles conflict.  The principles should, therefore, be used as guides to proper systems layout. 
A. 	Ensure Vehicular and Pedestrian Access and Provide Utility Access. The primary function of local streets is to serve abutting properties. Street widths, placement of sidewalks, patterns of streets and the number of intersections are related to safe and efficient access to abutting lands. 
B. 	Control Access to Collectors and Arterials. Local circulation systems and land development patterns should not detract from the efficiency of peripheral collector and arterial streets. Ideally, land development should occur so that no lots require direct access to collector or arterial routes. The number of access points between the local circulation system and the arterial system should be minimized. Intersections along collector and arterial routes should be properly spaced for efficient signalization and traffic flow.  
C. 	Discourage Speeding. Residential streets should be designed to discourage fast movement of vehicular traffic and incorporate traffic calming measures where appropriate.  
D. 	Interconnectivity. All developments should be planned to provide both vehicle and pedestrian/bicycle connectivity to adjacent undeveloped properties and to the existing circulation system. Wherever possible, street stubs to adjacent parcels, and connections for pedestrian/bicycle paths shall be incorporated into the design of the development. 
(Ord. 2009-02) 
17.43.040 MINIMUM REQUIREMENTS FOR LOCAL CIRCULATION SYSTEMS. In addition to the planning principles outlined in Section 17.43.030, the minimum requirements of this Section shall apply to the design of new streets. Additional specific requirements can also be found in the Mesa County Standard Specification for Road and Bridge Construction. Where conflicts exist between this Section and provisions of the Mesa County Standard Specification for Road and Bridge Construction, the provisions of this Section shall apply. 
A. 	Development Access. Any development exceeding two hundred fifty (250) average daily trips (ADT) or twenty-five (25) units shall have a minimum of two (2) fully platted ingress/egress points (dedicated rights-of-way), or one (1) fully platted ingress/egress point plus a secondary access point for emergency vehicles. Any development exceeding three hundred fifty (350) ADT or thirty-five (35) units shall have a minimum of two (2) fully platted ingress/egress points. Any development exceeding seven hundred fifty 
(750) 
ADT or seventy-five (75) units shall have a minimum of three (3) fully platted ingress/egress points. 

B. 	
Phased Developments. For phased developments, secondary access shall be installed at 


Revised 10/1/2018 	17-316 Land Use Code 
or prior to the time at which the total number of units served by a single access exceeds twenty-five (25) units. 
C. 	Courts and Cul-de-sacs. A cul-de-sac shall not exceed two hundred fifty (250) ADT and in no case should its length exceed six hundred (600) feet, unless a secondary emergency access is provided, in which case the cul-de-sac length may be increased to one thousand (1000) feet. Dead end streets or cul-de-sacs without bulbs shall not be permitted. Streets provided or designed for future connection to adjacent areas shall be improved. Such connections which provide access to structures shall have dedicated cul-de-sacs. A cul-de-sac bulb which may be vacated in the future shall be improved to paved standards if access is provided to dwellings or other structures. Cul-de-sac bulbs not providing access to dwellings or other structures shall be improved with a gravel surface and barricades may be required. 
D. 	Street Stubs. Proposed street stubs to adjacent undeveloped property may be considered in meeting the requirements of subsections (B) and (C) of this Section. The City Council shall have sole discretion to make this determination based on a consideration of current information pertaining to the potential and timing of the development of adjacent parcels. 
E. 	Urban and Rural Street Sections Based on Lot Size. Urban street sections, which include concrete curb and gutter, and either detached or attached sidewalks on both sides, are required in all residential and commercial developments serviced by public streets, wherein the minimum lot size in the development is less than two (2) acres. For residential developments wherein the minimum lot size in the development is equal to or greater than one-half (½) acre, the sidewalk on one (1) side of the street may be deleted at the discretion of the City Council. Rural street sections without curb and gutter, or sidewalks, are allowed only in developments having a minimum lot size of two (2) acres or greater. 
(Ord. 2009-02) 
17.43.050 ACCESS TO PRIVATE PROPERTY. In order to qualify as access to property within the city, a street shall be one (1) of the following: 
A. 	Public Maintained Street. A public street maintained by the city, the Colorado Department of Transportation (C.D.O.T.) or other public agencies. All new driveways or other access points to a public street shall be designed in accordance with the Fruita Design Criteria and Construction Specifications. 
B. 	Private Street Not Maintained by a Public Agency. Such a street shall be constructed according to the provisions of this Chapter and shall be owned by a homeowners association or other private entity that will take responsibility for maintenance. A maintenance waiver shall be signed by all lot owners accessing the street acknowledging that the city does not maintain the street, and will be recorded by the city in the records of 
Revised 10/1/2018 	17-317 Land Use Code 
the Mesa County Clerk and Recorder.  The right-of-way widths and level of improvement of such street shall be the same as that of a public street. 
C. 	Shared Drives. The level of improvements required for shared driveways shall be designed according to the following guidelines. 
1. 	Widths of Shared Drives: 
a. 	
Less than twenty (20) feet: A maximum density of two (2) units will be allowed on the shared driveway. Minimum improved travel surface roadway width shall be considered on an individual basis. 

b. 	
Twenty (20) feet to twenty-six (26) feet: A maximum density of four (4) units will be allowed on the shared driveway. Minimum improved travel surface roadway width of eighteen (18) feet.  


2. Access Requirements.  The access requirements for shared driveways are: 
a. 	
Garages and other parking facilities accessing shared driveways shall be located on the lot in such a manner that movement into or out of the garage or parking area will not encroach on adjacent private property or parking areas. 

b. 	
No parking is allowed on shared driveways. For all lots accessing from a shared driveway, one additional off-street car parking space must be provided. 


(Ord. 2009-02) 
17.43.060 GENERAL ACCESS STANDARDS. 
A. 	Purpose. The lack of adequate access management to the city's street system and the proliferation of driveways and other access approaches can become a major contributor to traffic accidents and a major factor contributing to the functional deterioration of city streets. As new access approaches are constructed, the traffic speed and capacity of streets decrease, while congestion and hazards to the traveling public increase. As a result, significant amounts of tax dollars can be spent to improve city streets and provide additional operational capacity and safety. 
The objective of these standards is to both maintain safety and preserve street capacity while at the same time allowing accessibility to adjacent land uses, in a manner consistent with the functional classifications of roads. 
B. 	Standards. 
Revised 10/1/2018 	17-318 Land Use Code 
1. 	
In all areas where curb and gutter are provided, all driveways accessing single family building lots shall conform to the standard construction details published by the city. In areas where curb and gutter are not provided, all driveways shall have a minimum surface width of eighteen (18) feet at the edge of pavement, or drive surface, and taper to a minimum surface width of twelve (12) feet at a distance of six (6) feet from the edge of the drive, and maintain this surface width to the edge of the city street or right-of-way.   

2. 	
A paved surface with a minimum of twelve (12) feet in width shall be available to fire, ambulance and police vehicles to within one hundred (100) feet of the principal entrances to all principal buildings. 

3. 	
In the Rural Estate (RE) and Agricultural Residential (AR) zones for lots three (3) acres in size or larger, access surfacing material outside of the public right-of-way may be six (6) inches Class 6 aggregate base course, or other material such as recycled asphalt, so long as the surfacing material is treated to maintain a dust free condition. 

4. 	
The maximum total width of access(s) serving any one (1) parcel shall be limited to thirty-two (32) feet. 

5. 	
Access grades may not exceed ten (10) percent. The grade of the entrance and exit shall slope downward and away from the street surface at the same rate as the normal cross slope and for a distance equal to the width of the shoulder, but in no case less than ten (10) feet from the pavement edge. 

6. 	
All driveways and approaches shall be constructed so that they do not interfere with the drainage system of the public street or highway. The applicant will be required to provide, at its own expense, drainage structures at entrances and exits which will become an integral part of the existing drainage system. The dimensions of all drainage structures shall be approved by the city prior to installation. 

7. 	
No more than one (1) access shall be allowed to any parcel or lot having an area of one (1) acre or less. Additional accesses to parcels or lots having an area of greater than one (1) acre shall be subject to all of the provisions of Chapter 17.07 and this Chapter 17.43. 

8. 	
An access approach that has a gate across it shall be designed so that the longest vehicle using it can completely clear the traveled way of the public street when the gate is closed. 

9. 	
A parcel or lot fronting on two (2) public streets with identical functional classifications shall take access from the street with the lowest twenty (20) year projected traffic volume. Residential lots fronting on two local roads do not 


Revised 10/1/2018 	17-319 Land Use Code 
necessarily have to take access from the street with the lowest twenty (20) year projected traffic volume. 
(Ord. 2009-02) 
17.43.070 ACCESS CONTROL STANDARDS FOR ARTERIAL STREETS. 
A. 	Private Direct Access. Private direct access to arterials is discouraged. Private direct access to such arterial streets shall be permitted only when the property in question has no other reasonable access to the city's street system. When direct access is necessary, the following shall be required: 
1. 	
Access shall continue until such time that some other reasonable access to a lower functional category street is available and permitted. Access permits issued by the city or by the Colorado Department of Transportation shall specify the future reasonable access location and, if known, the date the change will be made. This provision shall not be construed as guaranteeing a public street access. Subdivisions of land shall make provisions for all parcels or lots in the area to have access to a lower functional classification street in the future. Back-out driveways shall not be allowed. 

2. 	
No more than one (1) access approach shall be provided to an individual parcel or to contiguous parcels or lots under the same ownership unless it can be shown that additional accesses would be significantly beneficial to the safety and operation of the street or the local circulation system. Subdivision of a parcel or lot shall not result in additional access unless shown as necessary for safety or operational reasons. 

3. 	
On two-lane arterials, access approaches may be limited to right turns only if the approach is within five hundred (500) feet, measured near curb line to near curb line, from the nearest signalized intersection. Under no circumstances may a driveway be closer than one hundred (100) feet to the curb line of the intersecting street when measured from the driveway edge nearest the intersecting street. 

4. 	
Access approaches on multi-lane divided roads shall be limited to right turns only unless either: (1) the approach does not have the potential for signalization; or (2) it can be shown that allowing left turns would significantly reduce congestion and safety problems at a nearby intersection; or (3) there are no intersections, existing or planned, which allow a U-turn, and left turns can be safely designed without signalization; or (4) a painted median is present which allows continuous turning storage. 


B. 	Spacing and Signalization Shall be Considered. In areas where higher traffic volumes are present or growth is expected in the foreseeable future that will require signalization, it is imperative that the location of all public approaches be planned carefully to ensure good 
Revised 10/1/2018 	17-320 Land Use Code 
signal progression. An approved traffic engineering analysis shall be made to properly locate all proposed connecting access approaches that may require signalization. 
(Ord. 2009-02) 
17.43.080 ACCESS CONTROL STANDARDS FOR MAJOR COLLECTOR AND 
MINOR COLLECTOR STREETS. 
A. 	Private Direct Access. No more than one (1) access approach shall be provided to an individual parcel/lot or to contiguous parcels/lots under the same ownership unless it can be shown that additional access approaches would not be detrimental to the safety and operation of the public street, and are necessary for the safety and efficient use of the property. Back-out driveways shall not be allowed on Major Collector streets. Under no circumstances may a driveway be closer than one hundred (100) feet to the flow line or edge of the traveled way of the intersecting street when measured from the driveway edge nearest the intersecting street. Subdivision of a parcel shall not result in additional access unless shown as necessary for safety or operational reasons. Shared driveways are encouraged on all collector or larger roads to minimize access points. 
B. 	Spacing of Intersecting Streets. Spacing of major intersecting streets should be at one-quarter (1/4) mile intervals plus or minus two hundred (200) feet.  Spacing of other streets where intersection channelization improvements are not required in accordance with the Fruita Design Criteria and Construction Standards shall be at intervals no less than three hundred (300) feet, providing that reasonable access cannot be obtained from lower classification streets. 
C. 	Separation of Driveways. Individual driveways shall have a minimum edge to edge separation distance of one hundred (100) feet. Where the lot dimensions or the location of existing driveways prevent one hundred (100) feet separation, the minimum separation distance shall be the maximum achievable, as determined by the City Engineer on a case-by-case basis. 
(Ord. 2009-02) 
17.43.090 ACCESS CONTROL STANDARDS FOR LOCAL STREETS. 
A. 	Private Direct Access. Accesses located near an intersection of two (2) local streets shall be constructed so that the edge of the access nearest the intersection is no less than fifty 
(50) 
feet from the flowline of the intersecting street.  Where the intersecting street is classified as a collector or arterial, setbacks for accesses shall be no less than eighty (80) feet from the flowline of the intersecting street.  All accesses are subject to the sight distance requirements of subsection 17.43.090. 

B. 	
Spacing of Intersecting Streets. Intersecting public and private streets shall be located opposing where possible or be offset by a minimum of one hundred fifty (150) feet when 


Revised 10/1/2018 	17-321 Land Use Code 
measured from near curb line to near curb line 
C. 	Separation of Driveways. Individual driveways shall have a minimum edge to edge separation distance of ten (10) feet. Driveways cannot be located closer than five (5) feet to any side property line. 
(Ord. 2009-02) 
17.43.100 INTERSECTION REQUIREMENTS. 
A. 	General. Most streets intersect at grade. To minimize potential conflicts and to provide adequately for the anticipated crossing and turning vehicle movements, geometric design of the intersection at grade shall be given careful consideration. The geometric design components of all intersections, including but not limited to the location, approach radii, and sight distance, shall be designed in accordance with the Design Criteria and Construction Standards.

PART V.  DEFINITIONS 
PART I.  DESCRIPTION AND PURPOSES 
17.45.010 STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION. The Legislature of the State of Colorado has, in Section 31-23-301 C.R.S., authorized municipalities to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry by regulating, restricting and limiting land uses in order to lessen or avoid the hazards to persons and damage to property resulting from the accumulation of storm or flood waters. (Ord. 2009-02) 
17.45.020 FINDINGS OF FACT. 
A. 	The flood hazard areas of Fruita are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
B. 	These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are inadequately flood proofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss. 
(Ord. 2009-02) 
17.45.030 PURPOSES. The purposes of this Chapter are to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed: 
A. 	To protect human life and health; 
B. 	To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
C. 	To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
D. 	To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
E. 	To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and wastewater lines, streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
F. 	To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas; 
G. 	To ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood 
hazard; and 
H. 	To ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. 
(Ord. 2009-02) 
17.45.040 METHODS OF REDUCING FLOOD LOSSES. In order to accomplish its purposes, this Chapter includes methods and provisions for: 
A. 	Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; 
B. 	Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
C. 	Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters; 
D. 	Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; 
E. 	Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas; and 
F. 	Preventing or restricting development or construction where ingress and egress to a parcel of land is potentially affected by flood waters, or are within areas of special flood hazard as defined in this Chapter. 
(Ord. 2009-02) 
PART II.  GENERAL PROVISIONS 
17.45.050 LANDS TO WHICH CHAPTER PROVISIONS APPLY. This Chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazards within the jurisdiction of the City of Fruita. (Ord. 2009-02) 
17.45.060 BASIS FOR ESTABLISHING AREAS OF SPECIAL FLOOD HAZARD. The areas of special flood hazard are identified by the Federal Emergency Management Agency in a scientific and engineering report entitled "The Flood Insurance Study of Mesa County, Colorado and Incorporated Areas," dated July 6, 2010, with an accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) which is adopted by reference and declared to be part of this Chapter. The Flood Insurance Study and FIRM are on file at City of Fruita, 325 East Aspen, #155, Fruita, Colorado. (Ord. 2009-02; Ord. 2010-11, S1) 
17.45.070 COMPLIANCE REQUIRED. No structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the terms of this Chapter and the other applicable regulations. Violation of the provisions of this Chapter by failure to comply with any of its regulations (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall commit a Class B municipal offense in accordance with Section 17.01.100. (Ord. 2009-02; Ord. 2010-11, S2) 
17.45.080 ABROGATION AND GREATER RESTRICTIONS. This Chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this Chapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.  (Ord. 2009-02) 
17.45.090 INTERPRETATION. In the interpretation and application of this Chapter, all provisions shall be: 
A. Considered as minimum requirements; 
B. Liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and 
C. Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under State statutes. 
(Ord. 2009-02) 
17.45.100 LIMITATIONS OF LIABILITY. The degree of flood protection required by this Chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by manmade or natural causes. This Chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This Chapter shall not create liability on the part of the City of Fruita, any officer or employee thereof, or the Federal Emergency Management Agency for any flood damages that result from reliance on this Chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. (Ord. 2009-02) 
PART III.  ADMINISTRATION 
17.45.110 ESTABLISHMENT OF A FLOODPLAIN DEVELOPMENT PERMIT. A floodplain development permit shall be obtained before construction or development begins, including any grading or other earthwork, within any area of special flood hazard established in Section 17.45.060. Application for a development permit shall be made on forms furnished by the floodplain administrator, and may include, but not be limited to: 
A. 	Plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities; and the location of the foregoing. All elevations shall be given in 1988 North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) consistent with Mesa County Survey Monument (MCSM) standards, and a correction factor shall be provided/calculated to equate reference elevations listed on the FIRM maps to current  NAVD88 elevations.  Specifically, the following information is required: 
1. 	
Elevation in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest floor (including basement) of all structures; 

2. 	
Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any structure has been flood proofed; 

3. 	
Certification by a registered professional engineer or architect that the flood proofing methods for any nonresidential structure meet the flood proofing criteria in Section 17.45.230; and 

4. 	
Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development. 


(Ord. 2009-02) 
17.45.120 DESIGNATION OF CITY ENGINEER AS FLOODPLAIN 
ADMINISTRATOR. The City Engineer is hereby appointed floodplain administrator to administer and implement this Chapter by granting or denying floodplain development permit applications in accordance with its provisions. (Ord. 2009-02)

(Ord. 2009-02) 
17.45.150 CONDITIONS FOR VARIANCES. 
A. 	Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one half (1/2) acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base level, providing items one (1) thru eleven (11) in Section 17.45.140 (D) have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one half (1/2) acre, the technical justifications required for issuing the variance increases. 
B. 	Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this Section. 
C. 	Variances shall not be issued within any designated flood way if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
D. 	Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. 
E. 	Variances shall only be issued upon: 
1. 	
A showing of good and sufficient cause; 

2. 	
A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and, 

3. 	
A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create 


nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public as identified in Section 
17.45.140 (D), or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
F. 	Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk from the reduced lowest floor elevation.

17.47.010 PURPOSE. The purpose of this Chapter is to provide the procedures necessary to implement the provisions of Article 68 of Title 24, Colorado Revised Statutes, which Article establishes a vested property right to undertake and complete development and use of real property under the terms and conditions of a site specific development plan. (Ord. 2009-02) 
17.47.020 DEFINITIONS. The following definitions are for the purposes of administration of this Chapter only and do not apply to other sections of this Code. Unless modified in this Section, the terms used in this Chapter shall have the same meaning as set forth in Section 24-68-102, C.R.S.  
A. 	A "site specific development plan" means a plan that has been submitted to the city by a landowner or such landowner's representative describing with reasonable certainty the type and intensity of use for a specific parcel or parcels of property, which plan shall create a vested property right if the landowner wishes said approval to have the effect of creating vested rights pursuant to Sections 24-68-101, et. seq., C.R.S. The landowner must request vested rights approval in writing at the time a land development application 
is submitted. Failure to request vested rights renders the approval not a “site specific development plan” and no vested rights shall be deemed to have been created. The following shall be considered "site specific development plans" if a landowner wishes to 
have a “site specific development plan” approved: 
Revised 12/31/12 17-340 Land Use Code 
DEVELOPMENT REVIEW PROCEDURE  SITE SPECIFIC DEVELOPMENT PLAN  
1. Site Design Review pursuant to Section 17.13.020  Site Design Review as approved by City Council  
2. Conditional Use Permit pursuant to Section 17.13.040  Conditional Use Permit as approved by City Council  
3. Minor Subdivisions pursuant to Chapter 17.15.  Subdivision final plat as approved by the City Council  
4. Major Subdivisions pursuant to Chapter 17.15  Subdivision final plat as approved by the City Council AND the applicable subdivision improvements agreement as approved by the City Council  
5. Planned Unit Development (PUD), not accompanied by subdivision of land pursuant to Chapter 17.17  Final PUD Plan, any applicable PUD Guide AND the applicable development improvements agreement as approved by City Council  
6. Planned Unit Development (PUD) pursuant to Chapter 17.17, accompanied by subdivision of land pursuant to Chapter 17.15   Subdivision final plat together with Final PUD Plan, PUD Guide AND any applicable subdivision improvements agreement as approved by City Council  

If not indicated above, a "site specific development plan" shall mean the final approval step, irrespective of the name or designation of such approval, which occurs prior to a Planning Clearance application. 
Provided however, the City Council may, by agreement with the applicant, designate an approval step other than those indicated above, or the final approval step, to serve as the "site specific development plan" approval for a specific project.  
The following are specifically excluded from, and shall not constitute, a "site specific development plan": variances, subdivision Sketch Plans, subdivision Preliminary Plans, PUD Concept Plans, PUD Preliminary Plans, business licenses, floodway or floodplain permits, franchises, temporary use permits, any Master Plan element, creation of improvement districts, zoning, rezoning other than Planned Unit Developments, final 
Revised 12/31/12 17-341 	Land Use Code 
architectural plans, or final construction drawings and related documents specifying materials and methods for construction of improvements. 
B. 	"Vested property right" means the right to undertake and complete development and use of property under the terms and conditions of a "site specific development plan." 
(Ord. 2009-02; Ord. 2012-07, S4) 
17.47.030 APPLICATIONS; APPROVAL BY THE CITY. 
A. 	Except as otherwise provided in this Section, an application for approval of a "site specific development plan" as well as the approval, conditional approval, or denial of approval of a plan shall be governed only by the duly adopted laws and regulations in effect at the time the application is submitted to the city. For purposes of this Section, "laws and regulations" includes any zoning, development, or land use law of general applicability adopted by the city as well as any zoning, development or land use regulations that have previously been adopted for the particular parcel described in the plan and that remain in effect at the time of application for approval of the plan. In the event the application for a "site specific development plan" requires review and approval in multiple stages, "application" means the original application submitted at the first stage in any multi-stage process that may culminate in the ultimate approval of a "site specific development plan." 
B. 	Notwithstanding the limitations contained in subsection (A) above, the city may adopt a new or amended law or regulation when necessary for the immediate preservation of public health and safety and may enforce such law or regulation in relation to applications for "site specific development plans" pending at the time such law or regulation is adopted. 
(Ord. 2009-02) 
17.47.040 ALTERNATIVE CREATION OF VESTED PROPERTY RIGHTS. If any applicant desires an approval step, other than as defined in subsection 17.47.020(A) above, to constitute an approval of a "site specific development plan" with the effect of creating vested property rights pursuant to this Chapter and Article 68 of Title 24, C.R.S., the applicant must so request at least thirty (30) days prior to the date of the public hearing on said approval step by the City Council or Community Development Director, as applicable, is to be considered. Failure to do so renders the approval by the City Council or Community Development Director, as the case may be, to not constitute an approval of a "site specific development plan" and no vested property right shall be deemed to have been created by such approval, except in the case of an approval as set forth in subsection 17.47.020(A) above. (Ord. 2009-02; Ord. 2012-07, S4) 
17.47.050 ESTABLISHMENT OF VESTED PROPERTY RIGHTS; PUBLIC NOTICE AND HEARING REQUIRED. A vested property right shall be deemed established with 
Revised 12/31/12 17-342 	Land Use Code 
respect to any property upon the approval, or conditional approval, of a "site specific development plan," following notice and public hearing, by the City Council. A vested property right shall attach to and run with the applicable property and shall confer upon the landowner the right to undertake and complete the development and use of said property under the terms and conditions of the "site specific development plan", as approved, including any amendments thereto. A "site specific development plan" shall be deemed approved upon the effective date of the city's legal action, resolution or ordinance relating thereto. Such approval shall be subject to all rights of referendum and judicial review; except that the period of time permitted by law for the exercise of such rights shall not begin to run until the date of publication, in a newspaper of general circulation within the city, of a notice advising the general public of the "site specific development plan" approval and creation of a vested property right pursuant to this Chapter and Article 68 of Title 24, C.R.S. Such publication shall occur no later than fourteen (14) days following approval. (Ord. 2009-02; Ord. 2012-07, S4) 
17.47.60 APPROVAL OF SITE SPECIFIC DEVELOPMENT PLAN; CONDITIONS.

Such development agreements shall be adopted as legislative acts subject to referendum. 
C. 	Following approval or conditional approval of a "site specific development plan", nothing contained in this Chapter or Article 68 of Title 24, C.R.S. shall exempt such a plan from subsequent reviews and approvals by the city to insure compliance with the terms and conditions of the original approval, if such further reviews and approvals are not inconsistent with said original approval.

17.47.090 SUBSEQUENT REGULATION PROHIBITED; EXCEPTIONS. 
A. 	A vested property right, once established as provided in this Chapter and Article 68 of Title 24, C.R.S., precludes any zoning or other land use action by the city or pursuant to an initiated measure which would alter, impair, prevent, diminish, impose a moratorium on development, or otherwise delay the development or use of the property as set forth in 
an approved “site specific development plan,” except: 
1. 	
With the consent of the affected landowner; 

2. 	
Upon the discovery of natural or manmade hazards on or in the immediate vicinity of the subject property, which hazards could not reasonably have been discovered at the time of "site specific development plan" approval, and which hazards, if uncorrected, would pose a serious threat to the public health, safety, and welfare; or 

3. 	
To the extent that the affected landowner receives just compensation for all costs, expenses and liabilities incurred by the landowner after approval by the city, including, but not limited to, costs incurred in preparing the site for development consistent with the "site specific development plan", all fees paid in consideration of financing, and all architectural, planning, marketing, legal, and other consultants' fees, together with interest thereon at the legal rate until paid. Just compensation shall not include any diminution in the value of the property, which is caused by such action. 


B. 	Establishment of a vested property right pursuant to law shall not preclude the application of ordinances or regulations which are general in nature and are applicable to all property subject to land use regulation by the City of Fruita, including, but not limited to, building, fire, plumbing, electrical, housing, mechanical, and dangerous building codes. 
(Ord. 2009-02) 
17.47.100 PAYMENT OF COSTS. In addition to any and all other fees and charges imposed by this Title, the applicant for approval of a "site specific development plan" shall pay all costs incurred by the city as a result of the "site specific development plan" review and approval, including publication of notices, public hearing and review costs, when such costs are incurred apart and in addition to costs otherwise incurred by the city or applicant for a public hearing relative to the subject property. (Ord. 2009-02) 
17.47.110 OTHER PROVISIONS UNAFFECTED. Approval of a "site specific development plan" shall not constitute an exemption from or waiver of any other provisions of this Title pertaining to the development and use of property. (Ord. 2009-02) 
Revised 12/31/12 17-345 Land Use Code 
17.47.120 LIMITATIONS. Nothing in this Chapter is intended to create any vested property right, but only to implement Article 68 of Title 24, C.R.S., as amended. In the event of the repeal of said Article or judicial determination that said Article is invalid or unconstitutional, this Chapter shall be deemed to be repealed and the provisions hereof no longer effective.
