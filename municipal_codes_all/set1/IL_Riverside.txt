ORDINANCE NO. __3004______
AN ORDINANCE AMENDING THE VILLAGE CODE OF THE VILLAGE OF RIVERSIDE AND THE VILLAGE OF RIVERSIDE ZONING ORDINANCE
RELATIVE TO VACATION RENTALS
WHEREAS, in 2016, the President and Board of Trustees approved the licensing and operation of short-term residential rentals (a/k/a “vacation rentals”)
establishments within the Village, adopted vacation rental regulations and amended the zoning ordinance to permit vacation rentals as permitted uses within the Village;
and
WHEREAS, in 2018, the President and Board of Trustees, over the course of several meetings, discussed possible revisions to the regulations
governing the licensing and operation of vacation rental establishments; and
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=610 8/519
WHEREAS, the President and Board of Trustees recently approved amendments to the Village Code relative to the licensing and operation of vacation rentals,
including amendments that prohibited such uses in residential zoning districts within the Village; and
WHEREAS, the President and Board of Trustees forwarded to the Planning and Zoning Commission (“PZC”) of the Village a request to amend the
Village of Riverside Zoning Ordinance to prohibit vacation rentals in residential zoning districts consistent with the action taken by the Board of Trustees,
and further requested that the PZC consider whether vacation rentals in business districts should be changed from permitted uses to special uses. It was
noted that if vacation rentals were ultimately made special uses in business zoning districts, that the business licensing provisions requiring notification to
nearby property owners and review of each individual license by the Board of Trustees could be deleted as duplicative; and
WHEREAS, on October 24, 2018, the PZC held a public hearing on proposed text amendments prohibiting vacation rentals in residential zoning districts, and
making vacation rentals a special use in business districts; and
WHEREAS, following the October 24, 2018, public hearing the PZC voted 7-0 to recommend eliminating vacation rentals as a permitted use in
residential zoning districts, and voted 4-3 to recommend that vacation rentals be changed from a permitted use to a special use in business zoning
districts. The PZC has filed its Findings and Recommendation regarding the proposed text amendments with the President and Board of Trustees, and the
President and Board of Trustees have duly considered said Findings and Recommendation; and
WHEREAS, the Village of Riverside (the “Village”) is an Illinois non-home rule municipality, having all of the powers and authority granted to such
municipalities pursuant to law, including the powers set forth in Division 13 of the Illinois Municipal Code (65 ILCS 5/11-13-1 et seq.) relative to zoning within the
Village; and
WHEREAS,pursuant to the authority granted under Division 13 of the Illinois Municipal Code (65 ILCS 5/11-13-1 et seq.), the President and Board
of Trustees of the Village of Riverside approve the proposed text amendments to the Village’s Zoning Ordinance as set forth below and recommended by
the PZC, and find and determine that the adoption of the proposed text amendments are in the best interests of the health, welfare, and safety of the
residents, property owners and the businesses of the Village. The President and Board of Trustees further amend the Village Code to eliminate the
previously approved neighbor notification and board consideration and approval of each vacation rental business license in business zoning districts, as
those procedures are made unnecessary by the adoption of the special use process.
NOW, THEREFORE, BE IT ORDAINED by the President and Board of Trustees of the Village of Riverside, Cook County, Illinois, as follows:
SECTION 1: Each whereas paragraph set forth above is incorporated by reference into this Section 1.
SECTION 2: Section 10-4-5 (Use and Bulk Requirement Tables) of the Village of Riverside Zoning Ordinance is amended by deleting vacation rentals from

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=610 42/519
1. Said citations shall be in a form suitable for mailing, shall state the specific section of this code that was violated, and shall inform the alleged violator
that he may avoid appearance in court for such violation by payment of the amount specified below in full settlement of his liability for such violation.

the same in the circuit court of Cook County.

(C) Administrative Violation Notice: Whenever permitted by law, the proper police officer or other designated officer may employ the administrative violation

(30) additional days from receipt of the warning to correct the violation(s).

dollars ($250.00). The owner shall have the option of paying the fine or appearing in the circuit court to contest the citation. Payment of the fine shall
not relieve the owner of the duty to correct the violations, and corrective action satisfactory to the officer shall be completed within thirty (30) days
from the date the ticket is issued, or such other later date as the court may order in the event the owner contests the citation.
4. Failure of owner to respond as required to the initial violation ticket shall result in the issuance to owner of a second violation ticket in the fine amount
of five hundred dollars ($500.00). The owner shall have the option of paying the fine or appearing in the circuit court to contest the citation. Payment
of the fine shall not relieve the owner of the duty to correct the violations, and corrective action satisfactory to the officer shall be completed within
thirty (30) days from the date the ticket is issued, or such other later date as the court may order in the event the owner contests the citation.
5. Failure of owner to respond as required to the second violation ticket shall result in the arrest of the owner by means of legal process for the offense
of a misdemeanor pursuant to complaint as provided in section 1-2-1 of the Illinois municipal code, 65 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/1-2-1, which
provides for incarceration for a period not to exceed six (6) months.

and interest must be made by not later than ninety (90) days after the filing of the voluntary disclosure application or the date agreed to by the local tax
administrator. However, any additional amounts owed as a result of an underpayment of tax and interest previously paid under this section must be paid

competitive bidding; provided, that it shall not be less advantageous to the Authority than any valid bid received pursuant to advertisement.
The contract shall be awarded to the successful bidder as promptly as possible after the opening of bids. In determining the responsibility of any bidder,
the Board may take into account past dealings with the bidder, the bidder's experience, adequacy of equipment, and ability to complete performance within
the time set, and other factors besides financial responsibility; but in no case shall any contract be awarded to other than the highest bidder (in the case of
a sale, concession or lease) or to the lowest bidder (in the case of a purchase or expenditure) unless so authorized or approved by a vote of at least five
(5) members of the Board, and unless such action is accompanied by a statement in writing setting forth the reasons for not awarding the contract to the
highest or lowest bidder, as the case may be, which statement shall be kept on file and open to public inspection in the administrative offices of the Village
in the Village Hall, Riverside, Illinois.

6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=610 99/519
The following definitions shall apply in the interpretation and enforcement of this chapter:
FOOD DEALER: Any business operating in Riverside regulated by title 7 of this code that is subject to a health inspection, including food related
businesses, or such other fee as is currently charged to the village and published by the village.
LICENSE: A privilege granted by the village, after the fulfillment of all conditions precedent that are expressly provided herein, to engage in a business or a
commercial enterprise or activity. Whenever the term "business" is used it shall include any commercial enterprise or establishment or any activity licensed
or permitted under this title. Every license granted by the village pursuant to this title, and every renewal thereof, shall be purely a privilege, shall not
constitute property, and shall not otherwise be construed in any manner to create any other right to or interest in such license.
OWNER: Any individual, firm, association, partnership, corporation, trust, or any other legal entity having sufficient proprietary interest in any establishment
to maintain and manage its operation.
PERMIT: A privilege granted by the village, after the fulfillment of all conditions precedent that are expressly provided herein, to conduct a specific activity,
usually of commercial nature and for a shorter time period than allowed under a license, or for a temporary period.
PERSON: Any individual, firm, association, partnership, corporation, trust or any other legal entity. (Ord. 2506, 8-16-2004)
3-1-2: REQUIRED:
(A) It shall be unlawful for any person in this village to engage in any trade or business, or engage in any activity, or do anything, for any period of time at
any time, for which a license or permit is required by this code, without procuring the required license or permit. Persons operating under an existing
license or permit shall be considered to be in violation of this section upon a failure to submit a required fee, application or other materials required by
the village for renewal within thirty (30) days after expiration of the existing license or permit.
(B) A license shall be required for each separate business or commercial activity for which a license is required if more than one such activity is conducted
within any one establishment or on any one premises. The test to determine whether one or more than one business, activity or occupation is being
conducted within the village shall depend on the formalities of ownership of the business, activity, or occupation. When a licensable activity is operated
at more than one location, a separate license shall be required for each location, irrespective of ownership considerations. If all buildings containing the
principal or accessory uses are connected or are located on the same lot or parcel, and are operated and managed by the same person or owner, and
are an establishment with the same zoning code use classification, then the business, activity, or occupation shall require only one license. (Ord. 2895,
1-21-2016)
3-1-3: PROCEDURE FOR OBTAINING AND RENEWING; DEBTS TO VILLAGE:
(A) The procedure for obtaining a license or permit for any purpose, including form of application and qualifications of applicant, and the effective date and
conditions of issuance, shall be as prescribed by the particular ordinance or code provision requiring such license or permit, except that, unless
otherwise specified in such ordinance or code provision, the fee for such license or permit and the date of expiration thereof, if any, shall be as set forth
in section 3-1-6 of this chapter. Renewals of licenses and permits shall be subject to the same requirements and standards as are applicable to initial
licenses and permits, and according to administrative procedures established by the village.
(B) No person who is in default to the village regarding payment of water and sewer charges, special taxes or assessments, parking and other village
violation citations or judgments, motor vehicle tax, or any other taxes or fees that are due and unpaid by such person to the village shall be eligible to
obtain a license or permit. (Ord. 2506, 8-16-2004)
3-1-4: ASSIGNMENT AND TRANSFER:
(A) A license or permit shall be purely a personal privilege, good for not to exceed the designated expiration, unless sooner revoked as in this chapter
provided, and shall not constitute property, nor shall it be subject to attachment, garnishment or execution, nor shall it be alienable or transferable,
voluntarily or involuntarily, or subject to being otherwise encumbered.
(B) Such license or permit shall cease upon the death, insolvency or bankruptcy of the licensee or permittee ("event") and shall not descend by the laws of
testate or intestate devolution, provided that executors or administrators of the estate of any deceased licensee or permittee, the trustee of any
insolvent or bankrupt licensee or permittee, or any other legal successor to the licensed or permitted business, may request the village for an extension
of the license or permit for its remaining term. Such request shall be in writing and directed to the village manager, and shall include information as to
the specific event and any related court pleadings and orders, and the qualifications of the proposed successor to operate the licensed business or
activity.
(C) The village manager shall have the authority to grant or deny the extension of the license or permit for its remaining term to the proposed successor
upon reasonable terms and conditions, based upon applicable village code licensing standards, and an assessment of the experience, moral character
and reputation of the proposed successor. The village manager shall advise the proposed successor within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice of the
denial or grant of extension, and of any conditions attached to the grant of extension.
(D) During the period from the event to the receipt of the village manager's notice of the grant or denial of extension, in order to protect the viability of the
business entity, the licensed or permitted business or activity may continue in operation for such temporary period. Upon receipt of a denial of
extension, the license or permit shall be considered as terminated, and the person(s) having responsibility for the business or commercial operations or
otherwise operating the business shall immediately cease operations and close the business.
(E) Any denial of extension shall be deemed final and not subject to appeal to the village, provided, however, that any person having an ownership interest
in the business or commercial activity may submit an original application for a business license or permit in his or her own name. (Ord. 2506, 8-16-

similar business, activity or occupation by any federal, state, municipality or licensing authority; or

11. Refused to permit any authorized inspector to take adequate samples or to make inspections, or has interfered with any village employee, agent or
official in the performance of his or her duties, including those duties and inspections conducted pursuant to section 3-1-10 of this chapter. In order to
suspend or revoke a license or permit for cause pursuant to this section based on a refusal to permit the taking of samples or to make inspections,
there must have been a written demand by the village on the licensee, or on the person in charge of the licensed premises, stating that the
inspection or sample is desired; or
12. Been convicted of any felony as defined in section 2-7 of the Illinois criminal code of 20121, or a misdemeanor involving moral turpitude.
(B) A suspension, revocation, nonrenewal or denial of a license or permit shall not preclude prosecution and imposition of any other penalties provided for
the violation of applicable ordinances of the village, including the issuance of ordinance violations and/or the imposition of monetary penalties as
specified elsewhere in this code.
(C) When the conduct or operation of any business, activity or occupation, whether or not licensed or permitted, shall pose a clear and present danger to
the public health, safety or general welfare, the village manager, or his or her designee, shall have the authority to summarily order the cessation of
business and the closing of the premises, and the suspension of any valid license or permit for a period not to exceed ten (10) calendar days. Within
five (5) calendar days after he or she has so acted, the village manager or his or her designee shall call a hearing for the purpose of determining
whether or not the license or permit should be further suspended or revoked.
(D) Except where otherwise specifically provided for, licenses or permits issued under the ordinances of the village relative to the operation of a business
may be suspended or revoked after notice and hearing before the village manager or his or her designee in accordance with the following procedures:
1. Notice of the hearing for the suspension or revocation shall be given in writing, setting forth specifically the grounds of the contemplated action and
the date, time and place of the hearing. Such notice shall be personally served or sent certified mail or overnight delivery to the licensee at the

(E) Initial applications for a license, or for renewal of a license, may, in addition to any other grounds stated elsewhere in this Code, be denied by the

transferable, voluntarily or involuntarily, or subject to being otherwise encumbered or liened.
(B) No Vested Right: Nothing contained in this chapter or section shall create any vested or property right in any liquor license in any person whatsoever,
nor shall it limit or restrict the right of the Village to at any time amend or repeal this chapter.
(C) Death Or Bankruptcy: A license shall cease upon the death, insolvency or bankruptcy of the licensee or, when issued to a partnership, the death of a
partner of a licensee, and shall not descend by the laws of testate or intestate devolution, provided that executors or administrators of the estate of any
deceased licensee or partner of a licensee, and the trustee of any insolvent or bankrupt licensee, when such estate consists in part of alcoholic liquor
may, upon written notice to the Local Liquor Control Commissioner, continue the business of the sale of alcoholic liquor under the order of the
appropriate court, and may exercise the privileges of the deceased or insolvent or bankrupt licensee after the death of decedent, or such insolvency, or
bankruptcy until the expiration of such license, but not longer than six (6) months after the death, bankruptcy or insolvency of such licensee or partner
of a licensee. If a corporation to whom a license has been issued is ordered into receivership or files for bankruptcy, the receiver or trustee may
continue the operation of the business under the existing license under order of the appropriate court until the expiration of such license, but not longer
than six (6) months after the date of appointment of a receiver or trustee, whichever comes first. At the time of expiration of the license or passage of
six (6) months following death, bankruptcy or appointment of a receiver or trustee as specified in this subsection, the liquor license shall automatically
terminate and the number of available licenses in that classification shall automatically and immediately be reduced by one (1).
(D) Changes In Ownership:
1. When the licensee is a partnership, limited liability company or a corporation whose stock is not publicly traded on a recognized stock exchange, the
license shall terminate whenever fifty percent (50%) or more of the ownership interest therein changes from that shown on the original license
application, except as provided for in this subsection. Prior to a transfer of fifty percent (50%) or more of the ownership, the partnership, limited
liability company or corporation, through its officers/members/partners, shall submit a complete application and the required fees for the issuance of
a new license, as provided herein, and said application is subject to approval by the Board of the Trustees and the Local Liquor Control
Commissioner, in their sole discretion, and such approval is necessary for the new ownership to sell and/or serve alcoholic beverages. In the event
that the transfer of ownership occurs prior to the approval of the application, the new corporate ownership shall be prohibited from selling and/or
serving alcoholic beverages at the applied for location until the application is approved by the Board of Trustees and the Local Liquor Control
Commissioner and all required fees for the liquor license have been paid to the Village.
2. When the licensee is a corporation whose stock is publicly traded on a recognized stock exchange, the license shall automatically terminate
whenever fifty percent (50%) or more of the membership of the Board of Directors of the corporation changes from that shown on the original license
application, or whenever one (1) person who was not shown as an owner of fifty percent (50%) or more of the ownership interest in the publicly
traded corporation at the time of the original liquor license application, becomes an owner of a fifty percent (50%) or more ownership interest in the
publicly traded corporation. In such event, the corporation, through its officers/Board of Directors, must make application for the issuance of a new
license as provided in this chapter.
3. When the licensee is a partnership, limited liability company or corporation, no change in ownership from that shown on the original application
involving the addition of a new partner or member of such partnership or limited liability company or a new shareholder who will own in the aggregate
more than five percent (5%) of the stock of such corporation shall be effective until such proposed change in ownership has first been reported in
writing to the Local Liquor Control Commissioner and the Commissioner finds that the proposed new partner(s) or shareholder(s) is/are not ineligible
under the provisions of this chapter and so advises the licensee in writing. Any change in ownership without complying with the terms hereof shall
constitute grounds for a fine and/or the suspension or revocation of the liquor license issued to such partnership or corporation.
4. When the licensee is a partnership, limited liability company or corporation whose stock is not publicly traded on a recognized stock exchange, no
change in ownership from that shown on the original application involving the withdrawal of any partner, manager or shareholder shall be made
without reporting such change in ownership in writing to the Local Liquor Control Commissioner within ten (10) days of any such change in
ownership. Any such change in ownership made without complying with the terms hereof shall constitute grounds for a fine and/or the suspension or
revocation of the liquor license issued to such partnership, limited liability company or corporation.
(E) Termination Upon Transfer: Upon the alienation, sale, transfer, assignment or donation of the business that underlies the license to any third party or
person other than the licensee or as otherwise authorized by this section, the liquor license shall automatically terminate and the number of available
licenses in that classification shall automatically and immediately be reduced by one. (Ord. 2773, 5-6-2011)
3-2-11: CHANGE OF LOCATION:
A liquor license shall permit the sale of alcoholic liquor only on the premises described in the application and license. Such location may be changed only

police shall issue a written notice by first class mail to the alarm user of his intent to recommend the revocation or suspension of the alarm user's
permit and shall forward the user's report, and his own report and recommendation to the president and board of trustees which shall take such action

effectuating the sale at retail and shall be remitted by such retailer to the village. Any tax required to be collected by this chapter and any such tax
collected by such retailer shall constitute a debt owed by the retailer to the village. Retailers shall collect the tax from the taxpayer by adding the tax to
the gross charge for the act or privilege of selling or supplying gas when sold for use, in the manner prescribed herein. Said tax shall constitute a debt
of the purchaser to the retailer who provides such taxable services until paid and, if unpaid, is recoverable at law in the same manner as the original
charge for such taxable services. If the retailer fails to collect the tax from the taxpayer, then the taxpayer shall be required to pay the tax directly to the
village treasurer.
Whenever possible, the tax authorized by this chapter shall, when collected, be stated as a distinct item separate and apart from the gross charge for
gas.
(B) Each taxpayer shall make a return to the village treasurer within thirty (30) days following the receipt by the taxpayer of taxes actually paid for the acts
or privileges set forth herein. The return shall include the taxpayer's name and principal place of business, the gross charges during the collection
period upon which the tax is imposed, the amount of tax, and such other reasonable and related information as the village may require. The taxpayer
making the return herein provided for shall, at the time of making such return, pay to the village treasurer the amount of tax herein imposed; provided
that in connection with any return the taxpayer may, if he so elects, report and pay an amount based upon his total billings of gross charges subject to
the tax during the period for which the return is made (exclusive of any amounts previously billed) with prompt adjustments of later payments based
upon any differences between such billings and the taxable gross charges.
(C) If it shall appear that an amount of tax has been paid which was not due under the provisions of this chapter, whether as the result of a mistake of fact
or an error of law, then such amount shall be credited against any tax due or to come due under this chapter from the taxpayer who made the
erroneous payment; provided that no amounts erroneously paid more than three (3) years prior to the filing of a claim therefor shall be so credited.
No action to recover any amount of tax due under the provisions of this chapter shall be commenced more than three (3) years after the due date of
such amount.
(D) Any taxpayer who fails to make a return, or who makes a fraudulent return, or who wilfully violates any other provisions of this chapter is guilty of a
misdemeanor and, upon conviction thereof, shall be subject to a fine of not less than one hundred dollars ($100.00) or more than five hundred dollars
($500.00), and in addition shall be liable in a civil action for the amount of tax due. (Ord. 2612, 5-7-2007)

such additional information as the village may reasonably require.
(B) Upon approval of the application, the village shall assign a resale number to the applicant and shall certify such number to the applicant. The village
may cancel any number which is obtained through misrepresentation, or which is used to sell or supply gas tax free when such actions in fact are not
for resale, or which no longer applies because of the person's having discontinued the making of resales.
(C) Except as provided hereinabove, the act or privilege of selling or supplying gas in this village shall not be made tax free on the grounds of being a sale
for resale unless the person has an active resale number from the village and furnishes that number to the retailer in connection with certifying to the
retailer that any sale to such person is nontaxable because of being a sale for resale. (Ord. 2612, 5-7-2007)

4-3-7: SIGN AREA AND HEIGHT COMPUTATIONS:
(A) Sign Dimension Computation:
1. Sign Area: "Sign area" is defined as the area within any perimeter enclosing the limits of lettering, emblems or other figures on a sign, together with
any material or color forming an integral part of the display or used to differentiate the sign from the background on which it is placed. Structural
members bearing no sign copy shall not be included in a sign's surface area. The sign area shall be calculated by measuring the entire area
enclosed within the smallest regular geometric form, or combination of regular geometric forms, which may be inscribed to encompass all letters and
graphic symbols of the sign, including horizontal spacing between such letters and symbols plus any additional portion of the background which is
framed by a border, internally illuminated, consisting of a color or tone different than the wall or structure to which the sign is attached, or projects
more than three inches (3"). See figure 1 of this section for illustrations that show the method for calculating sign area.
2. Sign Height: Sign height shall be measured as the vertical distance from the base of the sign or, where a sign is not ground based, from the base of
the building to which a sign is attached, to the highest point of the sign.

(c) The proposed variation will maintain and/or enhance the historic (if applicable) and architectural character of a site or building;
(d) The proposed variation will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood and will result in a sign that is harmonious with the character of
the applicable zoning district;
(e) The unique circumstances or unusual conditions applying to the specific property and sign do not apply generally to other properties and signs in
the village;
(f) The purpose of the proposed variation is not based exclusively upon a desire to achieve a higher profit from the property; and

(I) To preserve the natural characteristics and functions of watercourses and floodplains in order to moderate flood and stormwater impacts, improve water
quality, reduce soil erosion, protect aquatic and riparian habitat, provide recreational opportunities, provide aesthetic benefits and enhance community
and economic development. (Ord. 2681, 8-18-2008)
4-10-2: DEFINITIONS:
For the purposes of this chapter, the following definitions are adopted:
ACCESSORY STRUCTURE: A nonhabitable structure which is on the same parcel of property as the principal structure to be insured and the use of
which is incidental to the use of the principal structure.
ACT: An act in relation to the regulation of the rivers, lakes and streams of the state of Illinois, 615 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/5 et seq.
APPLICANT: Any person, firm, corporation or agency which submits an application.
APPROPRIATE USE: Only uses of the designated floodway that are permissible and will be considered for permit issuance. The only uses that will be
allowed are as specified in subsection 4-10-7(B) of this chapter.
BASE FLOOD: The flood having a one percent (1%) chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. The base flood is also known as the 100-
year frequency flood event. Application of the base flood elevation at any location is as defined in section 4-10-5 of this chapter.
BASE FLOOD ELEVATION (BFE): The elevation in relation to mean sea level of the crest of the base flood.
BASEMENT: That portion of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides.
BUILDING: A walled and roofed structure, including gas or liquid storage tank, that is principally aboveground, including manufactured homes,
prefabricated buildings, and gas or liquid storage tanks. The term also includes recreational vehicles and travel trailers installed on a site for more than one
hundred eighty (180) days per year.
CHANNEL: Any river, stream, creek, brook, branch, natural or artificial depression, ponded area, flowage, slough, ditch, conduit, culvert, gully, ravine,
wash, or natural or manmade drainageway, which has a definite bed and banks or shoreline, in or into which surface or ground water flows, either
perennially or intermittently.
CHANNEL MODIFICATION: Alteration of a channel by changing the physical dimensions or materials of its bed or banks. Channel modification includes
damming, riprapping (or other armoring), widening, deepening, straightening, relocating, lining and significant removal of native vegetation from the bottom
or banks. Channel modification does not include the clearing of dead or dying vegetation, debris, or trash from the channel. Channelization is a severe
form of channel modification involving a significant change in the channel cross section and typically involving relocation of the existing channel (e.g.,
straightening).
COMPENSATORY STORAGE: An artificially excavated, hydraulically equivalent volume of storage within the SFHA used to balance the loss of natural
flood storage capacity when artificial fill or structures are placed within the floodplain. The uncompensated loss of natural floodplain storage can increase
off site floodwater elevations and flows.
CONDITIONAL APPROVAL OF A DESIGNATED FLOODWAY MAP CHANGE: Preconstruction approval by IDNR/OWR and FEMA of a proposed change
to the floodway map. This preconstruction approval, pursuant to this chapter, gives assurances to the property owner that once an appropriate use is
constructed according to permitted plans, the floodway map can be changed, as previously agreed, upon review and acceptance of as built plans.
CONDITIONAL LETTER OF MAP REVISION (CLOMR): A letter which indicates that FEMA will revise base flood elevations, flood insurance rate zones,
flood boundaries or floodway as shown on an effective flood hazard boundary map or flood insurance rate map, once the as built plans are submitted and
approved.
CONTROL STRUCTURE: A structure designed to control the rate of flow that passes through the structure, given a specific upstream and downstream
water surface elevation.
CRITICAL FACILITY: Any facility which is critical to the health and welfare of the population and, if flooded, would create an added dimension to the
disaster. Damage to these critical facilities can impact the delivery of vital services, can cause greater damage to other sectors of the community, or can
put special populations at risk. Examples of critical facilities where flood protection should be required include: emergency services facilities (such as fire
and police stations), schools, hospitals, retirement homes and senior care facilities, major roads and bridges, critical utility sites (telephone switching
stations or electrical transformers), and hazardous material storage facilities (chemicals, petrochemicals, hazardous or toxic substances). Examples of
critical facilities where flood protection is recommended include: sewage treatment plants, water treatment plants, and pumping stations.
DAM: All obstructions, wall embankments or barriers, together with their abutments and appurtenant works, if any, constructed for the purpose of storing or
diverting water or creating a pool. Dams may also include weirs, restrictive culverts or impoundment structures. Underground water storage tanks are not
included.
DESIGNATED FLOODWAY: The channel, including on stream lakes, and that portion of the floodplain adjacent to a stream or watercourse, generally
depicted on the FEMA FIRM map, which is needed to store and convey the existing 100-year frequency flood discharge with no more than a 0.1 foot
increase in stage due to the loss of flood conveyance or storage, and no more than a ten percent (10%) increase in velocities.
(A) The floodways are designated for on the countywide flood insurance rate map of Cook County prepared by FEMA and dated August 19, 2008.
When two (2) floodway maps exist for a waterway, the more restrictive floodway limit shall prevail.
(B) The floodways for those parts of unincorporated Cook County that are within the extraterritorial jurisdiction of the village that may be annexed into
the village are designated for the Des Plaines River and Salt Creek on the countywide flood insurance rate map prepared by FEMA and dated
August 19, 2008.
(C) To locate the designated floodway boundary on any site, the designated floodway boundary should be scaled off the designated floodway map and
located on a site plan, using reference marks common to both maps. Where interpretation is needed to determine the exact location of the
designated floodway boundary, IDNR/OWR should be contacted for the interpretation.

SUBSTANTIAL IMPROVEMENT: Any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or improvement of a structure taking place, during a ten (10) year period, in
which the cumulative percentage of improvements equals or exceeds fifty percent (50%) of the market value of the structure before the improvement or
repair is started.
(A) "Substantial improvement" is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building
commences, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. This term includes structures which have incurred
repetitive loss or substantial damage, regardless of the actual work done.
(B) The term does not, however, include either:
1. Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely
necessary to assure safe living conditions, or
2. Any alteration of a "historic structure" listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the Illinois Register of Historic Places, provided that the
alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure.
TRANSITION SECTION: Reaches of the stream or floodway where water flows from a narrow cross section to a wide cross section or vice versa.

4-10-3: HOW TO USE THIS CHAPTER:
(A) The village manager or designee shall be responsible for fulfilling all of the duties listed in section 4-10-4 of this chapter.
(B) To fulfill those duties, the village manager should first use the criteria listed in section 4-10-5, "Base Flood Elevation", of this chapter to determine
whether the development site is located within a floodplain.
(C) Once it has been determined that a site is located within a floodplain, the village manager must determine whether the development site is within a
flood fringe, a designated floodway, or within an SFHA or floodplain for which no floodway has been identified.
1. If the site is within a flood fringe, the village manager shall require that the minimum requirements of section 4-10-6 of this chapter be met.
2. If the site is within a floodway, the village manager shall require that the minimum requirements of section 4-10-7 of this chapter be met.
3. If the site is located within an SFHA or floodplain for which no detailed study has been completed and approved, the village manager shall require
that the minimum requirements of section 4-10-8 of this chapter be met.
(D) In addition, the general requirements of section 4-10-9 of this chapter shall be met for all developments meeting the requirements of section 4-10-6, 4-
10-7, or 4-10-8 of this chapter.
(E) The village manager shall assure that all subdivision proposals shall meet the requirements of section 4-10-10 of this chapter.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=610 209/519
(F) If a variance is to be granted for a proposal, the village manager shall review the requirements of section 4-10-11 of this chapter to make sure they are
met. In addition, the village manager shall complete all notification requirements.
(G) In order to assure that property owners obtain permits as required in this chapter, the village manager may take any and all actions as outlined in
section 4-10-13 of this chapter. (Ord. 2681, 8-18-2008)
4-10-4: DUTIES OF VILLAGE MANAGER:
(A) Determining The Floodplain Designation:
1. Check all new development sites to determine whether they are in a special flood hazard area (SFHA).
2. If they are in an SFHA, determine whether they are in a floodway, flood fringe or in a floodplain for which a detailed study has not been conducted
and which drains more than one square mile.
3. Check whether the development is potentially within an extended SFHA (with a drainage area less than 1 square mile), indicating that the
development would have adverse impacts regarding storage, conveyance, or inundation which would be the basis for the applicant being required to
delineate the floodplain and floodway and be subject to the remaining sections of this chapter.
(B) Professional Engineer Review:
1. If the development site is within a floodway or in a floodplain for which a detailed study has not been conducted and which drains more than one
square mile, the permit shall be referred to a licensed professional engineer under the employ or contract of the village for review to ensure that the
development meets section 4-10-7 or 4-10-8 of this chapter.
2. In the case of an appropriate use, the PE shall state in writing that the development meets the requirements of section 4-10-7 of this chapter.
(C) Dam Safety Requirements:
1. Dams are classified as to their size and their hazard/damage potential in the event of failure.
2. The construction or major modification of all class I (high hazard) and class II (moderate hazard) dams requires an IDNR/OWR dam safety permit.
3. Some class III (low hazard) dams require an IDNR/OWR dam safety permit, depending on the drainage area to the dam, the height of the dam and
the impounding capacity behind the dam. Most off channel detention basins that have an embankment are nonjurisdictional class III dams. It is not
required that IDNR/OWR "sign off" on all nonjurisdictional class III dams.
4. A consulting engineer with dam safety knowledge can estimate a hazard classification and determine if an IDNR/OWR dam safety permit is required.
5. A permit application submittal must be made to IDNR/OWR for the construction or major modification of jurisdictional dams.
6. Regulated dams may include weirs, restrictive culverts or impoundment structures.
(D) Other Permit Requirements: Ensure any and all required federal, state and local permits are received prior to the issuance of a floodplain development
permit.
(E) Plan Review And Permit Issuance:
1. Ensure that all development activities within the SFHAs of the jurisdiction of the village meet the requirements of this chapter; and
2. Issue a floodplain development permit in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and other regulations of this community when the
development meets the conditions of this chapter.
(F) Inspection Review:
1. Inspect all development projects before, during and after construction to assure proper elevation of the structure and to ensure compliance with the
provisions of this chapter; and
2. Schedule on an annual basis an inspection of the floodplain and document the results of the inspection.
(G) Damage Determinations: Make damage determinations of all damaged buildings in the SFHA after a flood to determine substantially damaged
structures which must comply with subsection 4-10-9(C)3 of this chapter.
(H) Elevation And Floodproofing Certificates: Maintain permit files including:
1. An elevation certificate certifying the elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) of a residential or nonresidential building subject to section 4-
10-9 of this chapter; and/or
2. The elevation to which a nonresidential building has been floodproofed, using a floodproofing certificate, for all buildings subject to section 4-10-9 of
this chapter.

(A) This chapter's protection standard is based on the flood insurance study for the village.
1. If a base flood elevation or 100-year frequency flood elevation is not available for a particular site, then the protection standard shall be according to
the best existing data available from federal, state or other sources.
2. When a party disagrees with the best available data, they shall submit a detailed engineering study needed to replace existing data with better data
and submit it to IDNR/OWR and FEMA for review and consideration prior to any development of the site.
(B) The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the SFHAs of the Des Plaines River shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in
the "Flood Insurance Study Of Cook County" prepared by FEMA dated August 19, 2008, and such amendments to such study and maps as may be
prepared from time to time.
(C) The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for the SFHAs of those parts of unincorporated Cook County that are within the extraterritorial
jurisdiction of the village or that may be annexed into the village shall be as delineated on the 100-year flood profiles in the "Flood Insurance Study Of
Cook County" prepared by FEMA and dated August 19, 2008, and such amendments or revisions to such study and maps as may be prepared from
time to time.
(D) The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each SFHA delineated as an "AH zone" or "AO zone" shall be that elevation (or depth)
delineated on the countywide flood insurance rate map of Cook County.
(E) The base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for each of the remaining SFHAs delineated as an "A zone" on the countywide flood insurance
rate map of Cook County shall be according to the best existing data available from federal, state or other sources. Should no other data exist, an
engineering study must be financed by the applicant to determine base flood elevations.
1. When no base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation exists, the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation for a riverine SFHA shall be
determined from a backwater model, such as HEC-II, HEC-RAS, or a dynamic model such as HIP.
2. The flood flows used in the hydraulic models shall be obtained from a hydrologic model, such as HEC-HMS, HEC-1, TR-20, or HIP, or by techniques
presented in various publications prepared by the United States geological survey for estimating peak flood discharges.
3. For a nonriverine SFHA, the base flood elevation shall be the historic flood of record plus three feet (3'), unless calculated by a detailed engineering
study.

4. For an unmapped extended SFHA (with a drainage area less than 1 square mile) which has been identified by the village manager pursuant to
subsection 4-10-4(A)3 of this chapter, the base flood elevation shall be determined by the applicant utilizing a method as approved in this subsection
(E). (Ord. 2681, 8-18-2008)
4-10-6: OCCUPATION AND USE OF FLOOD FRINGE AREAS:
Development in and/or filling of the flood fringe will be permitted if protection is provided against the base flood or 100-year frequency flood by proper
elevation, and compensatory storage, and other applicable provisions of this chapter. No use will be permitted which adversely affects the capacity of
drainage facilities or systems. Developments located within the flood fringe shall meet the requirements of this section, along with the requirements of
section 4-10-9 of this chapter.
(A) Development Permit:
1. No person, firm, corporation, or governmental body not exempted by law shall commence any development in the SFHA without first obtaining a
development permit from the village manager.
2. Application for a development permit shall be made on a form provided by the village manager.
(a) The application shall be accompanied by drawings of the site, drawn to scale, showing property line dimensions and legal description for the
property and sealed by a licensed engineer, architect or land surveyor; existing grade elevations, using the North American vertical datum of 1988,
and all changes in grade resulting from excavation or filling; the location and dimensions of all buildings and additions to buildings.
(b) For all proposed buildings, the elevation of the lowest floor (including basement) and lowest adjacent grade shall be shown on the submitted
plans and the development will be subject to the requirements of section 4-10-9 of this chapter.
3. Upon receipt of a development permit application, the village manager shall compare the elevation of the site to the base flood or 100-year
frequency flood elevation.
(a) Any development located on land that can be shown to be higher than the base flood elevation of the current flood insurance rate map and which
has not been filled after the date of the sites first flood insurance rate map without a permit as required by this chapter is not in the SFHA and,
therefore, not subject to the requirements of this chapter. Conversely, any development located on land shown to be below the base flood
elevation and hydraulically connected, but shown on the current flood insurance rate map is subject to the provisions of this chapter.
(b) The village manager shall maintain documentation of the existing ground elevation at the development site and certification that this ground
elevation existed prior to the date of the site's first flood insurance rate map identification.
4. A soil erosion and sediment control plan for disturbed areas shall be submitted. This plan shall include a description of the sequence of grading
activities and the temporary sediment and erosion control measures to be implemented to mitigate their effects. This plan shall also include a
description of final stabilization and revegetation measures, and the identification of a responsible party to ensure postconstruction maintenance.
5. The village manager shall be responsible for obtaining from the applicant copies of all other federal, state, and local permits, approvals or waivers
that may be required for this type of activity. The village manager shall not issue a permit unless all other federal, state, and local permits have been
obtained.
(B) Preventing Increased Damages: No development in the flood fringe shall create a threat to public health and safety.
1. Fill Used For Elevation: If fill is being used to elevate the site above the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation, the applicant shall submit
sufficient data and obtain a letter of map revision (LOMR) from FEMA for the purpose of removing the site from the floodplain.
2. Compensatory Storage:
(a) Whenever any portion of a floodplain is authorized for use, the volume of space which will be occupied by the authorized fill or structure below the
base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation shall be compensated for and balanced by a hydraulically equivalent volume of excavation taken
from below the base flood or 100-year frequency flood elevation.
(b) The excavation volume shall be at least equal to 1.5 times the volume of storage lost due to the fill or structure.
(c) In the case of streams and watercourses, such excavation shall be made opposite or adjacent to the areas so filled or occupied.
(d) All floodplain storage lost below the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed 10-year flood elevation. All floodplain
storage lost above the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed 10-year flood elevation.
(e) All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse.
(C) Construction Of The Lowest Floor Below The Base Flood Elevation (BFE): A person who has obtained a letter of map revision based on fill that
removes a site in the flood fringe from the floodplain due to the use of fill to elevate the site above the BFE, may apply for a permit from the village to
construct the lowest floor of a residential building below the BFE in the flood fringe. The village manager shall not issue such a permit unless the
applicant has complied with all the criteria set forth in the following subsections:
1. Compensatory storage shall be provided per subsection (B)2 of this section.
2. The elevation of the lowest opening in the basement wall (i.e., window wells, accessways) shall be at or above the flood protection elevation (FPE).
3. The lowest adjacent grade to the foundation shall be at or above the FPE, for a minimum distance of ten feet (10') beyond the outside face of the
structure. However, if site conditions are such that this requirement cannot be met, the village manager may waive the ten foot (10') minimum
setback if an Illinois licensed professional engineer certifies that an alternative method to protect the building from damage due to hydrostatic
pressures has been met. The certifications shall be in the form of a detailed soils and structural design analysis, which shall be submitted to the
village manager for review. The village manager may require such additional documentation as necessary to prove that the proposed shorter setback
distance will keep the structure reasonably safe. In no case shall the setback distance be less than four feet (4').
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=610 212/519
4. The grade around the perimeter of the structure, measured at a distance of twenty feet (20') from the structure, shall be above the BFE. However, if
site conditions are such that this requirement cannot be obtained, the village manager may waive the twenty foot (20') minimum setback distance if
an Illinois licensed professional engineer certifies that an alternative method to protect the building from damages due to hydrostatic pressures has
been met. A detailed soils analysis and structural design proving that a shorter setback distance will keep the structure reasonably safe from flooding
shall be submitted to the village for review. In no case shall the setback distance be less than four feet (4').
5. The ground around the building shall be compacted fill that meets all requirements of this subsection and is at least five feet (5') thick under the
basement floor slab. Nothing in this subsection shall be interpreted to require the removal or replacement of fill that was placed as part of an LOMRF,
if such fill consists of material, including soils of similar classification and degree permeability, such as those classified as CH, CL, SC or ML
according to ASTM standard D-2487, classification of soils for engineering purposes.
6. The fill material must be homogeneous and isotropic; that is, the soil must be all of one material, and the engineering priorities must be in the same
direction.
7. All fill material and compaction shall be designed, certified and inspected by an Illinois licensed professional engineer, as warranted by the site
conditions.
8. The basement floor shall be at an elevation that is no more than five feet (5') below the BFE.
9. There shall be a granular drainage layer beneath the floor slab, and minimum of one-fourth (1/4) horsepower sump pump with a backup power supply
shall be provided to remove seepage flow. The pump shall be rated at four (4) times the estimated seepage rate and shall discharge above the BFE
and away from the building in order to prevent flooding of the basement or uplift of the floor under the effect of the seepage pressure.
10. The drainage system shall be equipped with a positive means of preventing backflow.
11. All foundation elements shall be designed to withstand hydrostatic pressure in accordance with accepted engineering practices.
12. If the applicant is unable to meet all of the requirements set forth in the preceding paragraphs of this subsection, the village manager may allow the
construction of a basement below the BFE only if the applicant demonstrates that the proposed fill and structure meet the guidelines and
requirements set forth in FEMA technical bulletin 10-01 and are reasonably safe from flooding. In order to demonstrate that the proposed structure is
reasonably safe from flooding, the applicant shall submit a detailed engineering analysis of the proposed fill and foundation wall. The engineered
basement study shall be completed in accordance with the latest edition of FEMA technical bulletin 10-01, with the analysis of the fill being prepared
by an Illinois licensed professional engineer.
13. In order to provide the required compensatory storage on site, in no case shall the depth of excavation in the front and side yards of the lot exceed
eighteen inches (18"), as measured from the previously existing natural grade. The rear yard shall be permitted to have a greater depth of
excavation, if necessary. All such excavation shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse or storm sewer system. The use of
mechanical means to drain the compensatory storage area will not be permitted. (Ord. 2681, 8-18-2008)

(B) Preventing Increased Damages And A List Of Appropriate Uses:
1. Appropriate Uses: The only development in a floodway which will be allowed are appropriate uses, which will not cause a rise in the base flood
elevation, and which will not create a damaging or potentially damaging increase in flood heights or velocity or be a threat to public health and safety
and welfare or impair the natural hydrologic and hydraulic functions of the floodway or channel, or permanently impair existing water quality or
aquatic habitat. Construction impacts shall be minimized by appropriate mitigation methods as called for in this chapter. Only those appropriate uses
listed in 17 Illinois administrative code part 3708 will be allowed. The approved appropriate uses are as follows:
(a) Flood control structures, dikes, dams and other public works or private improvements relating to the control of drainage, flooding, erosion, or
water quality or habitat for fish and wildlife;
(b) Structures or facilities relating to the use of, or requiring access to, the water or shoreline, such as pumping and treatment facilities, and facilities
and improvements related to recreational boating, commercial shipping and other functionally water dependent uses;
(c) Storm and sanitary sewer relief outfalls;
(d) Underground and overhead utilities;
(e) Recreational facilities such as playing fields and trail systems, including any related fencing (at least 50 percent open when viewed from any one
direction) built parallel to the direction of flood flows, and including open air pavilions and toilet facilities (4 stall maximum) that will not block flood
flows nor reduce floodway storage;
(f) Detached garages, storage sheds, or other nonhabitable accessory structures that will not block flood flows nor reduce floodway storage;
(g) Bridges, culverts, roadways, sidewalks, railways, runways and taxiways and any modification thereto;
(h) Parking lots built at or below existing grade where either:
(1) The depth of flooding at the 100-year frequency flood event will not exceed 1.0 foot; or
(2) The applicant of a short term recreational use facility parking lot formally agrees to restrict access during over bank flooding events and accepts
liability for all damage caused by vehicular access during all over bank flooding events;
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=610 214/519
(i) Designated floodway regrading, without fill, to create a positive nonerosive slope toward a watercourse;
(j) Floodproofing activities to protect previously existing lawful structures including the construction of watertight window wells, elevating structures, or
construction of floodwalls around residential, commercial or industrial principal structures where the outside toe of the floodwall shall be no more
than ten feet (10') away from the exterior wall of the existing structure, and, which are not considered substantial improvements to the structure;
(k) The replacement, reconstruction, or repair of a damaged building, provided that the outside dimensions are not increased, and if the building was
damaged to fifty percent (50%) or more of the market value before the damage occurred, the building will be protected from flooding to the flood
protection elevation;
(l) Modifications to an existing building that would not increase the enclosed floor area of the building below the 100-year frequency flood elevation,
and which will not block flood flows including, but not limited to, fireplaces, bay windows, decks, patios, and second story additions. If the building
is improved to fifty percent (50%) or more of the market value before the modification occurred (i.e., a substantial improvement), the building will
be protected from flooding to the flood protection elevation;
2. Exclusions: Appropriate uses do not include the construction or placement of any new structures, fill, building additions, buildings on stilts,
excavation or channel modifications done to accommodate otherwise nonappropriate uses in the floodway, fencing (including landscaping or planting
designed to act as a fence) and storage of materials except as specifically defined above as an appropriate use.
3. Construction Permissible; Criteria: Within the designated floodway, the construction of an appropriate use, will be considered permissible provided
that the proposed project meets the following engineering and mitigation criteria and is so stated in writing with supporting plans, calculations and
data by a licensed professional engineer and provided that any structure meets the protection requirements of section 4-10-9 of this chapter:
(a) Preservation Of Flood Conveyance, So As Not To Increase Flood Stages Upstream: For appropriate uses other than bridge or culvert crossings,
on stream structures or dams, all effective designated floodway conveyance lost due to the project will be replaced for all flood events up to and
including the 100-year frequency flood. In calculating effective designated floodway conveyance, the following factors shall be taken into
consideration:
(1) Designated floodway conveyance, "K" = (1.486/n)(AR2/3) where "n" is Manning's roughness factor, "A" is the effective flow area of the cross
section, and "R" is the ratio of the area to the wetted perimeter. (See Ven Te Chow, "Open Channel Hydraulics", [McGraw-Hill, New York 1959].)
(2) The same Manning's "n" value shall be used for both existing and proposed conditions unless a recorded maintenance agreement with a
federal, state, or local unit of government can assure the proposed conditions will be maintained or the land cover is changing from a vegetative
to a nonvegetative land cover.
(3) Transition sections shall be provided and used in calculations of effective designated floodway conveyance. The following expansion and
contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to IDNR/OWR through engineering calculations or model tests that
more abrupt transitions may be used with the same efficiency:
A. When water is flowing from a narrow section to a wider section, the water should be assumed to expand no faster than at a rate of one foot
(1') horizontal for every four feet (4') of the flooded stream's length.
B. When water is flowing from a wide section to a narrow section, the water should be assumed to contract no faster than at a rate of one foot
(1') horizontal for every one foot (1') of the flooded stream's length.
C. When expanding or contracting flows in a vertical direction, a minimum of one foot (1') vertical transition for every ten feet (10') of stream
length shall be used.
D. Transition sections shall be provided between cross sections with rapid expansions and contractions and when meeting the designated
floodway delineation on adjacent properties.
E. All cross sections used in the calculations shall be located perpendicular to flood flows.
(b) Preservation Of Floodway Storage So As Not To Increase Downstream Flooding:
(1) Compensatory storage shall be provided for any designated floodway storage lost due to the proposed work from the volume of fill or structures
placed and the impact of any related flood control projects.
(2) Compensatory storage for fill or structures shall be equal to at least 1.5 times the volume of floodplain storage lost.
(3) Artificially created storage lost due to a reduction in head loss behind a bridge shall not be required to be replaced.
(4) The compensatory designated floodway storage shall be placed between the proposed normal water elevation and the proposed 100-year
flood elevation. All designated floodway storage lost below the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced below the proposed 10-year
flood elevation. All designated floodway storage lost above the existing 10-year flood elevation shall be replaced above the proposed 10-year
flood elevation. All such excavations shall be constructed to drain freely and openly to the watercourse.
(5) If the compensatory storage will not be placed at the location of the proposed construction, the applicant's engineer shall demonstrate through
a determination of flood discharges and water surface elevations that the compensatory storage is hydraulically equivalent.
(6) There shall be no reduction in floodway surface area as a result of a floodway modification, unless such modification is necessary to reduce
flooding at existing structure.
(c) Preservation Of Floodway Velocities So As Not To Increase Stream Erosion Or Flood Heights:
(1) For all appropriate uses, except bridges or culverts or on stream structures, the proposed work will not result in an increase in the average
channel or designated floodway velocities or stage for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event.
(2) In the case of bridges or culverts or on stream structures built for the purpose of backing up water in the stream during normal or flood flows,
velocities may be increased at the structure site if scour, erosion and sedimentation will be avoided by the use of riprap or other design
measures.
(d) Construction Of New Bridges Or Culvert Crossings And Roadway Approaches:
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=610 215/519
(1) The proposed structure shall not result in an increase of upstream flood stages greater than 0.1 foot when compared to the existing conditions
for all flood events up to and including the 100-year frequency event; or the upstream flood stage increases will be contained within the channel
banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as within the design protection grade of existing levees or floodwalls or
within recorded flood easements.
(2) If the proposed construction will increase upstream flood stages greater than 0.1 foot, the developer must contact IDNR/OWR to obtain a
permit for a dam or waiver.
A. The engineering analysis of upstream flood stages must be calculated using the flood study flows, and corresponding flood elevations for
tailwater conditions for the flood study specified in section 4-10-5 of this chapter. Bridges and culverts must be analyzed using any commonly
accepted FEMA approved hydraulic models.
B. Lost floodway storage must be compensated for per subsection (B)3(b) of this section.
C. Velocity increases must be mitigated per subsection (B)3(c) of this section.
D. If the crossing is proposed over a public water that is used for recreational or commercial navigation, an IDNR/OWR permit must be received.

(1) The bridge or culvert and roadway approach reconstruction or modification shall be constructed with no more than 0.1 foot increase in
backwater over the existing flood profile for all flood frequencies up to and including the 100-year event, if the existing structure is not a source
of flood damage.
(2) If the existing bridge or culvert and roadway approach is a source of flood damage to buildings or structures in the upstream floodplain, the
applicant's engineer shall evaluate the feasibility of redesigning the structure to reduce the existing backwater, taking into consideration the
effects on flood stages on upstream and downstream properties.
(3) The determination as to whether or not the existing crossing is a source of flood damage and should be redesigned must be prepared in
accordance with 17 Illinois administrative code part 3708 (floodway construction in northeastern Illinois) and submitted to IDNR/OWR for review
and concurrence before a permit is issued.
(f) On Stream Structures Built For The Purpose Of Backing Up Water:
(1) Any increase in upstream flood stages greater than 0.0 feet when compared to the existing conditions, for all flood events up to and including
the 100-year frequency event shall be contained within the channel banks (or within existing vertical extensions of the channel banks) such as
within the design protection grade of existing levees or floodwalls or within recorded flood easements.
(2) A permit or letter indicating a permit is not required must be obtained from IDNR/OWR for any structure built for the purpose of backing up
water in the stream during normal or flood flow.
(3) All dams and impoundment structures as defined in the definition of "dam" in section 4-10-2 of this chapter shall meet the permitting
requirements of 17 Illinois administrative code part 3702 (construction and maintenance of dams). If the proposed activity involves a modification
of the channel or floodway to accommodate an impoundment, it shall be demonstrated that:
A. The impoundment is determined to be in the public interest by providing flood control, public recreation, or regional stormwater detention;
B. The impoundment will not prevent the migration of indigenous fish species, which require access to upstream areas as part of their life cycle,
such as for spawning;
C. The impoundment will not cause or contribute to degraded water quality or habitat conditions. Impoundment design should include gradual
bank slopes, appropriate bank stabilization measures and a presedimentation basin;
D. A nonpoint source control plan has been implemented in the upstream watershed to control the effects of sediment runoff as well as minimize
the input of nutrients, oil and grease, metals, and other pollutants. If there is more than one municipality in the upstream watershed, the
municipality in which the impoundment is constructed should coordinate with upstream municipalities to ensure comprehensive watershed
control;
E. The project otherwise complies with the requirements of this section.
(g) Floodproofing Of Existing Habitable, Residential And Commercial Structures:
(1) If construction is required beyond the outside dimensions of the existing building, the outside perimeter of the floodproofing construction shall
be placed no farther than ten feet (10') from the outside of the building.
(2) Compensation of lost storage and conveyance will not be required for floodproofing activities.
(h) Excavation In The Floodway:
(1) When excavation is proposed in the design of bridges and culvert openings, including the modifications to and replacement of existing bridge
and culvert structures, or to compensate for lost conveyance or other appropriate uses, transition sections shall be provided for the excavation.
(2) The following expansion and contraction ratios shall be used unless an applicant's engineer can prove to IDNR/OWR through engineering
calculations or model tests that more abrupt transitions may be used with the same efficiency:

(1) There are no practicable alternatives to the activity which would accomplish its purpose with less impact to the natural conditions of the body of
water affected. Possible alternatives include levees, bank stabilization, floodproofing of existing structures, removal of structures from the
floodplain, clearing the channel, high flow channel, or the establishment of a streamside buffer strip or greenbelt. Channel modification is
acceptable if the purpose is to restore natural conditions and improve water quality and fish and wildlife habitat;
(2) Water quality, habitat, and other natural functions would be significantly improved by the modification and no significant habitat area may be
destroyed, or the impacts are offset by the replacement of an equivalent degree of natural resource values;
(3) The activity has been planned and designed and will be constructed in a way which will minimize its adverse impacts on the natural conditions
of the body of water affected, consistent with the following criteria:
A. The physical characteristics of the modified channel shall match as closely as possible those of the existing channel in length, cross section,
slope and sinuosity. If the existing channel has been previously modified, restoration of more natural physical conditions should be
incorporated into channel modification design, where practical.
B. Hydraulically effective transitions shall be provided at both the upstream and downstream ends of the project, designed such that they will
prevent erosion.
C. One sided construction of a channel shall be used when feasible. Removal of streamside (riparian) vegetation should be limited to one side of
the channel, where possible, to preserve the shading and stabilization effects of the vegetation.
D. Clearing of stabilizing vegetation shall be limited to that which is essential for construction of the channel.
E. Channel banks shall be constructed with a side slope no steeper than three to one (3:1) horizontal to vertical, wherever practicable. Native
vegetation and gradual side slopes are the preferred methods for bank stabilization. Where high velocities or sharp bends necessitate the use
of alternative stabilization measures, soil bioengineering techniques, natural rock or riprap are preferred approaches. Artificial materials such
as concrete, gabions, or construction rubble should be avoided unless there are no practicable alternatives.
F. All disturbed areas associated with the modification shall be seeded or otherwise stabilized as soon as possible upon completion of
construction. Erosion blanket or an equivalent material shall be required to stabilize disturbed channel banks prior to establishment of the
vegetative cover.
G. If the existing channel contains considerable bottom diversity such as deep pools, riffles, and other similar features, such features shall be
provided in the new channel. Spawning and nesting areas and flow characteristics compatible with fish habitat shall also be established,
where appropriate.
H. A sediment basin shall be installed at the downstream end of the modification to reduce sedimentation and degradation of downstream water
quality.
I. New or relocated channels should be built in the dry and all items of construction, including vegetation, should be completed prior to diversion
of water into the new channel.
J. There shall be no increases in stage or velocity as the channel enters or leaves the project site for any frequency flood unless necessitated by
a public flood control project or unless such an increase is justified as part of a habitat improvement or erosion control project.
K. Unless the modification is for a public flood control project, there shall be no reduction in the volume of floodwater storage outside the
floodway as a result of the modification; and
(4) The project otherwise complies with the requirements of this section.
(j) Seeding And Stabilization Plan: For all activities located in a floodway, a seeding and stabilization plan shall be submitted by the applicant.
(k) Soil Erosion And Sedimentation Measures: For all activities in the floodway, including grading, filling, and excavation, in which there is potential
for erosion of exposed soil, soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be employed consistent with the following criteria:
(1) The construction area shall be minimized to preserve the maximum vegetation possible. Construction shall be scheduled to minimize the time
soil is exposed and unprotected. In no case shall the existing natural vegetation be destroyed, removed, or disturbed more than fifteen (15) days
prior to the initiation of improvements.
(2) Temporary and/or permanent soil stabilization shall be applied to denuded areas as soon as possible. As a minimum, soil stabilization shall be
provided within fifteen (15) days after final grade is reached on any portion of the site, and within fifteen (15) days to denuded areas which may
not be at final grade but will remain undisturbed for longer than sixty (60) days.
(3) Sedimentation control measures shall be installed before any significant grading or filling is initiated on the site to prevent the movement of
eroded sediments off site or into the channel. Potential sediment control devices include filter fences, straw bale fences, check dams, diversion
ditches, and sediment traps and basins.
(4) A vegetated buffer strip of at least twenty five feet (25') in width shall be preserved and/or reestablished, where possible, along existing
channels (see subsection (B)3(p) of this section). Construction vehicle use of channels shall be minimized. Temporary stream crossings shall be
constructed, where necessary, to minimize erosion. Necessary construction in or along channels shall be restabilized immediately.
(5) Soil erosion and sedimentation control measures shall be designed and implemented consistent with "Procedures And Standards For Urban
Soil Erosion And Sedimentation Control In Illinois" (1988) also known as the "Green Book" and "The Illinois Urban Manual" (NRCS, 1995).

with concurrence from IDNR/OWR.
(o) Professional Engineer's Supervision: All engineering analyses shall be performed by or under the supervision of a licensed professional engineer.
(p) Construction Near Channel: For all activities in the floodway involving construction within twenty five feet (25') of the channel, the following criteria
shall be met:
(1) A natural vegetation buffer strip shall be preserved within at least twenty five feet (25') of the ordinary high water mark of the channel.
(2) Where it is impossible to protect this buffer strip during the construction of an appropriate use, a vegetated buffer strip shall be established
upon completion of construction.
(q) Construction May Proceed: After receipt of conditional approval of the designated floodway change and issuance of a permit and a conditional
letter of map revision, construction as necessary to change the floodway designation may proceed but no buildings or structures or other
construction that is not an appropriate use may be placed in that area until the designated floodway map is changed and a final letter of map
revision is received. The designated floodway map will be revised upon acceptance and concurrence by IDNR/OWR and FEMA of the "as built"
plans.
4. Development Activities In Delegated Communities Requiring State Review: For those projects listed below located in a designated floodway, the
following criteria shall be submitted to IDNR/OWR for their review and concurrence and/or permit prior to the issuance of a permit by a community or
county delegated state permitting authority in the floodway:

report without first notifying the duly constituted authorities in writing of such intended change and substantially notifying all purchasers and prospective
purchasers of such change.
(J) After the signing of the contract of sale for a condominium unit, and prior to the closing of the sale, the developer must deliver to the buyer a copy of
any amendments, supplements or modifications to the property report. The prospective purchaser may rescind, in writing, the contract of sale within
five (5) days after receiving any of the aforesaid items without any liability on the buyer's part, and shall thereupon be entitled to the return of any
deposit made on account of the contract.
(K) The rights of purchasers under this section may not be waived in the contract of sale, and any attempted waiver is void. (Ord. 2532, 8-15-2005)
4-14-5: NOTICE TO TENANTS AND TENANTS' RIGHT TO PURCHASE:
(A) Prior to conversion of the first condominium unit to a condominium status, the developer shall give each of the tenants in possession of units subject to
this chapter notice of intent to convert no less than two hundred ten (210) days prior to requiring the tenants to vacate.
(B) The notice of intent must set forth the rights of tenants under this chapter and must include this section as an attachment. Such notice shall be hand
delivered or sent by certified mail.
(C) No tenant may be required by the developer to vacate upon less than two hundred ten (210) days' notice, except by reason of nonpayment of rent,
conduct that disturbs other tenants' peaceful enjoyment of the premises, or other substantial violations of the terms of the rental agreement. The terms
of tenancy may not be altered during that period.
(D) During the one hundred twenty (120) day period following the delivery to tenants of the notice of intent, the developer shall offer the tenant his unit.
This offer shall be held open until tenant's acceptance or refusal, but in no event longer than the expiration of the one hundred twenty (120) day period.
Inaction by the tenant after the expiration of the one hundred twenty (120) days shall constitute a waiver of his right of first purchase. Said offer shall be
either a first time offer to the tenant at a set price, or the right of first refusal to that tenant when a bona fide offer has been submitted for that unit by a
third party. Under either procedure, the tenant shall have thirty (30) days to execute his own contract for the unit from the date of receipt of the offer or
right of first refusal. If a tenant fails to execute a contract during that period, the developer may not offer to sell that unit during the following one
hundred eighty (180) days at a price or on terms more favorable to the prospective purchaser than the price or terms offered to the tenant without first
making same offer to the tenant, who shall have at least fifteen (15) days within which to accept the offer. This provision does not apply to any unit in a
conversion condominium if the boundaries of the converted unit do not substantially conform to the dimensions of the unit before conversion; however,
where it is available, another unit similar to the preconversion dwelling must be offered to the affected tenant. (Ord. 2532, 8-15-2005)
4-14-6: DEVELOPER'S RIGHT TO ACCESS:
(A) The tenant in a conversion condominium shall not unreasonably withhold consent to the developer to enter the unit in order to inspect the premises,
make necessary or agreed repairs, supply necessary or agreed services, or show the unit to prospective or actual workmen or purchasers in
accordance with section 4-14-3 of this chapter. The landlord shall not abuse the rights of access or use it to harass the tenant. Except in case of
emergency, the landlord shall give the tenant at least two (2) days' notice of his intent and may enter only at reasonable times.
(B) An occupied unit which is offered for initial sale can be shown to a prospective purchaser only during the last ninety (90) days of the notice period or
tenancy, whichever terminates at a later date. However, if a tenant has provided notice of an intent to terminate the lease purchase pursuant to section
4-14-5 of this chapter, the developer may show the unit subsequent to the receipt of such notice. (Ord. 2532, 8-15-2005)

1. Applicants for a beekeeping license and/or associated building permit must submit the following to the Community Development Director:
(a) A completed application on forms provided by the Village, including a statement that all colonies shall be actively maintained in accordance with
the Illinois Bees and Apiaries Act, 510 Illinois Compiled Statutes 20/1 et seq., shall be duly registered with the Illinois Department of Agriculture,
and that licensees shall reasonably treat hives for varroa mites;
(b) Proof of liability insurance that does not exclude coverage for beekeeping activities;

project set forth in subsection (Q) of this section is continued or extended, the license will be presumptively renewed upon a showing by licensee that

over all property lines in the vicinity of the hive. This flyway barrier requirement shall not apply if the setback between any colony and the closest
property line is fifty feet (50') or more.
(G) Water: Each beekeeper shall ensure that a convenient source of water is available at all times to the bees so long as colonies remain active outside
the hive so that the bees will not congregate at swimming pools, faucets, pet water bowls, birdbaths or other water sources where they may cause
human, bird, or domestic pet contact. The water shall be maintained so as not to become stagnant.

within a building or other bee-proof enclosure.
(I) Queens: In any instance in which a colony exhibits unusually aggressive characteristics by stinging or attempting to sting without due provocation, or
exhibits an unusual disposition towards swarming, it shall be the duty of the licensee to re-queen the colony. Queens shall be selected from stock bred
for gentleness and non-swarming characteristics.
(J) Record Keeping: Each licensee shall keep records providing at least the following information: dates of installation and inspections; brood pattern and
health; whether queen was observed; visibility of sealed queen cells; honey and pollen stores; whether a super is ready to be added or removed;

condition, has been abandoned by the beekeeper, is unlawful.

a manner or of such disposition as to cause any unhealthy condition, interfere with the normal use and enjoyment of human or animal life of others or

Village Manager, in accordance with the procedures set forth in section 3-1-5 of this Code.
2. If a license to engage in beekeeping is revoked for any cause, no license shall be granted to the same licensee for beekeeping for a period of one
(1) year from the date of revocation.
(N) Summary Suspension: Where the Community Development Director presents to the Village Manager sufficient evidence demonstrating probable
cause to believe that the licensee has violated the provisions of this section or State or Federal law, and that said violation will immediately threaten the
public health, safety or welfare, the Community Development Director may, upon the issuance of a written order stating the reason for such conclusion,
and without prior notice or hearing, order the permitted structure for beekeeping closed and the beekeeping license summarily suspended pending a
hearing and a determination on suspension or revocation. The licensee shall be provided a copy of the order and a notice of violation. A hearing shall
be commenced not more than ten (10) days following the entry of such an order, unless the licensee shall agree to a longer period of time. The

Chapter 9
SMOKE FREE AIR REGULATIONS
7-9-1: BACKGROUND:
Smoking creates serious hazards to the personal health and safety of people near the smoking and serious threats of damage to property that may result
from the incendiary nature of smoking. It has been determined that breathing ambient smoke is a health hazard to both smokers and nonsmokers.
Smoking produces substances considered hazardous to health including carbon monoxide, hydrogen cyanide, nitrous oxide, and formaldehyde.
Secondhand smoke (68 percent of the total smoke produced by a cigarette) affects the health of the bystander, interferes with respiratory tract defenses,
and often causes nonsmokers to have allergic or irritating reactions. Secondhand smoke is a known cause of lung cancer.
Because smoking has potentially harmful effects, material and direct, on the public health, safety, welfare, and comfort, and on property of residents of the
village, it is necessary and desirable to establish regulations that prohibit smoking in all enclosed public places, in enclosed places of employment, near
entrances to all such public places and places of employment, in and near open air public dining areas, and within certain unenclosed public places
including school grounds, parks and recreation areas, and outdoor venues. (Ord. 2595, 12-4-2006)
7-9-2: PURPOSE:
This chapter may be cited as the RIVERSIDE SMOKE FREE AIR ACT, the purpose of which is to protect the public health and comfort and the
environment by prohibiting smoking in enclosed public places and places of employment, within twenty five feet (25') of all public entrances to such places,
in open air public dining areas and within twenty five feet (25') of such areas, and within certain unenclosed public places including school grounds, park
and recreation areas, to ensure that nonsmokers may breathe air free from the hazardous effects of secondhand smoke. (Ord. 2595, 12-4-2006)

The village manager is authorized and directed to plant, trim, spray, preserve and remove trees and shrubs within the lines of all streets, alleys and public
parks as may be necessary to ensure safety or preserve the beauty of such public grounds. The village manager may cause to be removed any tree,
shrub or part thereof which is in unsafe condition, or which by its nature is injurious to sewers or other public improvements, or is affected with any
injurious fungus, insect or other pest. (Ord. 1621, 11-19-1984)
8-5-6: DISEASED TREE REMOVAL:
(A) Any tree infected with Dutch elm disease or the emerald ash borer is declared to be a public nuisance and subject to abatement as such. No person
shall knowingly permit any tree so infected to remain on any lot or tract of land owned or controlled by such person. If such person fails to remove any
tree so infected within thirty (30) days after receipt of notice (in form as below prescribed) from the village manager or his designated representative,
directing such removal, the village may remove such tree at the expense of such person. (Ord. 2702, 3-16-2009)
(B) The cost of such diseased tree removal is a lien upon the real estate affected, superior to all other liens and encumbrances, except tax liens; provided
that notice has been given as hereinafter described, and further provided that within one year after such cost and expense is incurred the municipality,
or person performing the service by authority of the municipality in his own name, files notice of lien in the office of the recorder of deeds in the county
in which such real estate is located or in the office of the registrar of titles of such county if the real estate affected is registered under the torrens
system. The notice shall consist of a sworn statement setting out: 1) a description of the real estate sufficient for identification thereof, 2) the amount of
money representing the cost and expense incurred or payable for the service, and 3) the date or dates when such cost and expense was incurred by
the municipality. However, the lien of such municipality shall not be valid as to any purchaser whose rights in and to such real estate have arisen
subsequent to the tree removal and prior to the filing of such notice, and the lien of such municipality shall not be valid as to any mortgagee, judgment
creditor or other lienor whose rights in and to such real estate arise prior to filing of such notice. Upon payment of the cost and expense by the owner of
or persons interested in such property after notice of lien has been filed, the lien shall be released by the municipality or person in whose name the lien
has been filed and the release may be filed of record as in the case of filing notice of lien, at the sole cost and expense of the owner or person
interested in such property. (Ord. 2742, 3-1-2010)
(C) The cost of such tree removal shall not be a lien upon the real estate affected unless a notice shall be personally served or sent by registered mail to
the person to whom was sent the tax bill for the general taxes for the last preceding year on the property, such notice to be delivered or sent not less
than thirty (30) days prior to the removal of the tree or trees located thereon. The notice shall refer to and contain the substance of this section, and
shall identify the property by common description, and the tree or trees affected.
(D) Notwithstanding the foregoing, the village manager is further authorized and directed to contact the property owner having any tree infected, as
described in subsection (A) of this section and obtain from such owner permission to treat said infected tree with cacodylic acid and/or Sevin spray in
an effort to isolate and eliminate said tree as a breeding area and spreader of tree infection until such time as such tree has been removed in
accordance with this section. Permission from the property owner to so treat infected trees on private property must be obtained in writing together with
execution of the proper hold harmless and indemnification rights to the village covering the treatment of such tree or trees by village employees.
(E) If any property owner refuses to allow the village to remove such infected trees, the village shall obtain an order from the circuit court of Cook County
enjoining the owner from preventing the village from removing such trees. The costs of obtaining such an order shall be included with other costs of
removing such trees and become a part of the lien upon the real estate affected. (Ord. 2702, 3-16-2009)
8-5-7: COST SHARING TREE PLANTING PROGRAM:
There is hereby established a share the cost parkway tree planting program, to be administered by the village manager or his designated representative.
Said program shall be voluntary and shall involve the planting of parkway trees upon the parkways in front of residential properties within this village, at the
request of the residence owner and the payment, by the owner of fifty percent (50%) of the cost of said tree and the planting thereof; the remaining fifty
percent (50%) of the cost of said tree and the planting thereof to be borne by the village. No such parkway tree planting shall be undertaken under this
cost sharing program unless an amount to cover the village's portion of said cost has been first duly appropriated and the village has designated the
parkway areas to receive trees and the types of trees to be planted in such areas; nor shall such cost sharing program interfere with or otherwise restrict
the village from engaging in parkway tree planting separate and independent of resident owner participation. All such parkway trees planted pursuant to
this voluntary cost sharing program shall be and remain the property of the village. (Ord. 1816, 8-15-1988)

such meter, or, if necessary, the installation of a new meter as soon as may be practicable. Every water meter shall be subject to replacement, at the
expense of the respective owner, pursuant to a replacement schedule or program established from time to time by the Village Board.

relating to such account. The owner of the premises supplied shall be liable to pay for all water service charges, as well as any fees, charges, rates,
penalties, fines, obligations and liabilities relating to such account, whether such owner originally opened such account or assumed such account
upon the transfer of property ownership and irrespective of the water usage by each such owner. If more than one party has owned the premises

penalty. If the village treasurer determines that imposition of the particular charge, fee or late penalty is appropriate, the owner or occupant will have
ten (10) days following the hearing to pay such penalty in full. If, during the five (5) day period after the village treasurer's determination, the owner or
occupant disagrees with the determination, he may appeal the decision to the village manager. Failure to appeal within five (5) days shall cause the
decision of the village treasurer to become a final decision. The village manager shall review the evidence submitted at the previous hearing, and

1. The faithful performance by the permittee of all the requirements of this chapter;
2. Any expenditure, damage, or loss incurred by the village occasioned by the permittee's failure to comply with any codes, rules, regulations, orders,
permits and other directives of the village issued pursuant to this chapter; and
3. The payment by permittee of all liens and all damages, claims, costs, or expenses that the village may pay or incur by reason of any action or
nonperformance by permittee in violation of this chapter including, without limitation, any damage to public property or restoration work the permittee
is required by this chapter to perform that the village must perform itself or have completed as a consequence solely of the permittee's failure to
perform or complete, and all other payments due the village from the permittee pursuant to this chapter or any other applicable law.
(B) Form: The permittee shall provide the security fund to the village in the form, at the permittee's election, of cash, a surety bond in a form acceptable to
the village, or an unconditional letter of credit in a form acceptable to the village. Any surety bond or letter of credit provided pursuant to this subsection
shall, at a minimum:
1. Provide that it will not be canceled without prior notice to the village and the permittee;
2. Not require the consent of the permittee prior to the collection by the village of any amounts covered by it; and
3. Shall provide a location convenient to the village and within the state of Illinois at which it can be drawn.
(C) Amount: The dollar amount of the security fund shall be sufficient to provide for the reasonably estimated cost to restore the right of way to at least as
good a condition as that existing prior to the construction under the permit, as determined by the director of public works, and may also include
reasonable, directly related costs that the village estimates are likely to be incurred if the permittee fails to perform such restoration. Where the
construction of facilities proposed under the permit will be performed in phases in multiple locations in the village, with each phase consisting of
construction of facilities in one location or a related group of locations, and where construction in another phase will not be undertaken prior to
substantial completion of restoration in the previous phase or phases, the director of public works may, in the exercise of sound discretion, allow the
permittee to post a single amount of security which shall be applicable to each phase of the construction under the permit. The amount of the security
fund for phased construction shall be equal to the greatest amount that would have been required under the provisions of this subsection for any single
phase.
(D) Withdrawals: The village, upon fourteen (14) days' advance written notice clearly stating the reason therefor, and its intention to exercise withdrawal
rights under this subsection, may withdraw an amount from the security fund, provided that the permittee has not reimbursed the village for such
amount within the fourteen (14) day notice period. Withdrawals may be made if the permittee:

(E) Replenishment: Within fourteen (14) days after receipt of written notice from the village that any amount has been withdrawn from the security fund, the
permittee shall restore the security fund to the amount specified in subsection (C) of this section.
(F) Interest: If the security is held in the form of cash on escrow with the village, interest shall be based on actual interest rate earned, or five percent (5%)
per annum, whichever is less. The permittee may request that any and all interest accrued on the amount in the security fund be returned to the
permittee by the village, upon written request for said withdrawal to the village, provided that any such withdrawal does not reduce the security fund
below the minimum balance required in subsection (C) of this section.
(G) Closing And Return Of Security Fund: Upon completion of the work authorized under the permit, the permittee shall be entitled to the return of the
security fund, or such portion thereof as remains on deposit, within a reasonable time after account is taken for all offsets necessary to compensate the
village for failure by the permittee to comply with any provisions of this chapter or other applicable law. In the event of any revocation of the permit, the
security fund, and any and all accrued interest therein, shall become the property of the village to the extent necessary to cover any reasonable costs,
loss or damage incurred by the village as a result of said revocation; provided that, any amounts in excess of said costs, loss or damage shall be
refunded to the permittee.
(H) Rights Not Limited: The rights reserved to the village with respect to the security fund are in addition to all other rights of the village, whether reserved
by this chapter or otherwise authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of right with respect to said security fund shall affect any other
right the village may have. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the village shall not be entitled to a double monetary recovery with respect to any of its rights

unacceptable interference with a public safety agency's communications equipment. Unacceptable interference is determined by and measured in
accordance with industry standards and the FCC's regulations addressing unacceptable interference to public safety spectrum or any other spectrum
licenses by a public safety agency. If a small wireless facility causes such interference, and the wireless provider has been given written notice of the
interference by the public safety agency, the wireless provider, at its own expense, shall take all reasonable steps necessary to correct and eliminate
the interference, including, but not limited to, powering down the small wireless facility and later powering up the small wireless facility for intermittent
testing, if necessary. The Village may terminate a permit for a small wireless facility based on such interference if the wireless provider is not making a
good faith effort to remedy the problem in a manner consistent with the abatement and resolution procedures for interference with public safety
spectrum established by the FCC, including 47 CFR 22.970 through 47 CFR 22.973 and 47 CFR 90.672 through 47 CFR 90.675. The burden to
establish the good faith effort shall be on the wireless provider, which shall timely deliver to the Village all information necessary to demonstrate its
efforts to resolve the interference consistent with the Code of Federal Regulations sections cited above. Failure to remedy the interference as required
herein shall constitute a public nuisance and the small wireless facility may be abated through the procedures for abatement of such nuisances set
forth in this Code.
(B) Restrictions: A wireless provider shall not construct or maintain any small wireless facility that:
1. Obstructs, impedes or hinders the usual travel or public safety on a right-of-way;
2. Obstructs the legal use of right-of-way by utility users;
3. Violates nondiscriminatory applicable codes;
4. Violates or conflicts with chapter 10, "Construction Of Utility Facilities In Public Rights-Of-Way", of this title, or other applicable regulations set forth in
this Code or otherwise adopted by the Village, except to the extent such chapters, sections or regulations may be modified by the provisions of this
chapter; or
5. Violates the Federal Americans With Disabilities Act of 1990 (42 USC section 12101 et seq.).
(C) Contractual Requirements: Wireless providers shall comply with all requirements imposed by a contract between the Village and any private property
owner that concern design or construction standards applicable to utility poles and ground-mounted equipment located in the right-of-way.
(D) Ground-Mounted Equipment: Wireless providers shall comply with any ground mounted equipment spacing requirements within rights-of-way as set
forth in chapter 10, "Construction Of Utility Facilities In Public Rights-Of-Way", of this title, including subsection 8-10-15(H) of this title.
(E) Undergrounding:
1. Compliance: The wireless provider shall comply with Village Code provisions or regulations concerning undergrounding requirements, if any, that
prohibit the installation of new or the modification of existing utility poles or equipment in the right-of-way.
2. Waiver: A wireless provider may receive a waiver from the Director of Public Works or his or her designee to allow small wireless facilities to be
located above ground in an area where Village ordinances or regulations prohibit or restrict above ground facilities if the wireless provider can
establish that:
(a) Underground equipment is not technically feasible and there is no reasonable alternative or location that is more aesthetically favorable to
adjacent property owners and to effective use and management of the right-of-way; and
(b) An above ground small wireless facility at the proposed location is necessary at the proposed location to provide coverage in a specified area;

9-7-7: FINAL ADMINISTRATIVE HEARING:
(A) Notice: Unless the owner of the motor vehicle prevails at a preliminary vehicle impoundment hearing held pursuant to section 9-7-6 of this chapter, or

witnesses to appear and give testimony at the hearing. The formal rules of evidence will not apply at the hearing and hearsay evidence shall be
admissible if it is the type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs. If, after the hearing, the hearing officer
determines by a preponderance of the evidence that the motor vehicle, operated with the permission, express or implied of the owner, was properly
subject to towing and impoundment pursuant to this chapter, the hearing officer shall enter an order finding the owner of record of the motor vehicle
civilly liable to the village for an administrative fee in the amount of five hundred dollars ($500.00) (when authorized by section 9-7-2 of this chapter)
and requiring the vehicle to continue to be impounded until the owner, lessee or lienholder pays the administrative fee to the village, plus any applicable
towing and storage fees. If the owner of record fails to appear at the hearing, the hearing officer shall enter a default order in favor of the village, a copy
of which shall be sent to the registered owner, lessee and lienholder via certified mail, return receipt requested. If a cash bond or other acceptable form
of payment has been posted, that amount shall be applied to the amount owed. If the hearing officer finds by a preponderance of the evidence that the
vehicle was improperly towed and impounded pursuant to this chapter, the hearing officer shall order the immediate return of the owner's vehicle or
cash bond without fees. All orders entered by the hearing officer under this subsection shall be in writing.
(C) Liability For Administrative Fee And Costs: If an administrative fee is imposed pursuant to section 9-7-2 of this chapter, such fee shall constitute a debt
due and owing to the village. If a cash bond or other form of monetary payment acceptable to the village has been posted pursuant to this chapter,
such amount shall be applied to the administrative fee. If a vehicle has been impounded when such an administrative fee is imposed, the village may
seek to obtain a judgment on the debt and enforce such judgment against the vehicle as provided by law. Except as provided otherwise in this section,
a vehicle shall continue to be impounded until the administrative fee is paid to the village and any applicable towing and storage fees are paid to the
tower, in which case possession of the vehicle shall be given to the person who is legally entitled to possess the vehicle, or the vehicle is sold or
otherwise disposed of to satisfy a judgment to enforce a lien as provided by law. If the administrative fee and other applicable fees are not paid within
thirty five (35) days after an administrative fee is imposed against an owner of record who defaults by failing to appear at the hearing, the vehicle shall
be deemed unclaimed and shall be disposed of in the manner provided by law for the disposition of unclaimed vehicles. In all other cases, if the
administrative fee and other applicable fees are not paid within thirty five (35) days after the administrative hearing officer issues a written decision, the
vehicle shall be deemed unclaimed and shall be disposed of in the manner provided by law for the disposition of unclaimed vehicles under the Illinois
vehicle code.
(D) Vehicle Possession: Except as otherwise specifically provided by law or this chapter, no owner, lienholder, or other person shall be legally entitled to
take possession of a vehicle impounded under this chapter until the administrative fee and other applicable fees under this chapter have been paid in
full. However, whenever a person with a lien of record against an impounded vehicle has commenced foreclosure proceedings, possession of the
vehicle shall be given to that person if he or she agrees in writing to refund to the village the amount of the net proceeds of any foreclosure sale, less
any amounts required to pay all lienholders of record, not to exceed the administrative penalty, plus the applicable fees. (Ord. 2792, 3-5-2012)

the circuit court for the 1st judicial circuit, Cook County, Illinois, pursuant to the administrative review act, 735 Illinois Compiled Statutes 5/3-101 et seq., as
amended. Unless stayed by a court of competent jurisdiction, any fine, penalty, or administrative fee imposed under this chapter which remains unpaid in

(a) Because of a particular physical or other unusual condition of the specific property involved, a particular hardship or practical difficulty to the
owner would result, as distinguished from a mere inconvenience, if the strict letter of the regulations were to be carried out. Such conditions may
include, but are not limited to:
(1) The presence of an existing use or structure, whether conforming or nonconforming; irregular or substandard shape or size; exceptional
topographical features; or other extraordinary physical condition peculiar to and inherent in the subject property that amounts to more than a
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=610 392/519
mere inconvenience to the owner and that relate to or arises out of the lot and/or the structures thereon rather than the personal situation of the
current owner of the lot; or
(2) Situations in which the ordinance prevents the owner from reestablishing, restoring, or maintaining a material feature or significant architectural
feature related to the lot or structure, or from maintaining the architectural integrity of the lot or structure.
(b) The purpose of the variation is not based primarily upon a desire to increase financial gain;

(d) The conditions upon which the petition for variation is based would not be applicable generally to other property within the same zoning
classification;

which the property is located;
(f) The granting of the variation will not alter the essential character of the neighborhood; and
(g) The proposed variation will not impair an adequate supply of light or air to adjacent property or substantially increase the congestion of the public
streets, or increase the danger of fire, or impair natural drainage or create drainage problems on adjacent properties, or endanger the public
safety, or substantially diminish or impair property values within the neighborhood.

10-2-2-3: SPECIAL USES:
(A) Purpose: This zoning ordinance is based upon the division of the Village into districts, within which the uses of land, and the uses and bulk of buildings
and structures, are substantially uniform. However, there are special uses which, because of their unique characteristics, can only be properly
classified in any particular district or districts upon consideration in each case of the impact of those uses upon neighboring land and of the public need
for the particular use at the particular location. Such special uses fall into two (2) categories:
1. Uses publicly operated or traditionally affected with a public interest.
2. Uses entirely private in character, but of such an unusual nature that their operation may give rise to unique problems with respect to their impact
upon neighboring property, public facilities or the Village as a whole.
(B) Authority: Special use permits may be granted by the Village Board, but only in accordance with the requirements of this section. (Ord. 2550, 12-19-
2005)
(C) Application: An application for a special use permit shall be filed in triplicate with the Village Clerk, who shall forward a copy of the application to the
Planning and Zoning Commission without delay. The application shall be in such form, contain such information and be accompanied by such plans as
the Planning and Zoning Commission may by rule require.
(D) Public Hearing By Planning And Zoning Commission: The Planning and Zoning Commission shall hold a public hearing not more than sixty (60) days
after the filing of the application. Within sixty (60) days after the close of the hearing, unless the applicant shall have consented to a longer period, the
Planning and Zoning Commission shall transmit to the village board a written report giving its findings and recommendations for action to be taken by
the village board on the application. The report shall include any recommended conditions or restrictions to be imposed upon the premises benefited by
the special use permit.
(E) Notice: Notice of the time and place of such hearing shall be published at least once, not more than thirty (30) days nor less than fifteen (15) days
before the hearing, in a newspaper of general circulation in the village. The published notice may be supplemented by such additional form of notice as
the planning and zoning commission may provide by rule. (Ord. 2550, 12-19-2005; amd. Ord. 2843, 12-19-2013)
(F) Standards For Special Use Permit: No special use permit may be granted unless:
1. The proposed use is designated by this zoning ordinance as a special use in the district in which the use is to be located.
2. The proposed use will comply with all applicable regulations in the district in which the use is to be located.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=610 393/519
3. The location and size of the proposed use, the nature and intensity of the operation involved in or conducted in connection with it, the size of the site
in relation to it, and the location of the site with respect to streets giving access to it are such that it will be in harmony with the appropriate and
orderly development of the district in which it is located.
4. The location, nature and height of buildings, walls and fences, and the nature and extent of the landscaping on the site are such that the use will not
unreasonably hinder or discourage the appropriate development and use of adjacent land and buildings.
5. Parking areas will be of adequate size for the particular use, properly located and suitably screened from adjoining uses, and the entrance and exit
drives will be laid out so as to prevent traffic hazards and nuisances.
6. The proposed use will not cause substantial injury to the value of other property in the neighborhood.
7. At least one year has elapsed since any denial by the village board of any prior application for a special use permit that would have authorized
substantially the same use of all or part of the site, and conditions in the area have substantially changed. (Ord. 2550, 12-19-2005)
(G) Decision By Village Board:
1. The village board, within sixty (60) days of receipt of the report of the planning and zoning commission and without further public hearing, may grant
or deny any proposed special use in accordance with applicable statutes of the state of Illinois, or may refer it back to the planning and zoning
commission for further consideration. (Ord. 2550, 12-19-2005; amd. Ord. 2843, 12-19-2013)
2. The village board shall impose such conditions and restrictions upon the premises benefited by a special use permit as may be necessary to assure
compliance with the above standards, to reduce or minimize the effect of such permit upon other properties in the neighborhood, and to better carry
out the general intent of this zoning ordinance. Failure to comply with such conditions or restrictions shall constitute a violation of this zoning
ordinance.
(H) Effective Period: No special use permit shall be valid for a period longer than one hundred eighty (180) days from the date it is granted unless a
building permit or certificate of occupancy is obtained within such period and the erection or alteration of a building or other structure is started or the
use is commenced within such period. The village board may grant one extension of this period, valid for no more than one hundred eighty (180)
additional days, upon written application and good cause shown, without notice or hearing. If any special use is abandoned, or is discontinued for a
continuous period of one year, the special use permit for such use shall become void, and such use shall not thereafter be reestablished unless a new
special use permit is obtained.
(I) Fees: Application fee shall be as established by the village of Riverside. (Ord. 2550, 12-19-2005)
10-2-2-4: SITE PLAN REVIEW:
(A) Purpose: The site plan review process is hereby created to promote orderly development and redevelopment in the B1 and B2 districts and of multifamily
and townhouse uses in the R3 and R4 districts of Riverside, and to ensure that such development or redevelopment occurs in a manner
harmonious with surrounding properties, is consistent with village policies, further enhances the value of property, promotes the general welfare of the
village, and protects and enhances the village's national landmark district status.
This section sets forth standards to control the physical layout and/or use of a lot or a parcel of land in order to achieve the following purposes:
1. Compatibility of land uses, buildings and structures.
2. Protection and enhancement of community property values.
3. Mitigation of congestion, traffic and pedestrian safety hazards.
4. Maintenance of historic integrity.
5. Preservation of community character.
(B) Initiation: Applications for site plan review may be filed by the owner of, or any person having a right of ownership in, property located within the B1,
B2, R3 and R4 districts in the village.
(C) Applicability: A site plan review shall be required for all uses in the B1 and B2 districts and for multi-family and townhouse uses in the R3 and R4
districts as a condition of obtaining a building permit for all projects, except for those that only entail interior remodeling or improvements. For
development that is subject to review as a special use, the site plan review application may be reviewed by the planning and zoning commission at the
same time it reviews the request for a special use in accordance with section 10-2-2-3, "Special Uses", of this chapter.
(D) Procedure: The procedures for the site plan review of permitted and special uses are illustrated in appendix B of this zoning ordinance.
1. Preapplication Meeting: In order to receive direction from village staff prior to filing a concept plan, a preapplication meeting shall be held with village
staff at which the concept plan and other information about the proposed development is presented for staff comment. The applicant may also
request a preapplication meeting with the planning and zoning commission. Any comments, suggestions and input obtained at the preapplication
meeting with either village staff, or the planning and zoning commission, shall not constitute authority to proceed with any improvements or incur any
cost, nor obligate any officials or the planning and zoning commission to approve a subsequent site plan review application.
2. Optional Concept Plan:
(a) Purpose: A concept plan is a conceptual design for land development, prepared for informal review purposes, which does not carry any rights or
obligations to any parties. The purpose of the concept plan is to enable the applicant to obtain preliminary comments and suggestions from village
officials and the planning and zoning commission prior to spending considerable time and expense in the preparation and revision of detailed plans
and architectural drawings.

(b) Procedure:
(1) Application: In order to receive direction from the planning and zoning commission prior to submitting a final site plan review application, an
applicant may request a concept plan review meeting as described in subsection (D)2(b)(2) of this section. A concept plan shall be filed with the
village staff and shall contain those submission items outlined in appendix C1 of this zoning ordinance. No further action shall be taken on a
concept plan until village staff verifies that the submittal is deemed ready for review. Concept plans shall be forwarded to the planning and
zoning commission. Once village staff deems a concept plan submittal ready for review, they may forward such submittal to any outside
consultants hired by the village if necessary for a proper review of the application.
(2) Concept Plan Review Meeting: A concept plan review meeting shall be held to review the concept plan submittal within thirty (30) days of
village staff verification that the submittal is ready for review. The concept plan review meeting shall include the planning and zoning
commission, village staff, village manager, zoning administrator, building commissioner and village consultants, who shall review the concept
plan and provide comments and suggestions regarding compatibility with the village plan, general land use standards, this zoning ordinance and
other applicable ordinances. No official acts shall be taken at the concept plan review meeting. The concept plan review meeting shall be an
open meeting, for discussion purposes only.
(3) Comments And Suggestions: After the conclusion of the concept plan review meeting, an itemized list of comments and suggestions from the
planning and zoning commission shall be presented to the applicant at the next scheduled planning and zoning commission meeting or within
thirty (30) days.
Any comments, suggestions and input regarding the concept plan shall not constitute authority to proceed with any improvements or incur any
cost, nor obligate the planning and zoning commission or any officials to approve the subsequent site plan review application. No comments,
suggestions and input regarding the concept plan shall be deemed approval of a subsequent site plan review application. Nothing herein shall
prohibit the applicant from submitting a site plan review application to the planning and zoning commission for consideration.
(4) Relief: No requests for relief from the provisions of this zoning ordinance shall be sought until the planning and zoning commission presents the
comments and suggestions to the applicant as described in subsection (D)2(b)(3), "Comments And Suggestions", of this section.
(5) Formal Application: Once the applicant has received the comments and suggestions from the planning and zoning commission, the applicant
may submit a final site plan review application.

(H) Amendment To Approved Site Plans:
1. Application: An application for an amendment to an approved site plan shall be submitted to village staff. Once reviewed for completeness, village
staff shall forward the complete amendment application to the planning and zoning commission for consideration and approval. Amendment
applications shall include a written description of the proposed change, including the reason for such change, and a notation of the location on the
approved site plan. Village staff or the planning and zoning commission may determine that a proposed amendment to an approved site plan
requires submittal of a revised site plan for proper evaluation. Such revised site plan shall only include those components of the site plan submittal
impacted by the proposed change. Until such revised site plan is submitted, the amendment application shall not be considered complete. Nothing
within this section shall prevent an applicant from submitting a revised site plan with the amendment application at the time of initial submission.
2. Determination Of Type Of Change: Upon receipt of a complete application and using the following criteria, the zoning administrator shall determine,
within five (5) business days, whether the proposed amendment constitutes a minor or major change to an approved site plan. Major changes to an

(f) A change in the number and/or location of accesses to public streets or alleys.
(g) A change in excess of one foot (1') in the location of walkways, vehicle circulation ways and parking areas, or exterior building or structure walls.
(h) A change to the landscape plan that results in a reduction in the net amount of plant material or in the approved species. Changes to the
landscape plan, which do not result in a reduction in the net amount of plant material, violate the landscaping requirements of this zoning
ordinance, or use of a species not on the recommended plant list, shall be considered a minor change and may be approved by the planning and
zoning commission as a minor change to an approved site plan.
3. Minor Change Amendment:
(a) The zoning administrator may review and approve amendment applications for minor changes to approved site plans. The zoning administrator,
within five (5) business days of receiving the complete amendment application, shall review and decide on the application, unless a revised site
plan is required as described in subsection (H)1, "Application", of this section.
(b) If the zoning administrator does not approve the amendment application or determines that the proposed change to an approved site plan
constitutes a major change, such amendment application must be submitted to the full planning and zoning commission in accordance with the
procedures for a major change to an approved site plan.
(c) The zoning administrator may also, at his/her discretion, determine that a proposed change to an approved site plan constitutes a major change
and, as such, must be submitted to the full planning and zoning commission in accordance with the procedures for a major change to an approved
site plan.

scale that is compatible with the existing size and scale of buildings in residential neighborhoods.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=610 399/519
(B) Bulk Table: Table 3, "Residential Districts Bulk Requirements", of this chapter contains the bulk and yard requirements for the residential districts.
(C) Building Height Setback Plane: In addition to the general height restrictions in table 3 of this chapter, all buildings on any lot within the R1-AA, R1-A or
R2 district shall be subject to, and shall comply with, the following building height setback plane restrictions. (See figure 1, "Building Height Setback
Plane", of this section.)
1. No portion of a building on an R1-AA district lot shall intersect the planes that begin at a point seventeen and one-half feet (17.5') above grade on
the side lot line and run at a forty five degree (45°) angle toward the interior of the lot until they reach the maximum building height permitted. Since a
corner lot is defined by two (2) street lot lines, the setback plane shall be defined between the side lot line and the street lot line of the longer lot width
that is opposite the side lot line.
2. No portion of a building on an R1-A or R2 district lot shall intersect the planes that begin at a point twenty feet (20') above grade in the R1-A and R2
districts on the side lot line and run at a forty five degree (45°) angle toward the interior of the lot until they reach the maximum building height
permitted. Since a corner lot is defined by two (2) street lot lines, the setback plane shall be defined between the side lot line and the street lot line of
the longer lot width that is opposite the side lot line.
3. Dormers and gable ends may extend into and through the height setback plane, but must comply with the building height restrictions of this section.

https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=610 400/519
Note:
1. For reference, building height is measured from the top of the foundation of an existing building at the center point of the front door, or from a
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=610 401/519
point 3 feet above existing grade at the center point of the front door, whichever is lower, to the highest point of a flat roof or parapet, to the deck
line of a mansard roof, and to the mean point between the eaves and the ridge of a gable, hip or gambrel roof. Additional information on building
height measurement, including measurement for lots without an existing building, can be found in the definition of "building height" in chapter 11,
"Definitions", of this zoning ordinance. Note that in figure 1, the heights indicated (38 feet in R1-AA and R1-A, 35 feet in the R2) indicate height
to the peak of a pitched roof.
(Ord. 2550, 12-19-2005)
(D) Method For Measuring Street Yards: (See figure 2, "Measuring Street Yards", of this subsection.)
1. Purpose And Intent: The variability of residential setbacks from streets is identified as a noteworthy historic characteristic of Riverside and a valuable
aspect of the Village's status as a National Register Historic Landscape District. Therefore, the Village desires to maintain this variability and not
allow it to be diminished over time, as new construction and additions to existing homes are proposed. Therefore, any yard abutting a street is
defined as the "street yard".
2. Minimum Street Yard: The minimum street yard on each lot shall be the narrowest dimension as measured from a point on the street lot line to the
principal building, as determined by the foundation of said building, which shall not include porches (enclosed or unenclosed) or stoops. On corner or
irregularly shaped lots, there will be a minimum street yard for each street. The minimum street yard shall be measured from each street lot line to
the closest point of the foundation of the principal building, which shall not include porches (enclosed or unenclosed) or stoops, adjacent to such
street. The street yard dimension shall be established through a plat of survey or, where a plat of survey is not available, in one of the following
manners as applicable:
(a) WPA Survey: The street yard dimension shall be the closest dimension indicated on the Works Progress Administration (WPA) House Setback
Survey, as surveyed between 1936 and 1953. This survey is available from the Village Building Department or where the WPA House Setback
Survey does not indicate a street yard dimension, as defined herein, or the dimension indicated on the WPA House Setback Survey is not current
or considered accurate by either the Village or the property owner, the street yard dimension may be identified on a new plat of survey, prepared
by a surveyor, licensed by the State of Illinois. The expense of the new survey shall be borne by the property owner.
(b) Demolished Structure: When a structure within the residential districts is demolished, the demolition permit shall indicate the dimension of the
street yard before demolition. If there is no survey showing the demolished structure and there is no street yard dimension indicated on the WPA
map, the street yard shall be that which is indicated on the demolition permit as the prior structure's street yard dimension.
(c) Vacant Lot: In the event of a vacant lot where no street yard dimension is indicated on the WPA map and, because the vacancy is not a result of
the circumstances described in subsection (D)2(b) of this section, there is no existing home to survey to establish a street yard dimension as
required in subsection (D)2(a) of this section, the minimum required street yard shall be the average depth of street yards already established
along that particular block.
(d) Exceptions:
(1) In cases where the street yard, as established, is set back from the street lot line so that the rear yard requirement is not met, the street yard
requirement may be reduced to accommodate the required rear yard, provided that the permitted building coverage and impervious surface
requirements for the zoning district are not violated.
(2) In cases where maintaining the existing building line along the street frontage and meeting the required side and rear yard requirements, as set
forth in this section, shall result in a building coverage on the lot that is less than the thirty percent (30%) permitted, the Building Department
shall review the proposed building or addition and allow for a reduced street yard to permit the lot to meet the maximum building coverage,
provided all other yard and coverage requirements are met.
(3) Existing eaves may encroach into the required street yard, and may be restored, reconstructed or replaced in a required street yard to their
existing measurement.
(4) Existing porches may encroach into a required street yard in front of the foundation of the principal building, and may be restored,
reconstructed or replaced in a required street yard in conformance with section 10-7-3 of this zoning ordinance.

(E) Method For Measuring Rear Yards: (See figure 3, "Measuring Rear Yards", of this subsection.)
1. In all cases, the dimension of the minimum rear yard shall be twenty five percent (25%) of lot depth. This dimension shall be determined by
measuring from the deepest point of the rear lot line to the street lot line.
2. On an interior lot, the rear yard shall be measured from that lot line that is most distant from, and parallel to, the street lot line.
3. On a pie shaped or irregularly shaped lot, the rear yard shall be measured from a chord that is a minimum of ten feet (10') in length and parallel to
the narrowest street lot line.
4. Corner lots shall have only one rear yard. This rear yard shall be opposite the narrowest street lot line.

(H) Exception To Yard Location For Townhouse And Multi-Family Development In R-3 And R-4 Districts:
1. In the case of a townhouse or multi-family development in the R3 or R4 district located on a corner lot, the street lot line used to determine the
location of the rear yard shall be the longer street lot line only if the development is designed with the majority of the front facade of the development
facing the longer street lot line. In such case, the interior side lot line shall be that opposite the shorter street lot line. (See figure 4A of this section.)
2. To determine the required dimensions of the rear yard and interior side yard, "lot depth" for the rear yard shall be measured from the longer street lot
line to the rear lot line, and "lot width" shall be measured from the shorter street lot line to the interior side lot line. (See figure 4A of this section.)
3. Street yards shall be as required by this section.
4. However, to determine compliance with the minimum lot width and lot frontage requirements of the district, as required by table 3, "Residential
Districts Bulk Requirements", of this chapter in which the lot is located, the shortest street frontage of the lot shall be used, in accordance with the
measurement methods established for lot frontage and lot width by this section.

Notes:
1. At the time a building permit is requested, a property owner shall be required to submit a survey prepared by a licensed surveyor that indicates the lot
area that is occupied by all buildings, structures and paved surfaces, in order to enable the Village to determine the proposed building coverage and
impervious surface. This survey shall be accompanied by the proposed percentage of both "building coverage" and "impervious surface", as defined by
this zoning ordinance.
2. An appurtenance within the residential districts must meet building height with the exception of a tower. A special use permit is required for a tower that
exceeds the permitted building height in the residential districts.
3. Those structures in the Residential Districts (R1-AA, R1-A, R2, R3 and R4) that exceed the height limitations of this chapter and this table, as of the
date of adoption hereof, shall be deemed to be conforming in terms of height. Any additions or enlargements to such structures shall be in conformance
with the requirements of this chapter.
4. Existing lots of record indicated on the WPA map as meeting the required lot frontage for the district in which they are located, but do not meet such
requirement when surveyed, shall be deemed conforming if they are within 2 inches of the required lot frontage for that district. Those existing lots of
record indicated on the WPA map that have a lot frontage dimension within 2 inches of the required lot frontage for that district shall also be deemed
conforming. All new lots created through subdivision must meet the lot frontage and lot width requirements. However, when the lot frontage of an existing
lot of record indicated on the WPA map is sufficient to subdivide the lot into 2 or more conforming lots, in compliance with the regulations of the district in
which they are located, but such lot of record does not meet the lot frontage requirement when surveyed, such lot may be subdivided as evenly as
possible between the new lots and the lot frontage of each new lot must be within 2 inches of the required lot frontage. Such new lots, so long as they
meet these requirements, shall be deemed conforming.

Chapter 5
BUSINESS DISTRICTS
10-5-1: PURPOSE AND INTENT:
(A) B1 Business District: The B1 business district is intended to create a business environment for a variety of commercial uses, including retail goods
establishments, personal service establishments and office uses, designed to provide for the needs of local residents and enhance the economic
vitality of the community. Areas within this district should have access to major streets and provide a safe environment for pedestrian traffic.
(B) B2 Business District: The purpose and intent of the B2 central business district is to sustain the economic viability of the Riverside central business
district by preserving its historic character and allowing for compatible redevelopment. It is intended that the mixed use, small scale, and pedestrian
oriented character associated with the B2 central business district will be strengthened through improvements to existing properties and new infill
development that is consistent with its distinct historic scale, architecture and landscape architecture. The desired mix of uses shall consist of retail,
service and limited office establishments on the ground floor, with office and residential above the ground floor. Development shall be carefully
controlled to protect neighboring residential properties from impact, while at the same time permitting needed revitalization. (Ord. 2701, 3-3-2009)
10-5-2: B1 BUSINESS DISTRICT SUBDISTRICTS:
Because different areas of the B1 business district have differing intensities of use, physical characters and functions, the village of Riverside has identified
two (2) subdistricts each with its own set of allowable uses and bulk and yard regulations, as identified in table 4, "Business Districts Permitted Uses", of
this chapter. The subdistricts are identified on the B1 business district subdistrict map included as appendix H of this zoning ordinance. Each subdistrict is
described as follows:
(A) B1 Commercial Subdistrict: B1 commercial (B1-C) subdistrict is intended to create a commercial environment for a variety of retail goods
establishments, personal service establishments and office uses, which are typically oriented toward vehicular access and may be located within retail
centers, as well as mixed use development with residential uses permitted above the ground floor only.
(B) B1 Transitional Commercial Subdistrict: B1 transitional commercial (B1-TC) subdistrict is intended as a transitional area, where low intensity retail
goods establishments, personal service establishments and office uses, as well as multi-family and townhouse dwellings, transition to surrounding
single-family neighborhoods. (Ord. 2701, 3-3-2009)
10-5-3: B2 CENTRAL BUSINESS DISTRICT SUBDISTRICTS:
Because various areas of the central business district have differing mixes of uses, physical character and functions, the village of Riverside has identified
three (3) subdistricts, each with its own set of allowable uses, as identified in table 4, "Business Districts Permitted Uses", of this chapter. The subdistricts
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=610 410/519
are identified on the central business district boundary map included as appendix A of this zoning ordinance. The general mix of uses within each
subdistrict is described as follows:
(A) Retail Core: In an effort to encourage a "critical mass" of retail and service uses conveniently located to serve the village, the retail core allows retail,
service and limited office uses on the ground floor. Office and residential uses are encouraged above the ground floor, but the village may permit a
greater percentage of office uses on the ground floor, subject to approval as a special use.
(B) Mixed Use Periphery: The mixed use periphery accommodates existing residential uses that surround and support the retail core. The village
encourages continued maintenance of these existing residential uses and establishment of additional new medium density residential uses in this
subdistrict. In addition, the village may permit retail, service and office uses on the ground floor, and office uses above the ground floor, subject to
approval as a special use.
(C) Public Use Zone: The public use zone, located at the heart of the village, significantly contributes to the unique historic identity and character of
Riverside. The public use zone contains a significant number of public historic landmark buildings. It is intended that the public use zone continue to
accommodate existing public and quasi-public uses centrally located to serve Riverside residents. It is intended that these properties remain in public
and quasi-public use. In addition, the village may permit retail, service and professional office uses that are accessory to public and quasi-public uses
or compatible restaurant uses, subject to approval as a special use. (Ord. 2701, 3-3-2009)
10-5-4: USES:
(A) Purpose And Intent: The purpose and intent of the use standards is to encourage a mix of compatible uses in the business districts that will serve
village residents, commuters and the surrounding region. The range of permissible uses is intended to enhance the village's tax base, without
adversely affecting neighboring properties.
(B) Use Table: Table 4, "Business Districts Permitted Uses", of this chapter lists permitted and special uses for the B1 and B2 districts.
(C) Special Allowable Uses In The B2 District:
1. Special Allowable Commercial Uses In The B2 District: Due to the relative size of their respective private capital investment as of the date of the
establishment of the B2 district, all existing commercial uses in the B2 district, which would otherwise be nonconforming including, but not limited to,
the following uses at their respective locations, are hereby declared to be special allowable uses:
Type Of Use Permanent Real Estate Tax Number Address
Auto repair shop (Riverside Garage) 15-35-405-034-0000 18 East Ave.

Metal works and craftsmanship (Riverside Works) 15-36-302-056-0000 39 E. Quincy Rd.
2. Special Allowable Residential Uses In The B2 District: Due to the long standing residential nature of particular properties as of the date of
establishment of the B2 district, all single-family residential uses in the B2 district, which would otherwise be nonconforming at their respective
locations, are hereby declared to be special allowable uses, provided that they shall conform with the applicable R1-AA, R1-A, R2, R3 or R4
standards that had been in effect as of the date of the establishment of the B2 central business district:
Type Of Use Permanent Real Estate Tax Number Address
Single-family residential 15-36-301-035-0000 48 E. Quincy Rd.

Single-family residential 15-36-108-039-0000 36 Forest
Residential/office or residential 15-36-108-038-0000 24 Woodside
3. Status Of Special Allowable Uses In The B2 District: Such special allowable uses shall be considered to be permitted for all purposes of this zoning
ordinance, including the right of the present and future owners to be allowed to continue to maintain such uses, rebuild any building to original size in
the event of any partial or complete destruction, and to renovate or expand in compliance with all applicable provisions of this zoning ordinance,
notwithstanding that such use of the premises would not otherwise be permitted in the B2 district. The above listed uses will lose their status as a
special allowable use if one of the following occurs: a) if they are converted to a permitted use; b) if any of the special allowable uses are left vacant
or abandoned for a period of one year; or c) in the event of destruction of fifty percent (50%) or more of the total square footage of the building and/or
structure, as determined by the fire department, by fire or by any means not within the control of the property owner, unless a building permit is
acquired for its repair or replacement within a period of one year. (Ord. 2701, 3-3-2009)
10-5-5: BULK REQUIREMENTS:
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=610 411/519
(A) Purpose And Intent: The purpose and intent of the bulk requirements is to ensure that buildings are appropriately located on a site and of a size that is
compatible with the size and scale of existing buildings in the business districts and surrounding residential properties.
(B) Bulk Table:
1. Table 5, "B1 District Bulk Requirements", of this chapter contains the bulk and yard requirements for the B1 district. Interior side yard requirements

interior side lot lines. The setback along the opposite interior side lot line shall be of appropriate width to accommodate a driveway for access to a rear
parking area. However, a building may be built at both interior side lot lines if it meets the criteria of subsection (C)1, "Buildings Built To Both Interior
Side Lot Lines", of this section. In addition, the parking access requirements of subsection (C)2, "Parking Access Requirements", of this section and
the design standards of subsection (C)3, "Design Standards", of this section shall be met.
1. Buildings Built To Both Interior Side Lot Lines: A building may be built at both interior side lot lines if it meets one of the following two (2) criteria:
(a) The building proposed to be built at both interior side lot lines shall share access to its rear parking area through the use of a driveway on another
property within the B1-TC subdistrict. Permission to build at both interior side lot lines shall only be allowed if the shared driveway agreement is
approved by the owners of each lot and creates a perpetual easement along and across the driveway. The driveway agreement shall be recorded
and the resulting perpetual easement shall be recorded as a shared driveway easement on each plat of survey.

facades shall be designed with elements of a front facade, including doors and/or windows.
4. Where a front wall or rear wall of a row of townhouses or multiple-family residential buildings faces the front or rear wall of another row of
townhouses or multiple-family residential buildings, the minimum required separation between such buildings shall be thirty feet (30'). Driveways and
parking areas may be located within this minimum separation area. The minimum separation at the ground floor may be reduced to twenty feet (20')
for interior drives with garage doors facing garage doors, provided that the upper story living spaces comply with the thirty foot (30') separation
requirements.
5. Private yards a minimum of two hundred (200) square feet in area shall be required for each townhouse dwelling unit. This private yard may be

(I) Wireless Telecommunications Facility:
1. Purpose And Intent: It is the general purpose and intent of the village to carry out the will of the United States congress by authorizing
communication facilities needed to operate personal wireless telecommunication systems. It is the further purpose and intent of the village of
Riverside to provide for such authorization in a manner which will retain the integrity of residential neighborhoods and the character, property values
and aesthetic quality of the community at large. In particular, these standards attempt to address issues of demand, visual mitigation, engineering,
residual impacts, and facility design so as to minimize, to the extent possible, the amount of aesthetic degradation, property devaluation, and safety
implications related to the siting of such facilities. In fashioning and administering the provisions of this section, an attempt has been made to balance
these potentially competing interests.
Recognizing the number of providers authorized to establish and operate personal wireless telecommunication services and facilities, it is the further
purpose and intent of this section to:
(a) Promote the public health, safety and welfare.
(b) Facilitate adequate and efficient provision of sites for personal wireless telecommunication facilities.
(c) Ensure that wireless telecommunication facilities are situated in appropriate locations and relationships to other land uses, structures and
buildings.
(d) Limit inappropriate physical and aesthetic overcrowding of land use activities and avoid adverse impacts upon existing infrastructure systems,
and other public services and facility needs.
(e) Allow the village board to regulate and restrict personal wireless telecommunications facilities and services as special uses.
(f) Allow the village board to permit personal wireless telecommunication facilities as special uses at site locations on a priority basis, subject to
applicable standards and conditions.
(g) Recognize that operation of a personal wireless telecommunication system may, in the opinion of the applicant, require the establishment of
facilities in locations not within the higher priority areas. In such cases, it has been determined that it is likely that there will be greater adverse
impact upon neighborhoods within the community. Consequently, more stringent standards and conditions should apply to the review, approval
and use of such facilities.
(h) Provide for adequate information about plans for personal wireless telecommunications facilities in order to permit the village to effectively plan
for the location of such facilities.
(i) Minimize the adverse impacts of technological obsolescence of such facilities, including a requirement to remove unused and/or unnecessary
facilities in a timely manner.
(j) Minimize the negative visual impact of personal wireless telecommunications facilities on neighborhoods, community landmarks, historic sites and
buildings, public open space, and public rights of way. This contemplates the establishment of as few structures as reasonably feasible, and the
use of structures which are designed for compatibility, including the use of existing structures and the avoidance of lattice structures that are
unnecessary, taking into consideration the purposes and intent of this section.
(k) The village board finds that the presence of numerous tower structures, particularly if located within residential areas, would decrease the
attractiveness and destroy the character and integrity of the community. This, in turn, would have an adverse impact upon property values.
Therefore, it is necessary to minimize the adverse impact from the presence of numerous relatively tall tower structures having low architectural
and other aesthetic appeal to most persons, recognizing that the absence of regulation would result in a material impediment to the maintenance
and promotion of property values, and further recognizing that this economic component is an important part of the public health, safety and
welfare.
2. Permitted Locations:
(a) Special Uses: In all circumstances, a new personal wireless telecommunication facility shall be deemed a special use, subject to the general
special use standards and procedures set forth in section 10-2-2-3, "Special Uses", of this zoning ordinance.
(b) Priority Of Sites: To minimize the adverse visual impact of personal wireless telecommunications service facilities, such facilities will be permitted
as special uses only in the following order of preference for locating new facilities. If lower priority locations are requested, the applicant may be
required to provide engineering data certified by the appropriate Illinois licensed professional, or other information the village deems necessary, to
demonstrate to the satisfaction of the village board, that the use of a higher priority location is not technically, or otherwise, feasible, and that the
requested location is a matter of engineering necessity. In addition to the special use requirements, all facilities shall be subject to the conditions
set forth below, and, if approved, constructed and maintained in accordance with the standards and conditions of this section.

5. Collocation: It is the policy of the village of Riverside to minimize the overall number of newly established locations for wireless telecommunication
facilities and wireless telecommunications support structures within the community, and encourage the use of existing structures for attached
wireless telecommunications facility purposes, consistent with the statement of purpose and intent, set forth in subsection (I)1 of this section. Each
licensed provider of a wireless telecommunication facility must, by law, be permitted to locate sufficient facilities in order to achieve the objectives
promulgated by the United States congress. However, particularly in light of the dramatic increase in the number of wireless telecommunication
facilities reasonably anticipated to occur as a result of the change of federal law and policy in and relating to the federal telecommunications act of
1996, it is the policy of the village that all users should collocate on attached wireless telecommunication facilities and wireless telecommunication
support structures in the interest of achieving the purposes and intent of this section, as stated above, and as stated in subsection (I)1 of this section.
If a provider fails or refuses to permit collocation on a facility owned or otherwise controlled by it, where collocation is feasible, the result will be that a
new and unnecessary additional structure will be constructed in direct violation of, and in direct contradiction to, the basic policy, intent and purpose
of the village of Riverside. The provisions of this section are designed to carry out and encourage conformity with this policy.
(a) Feasibility Of Collocation: Collocation shall be deemed to be "feasible" for purposes of this section where all of the following are met:
(1) The wireless telecommunications provider entity under consideration for collocation will provide fair compensation for collocation.
(2) The site on which collocation is being considered, taking into consideration reasonable modification or replacement of a facility, is able to
provide structural support.
(3) The collocation being considered is technologically feasible, e.g., the collocation will not result in unreasonable interference, given appropriate
physical and other adjustment in relation to the structure, antennas and the like.
(4) The height of the structure necessary for collocation shall not exceed the maximum height identified under subsection (I)3(c), "Maximum Height
For A New Wireless Telecommunications Support Structure", of this section, unless authorized by the village board.
(b) Requirements For Collocation:
(1) A special land use permit for the construction and use of a new wireless telecommunication support structure shall not be granted unless and
until the applicant demonstrates that a feasible collocation is not available for the coverage area and capacity needs.
(2) All new and modified wireless telecommunication support structures shall be designed and constructed so as to accommodate collocation.
Prior to issuance of a special use permit for a new support structure, the applicant shall provide a notarized letter signed by the applicant
representing and warranting that the personal wireless telecommunication support structure is structurally designed to accommodate at least
one additional antenna for one future user, and that if approached by a second user, the applicant will permit collocation if fairly compensated. A
structural engineer's certification shall address the silhouette and structural integrity of the proposed support structure for use and occupancy by
at least two (2) users. Noncompliance with this provision may be grounds for revoking the special use permit.
6. Removal Of Wireless Telecommunication Facilities:
(a) All providers with facilities within the village shall notify the village, in a timely manner, when a facility is no longer in operation.
(b) All wireless telecommunication providers with facilities in the village of Riverside shall be required to submit an annual status report to the village
that describes the current operational and maintenance status of the facilities and any planned changes or modifications to the structure or site, or
ownership, lease or maintenance agreement. The village shall have the discretion to charge the applicant a fee for review of the annual status
report.
(c) A condition of every approval of a wireless telecommunication facility shall be adequate provision for removal of all or part of the facility by users
and owners.
(d) Provisions for removal shall be made if the facility has not been used for one hundred eighty (180) days or more. For purposes of this section, the
removal of antennas or other equipment from the facility, or the cessation of operations (transmission and/or reception of radio signals) shall be
considered as the beginning of a period of nonuse.
(e) The situation in which removal of a facility is required, as set forth in subsection (I)6(c) of this section, may be applied and limited to portions of a
facility.
(f) Upon the occurrence of the event requiring removal, specified in subsection (I)6(c) of this section, the property owner or persons who had used
the facility shall immediately apply or secure the application for any required demolition or removal permits, and immediately proceed with and
complete the demolition/removal, restoring the premises to its prior condition as reasonably determined by the Village Board.
(g) If the required removal of a facility or a portion thereof has not been lawfully completed sixty (60) days after the applicable deadline, and after at
least thirty (30) days' written notice, the Village of Riverside may remove or secure the removal of the facility or required portions thereof, with its
actual cost and reasonable administrative charge to be drawn or collected and/or enforced from or under the cash bond or letter of credit posted at
the time application was made for establishing the facility. (Ord. 2550, 12-19-2005)

landscaping that will aid in blending the system into the natural setting and existing environment.
9. Wiring And Piping: All exterior electrical and plumbing lines for solar energy systems shall be placed in a conduit or copper piping, shall be installed
underground or contained within a raceway that complements the building materials of the principal structure, and shall otherwise comply with all
other village requirements relative to electrical or plumbing lines.
10. Plans: Plans submitted to the building inspector as a requirement for the issuance of a building permit for any solar energy system shall indicate all
existing and proposed grading, excavating, filling, paving, fencing and screening as it may relate to the proposed system, shall indicate the location
of all property lines and neighboring buildings, and shall comply with the requirements and standards of this section.
11. Visibility, Design And Impact Preferences: Installation of solar energy systems in a manner that minimizes their visibility from public rights of way
and the aesthetic impact of such systems is strongly encouraged but not required where such installation will impair the functional integrity and
viability of a system. Persons installing solar energy systems should investigate all feasible alternative locations for placement of a solar energy
system on a building or site so as to minimize the visual and other impacts of the system on the building and site and in order to minimize the
visibility of solar energy systems from the public right of way and are encouraged to install solar energy systems in a manner that will not
compromise the character of the structure and site or the surrounding neighborhood. Further guidance on minimizing the impacts of solar energy
system installation is set forth in subsection (M) of this section.
(E) Building And Roof Mounted Solar Energy Systems:
1. Permitted: Building and roof mounted solar energy systems and their related solar collectors are permitted on both principal and accessory
structures in the following locations:
(a) Any portion of the principal roof of a building;
(b) Any roof surface on the side or rear of a building;
(c) Side and rear building facades; and
(d) Front or corner building facades, if the applicant obtains a special use permit pursuant to subsection (I) of this section and section 10-2-2-3 of this
zoning ordinance.
2. Area And Protrusion: The installation area of solar energy systems may not be greater than the roof section where the solar energy system shall be
mounted. All roof mounted solar collectors shall be positioned within the field of the roof plane, and shall not protrude over any edges or overhang of
the roof.
3. Orientation: Solar collectors may be angled to maximize solar access. Where installed solar collectors vary from the pitch/angle of the roof on which
the solar energy system is mounted, however, they shall not be visible from the public right of way, excluding public alleys, and except for flat roof
installations subject to subsection (E)8 of this section.
4. Projection: Solar collectors shall not project more than four feet (4') from a building facade or roof plane where not visible from a public right of way
and shall not project more than twelve inches (12") from a building facade or roof plane where visible from a public right of way, excluding public
alleys. Solar collectors visible from a public right of way and placed on awnings or otherwise used to simultaneously shade a structure's windows
may extend beyond twelve inches (12"), except that where such placement is on a front or corner building facade, placement is subject to a special
use permit pursuant to subsection (I) of this section and section 10-2-2-3 of this zoning ordinance.
5. Extension Beyond Peak Of Roof: Solar collectors shall not extend vertically above the highest peak of a pitched roof.
6. Setback Encroachment: Solar collectors may project into a side or rear setback, but shall be no closer than five feet (5') to the side or rear property
line. Solar collectors may not project into front, corner side or street yards, except where approved as a special use on front or corner building
facades pursuant to subsection (I) of this section and section 10-2-2-3 of this zoning ordinance.
7. Height Limitation: Solar collectors shall not project higher than the permitted building height without a zoning variation.
8. Flat Roof Installations: Solar energy systems may be installed on a flat roof provided they do not project more than ten feet (10') above the flat roof
on which they are installed, as measured from the roof base to the highest edge of the system. Flat roof installations shall be placed as far back on
the roof as possible so as to limit their visibility from the public right of way.
(F) Ground Mounted (Freestanding) Solar Energy Systems:
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=610 440/519
1. Permitted Yards: Ground mounted solar energy systems are permitted only in the rear and interior side yards.
2. Setback: The setback for ground mounted solar energy systems shall be five feet (5') from any lot line in the permitted yards as measured from the
lot line to the closest portion of the system, and shall not be located in any utility, water, sewer or other type of public easement.
3. Screening: The view of ground mounted solar energy systems from the public right of way shall be limited through the use of architectural features,
earth berms, fencing, a landscaped combination of evergreen and deciduous plants, or other screening which will harmonize with the character of
the property and surrounding area.
4. Height: Ground mounted solar energy systems shall not exceed a height of ten feet (10') above the ground, as measured from the average grade at
the base to the highest edge of the system.
(G) Maintenance, Repair, Abandonment And Removal:
1. Maintenance: All solar energy systems must be maintained in good repair and operable condition at all times, including compliance with all
standards in applicable building and technical codes to ensure structural and technical integrity of such systems, except for maintenance and repair
outages.
2. Repair: If a solar energy system becomes inoperable or damaged, operations must cease and prompt repairs must be made.
3. Notification: If the village determines that a solar energy system fails to comply with the applicable provisions of this section or appears to have been
abandoned, the village shall provide written notification to the property owner. The owner shall have a period of ninety (90) days from the date of
notification to either restore the solar energy system to operation or remove the system.
4. Enforcement: In the event the system is not removed or brought into compliance within the specified time period following notification, the village
may pursue any and all available legal remedies to ensure that a solar energy system which fails to comply with this and other applicable codes, or
which constitutes a danger to persons or property, is removed or brought into compliance.
5. No Waiver: Any delay by the village in taking enforcement action against the owner shall not waive the village's right to take any action at a later
time. The village may seek to have a solar energy system removed at the owner's expense regardless of the owner's intent for such system, and
regardless of any permits that may have been issued or granted.
6. Restoration: After a solar energy system is removed, the owner of the property shall promptly restore the property to a condition consistent with the
property's condition prior to the installation of the system.
(H) Variations: Variations to the height, setback and other requirements set forth herein may be obtained upon application and the granting of a variation in
conformance with the variation procedures set forth in section 10-2-2-2 of this zoning ordinance. In addition to the standards for granting of a variation
set forth therein, no variation relative to a solar energy system shall be recommended for approval unless it is found that the proposed solar energy
system is located in such a manner as to minimize intrusions on adjacent residential uses through positioning on the lot, selection of appropriate
equipment and other applicable means.
(I) Special Use: Solar energy systems or portions thereof may be installed on front or corner building facades only upon application and the granting of a
special use in conformance with the special use standards and procedures set forth in section 10-2-2-3 of this zoning ordinance.
(J) Government Installations: Solar energy systems or installations related to governmental uses, including, but not limited to, solar powered traffic speed
display devices or solar powered traffic signals or parking meters, are exempt from the requirements of this section.
(K) Permit Fees: Solar energy systems are subject to applicable permit fees as determined by the building department.
(L) Solar Water Heating: The following are additional regulations with which solar water heating units (units designed to heat water for the generation of
heat, water use or any other purpose) must comply, in addition to the other general regulations for solar energy systems set forth in this chapter:
1. Solar Water Heating Units: Solar water heating units which are an integrated part of the roof design are preferred. Solar water heating units may not
be visible from the public right of way, excluding alleys. If the solar water heating units are not flush, as preferred, they shall be installed so as not to
rise more than twelve inches (12") from the roof plane. They must appear to be part of the roof structure itself and be the same color as the roof or
glass enclosed. Collectors requiring a high angle of installation shall be fully screened from view with a material that blends with existing architecture
and color.
2. Tanks: No preheat, tempering or holding water tanks shall be located on the roof or building. Tanks shall be ground mounted on a concrete pad.
(M) Historic Structures:
1. Solar energy systems installed on structures designated as national, state or local historic landmark structures shall comply with all regulations
applicable to such structures, including title 11, chapter 1, "Historic Preservation", of the municipal code.
2. Taking into account the village's national historic landmark status, and the fact that a large number of structures throughout the village contribute to
the village's landmark status, adherence to the secretary of the interior's "Standards For Rehabilitation And Illustrated Guidelines On Sustainability
For Rehabilitating Historic Buildings" (the "standards"), and in particular the guidelines for solar technology contained therein ("Solar Technology
Guidelines"), is encouraged on structures deemed to be historic throughout the village.
Among practices recommended in the "Solar Technology Guidelines" in the 2011 edition of the standards are the following:
(a) Installing a low profile solar device on the historic building so that it is not visible or only minimally visible from the public right of way: for example,
on a flat roof and set back to take advantage of a parapet or other roof feature to screen solar panels from view; or on a secondary slope of a roof,
out of view from the public right of way.
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=610 441/519
(b) Installing a solar device on the historic building in a manner that does not damage historic roofing material or negatively impact the building's
historic character and is reversible.
(c) Analyzing whether solar technology can be used successfully and will benefit a historic building without compromising its character or the
character of the site or the surrounding historic district.
(d) Installing a solar device in a compatible location on the site or on a nonhistoric building or addition where it will have minimal impact on the
historic building and its site.
(e) Installing a solar device on the historic building only after other locations have been investigated and determined infeasible.
(N) Solar Access Protection:
1. Creation Of Easements: Solar energy system access easements across contiguous or nearby lots, tracts or land may be created to establish a
window of exposure to the sun so as to protect an existing or intended solar energy systems' exposure to the sun from obstruction of buildings and
trees. Such easements may be purchased, reserved, granted or otherwise obtained. Adverse possession cannot create such an easement. An
easement infringed upon is a compensable property right through private remedy.
2. Recording And Filing Of Easements: Solar access easements shall be recorded with the Cook County recorder of deeds and filed with the village's
building department.
3. Construction In Easement Areas: Any person seeking a building permit to construct or modify any structure or buildings so as to increase the
consumption of airspace over that lot shall certify in writing to the building department that no solar access easement exists over that lot.
4. Denial Of Permit: Should the building department determine that the proposed construction would intrude upon a solar energy system access
easement, no building permit shall be granted.
5. Approvals: Absent the existence of a solar energy system access easement that is recorded and filed with the village's building department,
approvals granted to a property owner for a solar energy system shall not be construed to bar owners or tenants of any adjacent property from
ordinary or permitted building, landscaping or other improvements, even if such improvements may diminish the function of said solar energy system.
(Ord. 2797, 5-21-2012)

the time they were established, are permitted to continue as legal nonconforming uses.
(B) Damage Or Destruction: When a building is reconstructed or repaired after being damaged or destroyed, off street parking facilities shall be restored or
maintained in an amount equivalent to that maintained at the time of such damage or destruction. However, it shall not be necessary to restore or
maintain parking facilities in excess of the applicable requirements of this chapter.
(C) Change In Land Use: When an existing use of a building, structure or parcel of land is changed to a new use, parking spaces shall be provided as
required for such new use. Additional spaces are required only in the amount by which the requirements for the new use exceed the requirements for
the existing use.
(D) Change In Intensity Of Use: When the intensity of use of any building, structure or parcel of land is increased, additional parking spaces shall be
provided. The number of additional parking spaces shall be based on the increase in the number of dwelling units, gross floor area, seating capacity or
other unit of measurement used to calculate the number of required parking or loading spaces. When the intensity of use of any building, structure or
parcel of land is decreased, the number of parking and loading spaces may be reduced if the requirements of this chapter are met for the entire
building, structure or parcel of land, as modified.
(E) Provision Of Additional Spaces: Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the voluntary establishment of off street parking facilities, provided
that all regulations governing the location, design and control of such facilities shall be followed. In addition, the voluntary establishment of additional
parking facilities shall not result in the property exceeding the maximum impervious surface requirements, where applicable, of this zoning ordinance.
(F) Limitations On Use: No motor vehicle repair work of any kind shall be permitted in any parking space or parking lot. The repair or maintenance of motor
vehicles conducted as a business or commercial activity is prohibited in any off street parking facility. (Ord. 2550, 12-19-2005)
10-8-2: COMPUTATION OF PARKING REQUIREMENTS:
The total number of required parking spaces shall be based upon the requirements for the principal use of the lot. However, when more than one use
occupies the same lot, the number of required spaces shall be the sum of the separate requirements for each use. All off street parking facilities shall be
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=610 442/519
completed before occupancy of the building or structure for which it serves. In computing the number of off street parking spaces required by this chapter,
the following standards for computation shall apply:
(A) Space allocated to any off street loading space shall not be used to satisfy the requirement for any off street parking space or access aisle, or portion
thereof. Conversely, the area allocated to any off street parking space shall not be used to satisfy the replacement for any off street loading space or
portion thereof.
(B) A fraction of less than one-half (1/2) may be disregarded, and a fraction of one-half (1/2) or more shall be counted as one parking or loading space.
(C) In places of assembly in which patrons or spectators occupy benches, pews or similar seating facilities, each twenty four inches (24") of such seating
facility shall be counted as one seat for the purpose of determining the requirement for off street parking facilities.
(D) Except as otherwise specified, parking or loading spaces required on an employee basis shall be based on the maximum number of employees
present on the premises at any one time. When the determination of the number of parking spaces is based on the number of employees, the owner or
manager shall be counted as an employee.
(E) For nonresidential uses, where there is accessory office space that serves the administrative functions for a nonresidential use, this accessory office
space shall be included in the calculation for the principal use, rather than used to calculate a separate requirement for office space. (Ord. 2550, 12-19-
2005)
10-8-3: CONSTRUCTION OF OFF STREET PARKING FACILITIES:
(A) Site Plan Review: Site plan review is required prior to any construction, alteration or addition of any off street parking facility for a nonresidential use
and for any townhouse or multiple-family residential development providing five (5) or more parking spaces. For purposes of this chapter, construction,
alteration or addition shall include all paving of previously unpaved surfaces, replacement of pavement with new binder and surface courses,
construction of curbing, installation of new parking lot landscaping, and similar activities. Construction, alteration or addition shall not include
maintenance activities, such as replacement of landscaping, curb repairs, sealing, restriping or placement of surface course pavement over previously
paved areas. The application for site plan review shall be in accordance with the site plan review requirements of section 10-2-2-4, "Site Plan Review",
of this zoning ordinance.
(B) Completion: The off street parking and loading facilities required by this chapter shall be completed prior to the issuance of the certificate of occupancy
for the use they serve. If weather conditions do not permit such completion, the village manager may issue a temporary certificate of occupancy for a
maximum period of six (6) months. The off street parking facilities shall be completed prior to the expiration of the temporary certificate of occupancy.
(C) Parking Plan: Each applicant for a building permit or certificate of occupancy shall file with his/her application a plan of parking facilities and loading
facilities, if required, to be provided in connection with the building for which the permit or certificate is sought. (Ord. 2550, 12-19-2005)
10-8-4: DESIGN OF OFF STREET PARKING SPACES:
(A) Dimensions Of Spaces And Aisles:
1. Required off street parking spaces shall have vertical clearance of at least seven feet (7'). The dimensions of aisles shall be as shown in figure 11,
"Off Street Parking Requirements", of this section. All two-way traffic aisles shall be a minimum of twenty four feet (24') in width. As shown in figure
11 for multi-family and nonresidential parking lots, one-way traffic aisles shall be a minimum of eighteen feet (18'). Townhouse developments shall be
permitted a minimum twelve foot (12') one-way traffic aisle. (Ord. 2593, 11-20-2006)
2. A required off street parking space shall be at least nine feet (9') in width and at least eighteen feet (18') in length, exclusive of access drives, aisles,
ramps and columns. Required dimensions for off street parking are illustrated in figure 11, "Off Street Parking Requirements", of this section.
(B) Surfacing And Striping: All off street parking areas and driveways shall be improved with a hard surfaced pavement as approved by the village. In an
effort to reduce storm water runoff caused by excessive pavement, the village encourages the construction of off street parking with a porous asphalt
material that meets village requirements. Striping of the surface to define each parking space shall be provided and visible at all times.
(C) Access To Spaces: A fire lane shall be provided where required by the fire department. All off street parking facilities shall be provided with appropriate
means of vehicular access in a manner that least interferes with traffic movements and allows the driver of the vehicle to proceed forward into traffic
rather than back out. All required off street parking facilities shall have vehicular access from a street, alley or driveway, containing all-weather, hard
surfaced pavement. Each required off street parking space shall open directly upon an aisle or a driveway of such width and design as to provide safe
and efficient means of vehicular access to the parking spaces. The location and route of access to such a parking area shall be identified and the route
shall not transverse any other parking spaces. Except for access to loading berths, no driveway across public property shall have a width exceeding
twenty four feet (24'), excluding curb returns.
(D) Drainage: All parking and loading areas shall be graded and drained to dispose of surface water accumulation by means of an approved stormwater
drainage system.
(E) Parking Facilities For Alternative Modes Of Transportation: It is the intent of the village to accommodate all modes of transportation, including bicycles,
motorcycles and scooters. Therefore, it is encouraged that private property owners provide facilities for these modes of transportation as part of the
provision of off street parking facilities.

(F) Landscaping And Screening: All open parking areas shall be landscaped and screened in accordance with chapter 9, "Landscaping And Screening", of
this zoning ordinance.
(G) Lighting: With the exception of ornamental lighting in the B2 district that is similar to the village's historic gas lighting fixtures and consistent with the
historic character of the central business district, all on site lighting shall comply with the requirements of section 10-7-2, "Exterior Lighting", of this
zoning ordinance. (Ord. 2550, 12-19-2005)
10-8-5: LOCATION OF OFF STREET PARKING:
All required parking shall be located on the same lot as the use served, except where permitted within the zoning district and the use standards of
subsection 10-6-2(E), "Off Street Parking; Parking Lots And Parking Structures", of this zoning ordinance. (Ord. 2701, 3-3-2009)
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=610 444/519
(A) Parking Lot Location:
1. B2 District:
(a) In the B2 district, parking lots shall be located at the rear of buildings such that buildings separate parking areas from the street. The planning and
zoning commission may permit parking to the side of a building if the lot is a minimum of one hundred fifty feet (150') in width. The need for parking
on the side of the building will be evaluated by the planning and zoning commission on a case by case basis and shall only be permitted where the
configuration of the site and/or need for on site parking makes locating all parking at the rear of the building infeasible. (Ord. 2701, 3-3-2009; amd.
Ord. 2843, 12-19-2013)
(b) For residential uses in the B2 district, it shall be encouraged that at least one of the required spaces per dwelling unit be enclosed and located
within the building or in an accessory garage building. These requirements shall apply to new residential development and not to existing
residential developments.
2. B1 District:
(a) In the B1-C district, parking may be located to the rear or side of the building. Parking may be permitted in front of the building in the B1-C district
by special use only. Parking is permitted to encroach into the required rear yard, however all applicable buffer yard requirements shall be met. No
parking is permitted in the buffer yard. (See figure 11B of this section for parking area locations relative to the building.)
(b) In the B1-TC district, the following parking location requirements apply:
(1) Parking is permitted to encroach into the required rear yard, however all applicable buffer yard requirements shall be met. No parking is
permitted in the buffer yard.
(2) Parking is permitted to the side of the building but may not encroach into a required interior side yard and all applicable buffer yard
requirements shall be met. No parking is permitted in the buffer yard.
(3) Parking may be permitted in front of a building in the B1-TC district by special use only, however it may not encroach into the required front
yard. (See figure 11B of this section.)

10-8-6: ACCESSIBLE PARKING:
(A) Required Spaces: All off street parking facilities, except single-family and two-family dwellings, shall provide parking spaces for handicapped persons.
The number of accessible parking spaces shall be included in the total number of required parking spaces and shall be in accordance with the
applicable requirements of the Illinois administrative code, as amended from time to time, and all governing codes and applicable laws.
(B) Dimensions And Design: Such spaces shall comply with the design standards presented in the state of Illinois accessibility standards and all governing
codes and applicable laws, provided that in no instance shall the width of any one space be less than sixteen feet (16'). Such spaces shall be identified
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=610 446/519
by a sign and pavement markings indicating parking for the handicapped only. Such spaces shall be those closest to the entrance of the building or
structure and shall be connected by a paved surface designed to provide safe and easy access. (Ord. 2550, 12-19-2005)
10-8-7: COMMERCIAL AND RECREATIONAL VEHICLES IN RESIDENTIAL DISTRICTS:
The parking of commercial and recreational vehicles on any lot or parcel of land in any residential district, and accessory to the main residential use, shall
be subject to the following regulations:
(A) Commercial Vehicles:
1. In the residential districts, no more than one commercial vehicle shall be parked on any lot or parcel of land. Such commercial vehicles shall be
parked within a totally enclosed garage or other building, except one commercial vehicle with an "A" or "B" license plate, as categorized by the state
of Illinois, may be parked in the driveway. If the garage is located in, and/or the driveway extends to, the rear yard, such vehicles, if parked outside,
must be parked in the rear yard.
2. Commercial vehicles may be parked in a residential driveway for the necessary short term period needed to make deliveries and/or render service to
the property owner.
(B) Recreational Vehicles:
1. Except as set forth in subsection (B)2 of this section, in residential districts, all recreational vehicles shall be parked within a totally enclosed garage
or other building.
2. Open parking of one recreational vehicle that, by itself or mounted on a trailer, does not exceed twenty three feet (23') in length and seven feet (7') in
height, is permitted in a rear yard, in addition to private passenger vehicles. Screening in the form of shrubbery, fencing or other means shall be
provided to shield such recreational vehicle from adjoining properties and shall be maintained in a good condition. A recreational vehicle with
collapsible walls shall be stored in a collapsed position.
3. While parked, stored or otherwise kept within any residential district, no recreational vehicle shall be occupied or used for living, sleeping or
housekeeping purposes. No water, gas, sewer or electrical service connection shall be attached to such vehicle.
4. In all residential districts, any recreational vehicle may be parked in a residential driveway for loading and unloading purposes for a continuous
period not exceeding forty eight (48) hours. (Ord. 2550, 12-19-2005)
10-8-8: B2 DISTRICT PARKING FLEXIBILITY:
It is recognized that the pedestrian character and small lot sizes within the B2 district make the provision of individual on site parking facilities difficult and
inappropriate. In addition to on street parking and limited public parking spaces, business owners are encouraged to pursue shared and off site parking
arrangements at the rear of properties in the B2 district. Where all required parking cannot be provided through these means, business owners may pay
into the village parking fund to contribute to the cost of providing and maintaining public parking. However, residential developments shall be responsible
for providing all required on site parking. (Ord. 2550, 12-19-2005)
(A) Shared Parking: Shared parking shall be encouraged in the B2 district. Shared parking may be provided if the number of spaces shall not be less than
the sum of parking requirements for each use, unless the uses have off peak hours such that spaces can count toward both uses, as determined by the
planning and zoning commission. In addition, in an effort to promote shared parking, the planning and zoning commission may require cross access
easements between adjacent properties in the B2 district to create a safer and more integrated circulation system.
(B) Payment In Lieu Of Providing Parking: A reduction in the required number of off street parking spaces for nonresidential uses in the B2 district may be
granted by the planning and zoning commission. The planning and zoning commission may authorize the requested parking reduction conditioned
upon payment, by the owner, of a fee in lieu of providing the required parking spaces, such fee established from time to time by resolution of the village
board. Such payment shall be placed into a village fund to be used by the village for the acquisition, construction and maintenance of public off street
parking facilities to serve the district. Upon payment, the property granted the modification in the number of required off street spaces shall be credited
permanently by ordinance with the number of spaces for which payment was received by the village. The parking fee in lieu of provision shall only be
applicable for new construction or where additional floor area in excess of four hundred (400) square feet is added to an existing building. Changes in
use within existing buildings shall not require payment into the Parking Fund. (Ord. 2550, 12-19-2005; amd. Ord. 2843, 12-19-2013)
10-8-9: REQUIRED OFF STREET PARKING SPACES:
The minimum number of off street parking spaces to be provided for the designated uses shall be as follows in table 8, "Required Off Street Parking", of
this section. In the B2 District, the following off street parking requirements shall only be applicable for new construction or where additions are made to
existing buildings. For mixed use developments, parking shall be provided for both residential and nonresidential uses in accordance with this section.

10-8-10: OFF STREET LOADING SPACES:
The Village may require off street loading spaces where a building or use requires the receipt or distribution of materials or merchandise by trucks. When
such a loading space is required by the Village, it shall be designed as follows:
(A) Location: When required, off street loading spaces shall be located on the same lot as the building or use served and shall not project into any public
right-of-way. Off street loading spaces shall not be located in any front or corner side yard.
(B) Dimensions: When required, off street loading spaces shall be at least twelve feet (12') in width and at least thirty feet (30') in length, exclusive of aisle
and maneuvering space, and shall have a minimum vertical clearance of at least fifteen feet (15').

2550, 12-19-2005)
Chapter 9
LANDSCAPING AND SCREENING
10-9-1: PURPOSE:
The landscaping and screening requirements established herein are intended to preserve and enhance the appearance, public health, safety,
convenience, comfort and general welfare of the village by fostering an aesthetically pleasing development. Proper landscaping contributes to the village in
many ways: enhancing its character and scenic beauty, providing clean air, reducing noise, preventing erosion of topsoil, reducing the rate of stormwater
runoff, providing nesting areas for birds and habitat for other wildlife, conserving energy, and providing shade and windbreaks. These regulations are also
intended to increase the compatibility of adjacent uses, and minimize the adverse impact of noise, dust, motor vehicle headlight glare or other artificial light
intrusions, and other objectionable activities or impacts conducted on, or created by, adjoining or neighboring uses. (Ord. 2550, 12-19-2005)
10-9-2: LANDSCAPING DESIGN STANDARDS:
Landscaping and screening requirements are illustrated in section 10-9-9, figure 12, "Landscaping And Screening Requirements", of this chapter. In
addition to all landscaping required by this section, all landscape improvements shall comply with the tree protection ordinance and stormwater
management ordinance of the municipal code.
(A) Selection: Preferred plant materials, for all areas other than business districts, are listed in the approved plant materials list included as appendix E of
this zoning ordinance. All planting materials used shall be of good quality and of a species capable to withstand the climate extremes of northeastern
Illinois, as well as the individual site microclimates. Plant material shall be selected for its form, texture, color, pattern of growth and suitability to local
conditions. Size and density of plant material, both at the time of planting and at maturity, are additional criteria that shall be considered when selecting
plant material. Where applicable, the use of drought and salt tolerant plant material is preferred. (Ord. 2843, 12-19-2013)
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=610 449/519
(B) Installation: All landscaping materials shall be installed in accordance with the current planting procedures established by the American Association Of
Nurserymen. To the extent possible, all plant materials shall be free of disease and shall be installed so that sufficient soil and water are available to
sustain healthy growth.
(C) Scale And Nature Of Landscaping Material: The scale and nature of landscaping materials shall be appropriate to the size of the structures.
(D) Shade Trees: All shade trees shall have a minimum trunk size as specified by the landscaping provisions of this section, unless otherwise specified by
the village.
(E) Evergreen Trees: Evergreen trees shall have a minimum height of six feet (6') at planting and shall be incorporated into the landscape treatment of a
site, particularly in those areas where year round screening and buffering is required.
(F) Ornamental Trees: Single stem ornamental trees shall have a minimum trunk size of two inches (2") in caliper at planting, unless otherwise specified.
Multiple stem ornamental trees shall have a minimum height of seven feet (7') at planting, unless otherwise specified by the village.
(G) Shrubs: Unless otherwise specified by the village, all shrubs shall have minimum height of eighteen inches (18") at planting, unless otherwise
specified.
(H) Softening Of Walls And Fences: Plant material should be placed intermittently against long expanses of building walls, fences and other barriers to
create a softening effect and to help break up long expanses of blank walls with little architectural detail.
(I) Planting Beds: Planting beds shall be mulched with bark chips, shredded hardwood or similar materials. Mulch shall not be used as a substitute for
plant materials.
(J) Energy Conservation: Plant material placement should be designed to reduce energy consumption needs of the development. Where possible:
1. Deciduous trees should be placed on the south and west sides of buildings to provide shade from the summer sun.
2. Evergreens and other plant materials should be concentrated on the north and west sides of buildings to dissipate the effect of winter winds.
(K) Berming: Earthen berms and existing topographic features shall be incorporated into the landscape treatment of a site where there is sufficient space
and, in particular, when berms and existing topographic features can be combined with plant material to facilitate effective screening. No berm shall
increase the amount of fill within the drip line of any established tree that is to remain after construction. (Ord. 2550, 12-19-2005)
10-9-3: MAINTENANCE:
All plant material shall be maintained in good condition to present a healthy, neat and orderly appearance, and shall be kept free of refuse and debris.
Fences and walls shall be maintained in good repair and neat appearance. Landscaping shall be trimmed so as not to obstruct public or private sidewalks,
parking lots and driveways. All landscape areas shall have an irrigation system or hose bib within one hundred feet (100') of the landscaped areas
installed and properly maintained to promote the health of the plant material and conservation of water. The owner of the premises and any tenant shall be
jointly responsible for maintenance, repair and replacement of all landscape materials, fences and barriers. (Ord. 2550, 12-19-2005)
10-9-4: PARKWAY LANDSCAPING:
(A) Residential Districts:
1. Required Number Of Parkway Trees: All residential lots shall be required to maintain two (2) canopy trees within the parkway or public right of way.
For existing residential lots that do not have the required parkway trees, they shall be required to be installed at the time a building permit is
requested for teardown and new construction, or for an addition that expands the floor area of principal and/or accessory buildings on the site by
more than twenty five percent (25%). For lots that have a street yard width of less than fifty feet (50'), one of the required parkway trees may be
installed within the required street yard where there is insufficient space for two (2) trees to be planted in the parkway or public right of way. Parkway
trees shall be a minimum of two inches (2") in caliper and shall be those species identified in appendix E of this zoning ordinance. In certain
circumstances where hardship is demonstrated, the director of public works may waive these requirements.
2. Guarantee For Parkway Trees: At the time a building permit is requested, which triggers installation of required parkway trees, a deposit,
performance bond or irrevocable letter of credit in an amount equal to five hundred dollars ($500.00) shall be required for each parkway tree that
must be installed. The guarantee shall be provided in a format acceptable to the building department and shall be returned upon final inspection of
the installed parkway trees. (Ord. 2550, 12-19-2005)
(B) Business Districts: The director of public works shall review and decide on any proposed landscaping in the public right of way. (Ord. 2843, 12-19-
2013)
10-9-5: PERIMETER PARKING LOT LANDSCAPING:
Perimeter parking lot landscaping provides for the enhancement and screening of parking lots by requiring a scheme of pedestrian walls and/or
landscaping along public streets. Perimeter landscaping is required for all parking lots and shall be established along the edge of the parking lot. The
landscape treatment shall run the full length of the parking lot and shall be located between the property line and the edge of the parking lot. All perimeter
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=610 450/519
parking lot screening areas shall be protected with raised concrete curbs. Landscaped areas outside of shrub and tree masses shall be planted in turf or
other ground cover. The landscaped area shall be improved as follows:
(A) One shrub, measuring a minimum of eighteen inches (18") at planting and not to exceed three and one-half feet (31/2') at maturity, for every three feet
(3') of landscaped area length, spaced linearly to adequately screen vehicle bumpers, and/or a low pedestrian wall the height of which provides
effective screening to a maximum height of three and one-half feet (31/2').
(B) The perimeter parking lot landscaping area shall be at least ten feet (10') in width, as measured from the back of curb, in order to accommodate
vehicle bumper overhang and ensure planting areas that are adequate in size. (Ord. 2550, 12-19-2005)
10-9-6: INTERIOR PARKING LOT LANDSCAPING:
For parking lots consisting of twenty (20) or more spaces, interior parking lot landscaping shall be required. Interior parking lot islands shall be required at
a rate of one parking lot island for every five (5) parking spaces. Landscaping areas located along the perimeter of a parking lot beyond the curb or edge of
pavement shall not be included toward satisfying this requirement. Interior parking lot landscaping areas shall be a minimum of one hundred forty four
(144) square feet in area and shall be a minimum of eight feet (8') in width, as measured from back of curb to back of curb. The landscaped areas shall be

that has become nonconforming upon the adoption hereof, or any subsequent amendments thereto, may continue subject to the provisions of this
chapter so long as it remains otherwise lawful.
(B) Burden On Property Owner To Establish Legality: In all cases, the burden of establishing the legality of a nonconformity under the provisions of this
zoning ordinance shall be upon the owner of the nonconforming building, structure, lot or use, and not upon the village.
(C) Safety Regulations: All police power regulations enacted to promote public health, safety, convenience, comfort and general welfare, including, but not

use, provided it will not create any new nonconformity, increase the degree of nonconformity, or increase the bulk of the building or structure in any
manner.
(B) Structural Alterations: No structural alterations shall be performed on any building or structure devoted to a nonconforming use, except in the following
situations:

such a nonconforming use has been changed in whole or in part to a permitted use, the whole or part which has been made to conform may not
thereafter be changed back to a use that is not permitted. A change of use shall be deemed to occur when an existing nonconforming use has been

intersects the interior lot line. The shorter of the two (2) projected lines shall be considered to contain the shorter "street lot line". The length of this
shorter projected line shall be considered to be the "lot frontage" dimension.
Figure 14
Lot Frontage
EXAMPLE 1 EXAMP
To measure "lot frontage":
(A) Using existing interior lot line 1, project a parallel line to the opposite street side, tangent to the outermost point of that street lot line (tangent
point A).
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=610 463/519
1. This creates projected interior lot line 1.
(B) Using existing interior lot line 2, project a parallel line to the opposite street side, tangent to the outermost point of that street lot line (tangent
point B).
1. This creates projected interior lot line 2.
(C) Measure the lengths of projected interior lot lines 1 and 2 from the point of intersection of these two (2) projected lines to the intersection with
each existing interior lot line.
1. In example 1, both existing interior lot lines need to be extended to intersect the projected interior lot lines (point C).
2. In example 2, existing interior lot line 1 needs to be extended to intersect projected interior lot line 2 (point C). In example 2, tangent point A
serves as the point of intersection between existing interior lot line 2 and projected interior lot line 1.
(D) The shorter of these two (2) lines is the "lot frontage" dimension; in both examples, projected interior lot line 1 is the "lot frontage" dimension.
LOT, INTERIOR: A lot other than a "corner lot" or "double frontage lot".
LOT LINE, INTERIOR (Residential Districts): An "interior lot line" is any lot line not abutting a street.
LOT LINE, REAR (Residential Districts): The "rear lot line" is the lot line opposite and most distant from the street lot line. The "rear lot line" on irregular,
triangular or gore lots shall, for the purpose of this zoning ordinance, be a line entirely within the lot at least ten feet (10') long, and parallel to, and most
distant from, the street lot line. On a "corner lot", the "rear lot line" shall be opposite the narrower "street lot line". (See figure 15, "Rear Lot Line", of this
definition.)

LOT LINE, SIDE (Residential Districts): A "side lot line" is any lot line that is not a "street lot line" or "rear lot line". A "side lot line" separating a lot from
another lot is a "side lot line". On a "corner lot", the "side lot line" shall be opposite the longer "street lot line". A lot line separating a lot from a street is
considered a "street lot line". (See figure 16, "Side Lot Line", of this definition.)
Figure 16
Side Lot Line
LOT LINE, STREET (Residential Districts): The "street lot line" is a lot line that abuts a street. Corner lots may have more than one street lot line. If a
portion of any lot is subject to an easement for public purposes, including, but not limited to, street, parkway and/or sidewalk, the street lot line will be
deemed to be the line that separated that part of the lot subject to the easement for public purposes from that part of the lot not subject to that easement.

LOT OF RECORD: A lot that is part of a recorded subdivision or a parcel of land that has been recorded at the County Recorder's Office containing
property tax records.
LOT WIDTH: The average lot width dimension shall be determined by adding the width of the lot at the required "street yard" setback dimension, as
determined by subsection 10-4-3(D) of this zoning ordinance, and the width of the lot at the required "rear yard" setback dimension, as determined by
subsection 10-4-3(E) of this zoning ordinance, and dividing that number by two (2).
(A) In the case of a lot defined by two (2) "side lot lines", a lot axis shall be drawn from the midpoint of the "street lot line" to the midpoint of the "rear lot
line", and the setback dimensions shall be drawn at a right angle to that axis (see figure 18, example 1 of this definition).
(B) In the case of a lot defined by one (1) "side lot line", the setback dimensions shall be drawn at a right angle from the "side lot line" to the intersection
with the longer "street lot line" at the required setback dimensions (see figure 18, example 2 of this definition). The longer "street lot line" shall be
determined by the projection of each interior lot line in parallel until it is tangent to the outermost point of the street lot line, as shown in figure 14 of
the "lot frontage" definition in this section. The longer of the two (2) projected lines, which are parallel to interior lot lines, shall be considered to
contain the longer "street lot line". In the case of projected lines that are equal in length, the Zoning Administrator shall make the decision, based on
lot shape, as to which of the "street lot lines" shall be considered the longer "street lot line" and used to determine "lot width".

in addition, include notice, by regular mail, not less than fifteen (15) days prior to the hearing, to property owners within two hundred fifty feet (250') of
the property for which application has been made.
At the public hearing the commission shall take the testimony presented by the owner(s) and any other interested parties concerning the effect of the
proposed alteration, construction, relocation, subdivision of property or demolition upon the designated landmark property, and shall include evidence
pertinent to the establishment of a substantial decrease in the fair market value of the property or a substantial decrease in the pretax or after tax
return to owners of record or other investors in the property as a result of the denial of the certificate of appropriateness; evidence pertinent to the
cost of the proposed construction, alteration, relocation, subdivision of property or demolition, and an estimate of any additional cost that would be
incurred to comply with the recommendations of the commission for changes necessary for the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness; evidence
pertinent to the structural soundness of any structures on the property and their suitability for rehabilitation; and, in the case of a proposed
demolition, evidence pertinent to the economic feasibility of rehabilitation or reuse of the existing structure or improvement on the property.
If, upon completion of the public hearing, the commission finds by an affirmative vote of at least four (4) of its members that, without approval of the
proposed work or subdivision, the property cannot be put to a reasonable use or the owner cannot obtain a reasonable economic return therefrom,
then the commission shall issue a certificate of economic hardship approving the proposed work, subdivision or demolition, provided that, if the
commission deems it to be feasible, it may first make recommendation to the board regarding building code or zoning modifications, or revising other
provisions of this chapter to allow for a reasonable use of or return from the property, or to otherwise preserve the same.
The board shall have a period of sixty (60) days to act upon the commission's recommendation before a decision to grant a certificate of economic
hardship shall issue. If the commission finds otherwise, it shall deny the issuance of a certificate of economic hardship. Notice of the decision shall
be sent to the property owner and the village manager and director of community development within five (5) working days after the decision.
7. Appeal: Any applicant denied a required certificate of appropriateness or certificate of economic hardship, in whole or in part, may appeal the final
decision of the commission to the board within thirty (30) days following receipt of the decision by filing a written notice of appeal in the office of the
village clerk, village hall, Riverside, Illinois. The board shall thereafter review the application, using the criteria established for such certificate, and
the reasons for the commission's denial thereof, and shall take action, by resolution, to either affirm the commission's decision or to reverse it and
order the certificate of appropriateness or of economic hardship to issue; said review and action to take place within forty five (45) days following
receipt of the notice of appeal. The decision of the board shall constitute the final administrative decision.
8. Work To Conform To Certificate: All work performed pursuant to the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness or of economic hardship shall
conform to the requirements of such certificate. It shall be the duty of the director of community development to inspect, from time to time, any work
performed pursuant to such certificate to assure such compliance. In the event work is performed which is not in accordance with such certificate, the
director of community development or his or her designated representative shall issue a stop work order and all work shall cease. No person shall
undertake any work on such project as long as such stop work order shall continue in effect.
(D) Penalties: Any person who violates any of the provisions of this section or of section 11-1-3-3 of this chapter shall, upon conviction, be subject to a fine
of not less than fifty dollars ($50.00) nor more than five hundred dollars ($500.00) for such offense. Each day that a violation exists shall be deemed a
separate offense.
Any contractor licensed by this village who undertakes construction, reconstruction, alteration, renovation, demolition or repair of a landmark structure
or property, without a permit or in violation of the provisions of this section or section 11-1-3-3 of this chapter, shall suffer revocation of such license by

offense. Each day that a violation exists shall be deemed a separate offense. (Ord. 2900, 3-3-2016)
11-1-3-5: ACCESSORY BUILDINGS DESIGNATED AS LANDMARKS USED FOR RESIDENCES:
Accessory buildings which have been designated as landmarks pursuant to section 11-1-3-2 of this chapter may be used for residential purposes if they
comply with all other requirements of this code. (Ord. 2335, 6-19-2000; amd. Ord. 2550, 12-19-2005)
11-1-3-6: RESTORATION OF NATIONAL HISTORIC LANDMARKS:
(A) The owners of buildings or structures which have been designated as national historic landmarks by the federal government (individually, and not
simply by virtue of their location within the Riverside landscape architectural district) who seek to restore such building or structure more nearly to its
original condition, may seek a waiver from or modification of any village code, ordinance, requirement, or regulation in order to further such restoration.
Such waiver or modification may be granted only if the following criteria are satisfied:
1. The changes proposed will enhance the building's or structure's authenticity with regard to those characteristics for which it was designated a
national historic landmark; and
2. The proposed changes will not create a health or safety hazard; and
3. The benefits from the proposed changes will outweigh any adverse consequences.
(B) Application for such waiver or modification shall be filed with the village manager. The village manager shall forward the application to the Riverside
preservation commission within seven (7) days of its receipt. The preservation commission shall schedule a hearing on the application, at which time
the applicant shall be allowed the opportunity to present such information and evidence as the applicant may deem appropriate, or as the commission
may require. Following such hearing, the preservation commission shall issue a report and recommendation to the village board. Such report and
recommendation shall be issued within sixty (60) days of receipt by the preservation commission of the application. The village board shall then
determine whether the waiver or modification shall be granted, based upon the criteria set forth in subsection (A) of this section and upon the
recommendation of the preservation commission.
(C) If the applicant seeks a waiver or modification of a requirement set forth in the Riverside zoning ordinance, then the applicant shall apply for a variation
from the requirement of the zoning ordinance pursuant to section 10-2-2-2 of the zoning ordinance, rather than seeking a waiver or modification
pursuant to this section. (Ord. 2382, 10-15-2001; amd. Ord. 2550, 12-19-2005)
11-1-3-7: DEMOLITION OF RESIDENTIAL BUILDINGS AND OTHER IMPROVEMENTS:
(A) The provisions of this section shall apply to all applications for demolition of residential buildings or other improvement in the R1, R2, R3, and R4
residential districts of the village of Riverside that have not previously been designated as a landmark pursuant to this chapter.
(B) Any such application shall be referred to the preservation commission for an initial review. Any applicant for a demolition permit must include at least
two (2) three and one-half inch by five inch (31/2" x 5") color photographs taken from the sidewalk of the building as seen by the public, and any
available information regarding the year of construction, the designer/architect, builder, and original owner. The preservation commission shall initially
review the building or other improvement which is the subject of the application for a demolition permit no later than the second regularly scheduled
meeting following the filing of the application, but in no event more than sixty (60) days after the application for demolition permit is submitted to the
village. If a majority of the members of the preservation commission in attendance find that the building or other improvement is worthy of nomination
as a landmark under this chapter based solely on its architectural significance, as reflected in criteria in subsections 11-1-3-2(B)1, (B)3, (B)4, and (B)6
of this chapter, then no demolition permit shall be issued for one month following the meeting. If an application is filed during that month for designation
of the building or other improvement as a landmark, then that application for landmark designation shall be processed by the village pursuant to the
provisions of section 11-1-3-2 of this chapter and no demolition permit shall be issued while that application is being processed; provided, however, that
the time permitted to process the application for landmark designation is limited to a maximum of twelve (12) months from the date the application for a
demolition permit is submitted to the village. If no finding is made that the building or other improvement is worthy of nomination as a landmark, then a
demolition permit shall be issued if all other village ordinances and regulations are satisfied. If a finding is made that the building or other improvement
is worthy of nomination as a landmark, but no application for designation as a landmark is filed with the village within a month following that finding,
then a demolition permit shall be issued if all other village ordinances and regulations are satisfied.
(C) If the building or other improvement is designated as a landmark pursuant to section 11-1-3-2 of this chapter, then demolition is prohibited by
subsection 11-1-3-4(A) of this chapter unless a certificate of appropriateness or certificate of economic hardship is first obtained. If an application is
filed seeking to designate the building or other improvement as a landmark but a decision is made not to designate the building or other improvement
as a landmark, or if the maximum twelve (12) month period expires without a decision, then a demolition permit shall be issued if all other village
ordinances and regulations are satisfied. (Ord. 2550, 12-19-2005; amd. Ord. 2561, 3-20-2006)
11-1-4: PUBLIC LANDS:
11-1-4-1: RIVERSIDE LANDSCAPE ARCHITECTURAL DISTRICT:
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=610 491/519
The board, pursuant to resolution adopted March 20, 1972, has accepted the national historic landmark designation of the Riverside landscape
architectural district and shall preserve, so far as practicable, and to the best of its ability, the historical integrity of this landmark through continued use of
the public property therein for purposes and in a manner consistent with its historical character, and through the application, control, conduct and carrying
out of all preservation activities, programs and grants involving, affecting or otherwise pertaining to the public property in this district and in the village as a
whole.
The district is legally described in the national register of historic places as an area bounded on the north by Twenty Sixth Street, on the east by Harlem
Avenue, on the south by Ogden Avenue and the south bank of the Des Plaines River, and on the west by Forbes Road. The district boundaries, as
outlined on a 1982 Riverside street map published by the Riverside public library, is set forth in section 11-1-5, appendix B of this chapter. (Ord. 1971, 12-
2-1991; amd. Ord. 2550, 12-19-2005)
11-1-4-2: THE PLANNING CONCEPT FOR RIVERSIDE:
The planning concept for Riverside, as designed by Frederick Law Olmsted, with Calvert Vaux and the firm of Olmsted, Vaux And Company, was to create
a total environmental suburban community which would answer individual needs for the most modern conveniences found in the village while providing the
domestic advantages of living in a rural environment. Olmsted planned such landscaped environment to unconsciously affect its residents and visitors with
serenity and tranquility. To achieve this end, he provided an enriched display of nature throughout the community. The best features of the site were
dedicated as public land for the use and enjoyment of all. Public lands occupied approximately forty four percent (44%) of the total community's land.
These public lands included the land adjacent to the Des Plaines River, two (2) large commons, the triangular landscaped parks, and the roadways with
their unique varying public parkway depths. These changing parkway depths allowed for natural tree groupings along the roadways in lieu of in-line street
planting. All public areas were landscaped with the same natural landscape approach, creating a pastoral setting of plant groups interspersed with open
green meadows. The landscaped public areas, curvilinear road system, and the irregularly shaped private lots provided the rural setting. The roads were
built lacking high curbs and were depressed relative to adjacent land, so as to be visually obscure. Ornamental gas streetlights were installed along the
road system.
The board is committed to operate and maintain these public lands, roads and streetlights so as to preserve the planning concepts upon which the general
character of the village and the historic landmark designation for the Riverside landscape architectural district is based. (Ord. 1971, 12-2-1991; amd. Ord.
2550, 12-19-2005)
11-1-4-3: THE ORNAMENTAL STREET LIGHTING SYSTEM:
The ornamental street lighting system, consisting of a cast iron post, globe and dome in the style set forth in section 11-1-5, appendix C of this chapter,
shall be preserved, operated and maintained as the only permissible form of street lighting standards allowable for commercial and residential streets and
public park areas within this village. Said ornamental style of street lighting standard shall be used for both electric and gas lighting systems.
The board shall continue efforts to maintain a current inventory of the village street lighting system and to purchase and maintain on hand a sufficient
amount of replacement ornamental standards and parts for use in the event of damage, destruction or other loss occasioned to one or more streetlights.
(Ord. 1971, 12-2-1991; amd. Ord. 2550, 12-19-2005)
11-1-4-4: THE CURVILINEAR ROADWAY SYSTEM:
The existing curvilinear roadway design and roadway system within the village shall be retained, preserved and maintained in its present form, to the
extent possible, to allow for safe travel and proper drainage. Roadway surfaces shall be of bituminous or other durable surface material of uniform
application to village roadways, with concrete curbs and gutters. Road surfaces shall be depressed from the adjacent park or parkway areas so as to
diminish the visual effect of the roadway and to accentuate an uninterrupted visual impact of the landscape. Combination cement concrete curbs and
gutters eighteen inches (18") in width shall be constructed to afford proper drainage and protect against vehicular parking on parkway areas. Curbs shall
blend in with the topography of the adjacent landscape and shall be as unobtrusive as possible. Modified or gently sloping curbs which continue the
curvilinear angle of the adjacent landscape shall be preferred in order to maintain a roadway profile most compatible to a rural setting. In undertaking
roadway improvements and the widths thereof, the board shall give consideration to the comprehensive street improvement study and report of November
4, 1966, prepared by the engineering firm of Baxter And Woodman, or any subsequent roadway improvement studies. (Ord. 1971, 12-2-1991; amd. Ord.
2550, 12-19-2005)
11-1-4-5: RESERVED:
(Ord. 2846, 1-16-2014)
11-1-4-6: HISTORICAL MONUMENTS, MARKERS AND ARTIFACTS:
The board shall maintain and preserve all historical monuments and markers located within the public park system or on public grounds. Skeletal remains
and other artifacts uncovered within the park system shall be reported, recorded, preserved and maintained in accordance with the procedures adopted
therefor by the Riverside historical commission and approved by ordinance on August 19, 1985, and as may be subsequently revised and amended from
time to time. (Ord. 1971, 12-2-1991; amd. Ord. 2550, 12-19-2005)
11-1-4-7: RECREATION AREAS AND STRUCTURES:
Within the public park system are several designated recreation areas, as set forth in section 2-16-5 of this code that are under the jurisdiction, operation,
maintenance, and control of the Riverside parks and recreation board. The board of trustees, village manager, parks and recreation board, and recreation
department shall work cooperatively to ensure that recreational activities and programs are conducted in such manner that trees, shrubs and other
plantings surrounding or situated within the recreation areas are preserved and maintained free from injury; that the open areas are policed and kept in a
neat and tidy condition; that efforts are made to preserve the grassland areas; that recreation structures and facilities (fencing, benches, etc.) be
6/5/2019 Sterling Codifiers, Inc.
https://www.sterlingcodifiers.com/codebook/index.php?book_id=610 492/519
constructed of natural wood or stone materials or of materials dark in color; and that, whenever possible, such structures and facilities be so installed as to
be removed when the pertinent seasonal or scheduled recreation activity has been concluded. (Ord. 2820, 6-20-2013)
11-1-4-8: THE RESIDENTIAL PROPERTIES:
An integral part of the general plan was the inclusion of large, irregular residential lots having spacious front yards with appropriate plantings
complementing the public lands and plantings, to enhance the overall semirural, countrylike setting of the area. Over the years many lots have been
divided and homes have been built on the small subdivided parcels, thus adversely affecting the open and spacious elements of the general plan. It is
therefore essential that efforts be made to preserve remaining lots from further reduction in size where such a reduction would negatively impact the
national historic landmark designation of the village, the historic landmark designation of an individually landmarked structure, or the general plan's
preference for large residential lots.
To further preserve these elements of large residential lots with spacious front yards, the board shall consider the effect of any subdivision on the village's
national historic landmark designation, on any designated historic landmark, and on the general plan of the village, and shall adopt, maintain and enforce
zoning, building, and other regulations which shall maintain existing front yard setbacks determined by the average depth of established front yards, and
existing side yard setbacks of not less than five feet (5') between residence structures and lot lines; which shall encourage tree planting in front yard areas;
which shall regulate and restrict the installation of fences and other walls, hedges or barriers which interfere with the openness between lots; which shall
regulate and restrict the amount of lot area used for accessory structures, including garages, decks, patios, swimming pools, driveways and other
structures or surface improvements; and which shall protect the original stone lot boundary markers. (Ord. 2900, 3-3-2016)
11-1-4-9: PRESERVATION COMMISSION REVIEW:
For areas other than the business districts, prior to acceptance or adoption by the board, all proposed subdivisions, plans and specifications for roadway
reconstruction, and for plantings within the public park system, and all proposed amendments to the zoning ordinance or subdivision regulations2 shall be
submitted to the commission for review and comment as to the effect of such subdivisions, plans, specifications or proposals on the national historic
landmark designation of the village or on the general plan of Riverside, as heretofore expressed, regarding the village. The commission shall review all
such subdivisions, plans, specifications and proposals submitted to it and shall submit its comments in writing to the board within thirty (30) days following
its receipt of the same. (Ord. 2900, 3-3-2016)

South 25 feet of Lots 601, 602, 603 in Block 1 in the Third Division of Riverside in Section 36, Township 39 North, Range 12 East of the Third Principal
Meridian in Cook County, Illinois.
Permanent Tax Index No.: 15-36-301-001-0000
Architectural Style: Prairie
Significance:
Criterion 1: The building was built at 3 Longcommon Road in 1909 by James Castle to serve as Riverside's first hardware store. Castle moved his
established plumbing and heating business from Quincy Road, and combined it with a full service hardware store. In 1941 Reed and Alice Henninger
purchased the building and installed a new front entrance and facade to accommodate a Rexall pharmacy and soda fountain. In 1962 Gloria and Royce
Canavera signed a lease with Henninger and moved their established plumbing business from the Hollywood section of Brookfield to this location. At the
same time, Royce and Gloria Canavera purchased an existing hardware business from Alvin Anderson, located on East Burlington Road, and combined
both businesses at 3 Longcommon Road. In 1985 Christine and Arthur Canavera purchased the building from Henninger. In 1986 Christine and Arthur
purchased the plumbing service business and expanded it to include heating and air conditioning. In 2002, Arthur and Christine Canavera restored the
interior and exterior facade based on the original blueprint design of E.E. Roberts architects in Oak Park.
Criterion 3: James Castle hired E.E. Roberts architects in Oak Park to design the building at 3 Longcommon. Between 1890 and 1915, a tremendous
architectural transformation was taking place in the midwest by a local group of progressive architects. Frank Lloyd Wright, Tallmadge, Watson, Maher,
Spencer, Van Bergen and E.E. Roberts were some of the most notable. Roberts started work in 1899 as site superintendent at the Pullman grounds for SS
Beman. In 1893 Roberts set up his own practice in Oak Park which became the largest architectural firm in Oak Park. He designed over two hundred (200)
homes, numerous schools, churches, and commercial buildings. Roberts was instrumental in furthering the Prairie Style design by adding geometric
masses and rectilinear design to his building designs. In 1912 Roberts opened up a Chicago office and focused on commercial properties with the clean
lines of the Prairie Style. In 1922 E.E. Roberts made his son Elmer full partner in the firm. They worked together for many years, until E.E. Roberts' death
in 1943. Many of Roberts' buildings have not been documented due to lost records.
Criterion 4: Visual inspection of the 3 Longcommon building reveals the clean rectilinear lines of the Prairie Style design in a commercial application. Large
rectilinear windows on the main floor display room provide ample natural light. Rectilinear casement style windows on all second floor rooms complement
the linear Prairie Style. Stone cornice and pillars are rectilinear and lacking ornamental clutter. In the main floor showroom, a section of the original tin
ceiling has been preserved, and is on display. A new prism glass inlay was installed above the showroom windows to match the original prism glass that
was demolished in past remodeling. In the second floor rooms, all the original oak trim, wood floors, original gas fireplace, and stained glass windows are
preserved. The original gas lights, tubular communication system, and plumbing fixtures have all been updated. The original glass prism blocks installed in
the sidewalks were demolished by the village during the 1970 streetscape improvement. The adaptability of the Prairie Style is revealed in its ability to be
remodeled and still maintain its architectural significance.
Criterion 5: The 3 Longcommon building is located in the central business district next to 5 and 7 Longcommon buildings, all with complementary Prairie
Style design. There are similar style buildings on the south side of East Burlington Road. The significance of these several buildings is that they were all
built during the early 1900s in order to meet the service needs of a growing Riverside community. With some facade improvements, these buildings will
add to the variety and beauty of a life that is daily more mechanized and stereotyped.
"Any historic environment has a network of pivotal or focal buildings as its foundation. Upon this framework hangs a series of anonymous structures -
anonymous to their average aesthetic quality and limited associative values. Together, whether separated by parks and roadways, these linkages of
anonymous structures provide the walls of continuity that create the definitive historical quality of the area".
-William Murtagh
Criterion 6: Scoville Square Building, corner of Lake Street and Oak Park Avenue National Register building. (Ord. 2616, 6-4-2007)

Address: 65-6973 Longcommon Road
Legal Description:
Lots 778, 779 in Block 5 in "Third Division of Riverside", in the Northwest Quarter of Section 36, Township 39 North, Range 12 East of the Third Principal
Meridian, in Cook County, Illinois.
Permanent Tax Index No.: 15-36-109-083-1001 through 1019
Architectural Style: Gothic Revival
Significance:
Criterion 1: As one of our only courtyard, multi-residential buildings of the early part of the last century, this building is noteworthy due to its interesting
design features and remarkably pristine integrity. For this reason, it has significant value as part of the architectural heritage of the village.
This category also offers a unique historic connection. It was the introductory location for many residents who started in this Riverside apartment house or
condominium and subsequently moved to their own homes elsewhere in the village.
Criterion 4: Its most salient feature is the castlelike appearance with crenelated parapets facing the courtyard. Each story has the different stone trim with
major belt courses below the first floor and above the third floor windows. Original wood windows facing the courtyard are tall and narrow, single light,
interior opening casement windows.
Formal three-story, flat roof, brick and stone building facing Longcommon Rd. containing nineteen (19) condominium units. The three (3) building complex
is set far back from the street and its footprint follows the curve of the street in front. There are a number of mature trees in the front yard and a U-shaped
driveway.
The wide courtyard has paths leading to three (3) entrances, each with an ornamental crest above the doors. Entrances have a vestibule and the stairwells
above have original lead glass casement windows. Each entrance is flanked by three-story bays. Many shrubs and flowers adorn the courtyard. The view
toward the street shows a majestic panorama of foliage and flowers. The courtyard is accessed through brick and stone gates with wrought iron fencing
which connect to matching wing walls attached to the buildings.

Criterion 5: Surrounded primarily by stately older homes, the building is located at the head of Longcommon Park, where Longcommon Road is joined by
Nuttall and Herrick Roads. The complex is clearly an established and familiar visual feature of the village. Its sheer scale, prominence and street presence
on the main thoroughfare through town are noteworthy and would be missed if not present. (Ord. 2662, 12-17-2007)
