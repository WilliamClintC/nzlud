of not less than three-fifths vote of all the members of the city council. In
making appointments and filling vacancies, the city shall comply with
Government Code Section 54970, et seq., requiring open lists of local
appointive offices; provided that upon a finding that an emergency exists, an
unscheduled vacancy may be filled immediately without notice, on an acting
basis until a final appointment is made.



   C.   The commission, by a majority vote, shall annually, at its June
meeting, elect a chairman who shall serve at the pleasure of the commission.
If a vacancy should occur in the office of chairman, the commission shall
elect a new chairman who shall serve for the unexpired term. The chairman
shall preside at all meetings of the commission and execute documents on
behalf of the commission.



   D.   The commission shall designate one officer of the city to serve
as secretary to the commission, subject to the confirmation of the city

preserving all records of the commission at City Hall, including minutes of
each meeting, and is designated as the official upon or with whom all
notices, requests for hearing, complaints, and other documents relating to
civil service shall be served and filed. The secretary shall perform such
other duties as the city council or the commission shall require.



   E.   The city attorney shall serve as the legal advisor to the
commission in all matters except in a hearing where, due to the city
attorney's prior involvement with the parties, the city attorney will
represent one of the parties or otherwise must withdraw from representing the
commission.



   F.   During their tenure of office, and for a period of one year
thereafter, a member of the civil service commission shall be disqualified

contract with the city, or with any officer thereof in his/her official
capacity, or in doing any work or furnishing any supplies.

2.80.050   Meetings.



   A.   The civil service commission shall meet monthly in the offices
of the City Hall at such time and day as the commission may establish, and
such other day and at such other times as may be specified in an order of
adjournment or in an order for a special meeting, which order may be issued
by the chairman or three members of the commission.



   B.   At any meeting of the commission, three members shall
constitute a quorum for purposes of conducting business or meetings. Unless
otherwise provided, a majority vote of those present and voting shall be
sufficient to adopt any motion.



   C.   All meetings of the commission shall be conducted in accordance
with Robert's Rules of Order. The commission may adopt and amend by-laws for
the governance of its meetings and proceedings, which shall be ratified by
the city council.

(Ord. 91-08-1111 §§ 3, 4; Ord. 86-03-970 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.80.051   Compensation.



   The members of the civil service commission shall receive such monthly
compensation for their services as the city council may establish from time
to time by resolution. This compensation shall be in addition to any funds
paid and reimbursement for reasonable and actual costs and expenses.



(Ord. 95-06-1194 § 3)



2.80.052   Attendance of commissioners.



   A.   It shall be the obligation of members of the civil service
commission to attend all meetings, whether regular or special, of the civil
service commission, except for good cause. If a commissioner knows he or she
will be unable to attend a meeting of the commission, the commissioner must
contact the chairperson of the commission or the staff member assigned to the
commission prior to the time established for commencement of the meeting. The
commissioner must explain his or her reasons for being absent. At the
beginning of the commission meeting, the chairperson shall inform the
commission of the reason for the absence of any commissioner, and the
commission shall determine whether such absence stems from good cause and
whether such absence is excused or unexcused. Failure by any commissioner to
make said contact prior to the commencement of the commission meeting shall
automatically be deemed an unexcused absence.



   B.   In the event that any commissioner arrives at a meeting after
the commission determines that the commissioner's absence is unexcused, the
commissioner may give his or her reasons for being late, and the commission
may then rescind its prior action and find such absence to be excused, but
otherwise, the late arrival shall be deemed an unexcused absence.



   C.   After a commissioner has accumulated three unexcused absences
in any calendar year, and upon the occurrence of the next unexcused absence,
the commissioner shall be deemed to be automatically removed from the
commission, and their office shall be deemed vacated by operation of law.



   D.   A commissioner who misses any regular commission meeting due to
an unexcused absence shall not be entitled to receive compensation for such
meeting. Attending ad hoc or committee meetings on behalf of the city is on a
volunteer basis and commissioners shall not receive any compensation for
attending such meetings. (Ord. 2016-11-1943 § 2; Ord. 88-09-1014 § 3)



2.80.055   Functions and authority.



   A.   The functions of the civil service commission shall be as
follows:



   1.   As provided by this chapter, the commission shall hear appeals
submitted by any person in the classified service relative to any suspension,
dismissal, demotion, or reduction in pay, and to certify its findings and
recommendations as provided in this chapter.



   2.   The commission shall certify to the appointing power a list of
all persons eligible for appointment to the appropriate position in the
classified service. Such eligibility list shall be established by the
personnel officer, as provided by this chapter and on the basis of merit and
fitness ascertained so far as practicable by competitive examination. The
commission, at its discretion, shall have available to it any and all
documents, tests, examinations, work samples, or any combination of these
which will, in the opinion of the commission, demonstrate the fair and
impartial administration of the examination process by the personnel officer.



   3.   When requested by the council, the commission shall hold
hearings and make recommendations on any matter of personnel administration
within the limits of the requests of the council.



   4.   The commission may, at the request of the city council, review
any and all information in the personnel file of an employee in the
classified service.



   B.   The commission is authorized to adopt resolutions and take all
actions necessary and proper to carry out the functions of the commission
pursuant to this section and this chapter, including, but not limited to:



   1.   In any investigation or hearing conducted by the commission, it
shall have the power to examine witnesses under oath and compel their
attendance or the production of evidence by subpoenas issued under the
authority of the city council and attested to by the city clerk. It shall be
the duty of the chief of police to cause all such subpoenas to be served, and
the refusal of a person to attend or to testify in answer to such a subpoena
shall subject the person to prosecution in the same manner set forth by law
for failure to appear before the council in response to a subpoena issued by
the council. Each member of the commission shall have the power to administer
oaths to witnesses.



   2.   The commission shall conduct appeal hearings in accordance with
the procedures contained in Section 2.80.560.



   3.   The commission may request that the city council appoint a
hearing officer to conduct hearings, gather evidence, prepare findings,
and/or make recommendations to the commission.



(Ord. 86-03-970 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.80.060   Classification plan.



   A.   The personnel officer, or a person or agency employed for that
purpose, shall ascertain and record the duties and responsibilities of all
positions in the competitive service and, after consultation with appointing
authorities and heads of departments affected, shall recommend a
classification plan for the positions. The classification plan shall consist
of classes of positions in the competitive service defined by class
specifications, including title, a description of typical duties and
responsibilities of positions in each class, and a statement of the training,
experience and other qualifications to be required of applicants for
positions in each class. Class specifications are explanatory, but not
restricting. The listing of particular tasks shall not preclude the
assignment of other related kinds of tasks, or jobs requiring lesser skills.
The classification plan shall be developed and maintained, that all positions
substantially similar with respect to duties, authority, character of work,
and qualifications are included within the same class, and that the same
schedules of compensation may be made to apply with equity under like working
conditions to all positions in the same class.



   B.   In the preparation of the classification plan, the personnel
officer shall allocate every position in the competitive service to one of
the classes established by the plan. Before the classification plan or any
part thereof shall become effective, it shall first be approved in whole or
in part by the city council. Upon adoption by the council, by resolution, the
provisions of the classification plan shall be observed in the handling of
all personnel actions and activities. The classification plan shall be
amended or revised as occasion requires in the same manner as originally
established.



   C.   When a new position is created, before the same may be filled,
and except as otherwise provided by the personnel system, no person shall be
appointed or employed to fill any such position until the classification plan
shall have been amended to provide therefor, and an appropriate eligible list
has been established for such position.



   D.   Positions in which the duties have changed materially, so as to
necessitate reclassification, shall be allocated to a more appropriate class,
whether new or already created, in the same manner as originally classified
and allocated. Reclassifications shall not be used for the purpose of
avoiding restrictions surrounding demotions and promotions.



(Ord. 86-03-970 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.80.100   Filling vacancies.



   All vacancies, other than temporary vacancies, in the competitive
service, shall be filled by reinstatement, reemployment, transfer, demotion,
or from eligibiles on an appropriate eligibility or promotional list, if
available. In the absence of persons eligible for appointment in the above
manner, temporary appointments may be in accordance with these rules and
regulations. The civil service commission shall be informed of all
appointments at the next regularly scheduled commission meeting.



(Ord. 86-03-970 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.80.110   Certification of eligibles.



   A.   The personnel officer shall determine whether it is desired to
fill a vacancy by reinstatement, reemployment, transfer, demotion, or whether
appointment from a promotional or eligibility list is preferred. The names of
persons willing to accept appointment from a promotional or eligibility list
shall be certified by the civil service commission prior to appointment.
Appointments may be made from any persons appearing on the eligibility list.
If sufficient names are not available on the list, as established in
accordance with Section 2.80.370, then a temporary appointment may be
effected until eligibles can be certified after appropriate examination. If
the temporary employee does not successfully pass the examination, he/she
shall be terminated and replaced by a person appearing on a new eligible list.



   B.   The personnel officer may certify names from the list for a
higher classification in order to fill a vacancy in a lower classification
when job duties are of a similar nature and the eligibility list for the
higher classification has been certified by the civil service commission. In
no case shall names be certified from a list for a lower classification to
fill a vacancy in a higher classification.



(Ord. 86-03-970 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.80.120   Appointment.



   A.   After interview and investigation, the personnel officer shall
effect the appointment by notifying the applicant, and if the applicant
accepts the appointment and presents himself/herself for duty within the
period of time the appointing authority prescribes, he/she shall be deemed to
be appointed; otherwise he/she shall be deemed to have declined the
appointment.



   B.   Appointments, as designated below in this subsection, shall be
considered "at will," and the employee shall have no property or vested
rights in his/her position. Before such an appointment shall become
effective, except for a probationary employee, the prospective appointee
shall sign a statement indicating that he/she acknowledges that he/she may be
terminated for any reason, with or without cause, without right of appeal,
and that he/she may have limited benefit accrual under the personnel system.
Such appointments are as follows:



   1.   Emergency appointments;



   2.   Temporary appointments;



   3.   Industrial appointments;



   4.   Long-term illness appointments;



   5.   Probationary appointments;



   6.   Interim appointments;



   7.   Acting appointments.



   C.   The civil service commission, at its next regularly scheduled
meeting, shall be informed of any appointments under this section.



(Ord. 86-03-970 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.80.130   Reinstatement.



   With the approval of the personnel officer and following notification
of the civil service commission, an employee who has resigned with a good
record may be reinstated without examination within two years, to his/her
former position, if vacant, or to a vacant position in the same or a
comparable class, or to a position in a lower classification. A reinstated
employee shall serve the probationary period prescribed for that class and,
for purposes of benefit accrual, begins with new employee status. The
reinstated employee may be appointed at a higher step than the entry level
with the approval of the city manager.



(Ord. 86-03-970 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.80.140   Emergency appointments.



   To meet the immediate requirements of an emergency condition, such as
fire, flood, earthquake, or other public calamity, which threatens life or
property, the appointing authority may employ such persons as may be needed
for the duration of the emergency without regard to the personnel rules
affecting appointments. Such appointments shall be reported to the personnel
officer as soon as possible, and to the civil service commission at its next
regularly scheduled meeting. No emergency appointment shall exceed sixty
working days, nor shall an individual hold successive emergency appointments.
No position shall be filled by a succession of emergency appointments.



(Ord. 86-03-970 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.80.150   Temporary appointments.



   Temporary appointments of persons who appear to possess the minimum
standards or qualifications for a position may be made by the personnel
officer. Such appointments shall not continue for a period in excess of six
months in any fiscal year unless approved by the city manager. Temporary
appointments shall be reported to the civil service commission at its next
regularly scheduled meeting. Temporary employees shall not be entitled to
fringe benefits. No credit shall be allowed upon an application or in the
giving of an examination for service rendered under a temporary appointment.
However, if a temporary appointment is converted to a probationary
appointment without interruption of service, the period of temporary service
may be credited towards the completion of the probationary period, but no
accrual of sick or annual vacation leave may be allowed for the period of
service that the temporary appointee has served and received compensation for
as provided in these rules. All temporary appointments must be made within
budget limitation. A temporary employee may be removed at any time without
the right of appeal or hearing.



(Ord. 86-03-970 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.80.160   Industrial appointments.



   Where a vacancy occurs as a result of a 4850 industrial leave which
extends beyond ninety days, it shall be filled in accordance with Sections
2.80.110 and 2.80.120(B). In the event that the original employee returns to
the position and subsequently goes on another 4850 industrial leave, the
person previously appointed to fill the vacancy created by the previous 4850
industrial leave may be reinstated, or a new appointment made, at the option
of the department head. The civil service commission, at its next regularly
scheduled meeting, shall be informed of any industrial appointments made. Any
industrial appointee shall receive all of the regular benefits of employees
in the classified service except that he or she shall continue to be deemed a
probationary employee without vested rights to his or her position until such
time as the original employee leaves the service of the city or the appointee
is transferred to a different position.



(Ord. 86-03-970 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.80.170   Long-term illness appointments.



   Wherever a vacancy occurs as a result of a long-term illness leave
which extends beyond ninety days, it shall be filled in accordance with
Sections 2.80.100 and 2.80.120(B). In the event that the original employee
returns to the position and subsequently goes on another long-term illness
leave, the person previously appointed to fill the vacancy created by the
previous long-term illness leave may be reinstated, or a new appointment
made, at the option of the department head. The civil service commission, at
its next regularly scheduled meeting shall be informed of any long-term
illness appointments made. Any long-term illness appointee shall receive all
of the regular benefits of employees in the classified service except that he
or she shall continue to be deemed a probationary employee without vested
rights to his or her position until such time as the original employee leaves
the service of the city or the appointee is transferred to a different
position.



(Ord. 86-03-970 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.80.200   Preparation of compensation plan.



   A.   The personnel officer or the person or agency employed for that
purpose shall prepare a pay plan covering all classes of positions in the
service, showing the minimum, intermediate (if applicable), and maximum rate
of pay. The personnel officer or the person or agency employed for that
purpose shall thereafter make such further studies of the compensation plan
as may be requested by the city council.



   B.   The personnel officer shall submit the proposed pay plan to the
city council. The council shall adopt, or amend and adopt, the proposed plan,
but no pay plan shall be effective until approved by the city council.
Thereafter, no position shall be assigned a salary higher than the maximum or
lower than the minimum salary provided for that class of position unless the
salary schedule for the class is amended in the same manner as herein
provided for its adoption.



(Ord. 86-03-970 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.80.205   Salary at appointment.



   Except as otherwise provided by this section, all new employees shall
be appointed at the first step of the salary range for the particular class
in which the appointment is made. When in the judgment of the city manager
and with the recommendation of the department head, the education, training
and experience of a proposed employee are superior and justify a salary in
excess of the first step, the city manager may authorize an appointment to a
position at a higher step in the salary range. Initial employment at a salary
step other than the first step may be authorized by the city manager when a
particularly difficult recruiting problem for a class is found to exist.



(Ord. 86-03-970 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.80.210   Advancement within salary range.



   Advancement within a salary range shall be authorized only after the
affirmative recommendation of the department head and with the approval of
the city manager. Only interim, probationary and permanent employees holding
positions allocated to a salary range shall be eligible for such advancement.
Such recommendation may be made only on the basis of satisfactory job
performance. No salary advancement shall be made which will exceed the
maximum rate established in the pay plan.



(Ord. 86-03-970 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.80.215   Salary anniversary date.



   A.   Appointment at First Step of Salary Range. A person appointed
at the first step of the salary range for the class to which his/her position
is allocated shall have a salary anniversary date which shall be six months
from the date of his/her appointment, promotion, or reinstatement.



   B.   Appointment Above First Step of Salary Range. A person
appointed at a step higher than the first step of the salary range for the
class to which his/her position is allocated shall have a salary anniversary
date which shall be twelve months from the date of his/her appointment,
promotion, or reinstatement.



(Ord. 86-03-970 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.80.220   Step advancement.



   A.   All employees shall be eligible to be advanced through the five
steps in their respective salary schedules in the following manner:



   1.   Step A. The first step is the minimum rate and shall normally
be the hiring rate for the class. No employee shall be considered to be on
permanent status until he or she has satisfactorily completed the
probationary period.



   2.   Step B. The second step is a rate which a qualified,
experienced, and conscientious employee may merit following the completion of
six months' satisfactory service in Step A.



   3.   Step C. The third step is the rate which a qualified,
experienced and conscientious employee may merit following the completion of
one year's satisfactory service in Step B.



   4.   Step D. The fourth step is the rate which a fully qualified,
experienced and conscientious employee may merit following the completion of
a minimum of one year's satisfactory service in Step C.



   5.   Step E. The fifth step is the rate which a fully qualified,
experienced, and conscientious employee may merit following the completion of
a minimum of one year's satisfactory service in Step D.



   B.   The city manager may authorize the advancement of an employee
to any of the last four steps of his/her allocated salary schedule earlier
than would normally be attained if exceptional performance warrants. The
recommendation for such advancement shall normally be initiated by the
respective department head.



(Ord. 86-03-970 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.80.225   Advancement procedure.



   The following provisions shall govern the normal advancement procedures
for employees assigned to positions having a salary range:



   A.   Notification of Eligibility to Department Head. Thirty days
prior to each employee's salary anniversary date and annually thereafter
until the employee reaches the maximum step of the salary range for his/her
class, the personnel officer shall advise the department head in writing of
the employee's pending eligibility for a merit salary increase. The
department head shall subsequently advise the personnel officer in writing
prior to the employee's salary anniversary date whether or not he/she
recommends advancement of the employee to the next higher step in the
appropriate salary range.



   B.   Notification of Authorization to Finance Director. If the
department head recommends the advancement of the employee to the next higher
salary step, and the city manager approves such advancement, the personnel
officer shall notify the finance director in writing of the approval merit
salary increase, and such notification shall constitute authorization for the
finance director to make payment to the employee at the specified higher
rate. Such payment shall commence at the beginning of the pay period in which
the employee's salary anniversary date falls.



   C.   Postponement of Merit Salary Increase. If a department head
recommends that advancement of the employee to the next higher salary step be
postponed pending further review of the employee's job performance, and the
city manager approves, the employee will not be assigned a new salary
anniversary date providing that said postponement does not exceed a period of
three months. If during or at the conclusion of the period of postponement,
the department head recommends that the employee be advanced to the next
higher salary step, the personnel officer shall notify the finance director
in writing and such notification constitutes authorization for the finance
director to make payment to the employee at the specified higher rate. Such
payment shall commence at the beginning of the pay period in which the
recommendation is made. If said postponement exceeds three months, the
employee will be assigned a new salary anniversary date which shall be the
date to which his/her previous salary anniversary date was postponed.



   D.   Failure to Notify Department Head of Employee's Eligibility.
Should an employee's salary anniversary date be overlooked through error, and
upon discovery of the error, the employee is recommended for a merit salary
increase, the finance director shall, on the next regular paycheck, include
payment compensating the employee from the beginning of the pay period in
which his/her salary anniversary falls.



   E.   Error in Determination of Correct Salary Rate.



   1.   Should an employee be advanced to a higher step in the salary
range for his/her class than for which he/she was recommended through error,
such error shall be corrected immediately following its discovery.
Reimbursement to the city by the employee for said error shall be made by
reduction of next or subsequent paychecks or any other method mutually agreed
to.



   2.   Determination of which one or combination of the above methods
of reimbursements should be used shall be made by the department head subject
to the approval of the personnel officer. Should the employee terminate
before full reimbursement to the city has been made, the money required to
complete reimbursement shall be deducted from his/her final paycheck.



   F.   Adjustment in Salary Anniversary Date Due to Leave of Absence.
The granting of any leave of absence without pay exceeding fifteen
consecutive calendar days shall cause the employee's salary anniversary date
to be postponed by the number of calendar days for which such leave of
absence has been granted, less the first fifteen calendar days of such leave.
The employee shall be assigned a new salary anniversary date which shall be
the date to which his/her previous salary anniversary date has been postponed.



(Ord. 86-03-970 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.80.230   Salary on promotion.



   An employee who is appointed to a position in a class allocated to a
higher salary range than the class in which he/she formerly occupied a
position shall receive the nearest higher monthly salary which is at least
five percent higher than his/her previous base salary but in no case shall
he/she be compensated above the top step of the new salary range unless the
city council grants special approval. Payment in such new salary range shall
commence at the beginning of the pay period in which the appointment became
effective as indicated on the city personnel action form. The effective date
of the promotion shall be the employee's new salary anniversary date.



(Ord. 86-03-970 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.80.235   Salary on transfer.



   A.   After notice to the personnel officer, an employee may be
transferred by the department head at any time from one position to another
position in the same or a comparable class.



   B.   An employee who is transferred from one position to another in
the same class or to another position in a class having the same salary range
shall be compensated at the same step in the salary range he/she previously
received. The employee's salary anniversary date shall remain the same as it
was before transfer.



(Ord. 86-03-970 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.80.240   Salary upon appointment to a position in an acting capacity.



   A.   Whenever the needs of the city require an employee to
temporarily perform the duties of a higher classification than that in which
the employee is currently employed for a period of more than fifteen
consecutive working days, the employee shall receive the salary rate of the
higher class in which he/she is performing the required duties. In such
cases, the employee shall be paid at an appropriate step of the salary
schedule of the higher classification which will assure an increase of not
less than five percent greater than the salary of his/her current position,
but in no case shall such salary exceed the top salary step of the higher
classification. The higher salary rate payable shall commence on the
sixteenth working day following the temporary reassignment to the performance
of duties of the higher classification. The requirement for the performance
of duties of the higher classification shall be placed in writing by the
personnel officer following recommendation by the affected department head.
No employee shall be required to perform any of the duties of a higher
classification unless that employee is deemed to possess the minimum
qualifications of the higher classification by the personnel officer as
recommended by the affected department head.



   B.   The employee assigned to perform the duties of a higher
classification shall not serve for more than ninety working days in a higher
classification whenever a vacancy exists (or it is apparent that a vacancy
will be present) without the announcement by the personnel officer of an
approved examination as otherwise provided in this chapter. In no case shall
an employee serve more than six months in a higher classification without
passing the examination.



   C.   A person appointed in an acting capacity shall be eligible to
receive merit increases in his/her permanent position during the acting
appointment but shall not be entitled to merit increases in the position
which he/she holds in an acting capacity. If successful in being promoted,
the period of time of service in the higher classification shall be credited
to the promoted employee toward the required period of probation for the
higher classification as otherwise required in this chapter.



   D.   The personnel officer shall obtain the employee's written
consent for the temporary performance of any of the duties of the higher
classification beyond a period of fifteen working days, prior to an
employee's assuming or continuing the duties and compensation of a higher
classification, which consent shall clearly state that it is understood that
a reduction in salary shall be effected to his/her original salary rate upon
the expiration of the need for the performance of the duties of the higher
classification. In no instance shall the salary rate of the higher
classification extend beyond the six-month period as hereinabove set forth,
unless otherwise promoted in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

2.80.245   Salary on reinstatement.



   Notwithstanding other provisions of this chapter, a person reinstated
(within two years) in (A) a position allocated to a class in which he/she
previously held regular status and from which he/she was separated in good
standing, or (B) a position allocated to a class which is comparable (as
determined by the city) to a position in which he/she previously held regular
status and from which he/she was separated in good standing, may, with the
approval of the city manager and the head of the department in which he/she
would be reinstated, be appointed to the same step of the salary range for
the particular class of position as the step which he/she occupied at the
effective date of his/her resignation. Upon reinstatement, the employee's
salary anniversary date shall be determined as provided by Section 2.80.215.



(Ord. 86-03-970 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.80.250   Salary on suspension.



   An employee who has been suspended without pay from his/her position
shall not receive his/her salary for the duration of the suspension.
Suspended employees will continue to accrue vacation and sick leave benefits
for suspensions of thirty working days or fewer.



(Ord. 86-03-970 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.80.255   Salary on demotion.



   The salary of an employee who is demoted to a position in a class
allocated to a lower salary range than the class in which he/she formerly
occupied a position shall be determined as follows:



   A.   Involuntary Demotion. An employee who is involuntarily demoted
to a position in a class allocated to a lower salary range than the class in
which he/she formerly occupied a position shall have his/her monthly salary
reduced to the nearest lower monthly salary rate in the salary range for the
class to which he/she has been demoted. In lieu of a reduction in salary, the
city manager may approve a "Y" rate for the employee. He/she shall not be
required to serve a probationary period in the lower position unless he/she
has not completed his/her initial probationary period as required by this
chapter. In such case, he/she will be required to complete his/her
probationary period in the lower position. The employee shall retain the
salary anniversary date he/she had in the higher position.



   B.   Voluntary Demotion. An employee who is demoted at his/her own
request to a position in a class allocated to a lower salary range than the
class in which he/she formerly occupied a position shall have his/her monthly
salary reduced to the nearest lower monthly salary in the salary range for
the class to which he/she has been demoted. In lieu of a reduction in salary,
the city manager may approve a "Y" rate for the employee. He/she shall not be
required to serve a probationary period in the lower position unless he/she
has not completed his/her initial probationary period as required by this
chapter. In such case, he/she will be required to complete his/her
probationary period in the lower position. The employee shall retain the
salary anniversary date he/she had in the higher position.



(Ord. 86-03-970 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.80.260   Changes in salary allocation.



   Whenever a classification is reallocated to a new salary range, the
salary of any employee in that classification (except an employee in an
acting capacity) shall be determined as follows:



   A.   Allocation to a Higher Salary Range. If the class is
reallocated to a higher salary range, the employee shall be compensated at
the step in the new salary range which is most nearly equivalent to what
he/she was receiving in the range to which the class was previously
allocated. With the approval of the personnel officer, the employee may be
compensated at the same step in the new salary range as he/she was receiving
at the range to which the class was previously allocated. The employee's
anniversary date shall not change.



   B.   Allocation to a Lower Range. If the class is reallocated to a
lower salary range the salary of the employee shall not change unless it is
greater than the maximum step of the lower salary range, in which case, it
shall be reduced to the maximum step of the new range. In lieu of a reduction
in salary, the city manager may approve a "Y" rate for the employee. The
employee's salary anniversary date shall not change.



(Ord. 86-03-970 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.80.265   Salary on position reclassification.



   The salary of an employee in a position that is reclassified shall be
determined as follows:



   A.   Class with Same Salary Range. If the position is reclassified
to a class with the same salary range as the previous class, and if the
incumbent is appointed to the reclassified position, the salary range and
salary anniversary date of the employee shall not change. This provision
shall also apply to the change of class title, provided there is no change in
the basic duties of the position.



   B.   Class with Higher Salary Range. If the position is reclassified
to a class with a higher salary range than the previous classification, and
if the incumbent is appointed to the reclassified position, he/she shall be
compensated at the step in the new salary range which comes nearest to but
not less than five percent higher than the step he/she held in the previous
salary range. The salary anniversary date shall be established in accordance
with Section 2.80.215. The salary of the employee serving in an acting
capacity shall be reestablished based on the provisions concerning
appointments to acting positions.



   C.   Class with Lower Salary Range. If the position is reclassified
to a class with a lower salary range than the previous class, and if the
incumbent is appointed to the reclassified position, his/her salary shall not
change unless it is greater than the maximum step of the lower salary range,
in which case it shall be reduced to the maximum step of the new range. In
lieu of a reduction in salary, the city manager may approve a "Y" rate for
the employee. The incumbent's salary anniversary date shall not change. The
salary of the employee serving in an acting capacity shall be reestablished
based on the provisions concerning appointments to acting positions.



(Ord. 86-03-970 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.80.270   Council authority to specify salary.



   Notwithstanding anything in this chapter to the contrary, the city
council may by resolution, upon recommendation of the city manager, specify
that the incumbent of a particular position shall occupy a step on the salary
range for that class either higher or lower than that provided for elsewhere
in this chapter.



(Ord. 86-03-970 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.80.280   Additional compensation.



   Notwithstanding anything in this chapter to the contrary, when in the
judgment of the city council it becomes necessary or desirable to utilize the
service of city employees in capacities other than those for which they are
regularly employed, the city council may, by minute order, so authorize and
fix an additional rate of compensation for such employees, and they shall be
paid in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.



(Ord. 86-03-970 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.80.300   Job announcements for recruitment.



   All positions to be filled competitively in the classified service
shall be publicized by posting announcements on the city's official bulletin
board, or in such other places as the civil service commission deems
advisable. The announcements shall specify the title and pay range of the
class for which the examination is announced; the nature of the work to be
performed; preparation desirable for the performance of the work of the
class; the date, time, place and manner of making applications; the closing
date for receiving applications; the minimum requirements for the position;
and other pertinent information. Special recruitment methods may be utilized
as necessary to insure that the employment needs of the city are met.



(Ord. 86-03-970 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.80.310   Application forms.



   Applications shall be made on forms provided by the personnel officer.
Such forms shall require information covering training, experience, and other
pertinent information as deemed necessary by the personnel officer. All
applications must be signed by the person applying. Applications received at
times other than following announcements as set forth above shall be
destroyed or returned to the applicant at the discretion of the personnel
officer.



(Ord. 86-03-970 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.80.320   Disqualification.



   A.   The personnel officer shall reject any application which
indicates on its face that the applicant does not possess the minimum
qualifications required for the position or when the application is not
properly completed. Applications shall also be rejected if the applicant is
physically unfit for the performance of duties of the position to which
he/she seeks appointment; is addicted to the habitual use of drugs or
intoxicating liquor; has been convicted of a crime which would impede his/her
ability to perform the job for which he/she is applying; is not legally
permitted to work within the United States; has made any false statement of
any material fact or practiced or attempted to practice any deception or
fraud in his/her application; or other reasons which would indicate that the
applicant is unfit for the position. Whenever an application is rejected,
notice of such rejection shall be mailed to the applicant by the personnel
officer. Defective applications may be returned to the applicant with notice
to amend same providing the time limit for receiving applications has not
expired.



   B.   As part of the review of an application, the personnel officer
is empowered to obtain summary criminal history information and local summary
criminal history information, as defined in Sections 11105 and 13300 of the
California Penal Code, for the sole purpose of determining whether or not an
applicant is addicted to the habitual or excessive use of drugs or
intoxicating liquor, or has been convicted of a crime which would impede
his/her ability to perform the job for which he/she is applying.



(Ord. 86-03-970 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.80.330   Physical requirements.



   The city requires that all applicants and employees be in such physical
or mental condition to perform the duties of their jobs and may require
periodic medical or psychological evaluation. No employee shall hold any
position in a classification in which he/she cannot physically or mentally
perform all the duties of the job adequately or without hazard to the
employee or others. Within the limitations indicated, the city's policy shall
be to make such efforts as are consistent with the provisions of these rules
and regulations to place physically disabled employees in such positions as
are available in the city service where their disabilities will not affect
their performance of duties. A disabled employee's length of service, nature
of past performance, and the availability of openings may be considered in
placing him or her.



(Ord. 86-03-970 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.80.350   Examinations.



   Examinations for employment shall be competitive and shall include any
technique which, in the opinion of the civil service commission, fairly
measures the job related qualifications of applicants. These may include
written tests, interviews, performance tests, assessment centers, physical
ability tests, prior training, experience and education, or any combination
of the above. The city may contract with any competent agency or individual
for the performance by such agency or individual of the responsibility for
giving or scoring examinations.



(Ord. 86-03-970 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.80.360   Qualifying grade and rating examinations.



   A.   In all examinations the minimum grade or standing for which
eligibility may be earned shall be based upon all factors in the examination,
including educational requirements, experience, and other qualifying elements
as shown in the application of the candidate or other verified information.
Failure in one part of the examination may be grounds for disqualifying the
applicant from further consideration for the position or from subsequent
parts of an examination.



   B.   Prior to appointment to a position in the competitive service,
a person may be required to pass a medical and/or physical examination to the
satisfaction of the personnel officer. The scope and type of examination is
to be determined by the personnel officer. If a person fails to pass such an
examination, he/she may be disqualified from consideration for employment.



(Ord. 86-03-970 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.80.370   Eligibility lists.



   A.   Eligibility lists will be established following examinations
listing the names of those applicants who qualified in the examination,
arranged in order of the scores received. These applicants will be considered
qualified for appointment, pending further review by the appointing power and
other qualifying procedures such as background investigations, reference
checks, polygraph, and medical examinations. Eligibility lists shall be valid
and in effect for a period of one year. An eligibility list may be extended
by action of the personnel officer for additional six month periods, but in
no event shall a list remain in effect for more than two years. If fewer than
three qualified applicants are available for appointment, the personnel
officer may declare the list invalid and announce a new recruitment and
examination period. Names of those not chosen from an eligibility list that
is less than one year old may be merged with names on a newly established
list for the same classification, but such names shall not remain on the new
list for more than twelve months from the date of the applicant's original
examination.



   B.   The personnel officer shall remove names from an eligibility
list for any of the following reasons:



   1.   If an eligible requests orally or in writing that his/her name
be removed;



   2.   If an eligible fails to accept an offer of employment within
ten days following the forwarding of such offer;



   3.   If an eligible on a promotional list resigns from the service;



   4.   If an eligible in a medical examiner's opinion does not meet
the physical, medical or mental parameters established for the position;



   5.   If a person on the eligibility list leaves no forwarding
address at which he/she can be contacted by registered mail;



   6.   If an appointing power can demonstrate that the eligible would
be incompatible with the city service as ascertained through background
investigations;



   7.   When a person's name is removed from an eligibility list by the
personnel office, the civil service commission shall be informed with the
reason for the removal at its next regularly scheduled meeting.



(Ord. 86-03-970 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.80.380   Notification of results.



   Every applicant taking part in the examination process shall be given
written notice of the results. Any applicant shall have the right to review
his/her own test results within five working days after notification of the
examination results. An error in rating or grading, called to the attention
of the personnel officer within one month after the effective date of the
eligibility list, shall be corrected. Any correction shall not, however,
invalidate certification of an appointment previously made.



(Ord. 86-03-970 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.80.400   Probationary period.



   A.   All original and promotional appointments shall be tentative
and subject to a probationary period of not fewer than twelve months.



   B.   The probationary period shall be regarded as part of the
testing process and shall be utilized for closely observing the employee's
work, for securing the most effective adjustment of a new employee to his/her
position, and for rejecting any probationary employee whose performance does
not meet the required standards of work. A department head may recommend, and
the city manager may extend, an employee's probationary period by a maximum
of six months, in three-month increments.



   C.   Probationary employees do not have property or vested rights to
their positions with the city. During the probationary period, an employee
may be rejected at any time by the appointing power without cause and without
the right of appeal. Notification of rejection in writing shall be served on
the probationer and a copy shall be filed with the personnel officer.



   D.   If the service of the probationary employee has been
satisfactory, then the appointing power shall file with the personnel officer
a statement to that effect.



   E.   Any employee rejected during the probationary period following
a promotional appointment shall be reinstated to the position from which
he/she was promoted unless charges are filed and he/she is discharged in the
manner provided in this chapter for positions in the competitive service.



(Ord. 86-03-970 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.80.410   Employee performance evaluation.



   A.   A report of performance of each probationary employee shall be
made every three months by the respective department heads or their designees
on a form provided by the personnel officer. A performance report for regular
employees shall be prepared within thirty days prior to the salary
anniversary date each year. In addition, a report may be prepared at any time
at the discretion of the employee's supervisor.



   B.   Each performance evaluation shall be thoroughly discussed with
the employee to point out areas of successful performance and areas that need
improvement. The employee shall sign the performance report to acknowledge
that he/she is aware of its contents and has discussed the report with the
evaluator. The employee's signature does not imply that he/she fully agrees
with the contents of the report.



   C.   Reports shall be prepared with a copy to the employee, the
department's file, and to the personnel officer for retention in the
employee's employment history file.



(Ord. 86-03-970 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.80.420   Layoff procedure.



   A.   For reasons of economy or efficiency, reductions or elimination
of city services may be required, and it may be necessary to layoff one or
more city employees. The layoff procedure is intended to give consideration
to both seniority and competency whenever the layoff of employees is
necessary.



   B.   1. Determination of a need for layoff will be made by the city
council. Classifications to be affected and the number of employees included
will be determined by the city council.



   2.   Within the classification, employees will be ranked by
seniority and ranked by competency. After six months, an employee carries
seniority in the new position with him/her into the new classification.
Seniority is computed from the date of probationary appointment to a
full-time position.



   C.   1. The department head will determine, based upon official
personnel records, and/or qualified testing procedures, where applicable, the
individual selected for layoff in the classification. The department head
will equally consider both the seniority and competency of the individual in
making this determination utilizing the following formula:



   Seniority Formula:



   Seniority + Competency ÷ 2 (Number of Categories) = Average Ranking



   Example:



 

 
Seniority
 
 
Competency
 
 
 
Average Ranking


Employee A
 
1
 
+
 
2
 
÷
 
2
 
=   1-1/2


Employee B
 
2
 
+
 
3
 
÷
 
2
 
=   2-1/2


Employee C
 
3
 
+
 
1
 
÷
 
2
 
=   2



 



   2.   Employee B would be the employee selected to be laid off in
this classification. If employee B chooses to bump into a lower
classification, he/she would be given a competency factor equal to the
average for the new classification. In the event of equal average ranking
scores, seniority will be used to determine selection.



   3.   An individual laid off from a particular classification may
"bump" into a classification for which he/she is qualified (qualification is
presumed where the person has held the position previously with the city or
where a lower position is in a normal line of promotion). After an employee
is informed of an impending layoff or "bump down," he/she must inform the
personnel officer within five working days of his/her intent to take the
option of the layoff or the "bump down." The process will be repeated at the
next classification level where an employee bumps in and creates an overage
in that classification.



   4.   The names of probationary and regular employees who have been
laid off shall be placed on appropriate reemployment lists in the order of
their competency, from highest to lowest. Such names shall remain thereon for
a period of one year unless such persons are sooner reemployed.



   5.   When a reemployment list is to be used to fill vacancies, the
personnel officer shall certify from the top of such lists the number of
names equal to the number of vacancies. An employee who is reemployed shall
receive credit for former service for purposes of seniority, benefit
compensation, and salary advancement.



(Ord. 86-03-970 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.80.500   Basis for disciplinary action.



   A.   Every employee is required to provide good conduct and fit and
efficient service.



   B.   An employee may be disciplined for any of the following
reasons: dishonesty; incompetency; inefficiency; neglect of duty;
insubordination; disruptive or disorderly conduct; unexcused absence;
drunkenness; drug/alcohol addiction; disability resulting from other than
work-related cause; discourtesy to the public or fellow employees; misuse,
abuse, or misappropriation of city property or equipment; engaging in
inconsistent or incompatible employment; violation of the conflict of
interest code; conviction of a felony or misdemeanor involving moral
turpitude, immorality or other cause related to job performance; violation of
this chapter or the policies, orders, rules, regulations or guidelines
established by the city; and other acts which are incompatible with service
to the public.



   C.   Notwithstanding anything in this chapter to the contrary, any
probationary employee, and any other employee as specified in subsection B of
Section 2.80.120, may be discharged either with or without cause or subjected
to other disciplinary measures, and shall have no right of hearing or appeal.



(Ord. 86-03-970 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.80.510   Types of discipline.



   A.   Disciplinary action shall be administered equitably. It is the
policy of the city that in taking disciplinary action, the severity of the
discipline imposed shall be commensurate with the seriousness of the offense
and with due consideration to the employee's prior performance record. It is
further the policy of the city that a system of progressive discipline be
utilized with the objective of correcting inappropriate employee conduct.



   B.   Disciplinary actions, which may be taken for any of the reasons
provided in Section 2.80.500, listed generally in order of severity are as
follows: reprimand; suspension; reduction in salary; demotion and dismissal.
These disciplinary actions are defined in Section 2.80.025.



   C.   For nondisciplinary purposes, the department head, or, in the
case of an emergency, a supervisor, may suspend an employee with pay and
without complying with the procedures of Section 2.80.520 in the following
circumstances:



   1.   In an emergency when life, property, or employee safety is
endangered or the self-control of the employee is questionable, and
suspension is necessary to reduce or eliminate the danger or to establish
control; or



   2.   When an investigation is being made of the circumstances
surrounding a possible disciplinary action, and the presence of the employee
would interfere with such investigation.



   The personnel officer immediately shall be advised of the foregoing
actions. In the event that the department head proposes to convert the
nondisciplinary suspension into a disciplinary suspension without pay or take
any other disciplinary action, prior to taking such action, the department
head shall comply with all provisions of Section 2.80.520 and the employee
shall have all rights thereunder, including the right of appeal.



(Ord. 86-03-970 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.80.520   Disciplinary procedure.



   A.   Counseling. To the degree possible, a supervisor should assist
the employee in resolving discipline problems through discussion and
counseling.



   B.   Party Imposing Discipline. Unless otherwise specified, the
party authorized to impose discipline shall be the department head. In the
case of any member of the staff of the city manager's office, the city
manager shall, for the purpose of this section, be considered to be a
department head. Although no right of appeal exists from the decision of the
department head to the city manager, the city manager may, on his own motion,
reverse or modify the decision of the department head, so long as the city
manager acts prior to the decision's becoming effective.



   C.   Notice of Proposed Discipline. Except for written reprimands,
nondisciplinary suspensions, or as otherwise provided herein, no disciplinary
action may be taken without giving the employee written notice of the
proposed disciplinary action not fewer than five working days prior to the
proposed effective date of such action. The notice shall contain a
description of the events which necessitated the disciplinary action, a
statement of the charges, notification that the employee may review available
materials leading to the disciplinary action, a statement of the employee's
right to meet with the department head and/or respond in writing prior to the
effective date of the discipline, notice of possible further action(s) in the
event corrective action by the employee does not occur, if applicable, and a
description of the appeal procedure. The department head shall advise the
personnel officer in writing of his/her intention to take such disciplinary
action prior to taking such action.



   D.   Employee's Opportunity to Respond. Within the time set forth in
the notice, as described in subsection C of this section, the employee may
either request a meeting with the department head and/or respond in writing.
An employee's opportunity to respond to the department head is not intended
to be an adversarial hearing, although the employee has a right to have a
representative or counselor present. The employee need not be given the
opportunity to present or cross-examine witnesses or present a formal
evidentiary case, but shall have the opportunity to present a response.



   E.   Decision. If the employee does not respond to the notice, the
decision shall be effective on the date stated in the notice. If the employee
does respond, the department head shall evaluate the proposed discipline in
light of the employee's response and shall initiate further investigation if
the employee's version of the facts raises doubts as to the accuracy of the
department head's information leading to the discipline proposal. The
decision shall contain the applicable information previously set forth in
subsection C of this section, and set forth the department head's evaluation
of the employee's response and further investigation if such was necessary.
The decision shall be signed by the department head and personnel officer and
shall clearly inform the employee that he/she has the right, within five
working days after receipt of the decision, to request a hearing on the
charges before the civil service commission by filing a written request with
the personnel officer.



   F.   Appeal. Within five days of receipt of the decision, the
employee may appeal by giving written notice of appeal to the personnel
officer. Thereafter the civil service commission shall hold a hearing on such
appeal. The date for commencement of the hearing shall be not fewer than ten
days, nor more than thirty days, from the date of the filing of the appeal,
unless the parties stipulate to a different date. All interested parties
shall be notified in writing of the date, time, and place of the hearing at
least seven calendar days prior to the hearing.



   G.   Finality. If within the five-day appeal period the employee
involved does not file said appeal, the decision shall be final.



   H.   Notices. All notices required to be given hereunder, will be
given to the employee in person, whenever possible and the employee's
signature obtained to indicate receipt. In the absence of personal service,
the notice may be sent by registered mail to the employee's last known
address.



   I.   Waiver. Failure of the employee to take any action required by
this section within the time limits permitted therefor shall be deemed a
waiver of all further rights of appeal.



(Ord. 86-03-970 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.80.560   Civil service commission hearing procedures.



   A.   The civil service commission shall hear all appeals. Three
members of the commission shall constitute a quorum for the purpose of
conducting a hearing on any appeal, provided that no commission member may
vote on the decision if absent from a part of the hearing unless such
commission member certifies that he/she has listened to or read the
transcript of the entire proceedings.



   B.   All hearings shall be open to the public provided, however,
that the commission shall, at the request of the employee, exclude the public
from all or any portion of such hearings. The commission may, at its
discretion, exclude the public from any portion of the hearings.



   C.   The chairman shall issue subpoenas on behalf of the commission
under the authority of the city council. Subpoenas pertaining to a hearing
shall be issued at the request of either party prior to the commencement of
such hearing. After the commencement of such hearing, subpoenas shall be
issued only at the discretion of the commission.



   D.   The commission shall select a presiding officer for every
hearing from among its membership.



   E.   The hearing need not be conducted in accordance with the
technical rules relating to evidence and witnesses, but hearings shall be
conducted in a manner most conducive to determination of the truth. Any
relevant evidence shall be admitted if it is the sort of evidence on which
responsible persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs,
regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rules which might
make improper the admission of such evidence over objection in civil actions.
Hearsay evidence may be used for the purpose of supplementing or explaining
any direct evidence but shall not be sufficient in itself to support a
finding unless it would be admissible over objection in civil actions. The
rules of privilege shall be effective to the same extent that they are now or
hereafter may be recognized in civil actions, and irrelevant and unduly
repetitious evidence shall be excluded. Decisions made by the commission
shall not be invalidated by any informality in the proceedings, and the
commission shall not be bound by technical rules of evidence.



   F.   The presiding officer shall rule on the admission or exclusion
of evidence with or without the assistance of the legal advisor to the
commission.



   G.   Each party shall have these rights: To be represented by legal
counsel or other person of his or her choice; to call and cross-examine
opposing witnesses on any matter relevant to the issues even though that
matter was not covered in the direct examination; to impeach any witness
regardless of which party first called him/her to testify; and to rebut the
evidence against him/her.



   H.   Oral evidence shall be taken only on oath or affirmation.



   I.   1.   With respect to any matters set for hearing, both
parties shall confer no later than ten business days prior to the date for
the hearing for the purpose of agreeing to a statement in writing setting
forth the specific facts or contentions in issue. The party imposing the
discipline shall have the burden of proof and shall initiate the contact with
the opposing party. The statement must be filed with the commission not later
than five business days prior to the hearing and shall include an estimate of
the time required for the hearing. The commission may also require such
additional matters in the written statement as it deems appropriate. The
commission may issue such orders as are necessary to assure that both parties
attend the prehearing conference and cooperate in preparation of the
statement in writing. If either party does not attend the prehearing
conference and participate in attempting the preparation of the statement in
writing, the commission may accept the statement of the other party as to the
facts and contentions in issue to the extent such statement conforms to the
scope of the hearing.



   2.   If the parties fail to reach agreement, then each party must
file a written statement with the commission. The commission shall rule on
all disputes, and announce the rulings to the parties as the first order of
business in the hearing.



   J.   The hearing shall proceed as follows, unless the commission
otherwise directs:



   1.   Final stipulations of facts or issues shall be disseminated to
the parties;



   2.   In the event that the prehearing conference between the parties
has resulted in disputes, the commission shall rule on those disputes as
provided in subsection I;



   3.   The party imposing discipline shall be permitted to make an
opening statement;



   4.   The appealing party shall be permitted to make an opening
statement;



   5.   The party imposing disciplinary action shall produce the
evidence on his/her part;



   6.   The party appealing from such disciplinary action may then open
his/her defense and offer his/her evidence in support thereof;



   7.   The parties may then, in order, respectively, offer rebutting
evidence only, unless the commission, for good reason, permits them to offer
evidence upon their original cases;



   8.   Closing arguments shall be allowed at all commission hearings.



   K.   The commission shall determine relevancy, weight, and
credibility of testimony and evidence. It shall base its findings on the
preponderance of evidence.



   L.   The commission may, and shall if requested by the disciplining
party or the appealing employee, subpoena witnesses at no loss of
compensation to a city employee, and/or require the production of records or
other material evidence as authorized by law.



   M.   During the examination of a witness, all other witnesses,
except the parties, shall be excluded from the hearing, unless the
commission, in its discretion, for good cause, otherwise directs.



   N.   No still photographs, moving pictures, or television pictures
shall be taken in the hearing chamber during the hearing.



   O.   The costs of a court reporter during the hearing shall be borne
equally by the parties.



   P.   The commission, prior to or during a hearing, may grant a
continuance for any reason it believes to be important to its reaching a fair
and proper decision.



   Q.   Whether the hearing is held in a public or closed session, the
commission, after it concludes the hearing, may deliberate its decision in
closed session. Members of the commission may request the attendance of the
commission's legal counsel to a discussion solely for the purpose of
rendering legal advice to the commission.



   R.   The commission shall render its judgement as soon after the
conclusion of the hearing as possible and in no event later than ten working
days after conducting the hearing. Its decision shall set forth which
charges, if any, are sustained and the reasons therefor.



   S.   The commission may sustain or reject any or all of the charges
filed against the employee. It may sustain, reject or modify the disciplinary
action invoked against the employee. It may not provide for discipline more
stringent than that invoked by the department head.



   T.   The commission's order of judgement shall be filed with the
charged employee and the city manager, and shall set forth its findings and
decisions. Any member of the commission may submit a minority or supplemental
finding and recommendations. If a dismissal is not sustained, the
commission's order shall set forth the effective date the employee is to
return to work, which may be any time on or after the date of disciplinary
action. An employee who returns to work under the provisions of this section
shall not be discriminated against in any manner with respect to benefit
accrual, prior service, or seniority.



   U.   The civil service commission's decision shall be final unless
overturned or modified by a four-fifths vote of the city council.



(Ord. 91-08-1111 § 5; Ord. 86-04-970 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.80.570   City council review of commission findings.



   A.   The civil service commission's decision shall be transmitted to
the city council by the city manager immediately following its issuance by
the commission. The city council shall, at its next regularly scheduled city
council meeting, occurring not less than five days after receipt of said
decision, either:



   1.   Receive and file and commission decision;



   2.   Announce its intent to review the commission's findings.



   B.   If a majority of the city council decides to review the
commission's decision, that review shall be of the record prepared of the
commission's proceedings only. No new evidence shall be introduced, nor shall
examinations of witnesses be permitted.



   C.   Following a review of the commission's decision, the city
council may sustain, reject or modify the disciplinary action invoked against
the employee by the department head or the civil service commission. It may
not provide for discipline more stringent than that invoked by the department
head. The decision of the city council shall be final.



(Ord. 86-03-970 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.80.580   Appeals, probationary demotions and reassignments.



   A.   Permanent sworn police personnel shall have the right to appeal
a probationary demotion or reassignment in the following manner:



   1.   Following a review of the proposed action by the employee's
immediate supervisor and appointing power, the personnel officer shall serve
or cause to be served on the employee affected, by registered mail or
personal delivery, a statement signed by the appointing power of the specific
action against the employee. This statement shall clearly inform the employee
that he/she has the right, within five working days after receipt of this
notice, to request an informal hearing on the action by filing a request with
the personnel officer.



   2.   If within the five-day appeal period the employee involved does
not file said appeal, unless good cause for the failure is shown, the action
of the city shall be considered conclusive and shall take effect as
prescribed.



   3.   If within the five-day appeal period the employee involved
files such notice of appeal by giving written notice of appeal to the
personnel officer, a time for an appeal hearing before the city manager shall
be established. The date for a hearing shall not be fewer than ten days, nor
more than thirty days, from the date of the filing of the appeal, unless the
parties shall be notified in writing of the date, time, and place of the
hearing at least seven calendar days prior to the hearing.



   4.   The city manager shall conduct an informal hearing on the
appeal. Each party shall have the opportunity to present all relevant
information in support of its respective position. These proceedings may be
electronically recorded and either party shall have the right to cause them
to be reported by a certified shorthand reporter at that party's expense.



   B.   Within ten working days after the conclusion of the hearing,
the city manager shall deliver to the employee a written decision which shall
either (1) affirm the decision, (2) modify it by (a) holding that certain
charges were not established by a preponderance of the evidence and/or (b)
reducing the penalty or (3) overturn the decision in its entirety. Said
decision shall be final and binding on the parties, subject to their right to
seek judicial review pursuant to 1094.5 of the California Code of Civil
Procedure.



   C.   Exempt employees, disciplined entry level probationary
employees, or persons who have been rejected from probationary status in an
entry level position shall have no right to appeal such action under these
rules. In the event that any right to appeal is mandated by either the
Legislature, or the California Supreme Court, the appeal procedure described
in subsection A3 of this section shall be the appropriate procedure to be
followed.



(Ord. 86-03-970 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.80.600   Grievance procedure--Purpose.



   The purpose and objectives of the grievance procedure are to:



   A.   Assure fair and equitable treatment of all employees and
promote harmonious relations among employees and their supervisors;



   B.   Afford employees a written and simple means of obtaining
consideration of their grievances by informal means at the supervisory level
and review of the supervisor's decisions;



   C.   Resolve grievances as quickly as possible and correct, if
possible, the causes of grievances, thereby reducing the number of grievances
and future similar complaints.



(Ord. 86-03-970 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.80.620   Procedure.



   A.   Informal Resolution.



   1.   Within ten days after a grievant knew, or by reasonable
diligence should have known, of the condition upon which a grievance may be
based, the grievant shall attempt to resolve it by an informal conference
with the grievant's immediate supervisor.



   2.   Every effort shall be made to resolve a grievance through
discussion between the employee and his/her immediate supervisor. It is the
spirit and intent of this procedure that all grievances be settled quickly
and fairly without any subsequent discrimination against employees who may
seek to adjust a grievance. Every effort should be made to find an acceptable
solution at the lowest level of supervision.



   B.   If the problem cannot be resolved between the employee and the
supervisor, the employee may, within seven calendar days from the date of
receiving the answer from his/her supervisor, request and be granted an
interview with the division head, if one exists, in order to discuss the
grievance.



   C.   If the division head and employee cannot reach a solution to
the grievance, the employee may, within seven calendar days from the date of
receiving the answer from the division head, request in writing and be
granted an interview with the department head.



   D.   The department head shall render his/her decision in writing
within fifteen calendar days of receiving the appeal. If the department head
and employee are unable to arrive at a satisfactory solution, the employee
may, within ten calendar days from the date of the decision by the department
head, submit a written appeal to the city manager.



   E.   The city manager shall review the grievance and respond to the
employee within twenty calendar days of receiving the appeal. The response
shall be in writing, will be considered an expression of management's
viewpoint, and shall be final.



(Ord. 86-03-970 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.80.630   Representation.



   A.   An employee may request representation by the appropriate
employee association at any stage of the grievance procedure.



   B.   The grievant and designated association representative shall
receive release time for the purpose of representing the grievant in
conference at any step, but in no way shall release time be granted for
purposes of gathering information, interviewing witnesses, or preparing a
presentation.



   C.   Association representation shall be limited to one person and
shall not inordinately interfere with the normal course of city business.



(Ord. 86-03-970 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.80.640   Class grievance.



   A.   Each employee must submit his or her grievance in writing. At
the discretion of the city, individual grievances may be treated as a single
grievance for a class.



   B.   Resolution of a class grievance may not be consistent among all
grievants in the class grievance due to differences in the circumstances or
occurrences that brought about the grievance.



(Ord. 86-03-970 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.80.650   Time limits.



   A.   Failure by a grievant to meet a deadline set forth in this
procedure shall terminate the grievance and the grievant shall not have a
right to refile on the same set of facts.



   B.   Failure by the city to meet a deadline shall give the grievant
the right to proceed to the next step.



   C.   Time limits in this procedure may be extended by mutual written
agreement between the grievant and the city.



(Ord. 86-03-970 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.80.660   Grievance withdrawal.



   Any grievance may be withdrawn by the grievant at any time in writing.
Withdrawal of a grievance shall be with prejudice and shall remove the right
of the grievant to refile on the same set of facts.



(Ord. 86-03-970 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.80.670   Freedom from reprisal.



   No grievant shall be subject to coercion or disciplinary action for
discussing a complaint with his/her immediate supervisor or for the good
faith filing of a grievance.



(Ord. 86-03-970 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.80.700   Amendments.



   Proposed amendments to this chapter shall be submitted to the city
manager and civil service commission for review and recommendation prior to
submittal to the city council. Advance notice shall be given to recognized
employee organizations of any amendments which affect wages, hours, and other
terms and conditions of employment. Upon request, the city manager shall
provide the opportunity to consult with any employee organization so
requesting, regarding amendments affecting wages, hours, and other terms and
conditions of employment. As provided in Section 3500, et seq. of the
Government Code, in cases of emergency, when the city council determines that
amendment(s) to these rules must be adopted immediately without prior notice
or meeting with a recognized employee organization, the city shall provide
such notice and opportunity to meet at the earliest practicable time
following the adoption of the amendment(s). Amendments shall become effective
upon adoption by the city council.

management, classified, hourly, seasonal, part-time, contractual, volunteer,
emergency, or other. In addition, the provisions of Chapter 2.80 govern those

shall receive equal treatment in matters affecting recruitment, hiring,

and recall practices and any other matters affecting employment.



   B.   The city shall establish an affirmative action program with a
goal of equality of opportunity in all personnel actions. Special recruitment
efforts among minorities, women, disadvantaged individuals, and handicapped
persons do not conflict with the merit system and assure equality of
opportunity in employment with the city.



(Ord. 86-04-974 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.82.030   Light duty appointments.



   A.   It is the policy of the city to favor the employment and the
utilization of physically and/or mentally permanently disabled employees who
are injured as a result of their duties and responsibilities as employees.
The city reserves the right to make available a permanent light-duty position
to any employee who may be determined to be permanently disabled from
performing the functions and duties of such position which such employee may
occupy at the time of a work-related injury. The city shall in no instance be
obligated to provide a permanent light-duty position for an employee.



   B.   The duties and responsibilities of the permanent light-duty
position shall be such that the disabled employee will be capable of
performing them, notwithstanding such employee's disability. Such light-duty
position may be made available in any department of the city, and need not be
in the particular department in which such employee worked at the time of the
work-related injury. Such position shall be termed a permanent light-duty
position and may be created or modified at any time, including, but not
limited to, subsequent to the occurrence of the work-related injury of any
particular employee.



   C.   The permanent light-duty position need not have the same or
even substantially similar duties or responsibilities to the position held by
a permanently disabled employee at the time of a work-related injury, but
shall be a position which provides substantially the same salary and benefits
provided by the position held by the permanently disabled employee at the
time he or she sustained a work-related injury.



   D.   Failure of a permanently disabled employee to accept a
permanent light-duty position within thirty days of its tender to him/her
shall constitute an absolute waiver and forfeiture of any right to disability
retirement, including, but not limited to, such right which may be provided
by the Government Code, and shall constitute a ground for termination of such
employee.



(Ord. 86-04-974 § 1 (part), 1986)



2.82.040   Loyalty oath.

   In the event that the people of the city shall, at a municipal election
or special election at which such question is submitted, elect to change the
status of any one or more of the elective officers of the city to that of
appointive officers, then at the expiration of the term of office of any such
officer, the person holding the office at the time of the expiration of
his/her term shall be retained in the office without examination or
performance test and thereafter shall be subject in all other respects to the
provisions of the personnel system, as contained in Chapter 2.80.

marriage living in the same household as a city employee) is employed if
potential conflicts of interest or other hazards are created which are
greater for married couples or related individuals than for unrelated persons
by virtue of, for example, their:



   1.   Performing joint duties; or



   2.   Sharing responsibilities or authority; or



   3.   Reporting to the same immediate supervisor; or

situation in which potential conflicts or other hazards greater than those
associated with unmarried employees may arise through, for example, the
performance of joint duties, sharing responsibility or authority, reporting
to the same immediate supervisor, or supervising one another, then every
attempt will be made to transfer one employee to a position where no such
potential conflict exists. In the event such a transfer is not feasible, the
employees shall be given the opportunity to make the decision as to which one
shall resign. In the event that neither employee resigns, the least senior
employee shall be terminated.

to limit the use of loans and credit in the financing of municipal election
campaigns; and to provide full and fair enforcement of all the provisions of

such contributions are placed into the campaign contribution checking account
pursuant to Section 2.90.030, and further provided, that the candidate, or
spouse, is not acting as an agent or intermediary for any other person.



   B.   Extensions of credit to a candidate or committee for purposes
of aiding the political activity of a candidate or committee in amounts of
more than the campaign contribution limitation and for periods of longer than
sixty days are prohibited; provided, that a candidate may personally borrow
funds where such funds will be the candidate's personal contribution to his
or her campaign if the loan is a bona fide loan made on such terms and
conditions comparable to those available from commercial lending institutions
for loans not made for political purposes, including payment of a reasonable
rate of interest and a reasonable, specific repayment schedule. The loan
shall be made in the form of a loan agreement, promissory note or other

a contribution in the name of any person who is not eligible to vote because
of age. No person shall make a contribution in his, her or its name of
anything belonging to another person or received from another person on the
condition that it be used as a contribution. Whenever it is discovered that a
contribution has been received in violation of this section, that
contribution shall be returned to whoever made it, and the city clerk shall
be notified by the recipient of the contribution of the amount of the
contribution and the person to whom it was returned. If the recipient of the
contribution cannot ascertain the person who made the contribution, the
contribution shall be forwarded to the city treasurer for deposit in the
general fund of the city.

cycle including the effective date of any ordinance amending this chapter,
shall be counted towards the campaign contribution, provided that no person
whose contributions exceed the campaign contribution limitation during such

3.12.030   Purpose of provisions.



   The city council declares that this chapter is adopted to achieve the
following, among other, purposes, and directs that the provisions of this
chapter be interpreted in order to accomplish those purposes:



   A.   To adopt a sales and use tax law which complies with the
requirements and limitations contained in Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the
Revenue and Taxation Code;



   B.   To adopt a sales and use tax law which incorporates provisions
identical to those of the Sales and Use Tax Law of the state of California
insofar as those provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements and
limitations contained in Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation
Code;



   C.   To adopt a sales and use tax law which imposes a tax and
provides a measure therefor that can be administered and collected by the
State Board of Equalization in a manner that adapts itself as fully as
practicable to, and requires the least possible deviation from the existing
statutory and administrative procedures followed by the State Board of
Equalization in administering and collecting the California State Sales and
Use Taxes;



   D.   To adopt a sales and use tax law which can be administered in a
manner that will, to the degree possible be consistent with the provisions of
Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, minimize the cost of
collecting city sales and use taxes and at the same time minimize the burden
of recordkeeping upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of
this chapter.



(Ord. 73-9-709 § 1 (part): prior code § 3.04.040)



3.12.040   Contract with state.



   Prior to the operative date, this city shall contract with the State
Board of Equalization to perform all functions incident to the administration
and operation of this sales and use tax law; provided, that if this city
shall not have contracted with the State Board of Equalization prior to the
operative date, it shall nevertheless so contract and, in such a case, the
operative date shall be the first day of the first calendar quarter following
the execution of such a contract rather than the first day of the first
calendar quarter following the adoption of this chapter.



(Ord. 73-9-709 § 1 (part): prior code § 3.04.050)



3.12.050   Sales tax--Imposed.



   For the privilege of selling tangible personal property at retail, a
tax is imposed upon all retailers in the city at the rate stated in Section
3.12.020 of the gross receipts of the retailer from the sale of all tangible
personal property sold at retail in this city on and after the operative date.



(Ord. 73-9-709 § 1 (part): prior code § 3.04.060)



3.12.060   Place of sale.



   A.   For the purposes of this chapter, all retail sales are
consummated at the place of business of the retailer unless the tangible
personal property sold is delivered by the retailer or his agent to an
out-of-state destination or to a common carrier for delivery to an
out-of-state destination.



   B.   The gross receipts from such sales shall include delivery
charges, when such charges are subject to the state sales and use tax,
regardless of the place to which delivery is made.



   C.   In the event a retailer has no permanent place of business in
the state or has more than one place of business, the place or places at
which the retail sales are consummated shall be determined under rules and
regulations to be prescribed and adopted by the State Board of Equalization.



(Ord. 73-9-709 § 1 (part), prior code § 3.04.070)



3.12.070   Use tax--Imposed.



   An excise tax is imposed on the storage, use, or other consumption in
this city of tangible personal property purchased from any retailer on and
after the operative date for storage, use, or other consumption in this city
at the rate stated in Section 3.12.020 of the sales price of the property.
The sales price shall include delivery charges when such charges are subject
to state sales or use tax regardless of the place to which delivery is made.



(Ord. 73-9-709 § 1 (part): prior code § 3.04.080)



3.12.080   State law--Adopted.



   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, and except insofar as
they are inconsistent with the provisions of Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the
Revenue and Taxation Code, all of the provisions of Part 1 of Division 2 of
the Revenue and Taxation Code are adopted and made a part of this ordinance
as though fully set forth in this chapter.



(Ord. 73-9-709 § 1 (part): prior code § 3.04.090)



3.12.090   State law--Interpretation.



   In adopting the provisions of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Revenue and
Taxation Code, wherever the state of California is named or referred to as
the taxing agency, the name of the city shall be substituted therefor. The
substitution, however, shall not be made when the word "State" is used as
part of the title of the State Controller, the State Treasurer, the State
Board of Control, the State Board of Equalization, the State Treasury, or the
Constitution of the State of California; the substitution shall not be made
when the result of that substitution would require action to be taken by or
against the city, or any agency thereof rather than by or against the State
Board of Equalization, in performing the functions incident to the
administration or operation of this chapter; the substitution shall not be
made in those sections, including, but not necessarily limited to, sections
referring to the exterior boundaries of the state of California, where the
result of the substitution would be to provide an exemption from this tax
with respect to certain sales, storage, use or other consumption of tangible
personal property which would not otherwise be exempt from this tax while
such sales, storage, use or other consumption remain subject to tax by the
state under the provisions of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Revenue and
Taxation Code, or to impose this tax with respect to certain sales, storage,
use or other consumption of tangible personal property which would not be
subject to tax by the state under the said provisions of that code; the
substitution shall not be made in Sections 6701, 6702 (except in the last
sentence thereof), 6711, 6715, 6737, 6797, or 6828 of the Revenue and
Taxation Code; and the substitution shall not be made for the word "State" in
the phrase "retailer engaged in business in this State" in Section 6203 or in
the definition of that phrase in Section 6203.

(Ord. 68-8-627 § 1 (part): prior code § 3.10.01)



3.16.020   Definitions.



   Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in
this section govern the construction of this chapter:



   A.   "Hotel" means any structure or any portion of any structure
which is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by transients for
dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes and includes any hotel, inn, tourist
home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodginghouse,
roominghouse, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, other
similar structure or portions thereof and any mobile home or house trailer
which is located outside a mobile home park for occupancy on a transient
basis, unless such occupancy is for any period of more than thirty days or
unless such occupancy is by a tenant who is an employee of the owner or
operator of the mobile home.



   B.   "Occupancy" means the use or possession or the right to the use
or possession of any room or rooms or portion thereof in any hotel for
dwelling, lodging, or sleeping purposes.



   C.   "Operator" means the person who is proprietor of the hotel,
whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession,
licensee, or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his functions
through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the
managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this
chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal.
Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the
managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both.



   D.   "Rent" means the consideration charged, whether or not
received, for the occupancy of space in a hotel, valued in money, whether to
be received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts,
cash, credits and property and services of any kind or nature, without any
deduction therefrom whatsoever.



   E.   "Tax administrator" means the director of finance of the city.



   F.   "Transient" means any person who exercises occupancy or is
entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access,
license or other agreement for a period of thirty consecutive calendar days
or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such person so
occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period
of thirty days has expired unless there is an agreement in writing between
the operator and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy.



(Ord. 80-6-848 § 3; Ord. 68-8-627 § 1 (part): prior code § 3.10.02)



3.16.030   Imposed--Rate.



   For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject
to and shall pay a tax in the amount of nine percent of the rent charged by
the operator. The tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the city
which is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the city. The
transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the same time the
rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of
the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon
the transient's ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the
tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the tax administrator may
require that such tax shall be paid directly to the tax administrator.

charged, and each transient shall receive a receipt for payment from the
operator. No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner,

that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of
the Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax Ordinance by registering with the Tax
Administrator for the purpose of collecting from transients the Transient
Occupancy Tax and remitting said tax to the Tax Administrator. This
certificate does not authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business or
to conduct any lawful business in an unlawful manner, nor to operate a hotel
without strictly complying with all local applicable laws, including but not
limited to those requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or
office of this city. This certificate does not constitute a permit."

charged and received and the amount of tax collected for transient
occupancies. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax
collected shall be remitted to the tax administrator.



   B.   The tax administrator may establish shorter reporting periods
for any certificate holder if he deems it necessary in order to insure
collection of the tax and he may require further information in the return.



   C.   Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of
business for any reason.

(Ord. 68-8-627 § 1 (part): prior code § 3.10.07)



3.16.080   Delinquency interest assessments.



   A.   Original Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any tax
imposed by this ordinance within the time required shall pay a penalty of one
percent of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax.



   B.   Continued Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any
delinquent remittance on or before a period of thirty days following the date
on which the remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second
delinquency penalty of one percent of the amount of the tax in addition to
the amount of the tax and the one percent penalty first imposed.



   C.   Fraud. If the tax administrator determines that the nonpayment
of any remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of
twenty-five percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in
addition to the penalties slated in subsections A and B of this section.



   D.   Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator
who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the
rate of one-half of one percent per month or fraction thereof on the amount
of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance
first became delinquent until paid.



   E.   Penalties Merged With Tax. Every penalty imposed and such
interest as accrues under the provisions of this section shall become a part
of the tax required to be paid.



(Ord. 68-8-627 § 1 (part): prior code § 3.10.08)



3.16.090   Assessments determined by tax collector.



   A.   If any operator fails or refuses to collect the tax and to
make, within the time provided in this chapter any report and remittance of
the tax or any portion thereof required by this chapter, the tax
administrator shall proceed in such manner as he may deem best to obtain
facts and information on which to base his estimate of the tax due.



   B.   As soon as the tax administrator procures such facts and
information as he is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any
tax imposed by this chapter and payable by an operator who has failed or
refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, he shall
proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interests, and
penalties provided for by this chapter. In case such determination is made,
the tax administrator shall give notice of the amount so assessed by serving
it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid,
addressed to the operator so assessed at his last known place of address.



   C.   Such operator may within ten days after the serving or mailing
of such notice make application in writing to the tax administrator for a
hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing
is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest, and penalties, if
any, determined by the tax administrator shall become final and conclusive
and immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the tax
administrator shall give not less than five days' written notice in the
manner prescribed in this section to the operator to show cause at a time and
place fixed in the notice why the amount specified therein should not be
fixed for such tax, interest, and penalties. At such hearing, the operator
may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest, and penalties
should not be so fixed.



   D.   After such hearing the tax administrator shall determine the
proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the
person in the manner prescribed in this section of such determination and the
amount of such tax, interest, and penalties.



   E.   The amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen
days unless an appeal is taken as provided in Section 3.16.100.



(Ord. 68-8-627 § 1 (part): prior code § 3.10.09)



3.16.100   Appeals.



   Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the tax administrator with
respect to the amount of such tax, interest, and penalties, if any, may
appeal to the council by filing a notice of appeal with the city clerk within
fifteen days of the serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The
council shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and the city
clerk shall give notice in writing to such operator at his last known place
of address. The findings of the council shall be final and conclusive and
shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed in Section
3.16.090 for services of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall
be immediately due and payable upon the service of notice.



(Ord. 68-8-627 § 1 (part): prior code § 3.10.10)

   It shall be the duty of every operator liable for the collection and
payment to the city of any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve,
for a period of three years, all records as may be necessary to determine the
amount of such tax as he may have been liable for the collection of and
payment to the city, which records the tax administrator shall have the right
to inspect at all reasonable times.



(Ord. 68-8-627 § 1 (part): prior code § 3.10.11)



3.16.120   Refunds.



   A.   Whenever the amount of any tax, interest, or penalty has been
overpaid or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally
collected or received by the city under this chapter, it may be refunded as
provided in subsections B and C of this section, provided a claim in writing
therefor, stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which
the claim is founded, is filed with the tax administrator within three years
of the date of payment. The claim shall be on forms furnished by the tax
administrator.



   B.   An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes
collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once, or
erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established in a
manner prescribed by the tax administrator that the person from whom the tax
has been collected was not a transient; provided, however, that neither a
refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so
collected has either been refunded to the transient or credited to rent
subsequently payable by the transient to the operator.



   C.   A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more
than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city by
filing a claim in the manner provided in subsection A of this section, but
only when the tax was paid by the transient directly to the tax administrator
or when the transient, having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to
the satisfaction of the tax administrator that the transient has been unable
to obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax.



   D.   No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section
unless the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing
entitlement thereto.



(Ord. 68-8-627 § 1 (part): prior code § 3.10.12)



3.16.130   Tax deemed debt to city.



   Any tax required to be paid by any transient under the provisions of
this chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the transient to the city. Any
such tax collected by an operator which has not been paid to the city shall
be deemed a debt owed by the operator to the city. Any person owing money to
the city under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to an action
brought in the name of the city for the recovery of such amount.



(Ord. 68-8-627 § 1 (part): prior code § 3.10.13)



3.16.140   Penalties for violations.



   A.   Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter
shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punishable pursuant to Chapter
1.16.



   B.   Any operator or other person who fails or refuses to register
as required in this chapter, or to furnish any return required to be made, or
who fails or refuses to furnish a supplemental return or other data required
by the tax administrator, or who renders a false or fraudulent return or
claim, is guilty of a misdemeanor, and is punishable pursuant to Chapter 1.16.



   C.   Any person required to make, render, sign, or verify any report
or claim who makes any false or fraudulent report or claim with intent to
defeat or evade the determination of any amount due required by this chapter
to be made is guilty of a misdemeanor and is punishable pursuant to Chapter
1.16.

is in the best interest of the city, and as is agreed to by the vendor,
provided, however, that no open purchase order shall be effective for a
period of time in excess of three years. Issuance of an open purchase order

equipment, and the sale of personal property shall be by bid procedures
pursuant to Sections 3.20.110 and 3.20.190. Such procedures shall be
dispensed with only when an emergency requires that an order be placed with
the nearest available source of supply, when the amount involved is less than
two hundred and fifty dollars, when the commodity can be obtained from only
one vendor, when the order is made under an open purchase order issued

as the case may be, pursuant to the procedure prescribed in this chapter. No
purchase shall be made under an open purchase order which will make the total

dollars unless such open purchase order was issued pursuant to the provisions
of this section, or unless such purchase is specifically authorized by the

that a successful bidder shall forfeit his bid security upon refusal or
failure to execute the contract within ten days after the notice of award of

the contract, award it to next lowest responsible bidder.



   C.   If the city council awards the contract to the next lowest

3.20.170   Bidding--Tied bids.



   If two or more bids received are for the same total amount or unit
price, quality and service being equal, and if the public interest will not
permit the delay of readvertising for bids, the city council may accept the
one it chooses or accept the lowest bid made by negotiation with the tie
bidders at the time of the bid opening.



(Prior code § 2.12.420 (Ord. 506 § 28(f), 1961))

3.20.220   Master agreements for emergency purchases.



   A.   The city may enter into master agreements for supplies,
services, or equipment, including supplies, services, and equipment for
public projects, to be provided on an on-call basis, when it is foreseeable
that such supplies, services, or equipment will be necessary in the event of
an emergency.



   B.   For the purposes of this section, an “emergency” is any
sudden, unexpected occurrence that poses a clear and imminent danger,
requiring immediate action to prevent or mitigate the loss or impairment of
life, health, property, or essential public services.



   C.   The city may enter into master agreements with multiple
contractors for the provision of the same supplies, services, or equipment.
Such master agreements shall contain the contractors’ rates so that when an
emergency occurs the city can quickly obtain competing proposals from the
prequalified contractors. In the event of an emergency, the city will not be
obligated to utilize the formal bidding procedures otherwise described in
this chapter for purchase of supplies, services, or equipment, but may
instead request competing bids or proposals from the multiple prequalified
contractors that have entered into master agreements with the city for
emergency services.



   D.   The award of master agreements shall be based on demonstrated
competence, qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of the
required services or provision of the required supplies or equipment, any
past performance, and the offer of a fair and reasonable price, after notice
to a number of potential vendors adequate to permit reasonable competition
consistent with the nature and requirements of the procurement.



   E.   The bidding procedures described in Sections 3.20.110 through
3.20.180 of this chapter shall not be required for the procurement of master
agreements under this section.



(Ord. 2018-09-1502 § 4)



3.20.230   Master agreements for maintenance purchases.



   A.   In addition to prequalifying contractors through master
agreements to perform emergency services in accordance with Section 3.20.220,
the city may enter into master agreements for supplies, services, or
equipment, including for public projects, to be provided on an on-call basis,
for maintenance of public facilities and public works as described herein.
This authority may be necessary because the maintenance work can be
unexpected or because the cost of doing the work does not justify the costs
of the formal notice and bidding process described in this chapter, Through
the master agreement procedure, multiple contractors can be prequalified and
competing proposals can still be obtained for the specified work.



   B.   For the purposes of this section, “maintenance” includes
the following:



      1.   Roadway maintenance and repairs, including crack sealing,
pot hole patching, temporary pavement patching, and removal and replacement
of existing pavement up to a depth of four (4) inches.



      2.   Pavement striping and marking, repainting of curbs, and
installation or replacement of traffic pavement markers.



      3.   Replacement, repair, relocation, and installation of new
or existing traffic signs and other related work and materials, including
sign blanks, hardware, poles, and pipes.



      4.   Repair and replacement of damaged sidewalk.



      5.   Erosion control to prevent or correct erosion at
city-owned lots and facilities, including but not limited to earth-moving,
wattles, and silt fences.



      6.   Repair and replacement of fencing in drainage ditches and
other drainage facilities for which the city is responsible, including
vandalism repair, repair of chain link fences and posts, adjustments to
hardware, and touch-up painting.



      7.   Electrical repairs and services, including repair of
electrical circuits at city facilities and replacement of burned-out light
bulbs at sports fields.



      8.   Plumbing repairs and services at city facilities,
including inspection; preventative maintenance; installation, repairs, and
modifications of water, sewer, and drain lines; cleaning and unstopping
drains and sewer lines from 1-inch to 6-inches; installation, repairs, and
modifications of bathroom fixtures and equipment including sinks, showers,
toilets, urinals, hot water heaters, well pumps, holding tanks, and drains;
installation of gas pipes, pipe installation, and heat tape; and other
related repairs and services.



      9.   Routine maintenance and repair of HVAC equipment at city
facilities.



      10.   Painting services, including interior and exterior
painting.



   C.   The city may enter into master agreements with multiple
contractors for the provision of the same supplies, services, or equipment.
Such master agreements shall contain the contractors’ rates so that when a
need arises the city can obtain competing proposals from the prequalified
contractors. When making a purchase from a prequalified contractor through a
master agreement under this section, the city will not be obligated to
utilize the formal bidding procedures otherwise described in this chapter for
purchase of supplies, services, or equipment, but may instead request
competing bids or proposals from the multiple prequalified contractors that
have entered into master agreements with the city.



   D.   The award of master agreements shall be based on demonstrated
competence, qualifications necessary for satisfactory performance of the
required services or provision of the required supplies or equipment, any
past performance, and the offer of a fair and reasonable price, after notice
to a number of potential vendors adequate to permit reasonable competition
consistent with the nature and requirements of the procurement.



   E.   The bidding procedures described in Sections 3.20.110 through
3.20.180 of this chapter shall not be required for the procurement of master
agreements under this Section where the specific project proposed under the
master agreement will cost less than $100,000, but projects exceeding this
minimum shall be publicly bid in accordance with the city’s formal bid
process.

   This chapter is enacted pursuant to the provisions of the Signal Hill
Charter including but not limited to the following authorities:



   A.   Article II, Section 200 stating that the city shall have the
power to exercise all rights powers, privileges or procedures established,
granted or prescribed by any law of the state, by the charter, or by other
lawful authority, or which a municipal corporation might exercise under the
Constitution of the State of California; and that the charter shall be
liberally construed to vest the city with all legal authority and powers
necessary to protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens
of the city;



   B.   Article II, Sections 203 and 204 permitting the joint or
cooperative exercise of powers with other governmental agencies and
permitting the establishment of an economic development authority or other
agency or authority of specialized expertise and application to the authority
thereof to the full extent as may be permitted by state or federal law to
carry out the business of the city or otherwise advance the health, safety,
or general welfare of its citizens;



   C.   Article IX, Section 906 which gives the city full power to
enact any taxes, assessments, fees or other measures for the purpose of
raising revenue which charter cities in the State of California may enact,
including, but not limited to business and license taxes, franchise taxes,
sales and use taxes, property taxes, oil barrel taxes, hazardous waste
facility taxes, transient occupancy taxes, and other taxes, and to levy
assessments on property for special benefits, capital construction and
maintenance, or impose fees and charges for services and benefits received,
or to mitigate impacts caused by any activity, business enterprise or
development, all in accordance with law; and



   D.   Article VI, Section 608 concerning the use of land which states
that the city has full power to enact regulatory land use measures including
enacting specific plans, redevelopment agreements and other similar matters
for the regulation and development of land; to abate nuisances; to regulate
oil uses and the operation and abandonment of oil wells, pipelines and
appurtenant facilities; and to establish measures to mitigate the impacts of
development on adjacent property and the city generally, through land use
regulations, requirements that the developer provide appropriate
infrastructure improvements, impact mitigation fees, assessments for
construction of infrastructure improvements and measures similar to the
foregoing. 



(Ord. 2012-04-1446 § 2, 2012)



3.32.020   Purpose.



   A.   Unique Constraints to Development. The City of Signal Hill has
found that it's redevelopment program has been essential to transforming
Signal Hill from one dominated by vacant, blighted land scarred by 80 years
of oilfield production and which is still the second most productive in the
state, to a vibrant community with all ingredients necessary to provide a
high quality living environment. Signal Hill has had to overcome many
obstacles including: (i) being a low property tax city with it's property
taxes reallocated to other agencies; (ii) undeveloped infrastructure due to
the majority of the city being devoted to oilfield rather than urban uses;
(iii) the existence of 2,200 wells, the majority of which were abandoned
under historic practices no longer permitted, which can require excessive
costs to be reabandoned to current standards, and the presence of other
oilfield pipelines, tanks and facilities which must be removed for
development, or are active facilities and must be incorporated into any
development plan; (iv) the existence of oilfield-related contamination
requiring significant remediation costs under current environmental
standards; (v) complex issues of site assemblage due to small town lots
created in the early development of the city and the sale of fractional
interests in the lots to allow sales of oilfield interests throughout the
United States in the 1920s now requiring the exercise of condemnation to
reconsolidate the fractioned property interests; (vi) the existence of a
large number of faults and geological conditions related to the hill which
further constrain development and limit the developable acreage.



   B.   Accomplishments of Redevelopment Program. Since the formation
of the Redevelopment Agency, the city has spent over fifteen million dollars
in environmental remediation and cleanup costs; has spent over thirty million
dollars in building various public buildings and improvements; has created
some two thousand, five hundred jobs in businesses developed on SHRA
projects; and has brought half of the twenty-five biggest sales tax
generators to the community, who collectively pay over five million dollars
in sales taxes, or sixty percent of the city's sales taxes, where sales taxes
are approximately sixty percent of the city's general fund budget.



   C.   Remaining Property Needs Continued Redevelopment. If most of
the property in Signal Hill which needed redevelopment had been redeveloped,
or if the remaining blighted property did not face the same constraints as
the property the SHRA has redeveloped over the last thirty-five years, then
the elimination of the redevelopment agency by the State of California by
AB1x26 would not be contrary to the general welfare of the citizens of Signal
Hill. But in many cases, some of the most constrained parcels in the city are
still the ones most in need of redevelopment assistance. The Legislature in
acting quickly in a statewide manner could not appreciate the impact of
AB1x26 in a small community specially impacted by oilfield blight such as
Signal Hill.



   D.   Need for Local Economic Development Program. In the face of the
state's decision to eliminate redevelopment, the City of Signal Hill must
design and implement a local program within the authority of its powers under
the charter to accomplish the purposes previously served by the city's
redevelopment program. It is therefore the purpose of this chapter to
implement a program within the authority of the city under its charter and
the powers granted to the city by law. 



(Ord. 2012-04-1446 § 2, 2012)



3.32.030   Assistance available.



   To accomplish the purposes provided herein, the City of Signal Hill and
its associated and subordinated entities shall have the power to carry out
policies, plans and programs, to enact measures, to enter into agreements,
and to loan, grant, fund, or finance projects which will provide public
benefit and protect the public health, safety and welfare of the community.
These programs may be carried out singly or in combination in a manner to
promote the objectives of this chapter, and may include the following general
types of measures:



   A.   Public-Private Partnerships. Agreements with private persons or
entities where by the sharing of public resources by the public agency, the
reduction of regulatory burdens, asset monetization, fee producing
infrastructure, alternative procurement, concession agreements, leasing
arrangements, securitization of obligations, or other measures, the risks to
the private person or entity can be reduced to a level whereby the
development entity and investors can earn a commercially reasonable return on
investment and will accordingly proceed with the project;



   B.   Emerging Statutory Opportunities. Special legislative programs
exist, and are likely to be enhanced as a result of the elimination of
redevelopment, the state's most important and best funded economic
development strategy. Under this chapter, such programs should be exploited
to the fullest extent of the law. Such programs may include design build
contracts; tax credits; infrastructure finance districts; environmental
sustainability programs; development zones; and similar legislation. Any
legal structure existing currently, or enacted hereafter which permits the
city legally to carry out these purposes is permitted hereunder:



   C.   Public Financing. All public financing mechanisms which offer
the opportunity of lower financing costs, if permitted by law, may be
utilized including lease-revenue bonds, industrial development bonds, private
activity bonds, certificates of participation, letter of credit enhancement
and similar measures;



   D.   Special Districts. The financing of both the development of
infrastructure and services through community service districts, landscape
and lighting districts, assessment districts, school facility improvement
bonds, and similar special district financing mechanisms permitted by law;



   E.   Public Property. The use of ground leases or sale of publicly
owned land, including at less than fair market value as provided herein,
contractual development agreements in accordance with law, lease-lease back
financing, design-build contracts, and the use of eminent domain to acquire
property for the foregoing purposes;



   F.   Tax Rebate Agreements. The use of tax rebate or similar
agreements permitted by law including for sales taxes, transient occupancy
taxes, utility taxes or other taxes shared with the generator, and rebates or
waivers of franchise fees, business license fees, development impact fees, or
other revenue sources but any such tax may only be imposed in accordance with
law;



   G.   Regulatory Relief. The modification or suspension of zoning and
other land use restrictions affecting the feasibility of development, density
bonuses, expedited processing of entitlements, the establishment of clear and
consistent regulatory regimes, creating procedures to quickly resolve
disputes, clear definition of scope of environmental review and use of
scoping processes;



   H.   Other Agencies. Use of financial assistance provided by other
local public agencies and by state and federal programs to assist projects,
consistent with the requirements of such programs; and



   I.   Other Programs. In addition to the foregoing, the city may
utilize any other program and provide any other form of direct or indirect
assistance as the same may currently or in the future exist which would
further permit the accomplishment of the purposes provided herein, to the
full extent permitted by the law. The enumeration of certain programs herein
does not preclude the use of any other program which might accomplish the
purposes of this chapter.



(Ord. 2012-04-1446 § 2, 2012)



3.32.040   Economic development assistance programs.



   The city may plan and carry out an economic development assistance
program for the improvement, rehabilitation, and economic development of
property through public-private partnerships, or utilizing any other method
provided in Section 3.32.030. Any economic development assistance program
must identify, explain and analyze (i) the project to be assisted, (ii) the
location of the project, (iii) impacts on surrounding property; (iv) the cost
of the project, (v) the project financing, (vi) the assistance requested,
(vii) how the assistance will be used, (viii) the benefits to the community
or city from the project, including jobs, financial return to the city,
community improvements or amenities or other benefits, (ix) the development
schedule, (x) performance criteria and assurances, and (xi) the public
purpose to be accomplished by the project. 



(Ord. 2012-04-1446 § 2, 2012)



3.32.050   Powers exercised.

(Ord. 2012-04-1446 § 2, 2012)



3.32.060   Conditions to qualify for assistance.



   A.   An economic development assistance program may only be approved
for projects which, due to the nature of the project or scale of the project,
the project will provide significant long-term benefits to the public
generally. Accordingly, any person seeking approval of an economic
development assistance program must meet one or more of the following
conditions:



   1.   Alleviation of Blighting Conditions. The development of the
project will alleviate a persistent condition of blight which has previously
discouraged the development of the property, such as removal of active or
inactive oil field facilities, reabandonment of wells, removal of underground
tanks or facilities, or the removal or remediation of hazardous substances or
environmental contamination of soils, where the cost of such blighting
conditions will exceed five hundred thousand dollars per acre.



   2.   Production of Jobs. The development of the project will result
in the establishment of a business or businesses on the property producing in
excess of three hundred long-term jobs or preserve an existing business which
will also bring one hundred fifty new long-term jobs (excluding multipliers).



   3.   Fiscal Impact on City. The development of the project will
create new on-going revenues to the city, considering all revenue sources, of
at least three hundred thousand dollars annually.



   4.   Special Amenities. The development of the project will produce
unique community amenities either due to the construction of needed public
facilities, or due to the fact that the project itself provides special
private facilities available to the public which do not otherwise exist in
the community and which would be significant to the community character and
quality of life of those who work or live in the community. A special amenity
may be a joint project undertaken with Long Beach.



   B.   In addition to the above conditions, the development of the
project must not have a substantially adverse impact on traffic, or on
surrounding properties or on the community generally. The project must meet
one or more of the above conditions and the City Council must find that the
project taken as a whole is uniquely beneficial to the community.

circulation and parking, landscaping, architectural design and similar
issues. All projected costs for design and construction of the project shall
be included.



   E.   Proforma. The project proforma shall be included identifying
the estimated amount of public money to fund the development and how it will
be used and the anticipated economic return of development. The
applicant/developer shall provide a detailed analysis of how the development

(Prior code § 5.04.030 (Ord. 494 § 3, 1960))



5.04.040   Effect on other provisions.



   A.   Neither the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter

shall be construed to in any manner excuse or relieve from prosecution the
violation of any ordinance committed prior to the effective date hereof.

releasing any person from payment of any tax due under the provisions of any
other ordinance of the city, nor to affect the validity of any bond or cash
deposit required by any ordinance to be posted, filed, or deposited with any
officer of the city; and all rights and obligations thereunto appertaining
shall continue in full force and effect.



(Prior code § 5.04.040 (Ord. 494 § 4, 1960))



5.04.050   Tax and license required.



   A.   There are imposed upon the businesses, trades, professions,

   C.   This section shall not be construed as requiring any person to
obtain a license prior to doing business within the city if such requirement
conflicts with applicable statutes of the United States or of the state of
California. However, persons not required to obtain a license prior to doing
business within the city because of conflict with applicable statutes of the
United States or of the state of California shall be liable for payment of
the tax imposed by this chapter.



(Prior code § 5.04.050 (Ord. 494 § 5, 1960))



5.04.060   Applicability to individuals.



   Every person engaging in or carrying on any business, profession,

(Prior code § 5.08.010 (Ord. 494 § 40, 1960))



5.04.070   Separate licenses required for branch establishments.



   A separate license must be obtained for each branch establishment or
location of the business transacted and carried on which is located in the
city, and each license shall authorize the licensee to transact and carry on
only the business licensed thereby at the location or in the manner
designated in such license; provided, that warehouses and distributing plants
used in connection with and incidental to a business licensed under the
provisions of this chapter shall not be deemed to be separate places of
business or branch establishments.



(Prior code § 5.04.060 (Ord. 494 § 6, 1960))



5.04.080   Separate businesses--License and tax computation.



   If two or more businesses or professions are conducted on the same
premises by the same person, the license to be obtained by such person and
the tax to be paid on account thereof shall be as follows:



   A.   If all of such businesses are subject to a license tax computed
on the basis of the number of employees, only one license shall be required
which shall be the license applicable to the business which constitutes more
than fifty percent of the dollar volume of the total business conducted at
the location.



   B.   If all of such businesses are subject to license taxes for
which a flat amount is specified in this chapter, separate licenses shall be
issued for each business but the amount of the license tax for all thereof
shall be the highest tax applicable to any one of such businesses plus fifty
percent of the license tax applicable to each of the other businesses.



   C.   If one or more of such businesses is subject to a license tax
based upon the number of employees and one or more of the other businesses is
not, a separate license must be obtained for the business or businesses as to
which the license tax based upon the number of employees is applicable and,
if there is more than one such business, the tax shall be determined as
provided in subsection A of this section. A separate license shall be
obtained for each of the other businesses, and, if there is more than one
such business, the tax shall be determined as provided in subsection B of
this section.



(Prior code § 5.04.070 (Ord. 494 § 7, 1960))



5.04.090   Establishments extending across city boundaries--Tax
computation.



   If a business is conducted upon or from an establishment which is
located upon property which lies partly within the city and extends across
the city boundary line, the license tax with respect to the business shall be
reduced by an amount which the tax collector determines is equal to the same
proportion of the total tax, computed as if the whole establishment were
within the city, that the value of the portion of the establishment located
outside the city bears to the value of the entire establishment; provided,
however, that this provision shall not be applicable unless the tax collector
determines that at least ten percent of the establishment, on the basis of
value, is located outside of the city.



(Prior code § 5.04.080 (Ord. 551, 1963: Ord. 494 § 7.5, 1960))



5.04.100   Computation of number of employees.



   In those instances in which the license tax provided in this chapter is
based upon the number of employees of the licensee or the applicant for the
license, the number of employees upon which the tax is to be based shall be
the average number of employees who during the preceding calendar year worked
in an establishment of the licensee within the city, or who used to a
substantial extent an office, plant or other establishment within the city as
his headquarters. The average number shall be determined by adding together
the totals of the names listed upon each of the employer's reports to the
State Department of Employment filed during the preceding calendar year and
dividing said sum by the number of such reports from which the names were
taken.



(Prior code § 5.04.090 (Ord. 494 § 8, 1960))



5.04.110   Exemptions--Constitutional and statutory.



   Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed or construed to apply to any
person transacting and carrying on any business exempt by virtue of the
Constitution or applicable statutes of the United States or of the state of
California from the payment of such taxes as are prescribed in this chapter.



(Prior code § 5.04.100(A) (Ord. 494 § 9(a), 1960))



5.04.120   Exemptions--Interstate commerce.



   A.   None of the license taxes provided for by this chapter shall be
so applied as to occasion an undue burden upon interstate commerce. In any
case where a license tax is believed by a licensee or applicant for license
to place an undue burden upon such commerce, he may apply to the tax
collector for an adjustment of the tax so that it shall not be discriminatory
or unreasonable as to such commerce.



   B.   Such application may be made before, at, or within six months
after payment of the prescribed license tax. The applicant shall, by
affidavit and supporting testimony, show his method of business and the gross
volume or estimated gross volume of business and such other information as
the tax collector may deem necessary in order to determine the extent, if
any, of such undue burden on such commerce.



   C.   The tax collector shall then conduct an investigation, and
after first having obtained the written approval of the city attorney shall
fix as the license tax for the applicant an amount that is reasonable and
nondiscriminatory or, if the license tax has already been paid, shall order a
refund of the amount over and above the license tax so fixed.



   D.   In fixing the license tax to be charged, the tax collector
shall have the power to base the license tax upon a percentage of gross
receipts or any other measure which will assure that the license tax assessed
shall be uniform with that assessed on businesses of like nature, so long as
the amount assessed does not exceed the license tax as prescribed by this
chapter.



   E.   Should the tax collector determine the gross receipts measure
of license tax to be the proper basis, he may require the applicant to
submit, either at the time of termination of applicant's business in the city
or at the end of each three-month period, a sworn statement of the gross
receipts and pay the amount of license tax therefor; provided that no
additional license tax during any one calendar year shall be required after
the licensee has paid an amount equal to the annual license tax as prescribed
in this chapter.



(Prior code § 5.04.100(B) (Ord. 494 § 9(b), 1960))



5.04.130   Exemptions--Nonprofit enterprises.



   The provisions of this ordinance shall not be deemed or construed to
require the payment of a license tax to conduct, manage, or carry on any
business, occupation, or activity from any institution or organization which
is conducted, managed, or carried on wholly for the benefit of charitable
purposes or from which profit is not derived, either directly or indirectly,
by any individual; nor shall any license tax be required for the conducting
of any entertainment, concert, exhibition, or lecture on scientific,
historical, literary, religious, or moral subjects within the city whenever
the receipts of any such entertainment, concert, exhibition, or lecture are
to be appropriated to any church or school or to any religious or benevolent
purpose; nor shall any license tax be required for the conducting of any
entertainment, dance, concert, exhibition, or lecture by any religious,
charitable, fraternal, educational, military, state, county, or municipal
organization or association whenever the receipts of any such entertainment,
dance, concert, exhibition, or lecture are to be appropriated for the purpose
and objects for which such organization or association was formed and from
which profit is not derived, either directly or indirectly, by any
individual; provided, however, that nothing in this section shall be deemed
to exempt any such organization or association from complying with any of the
provisions of this chapter requiring a permit from the city council or any
commission or officer to conduct, manage, or carry on any profession, trade,
calling, or occupation.



(Prior code § 5.04.100(F) (Ord. 494 § 9(f), 1960))

verified statement, issue a license to such person claiming exemption under
Sections 5.04.110 through 5.04.140 without payment to the city of the license
tax required by this chapter.



   C.   The tax collector, after giving notice and a reasonable
opportunity for hearing to a licensee, may revoke any license granted
pursuant to the provisions of Sections 5.04.110 through 5.04.140 upon
information that the license is not entitled to the exemption as provided in
this chapter.



(Prior code § 5.04.100(C--E) (Ord. 494 § 9(c)--(e), 1960))

   No license provided for in this chapter shall be initially issued to
any person unless such person has filed with the tax collector a written
application upon a form to be provided by the tax collector, signed under
penalty of perjury or verified under oath before a person authorized to
administer oaths by the applicant or a managing agent or officer of the
applicant, wherein is set forth all information required by the tax collector
in order to enable him to determine the proper license to be issued and the
correct amount of the license tax payable therefor.



(Prior code § 5.04.120 (Ord. 494 § 10(b), 1960))



5.04.180   Renewal application.



   No license provided for in this chapter shall be renewed or reissued to
any person unless such person has filed with the tax collector a written

penalty of perjury or verification under oath before a person authorized to
administer oaths by the applicant or a managing agent or officer of the
applicant, wherein is set forth all information required by the tax collector

5.04.190   Application verification and investigation.



   No statement contained in an application for a license or for a renewal
of a license shall be conclusive as to the matters set forth therein, nor
shall the filing of the same preclude the city from collecting by appropriate
action such sum as is actually due and payable under this chapter. Such
applications and each of the several items therein contained shall be subject
to audit and verification by the tax collector, his deputies, or authorized
employees of the city, who are authorized to examine, audit, and inspect such
books and records of any licensee or applicant for a license, as may be
necessary in their judgment to verify or ascertain the amount of license fee
due. All licensees, applicants for licenses, and persons engaged in business
in the city are required to permit an examination of such books and records

   B.   Fifteen cents times the number of barrels of oil produced and
shipped from the well during each calendar quarter of the calendar year,
except as adjusted herein, which amount is referred to in this chapter as the
"per-barrel tax."  The per-barrel tax shall be adjusted on July 1, 1984, and
on each July 1st thereafter.  The adjustment shall be to increase or

substances" means crude oil remaining after the removal therefrom of water
and other impurities by preliminary processing in the vicinity of the well
site preparatory to the shipment thereof.



   D.   If oil produced from two or more wells is commingled without
the production of the respective wells being separately measured, each well
whose production has been so commingled shall be considered as having
produced an equal part of the total.



   E.   Oil produced and shipped during a calendar quarter shall mean
oil produced from a well either before or during said calendar quarter which
either has been sold to another or shipped from the well site during said

file the foregoing statement, and that to the best of my knowledge and belief
it is a true, correct, and complete statement made in good faith for the
period stated."



   C.   The statement shall not be conclusive against the city as to
the information set forth therein, nor shall the filing of a statement
preclude the city from collecting by appropriate action any additional tax
that is later determined to be due and payable.

   In the event any person required to have a license under this chapter
fails to file a report of the quarterly production and shipment of oil from
his wells as provided in Section 5.12.040, or that the information filed in
such report is insufficient to enable the tax collector to compute the
license tax liability of such person, the tax collector shall, by such method
as he may deem appropriate, estimate the amount of the tax due from the
person. Notice thereof may be sent by the tax collector to such person by
registered mail at his latest address as shown on the city's records, and,
unless within thirty days thereafter a proper statement is filed by such
person with the tax collector, the estimate shall become a final and binding
determination of the amount of the tax.

   All permits issued under this chapter shall be subject to all

vested in the city council, and the city council may, as provided in this
chapter, suspend or revoke and cancel any permit for fraud or
misrepresentation in its procurement, or for a violation of any of the
provisions of this chapter or of any other ordinance of this city or any
state or federal statute relating to gambling or the sale of intoxicating
liquors, committed or permitted on the premises of the permittee by his,
their, or its officers or employees or by any member of the club, or any
other conduct or act of the permittee or his, their or its officers or
members, or permitted by them, tending to render such premises a common
nuisance or a menace to the health, peace, morals, or general welfare of the
city, or whenever in the judgment of the city council the public interest

   Whenever the city council receives evidence which it deems to be
satisfactory that any permittee or his, their or its officers, employees, or

5.28.060 to be grounds for the suspension or revocation of any permit issued
under this chapter, the city council may, by written notice served upon the
permittee, by serving the person designated in the application for permit for
service of notices, temporarily suspend such permit, pending a hearing on the
permanent suspension or revocation of such permit, which hearing is to be
held not more than ten days after notice of such temporary suspension.

   The hearing or investigation by the city council shall be informal, and
the formal rules of evidence shall not apply. Nothing shall operate to
prevent the city council from considering any evidence developed during the
hearing or investigation touching or concerning the fitness of the permittee
to retain the permit. If on such hearing or investigation the city council
finds that sufficient cause exists for the suspension or revocation of the
permit, the same may be suspended for any period the city council deems
proper under the circumstances or it may be revoked. Such action shall be by
majority vote of the city council on motion entered in its minutes. A copy of
the determination of the city council shall be served upon the permittee by
serving the person designated in the application for permit for service of
notices in the same manner as that provided in Section 5.28.080 for service
of notice of hearing.

Ord. 90-11-1082 § 1 (part))



8.08.020   Responsibility of the city to collect refuse.



   It is the duty of the city to either collect the refuse or cause it to
be collected by another. The city's collection and disposal of refuse is a
proper exercise of a governmental function pursuant to the city's power to
make and enforce within its limits all such local, police, sanitary, and
other regulations as is necessary for the public health and welfare.



   In populated communities, such as Signal Hill, it has become
impractical for each individual to provide for the disposal of his or her own
refuse. Therefore, the city assumes the exclusive responsibility for the
collection of refuse, since if the city were to leave such an important
function to each individual property owner, unsanitary and unhealthful
results might follow from an individual landowner's indifference or neglect.

control pest and nuisance vectors and to carry out the mandatory duties
imposed on the city by the State of California, the city council may
authorize one or more contractors to make arrangements with generators of
solid waste for the collection, transportation, recycling and disposal of
solid wastes within and throughout the city.  The city council may, by duly
executed written franchise agreement, approved by the city council by
ordinance naming the contractor, grant to a qualified person the exclusive
right to make arrangements for the collection, transportation, recycling and
disposal of solid waste from residential premises, commercial premises, or
both, within the entire city, or any designated portion of the city.  A
franchise agreement entered pursuant to this section shall be made in
accordance with Chapter 13.01 of this Municipal Code.



   B.   Any violation of this chapter may be subject to the general
penalties provided within this municipal code, including without limitation
Municipal Code Section 1.16, and any other penalties or provisions that might
be specified in a duly adopted franchise agreement.

8.08.025   Franchise required; exception.



   No solid waste enterprise or other person shall collect, transport or
dispose of solid waste by use of any public right-of-way within the city
without first obtaining a franchise granted by the city council, in writing,
by ordinance naming the contractor.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, any
person transporting solid waste generated by that person, such as persons
transporting solid waste generated at the person's own residence, gardeners
transporting green waste from their work sites, or building contractors
(including roofers) transporting solid waste generated at their work-sites,
shall not be required to obtain a franchise.  Other exceptions to the
foregoing franchise requirement may be designated in the city's duly-adopted
franchise contract.

   The term of each franchise shall be set forth in the franchise
agreement.  A reasonable franchise fee shall be included within every
franchise granted pursuant to this chapter.  The amount and payment thereof
shall be determined by the city council, and shall be set forth in the

8.08.030   City or its contractor has exclusive right to collect refuse.



      A.   The city shall provide for the collection and disposal of
refuse from all premises.  Such provision may be made either by the city
letting a contract for such collection and removal or performing such service
itself. The city and its duly authorized agents, servants and employees, or
any contractor with whom the city may contract therefor and the agents,
servants and employees of such contractor, while any such contract shall be
in force, shall have the exclusive right to gather, collect and remove refuse
material from all premises in the city, including construction and demolition
debris, unless such debris is self-hauled by the contractor performing such
construction and demolition operations.  No person, other than those above
specified herein or as specified in the city's franchise contract, shall
gather, collect or remove refuse from any premises or take any such material
from any refuse receptacle placed for collection or removal, or interfere
with or disturb any refuse receptacle, or remove any refuse receptacle from
any location where the same is placed by the owner or occupant thereof, or
remove the contents of any refuse receptacle.



   B.   The terms, as set forth in this chapter, shall be the minimum
terms of any refuse contract approved by the city council.

(part))



8.08.035   Nature of refuse collection services to be performed by
contractor.



   By entering the exclusive contract authorized by Section 8.08.030, the
contractor shall be assuming the city's entire responsibility for refuse
collection and disposal within the city, including the responsibility for
rate setting, billing and payment collection. The city has determined that
such an exclusive contract will provide the most efficient and economical
refuse collection service for a small community. Notwithstanding the above,
the city may by contract agree to perform certain services for the contractor
to further improve the efficiency and lower the cost for refuse collection
services. Such services the city may provide include, but are not limited to,
billing and lien services.



(Ord. 98-01-1229 § 3)



8.08.040   Refuse contractor requirements.

office hours for communication with the public at such local office. 
Additionally, the contractor shall continue to employ the services of a
telephone answering exchange for calls during non-business hours and provide
a telephone system sufficient and adequate to handle calls during peak
periods.  The contractor shall provide the city manager and the city's
police and fire departments with updated twenty-four hour emergency contact
telephone numbers.  The contractor shall have a representative or answering
service available at said telephone number during all hours other than normal
office hours.



   C.   Contractor Refuses Pick-up of Refuse.  If for some reason
refuse is not collected, the contractor will leave a written tag or other
conspicuous written notice which state's the contractor's telephone number
and address and explains why any item left for disposal was not collected. 
The contractor shall be required to maintain a log of all such notices issued
which also states the location and the reason for refusing collection. 
Reasons for non-collection may include, but are not limited to the
following:  containers inaccessible to contractor (after contractor has made

concern the contractor's performance under the contract.  The contractor
shall report back to the public works director or designee and/or cooperate
with the public works director regarding any action or procedures taken with
reference to complaints or other matters discussed, all as such procedures
and actions may be further specified in the franchise contract.



   E.   Emergency Operation.  In the event of a natural disaster,
earthquake, storm, fire or other extraordinary occurrence that may tend to
generate abnormal amounts of refuse, the city may require additional
collection with payment to be determined by an agreement between the city
manager and the contractor.  Contractor shall maintain on-call equipment and
personnel to be available to assist the city with debris collection and
removal within a reasonable time resulting from emergencies and natural
disasters, excepting that nothing in this section shall require contractor to
collect, haul or dispose of waste that contractor is not permitted to handle.



   In the event that service is interrupted due to labor disputes or other
events impacting the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city,
the city shall have the right to take over and have its municipal employees
operate any and all equipment of the contractor in order to continue service
pursuant to the terms of the contract.



   F.   Schedules to be filed with the City Manager.  The contractor
shall prepare and file with the manager schedules setting forth the specific
days on which industrial, commercial, multifamily and residential collections
shall be made.



   G.   Frequency of Pickup and the Hours of Operation.  Collection
service for single-family residential units and multi-family residential
units shall occur at least once per week on a schedule approved by the city
manager.  Commercial and industrial units shall be provided with a minimum

peace or quiet of the area wherein refuse collections are made.  Collection
services shall be conducted between such hours as specified in the city's
duly-adopted franchise contract.  The city may, from time to time, revise

   H.   Location and Handling of Containers.  Unless otherwise
directed by the city manager or his/her designee, all collections of refuse
from single-family residences shall be made from the curb along the street in
front of each property except that where paved alleys exist in the rear of

duties and obligations imposed thereunder upon the contractor, his agents,
employees or assigns, shall be subject to and conditioned on the provisions

to time, adopt with respect to the collection, removal or disposal of refuse.



   L.   Worker's Compensation Insurance.  The contractor shall, at all
times, keep fully insured as required by the Worker's Compensation Insurance

third parties, arising out of personal injuries or property damage suffered
by any such persons on account of the operations of the contractor required
by the contract.  The contractor shall provide and maintain in effect,

   O.   Right of Contractor to Limit Service.  This section shall
apply to all such contracts under this chapter approved by the city council
and shall be an additional term thereof, whether or not written into such
contracts.



   Whenever a contractor believes, upon reasonable grounds, that any
householder or other customer is permitting the refuse of a separate
household or occupants of other premises, which household or occupants are
not customers of such contractor, to be deposited in the refuse containers of
such customer, for the purpose of permitting such noncustomers to avoid the
usual payment required for the pickup of such refuse, such contractor may,
upon ten days written notice to such customers, limit the service provided to
such customer to pickup of the contents of two refuse containers each week,
for a period not exceeding one month.  If such customer shall object, in
writing, to the director of public works within such ten-day period, the
director of public works shall require the contractor to show good cause why
normal service should not be continued and shall afford the contractor an
opportunity to do so in the presence of the customer. If, in the opinion of
the director of public works, good cause is not shown, the contractor shall
continue normal service; otherwise, such limited service may be instituted as
herein provided.

commingled recyclable materials, such household refuse container being blue
in color.  Each household refuse container shall be made of durable plastic
containing a minimum of twenty percent post-consumer recycled material
content.  Such containers must be fitted with handles and lids.  Total
capacity of such containers shall be at least sixty-five gallons.  Although
multi-family complexes are not required to utilize recyclable material
containers, the contractor shall provide any multi-family complex with at
least one on-site container (either a household refuse container for
recyclables or a dumpster, as appropriate to the amount of recyclable
materials generated) designated solely for recyclable materials
free-of-charge upon request of the complex management.

unit where municipal solid waste is produced shall subscribe to refuse
collection service with the city or its contractor.  The owner of such
property is responsible for assuring that refuse containers are provided with
adequate capacity for the amount of municipal solid waste being produced on
such premises between service days.  Premises which have been unoccupied by
any human habitation and upon which no refuse has been produced or
accumulated for three consecutive months may be exempted from mandatory
service until such premises become occupied, provided the owner obtains an
approved application for such exemption from the city.



   B.   Customers Shall Use Proper Containers.  Each customer shall
deposit all recyclable materials in their designated recyclable container, if
applicable, and all household refuse in the household refuse container or
dumpster.  No other containers, including cardboard barrels or cardboard
boxes, shall be used.  The combined weight of each container and its
contents shall not exceed one hundred fifty pounds.



   C.   Time for Setting Containers at Curb for Collection.  When
household refuse containers are placed for collection, they shall be placed
immediately adjacent to the curb within the street or alley.  Such
containers shall be placed for collection so that the lids of the household
refuse containers open towards the street, and shall not be placed within two
feet of any obstruction.  Household refuse containers shall not be set out
for collection any earlier than seven p.m. on the day before the scheduled
collection pickup and must be returned to an out-of-view location by eight
p.m. the day the collection is made.  When household refuse containers are
not placed for collection, they shall be stored so as to not be visible from
any public street or right-of-way. 



   Commercial/industrial and multi-family dumpsters shall be located in
such a manner as to reasonably shield public visibility of the dumpster and

lengths small enough for ease of disposal in the customer's regular household
refuse container or dumpster.  Tree stumps and limbs greater than three 
inches in diameter, unless they are reduced to a chipped form, shall be
considered bulky waste rather than green waste. 



   E.   Disposal of Accumulated Debris.  Every person occupying or
having charge or control of any premises in the city, at least once in each
calendar month, shall collect and dispose of all refuse, such as discarded

items so as not to interfere with public access and travel on, over or across
the alley, street or right-of-way. 



   G.   Storage of Recyclable Materials.  The owners and occupants of
premises may store certain recyclable materials (limited to cans, bottles and
cardboard) for purposes of holding the materials for recycling at a later
date subject to the following restrictions: 



   1.   Such recyclable materials must be held in a leak-proof rubbish
can or container stored out-of-view from any public street or right-of-way,
and



   2.   Such recyclable materials must be stored indoors or otherwise
held in a manner that does not expose neighboring properties and citizens to
unsightly or odiferous conditions, pest infestation or conditions that
otherwise constitute a nuisance. 



   H.   Special Pickups.  Subject to the terms of a duly adopted
franchise agreement, both residential and commercial/industrial customers may
request the contractor to provide special pickups of oversized or bulky waste
items which are not appropriate for standard waste collection containers. 
The contractor shall be under no obligation to provide a special pickup for
items too large, bulky or heavy for the contractor's waste removal equipment
to effectively transport and dispose of.



   I.   Damage to Waste Containers or Receptacles.  In the event
unusual damage occurs to a dumpster, household refuse container or other
waste receptacle due to the negligence of a waste disposal customer, the
contractor may negotiate with the individual customer with respect to
compensation for unusual damage to containers, dumpsters or other waste
receptacles.  No such fee shall be final until approved by the director of
public works.



   J.   Organic Waste Recycling. Organic waste generators shall comply
with the requirements in Chapter 12.9 of Part 3 of Division 30 of the
California Public Resources Code (Section 42649.8 et seq.) regarding organic
waste recycling. The city shall provide notice to any organic waste generator
that fails to comply with this subsection.

8.08.080   Refuse collection charges.



   A.   Collection Charges.  The city has determined that the regular
collection of refuse from all property in the city is of benefit to all of
the city's inhabitants and that all city customers, whether residential or
commercial, will be benefitted by the provision of franchised public waste
hauling services, and that the administration of refuse charges, accounts and
billing services is most efficient when handled by a single service
provider.  To this end, the city's refuse contractor shall be responsible
for all billing and account collection with the exception of certain duties
concerning placement of delinquent accounts onto the tax rolls.  With
respect to temporary and special services, and any person who is served by a
commercial service contract, or who arranges to have a special pickup, a
dumpster or a debris box, shall make payment for any such services directly
to the city's refuse contractor.



   B.   Form of Bills.  The most feasible and efficient way to provide
for the expense of refuse collection and disposal in the city is for the
city's refuse contractor to bill customer accounts directly.  The city's
refuse contractor shall provide itemized bills, clearly showing charges for
all classification of services, including any charges for late payment. 
Contractor shall have procedures for on-line payment, payment by credit card,
and similar customer services.



   C.   Single-Family Residential Account Billing.  Single-family
residential unit accounts receiving collection services from the city's
refuse contractor shall be billed by the city refuse contractor as follows: 
For the quarter in which services are rendered, the contractor shall bill
thirty days into the quarter, and the bill shall be due sixty days thereafter
at the end of that quarter. 



   D.   Multi-Family and Commercial/Industrial Account Billing. 
Multi-family residential units, commercial, and industrial unit accounts
receiving collection services from the city's refuse contractor shall be
billed by the contractor at the end of the month in which service is
provided. 



   E.   Delinquent Accounts. 



      1.   Delinquent Residential Accounts.  The city's refuse

delinquency/past-due account status to the occupants of any residential unit
with a delinquent account.  City refuse contractor shall be entitled to
collect late charges at the rate of one and one-half percent per month from
the delinquent residential unit account and, in addition, to charge a
reasonable rate for the redelivery of waste containers provided by the
contractor.  If, after city's refuse contractor's exercise of diligent
efforts to collect a delinquent account, a residential unit account remains
delinquent, the contractor shall have the right to request placement of the
delinquent account onto city tax rolls.  Said right to place delinquent
accounts onto city tax rolls shall occur no more than once-per-year at a
time, and in a manner, coordinated with the city's regular processing of tax
liens.



      2.   Multi-Family Residential, Commercial and Industrial
Account Delinquencies.  The city council may permit refuse contractor to
discontinue service to commercial, Industrial and/or multi-family residential
units whose accounts are more than ninety days past due.  The contractor
shall be entitled to collect late charges at the rate of one and one-half
percent per month and in addition to charge a reasonable rate for the
redelivery of containers provided by the contractor.  These delinquent
accounts may also be placed on tax rolls.  Said right to place delinquent
accounts onto city tax rolls shall occur no more than once-per-year at a
time, and in a manner, coordinated with the city's regular processing of tax
liens.

8.12.080   Notice and order for abatement of nuisance.



   Whenever a city abatement officer has determined a nuisance exists on

Chapter 4 of Title 5 of Part 2 of the Code of Civil Procedure.  If the
owners of record of the property, as shown on the last equalized assessment
roll or the supplemental roll, whichever is more current, cannot be found
after diligent search, the notice and order shall also be served by posting a
copy on the property in a conspicuous place for a period of ten days, and
publication in a newspaper of general circulation published in Los Angeles
County pursuant to Section 6062 of the California Government Code.  The

enforcement protection and other consequential direct and indirect costs
relating to such abatement, including all administrative and legal fees and
costs, as well as any and all costs incurred pursuant to Section 8.12.050.

appeal the determinations set forth in this notice and order to the city
council by serving a written request for such an appeal on the city clerk

fifteen-day time period shall constitute a waiver of the party's rights to
contest the determinations set forth in the notice and order.

council's decision on the appeal of the notice and order within fifteen days
of service of notice of the city council's decision, or where more than

the city council's decision, the city manager may cause a nuisance to be
abated by city personnel or private contractors and the city manager is
authorized to pursue any and all legal means necessary to enter upon the
premises for such purposes.



   C.   If the city council has not previously authorized the city
manager to abate the nuisance, the city manager shall obtain authorization
from the city council by motion or resolution before seeking to abate the
nuisance by city forces or private contractors.



   D.   The responsible parties shall be liable to the city for all
costs the city incurs to initiate the abatement of and to abate the nuisance,

traffic control, law enforcement protection and other consequential direct
and indirect costs related to such abatement, including all administrative

8.12.080.

initiates the abatement of the nuisance on behalf of the city, under the
provisions of this chapter, including any action taken pursuant to Section
8.12.050, shall keep an account of the costs thereof. City personnel and/or
such person or persons shall submit to the city council for confirmation an
itemized written report showing such costs. The city council may confirm,
modify or reject some or all of the costs to be assessed against the
responsible party by motion or resolution.



   B.   Notice of the total costs confirmed by the city council that
have been incurred by the city to abate or initiate the abatement of the
nuisance, including all inspection, investigation, assessment, repair,
mitigation, remediation, removal, rehabilitation, security, storage, traffic
control, law enforcement protection and other consequential direct and

8.12.050, shall be served on the owner(s) of record in accordance with
Article 3, commencing with Section 415.10 of Chapter 4 of Title 5 of Part 2
of the Code of Civil Procedure. If the owner(s) of record, as shown on the
last equalized assessment roll or the supplemental roll, whichever is most
current, after diligent search cannot be found, the notice may be served by
posting a copy thereof in a conspicuous place on the property for a period of
ten days and publication thereof in a newspaper of general circulation
published in Los Angeles County pursuant to California Government Code
Section 6062. Responsible parties, other than owner(s) of record, shall be
served with this notice in the manner provided under Section 8.12.080. The
notice provided under this section shall include:



   1.   Notice that a lien may be imposed on the property if full
payment is not received by the city within thirty days from the date of
service of the notice;



   2.   The date of the notice and order issued to the responsible
party(ies), if such a notice and order was issued;

number of the parcel on which the lien may be imposed;



   4.   A statement advising the responsible party that the party may
appeal to the city council the reasonableness of the amount of the total cost
incurred by or on behalf of the city by serving a written request for such an
appeal on the city clerk. The written request must be received by the city
clerk within fifteen days from the date of service of the notice provided in
this section. Failure of the responsible party to file an appeal within this
fifteen-day period shall constitute a waiver of the party's rights to contest
the reasonableness of the costs.



   C.   If payment of the costs specified in subsection A of this
section is not provided within fifteen days of the notice provided under
subsection (B) of this section and no appeal of the reasonableness of the
total costs is timely made, a nuisance abatement lien may be recorded on the
property in the county recorder's office. From the date of recording, the
nuisance abatement lien shall have the same force, effect and priority as a
judgment lien.



   D.   If payment of the costs specified in subsection (A) of this
section is not provided within fifteen days of the notice provided under
subsection (B) of this section and no appeal is timely made, as an
alternative to the recording of a nuisance abatement lien, the city may
assess the unpaid costs as a special assessment against the property to be
collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes
are collected, subject to the same penalties and the same procedures under
foreclosure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary
municipal taxes. All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement
of municipal taxes shall be applicable to the special assessment provided for
in this chapter.



   E.   If the costs specified in subsection (A) of this section are
not paid within fifteen days of the notice provided under subsection (B) of
this section and no appeal is timely made on the city council, the unpaid
costs shall become a personal obligation of the responsible party(ies), and
each of them, jointly and severally, and the city attorney is authorized to
pursue collection of these costs by all appropriate legal means.



   F.   Where an appeal has been timely filed with the city clerk
contesting the reasonableness of the costs set forth in the notice provided
pursuant to subsection (B) of this section, the city clerk shall set the
matter for a public hearing before the city council within forty-five days
from receipt of the request for appeal. Notice of the public hearing shall be
provided to the appellant in accordance with Section 8.12.080. At the
conclusion of the public hearing, the city council, by motion or resolution,
shall confirm, modify or reject some or all of the costs set forth in the
notice given pursuant to subsection (B) of this section. Notice of the
decision of the council on the reasonableness of the costs and a demand for
payment of the costs determined to be reasonable by the council shall be
provided to the responsible party(ies) consistent with subsections (B)(1),
(2) and (3) of this section. If any costs are not paid within fifteen days of
the date of the notice of the city council's decision and request for
payment, the city may enforce its rights to collect these costs in accordance
with subsections (C), (D) and (E) of this section and in accordance with all
other legal means available to the city.

   Except for any nuisance abated pursuant to Section 17980 of the
California Health and Safety Code, in accordance with Section 38773.7 of the
California Health and Safety Code, an owner of property responsible for a
nuisance abated in accordance with this chapter shall be liable for treble
the costs of the abatement of such nuisance if a previous civil or criminal
judgment for abatement of a nuisance has been entered against such person
within the past two years.

pursuing any and all other legal means to abate or seek the abatement of a
public nuisance, or the recovery of costs and damages incurred therein,
including but not limited to requesting the city attorney and/or the district
attorney to commence civil and/or criminal proceedings.

8.13.010   Purpose.



   Under the provisions of state law and this code, violations of certain
sections of the code may be prosecuted criminally, enjoined by civil action,
or abated by the city. The purpose of this chapter is to provide for an
additional remedy to be referred to as administrative citation.
Administrative citations may be issued to persons who violate the provisions
of this code as specified in Section 8.13.020(B), in addition to any of the
other remedies provided by law.



(Ord. 2001-10-1296 § 2 (part))



8.13.020   Definitions.



   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply:



   A.   "Enforcement officer" means the director of community
development, or his or her designee.



   B.   "Offender" means any person, as defined in Section 1.04.010,
who has committed a violation of this code.



(Ord. 2001-10-1296 § 2 (part))



8.13.030   Administrative citations.



   A.   Citation Power. The director of community development, or his
or her designee, may issue an administrative citation as provided by this
chapter.



   B.   Violations Subject to Citation. Any violation of the Signal
Hill Municipal Code may be subject to the administrative citation process.



   C.   Correction Notice. Upon discovery of a violation, the
enforcement officer shall issue a written correction notice to the offender
by personal service or by registered or certified mail to the offender's last
known address. Such notice shall refer to the code section(s) violated and
facts supporting the issuance of the citation. The correction notice shall
also describe the action(s) necessary to correct the violation and state the
final date by which the correction must be completed and inform the offender
that he or she is subject to citation if the correction is not made by that
date.



   D.   Correction Period. Unless otherwise specified, an offender
shall have at least fifteen calendar days to correct or otherwise remedy a
violation prior to the issuance of an administrative citation and the
imposition of the corresponding fine. A longer correction period may be
granted if the enforcement officer determines that additional time is
reasonably necessary to remedy the violation.



   E.   Expedited Correction Date. An offender may be given less than
fifteen calendar days to correct or otherwise remedy a violation prior to the
issuance of an administrative citation should the violation be of a
transitory nature, or a condition which poses an immediate risk to the
health, safety or welfare of the community. An expedited correction date
shall set a correction date as short as "immediate," to as many as fourteen
days.



   F.   Citation Issuance--Immediate Risk to the Health. Safety or
Welfare of Community. An enforcement officer may, upon discovering that a
person has committed a violation of the municipal code that poses an
immediate risk to the health, safety or welfare of the community, issue an
administrative citation to the offender.



   G.   Citation Issuance--All Other Cases. In a case where a person
has committed a violation of the municipal code that does not pose an
immediate risk to the health, safety or welfare of the community, no
administrative citation shall be issued to an offender unless he or she has
been previously issued a correction notice.



   H.   Delivery of Citations. The administrative citation shall be
issued by personal service on the offender or by registered or certified mail
to the offender's last known address. The offender's failure to receive or
refusal to accept the administrative citation shall not affect the validity
of the administrative citation or any proceeding undertaken to this chapter.



   I.   Offender's Obligations--Pay Fine/Request Hearing. Within
fifteen calendar days from the date the administrative citation is issued, an
offender shall either:



   1.   Pay the administrative fine designated on the administrative
citation; or



   2.   Pay the administrative fine designated on the administrative
citation and make a written request to the city clerk for an administrative
hearing.



   The citation shall be deemed to have been issued on the date noted on
the citation, if personally served, or on the date mailed, if served by
registered or certified mail. The administrative citation shall include a
warning that failure to pay the fine, or failure to pay the fine and request
an administrative hearing and appear at the same may result in the city
taking all legal steps necessary to obtain payment of the fine, and the
offender being charged all costs of such collection.



   J.   Obligation to Correct Violation. Nothing in this chapter shall
be interpreted to mean that payment of the administrative fine by an offender
discharges or excuses the offender's obligation to correct the municipal code
violation. Failure to correct the municipal code violation may result in the
issuance of additional administrative fine citations, the commencement of a
criminal prosecution, or the imposition of any other legal remedy available
to the city.



(Ord. 2001-10-1296 § 2 (part))



8.13.040   Failure to pay fine.



   A.   Delinquency of Administrative Fine. Payment of an
administrative fine is delinquent thirty days after the fine becomes due and
payable. A delinquent administrative fine shall be treated as an account
receivable by the city and shall be subject to the city's established policy
for delinquent accounts payable. Furthermore, the offender shall also be
required to pay to the city its actual cost of collection. Any fine imposed
pursuant to Section 8.13.030(I) of this code shall be deemed delinquent if it
is not paid in accordance with the terms and conditions of Section
8.13.030(I).



   B.   Delinquency Penalty. Any person who fails to pay to the city
the amount of any fine imposed pursuant to the provisions of Section
8.13.030(I) of this code, on or before the date that fine amount is due,
shall be liable for the payment of an additional delinquency penalty. The
delinquency penalty is equal to ten percent of the amount due the city, or
ten percent of the amount of the fine remaining unpaid to the city if a
portion of the fine amount was timely paid. Interest shall accrue on all
delinquent accounts, exclusive of delinquent penalties at the rate of
one-half of one percent per month, pro rata, of the total delinquent fine
amount, from the date the fine becomes delinquent until the date that all
delinquent fine amounts are paid to the city.



(Ord. 2001-10-1296 § 2 (part))



8.13.050   Appeal hearings.



   A.   Request for Hearing. Any offender desiring to challenge the
issuance of an administrative citation shall, within fifteen calendar days
from the date the administrative citation is issued, make a written request
for a hearing with the city clerk setting forth the basis of the challenge.
The offender shall cause to be deposited with the city's finance department
the entire administrative fine plus two hundred fifty dollars as an offset to
one-half the fee associated with payment of an administrative hearing
officer. Subject to subsection (C), both parties shall equally share the cost
for the hearing officer.



   B.   Selection of Hearing Officer. The hearing officer shall be
chosen by the offender from a list made available by the city clerk. The list
of hearing officers shall contain no fewer than three names and shall not
include any person employed by the city.



   C.   Decision in Favor of Offender. If the administrative hearing
officer concludes the offender did not, in fact, violate any provision of the
Signal Hill Municipal Code and dismisses the citation, then the city shall
reimburse the offender the entire administrative fine amount and two hundred
fifty dollar fee paid pursuant to subsection (A). Dismissal of an
administrative citation shall not preclude the city from the commencement of
a criminal prosecution, or the imposition of any other legal remedy available
to the city.



   D.   Waiver of Right to Hearing. The offender's failure to appear at
a scheduled hearing shall constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing as
well as a waiver of a right to judicial review of the imposition of the
administrative fine. An offender's failure to appear at the hearing shall be
presumed to be an admission of guilt to the municipal code violation charges
as indicated on the administrative citation.



(Ord. 2001-10-1296 § 2 (part))



8.13.060   Judicial review.



   If an administrative citation is rendered in favor of the city, the
order shall be final. The offender may seek judicial review of the
administrative order by filing a petition for a writ of mandate pursuant to
Code of Civil Procedure, § 1094.5, within ninety calendar days after service
of the administrative order.

city property, it shall be the duty of the director of public works to cause
the nuisance to be at once removed or abated, and to draw upon the general
fund for such sums as may be required for its removal or abatement. The sum
or sums so paid shall, at the time of being so paid, become a lien on the
property from which or from the sidewalk in front of which the nuisance has
been removed or abated in pursuance of this section, and may be recovered by
an action against the property.

paid to the owner of the property if he can be found and, if not, then into
the court for his use when ascertained.

imposed by this chapter, due and unpaid at the time of the conviction and/or

payment of any permit fee or reimbursement of false alarm response fees
prevent enforcement through criminal, civil or administrative process for
violation of any of the provisions of this chapter.



   D.   The amount of any permit fee or reimbursement for excessive
false alarms shall be deemed a debt to the city. The city attorney may

   The impoundment procedures contained in this section shall apply only
to shopping carts that have the identification sign required by Section
8.54.030.



   A.   Any abandoned shopping cart may be impounded by the city at the
owner's cost if, prior to said impoundment, the city provides to the owner or
the owner's agent a minimum of three business days actual notice of the
shopping cart's discovery and location. Notice may be given by any
appropriate means, including by telephone. After said impoundment, the city
shall notify either the owner of the shopping cart or the owner's agent,
either by telephone or in writing, that the city has impounded the shopping
cart and the address at which the shopping cart is then located. Any owner
wishing to reclaim a shopping cart impounded pursuant to this subsection may
appear during normal business hours at the applicable location and reclaim
the shopping cart upon paying the fifty dollar fine authorized by Business
and Professions Code Section 22435.7 subsection (f) (the "fine"), if
applicable, and the city's actual costs incurred for impoundment and storage
of the shopping cart. The fine shall only be required to be paid if the owner
or the owner's agent fails to retrieve one or more shopping carts within the
applicable three-day period on three separate occurrences within any six
month period.



   B.   Any abandoned shopping cart may be immediately impounded by the
city provided that the city shall, within twenty-four hours of the shopping
cart's impoundment, notify the owner or the owner's agent that the shopping
cart has been impounded and the location at which the shopping cart was
impounded. Any owner wishing to reclaim a shopping cart impounded pursuant to
this subsection may appear during normal business hours within three business
days of the date of notice at the location and times indicated in the notice
and reclaim the shopping cart free of charge, unless the shopping cart was
impounded pursuant to subsection C of this section. Any shopping cart
reclaimed within the three-business-day period shall not be deemed an
"occurrence" for the purposes of assessing the fine referred to in subsection
A of this section. Any shopping cart not reclaimed within the
three-business-day period shall be subject to any applicable fee or fine
imposed pursuant to subsection A of thi ssection commencing on the fourth
business day following the date of the notice.



   C.   Notwithstanding anything contained in subsections A or B of
this section, any abandoned shopping cart found in a location where it will
impede emergency services or otherwise cause an immediate threat of danger to
persons or property may be immediately impounded by the city. After said
impoundment, the city shall, within twenty-four hours of the shopping cart's
impoundment, notify the owner of the shopping cart or the owner's agent, in
writing, that the city has impounded the shopping cart and the address at
which the shopping cart is then located. Any owner wishing to reclaim a
shopping cart impounded pursuant to this subsection may appear during normal
business hours within three business days of the date of notice at the
applicable location and reclaim the shopping cart upon paying the fine, if
applicable, and the city's actual costs incurred for impoundment and storage
of the shopping cart.

hours of said impoundment, the city shall attempt to notify the owner (if the
identity of the owner is known), either by telephone or in writing, that the
city has impounded the shopping cart and the location at which the shopping
cart was impounded. Any owner wishing to recover a shopping cart impounded
pursuant to this section may appear during normal business hours within
thirty days of the date of the notice (or, if no notice is given because the
identity of the owner is not known, within thirty days after impoundment) at

request for a hearing within fifteen days of receipt of notice that the
shopping cart has been impounded. The hearing shall be held not later than
thirty days from the date of the hearing request and the owner shall be
notified of the time, date, and location of the hearing. The city manager or
his or her designee shall appoint a hearing officer. If the hearing officer
determines that the city properly impounded the shopping cart and the owner
has been charged the appropriate amount, the owner shall pay all costs
associated with the administrative hearing and, if he or she desires to
reclaim the shopping cart, pay any applicable fee and/or fine. If the hearing
officer determines that the owner has been improperly charged a fee and/or
fine, the owner shall be entitled to reclaim the shopping cart at an adjusted

proposed activity or use may interfere with the use and enjoyment of the
public park, building, facility or other place by the general public; the
availability of the requested public park, building, facility or other place;
the extent to which the proposed activity or use would require the diversion
of public safety or other city employees from their normal duties so as to
unreasonably reduce adequate levels of service to any other portion of the
city; the extent to which the activity or event would adversely affect the
city's ability to reasonably perform municipal functions or furnish city
services; and any other criteria contained in any applicable policy of any
applicable city department. Based on these criteria, city department staff

shall be personally served or mailed to the applicant within five business
days of the application submittal. If the permit application is denied, all
deposited fees shall be returned to the applicant with the notice of denial.

expressive activity, no consideration may be given to the message of the
event, the content of speech, the identity or associational relationships of
the event organizer or its members or affiliates, or to any assumptions or
predictions as to the amount of hostility which may be aroused in the public
by the content of the speech or the message conveyed during the event.



   C.   Permits issued under the provisions of this chapter are subject
to such reasonable conditions as the city department staff may deem necessary
in order to ensure that the proposed activity or use will be compatible with
the general uses of the park or other public place; will prevent dangerous,
unlawful or impermissible uses; and will protect the safety of persons and
property; provided that such requirements shall not be imposed in a manner
that will unreasonably restrict expressive or other activity protected by the
California or United States Constitutions. Such conditions may include, but
shall not be limited to the following:



   1.   Limitations upon the times during which the proposed use will
be permitted;

services of the city;



   6.   Requirement that the applicant provide temporary sanitary
facilities, trash containers, and the like;



   7.   Requirement that the applicant post additional fees, deposits
or other security to cover extraordinary costs which may be incurred by the
city as a result of the proposed use; and

9.16.020   Definitions.



   The following terms used in this chapter, unless the context clearly
indicates otherwise, shall have the respective meanings set forth in this
section:



   A.   "Ambient noise" means the all-encompassing noise associated
with a given environment, being usually a composite of sounds from many
sources near and far. For the purpose of this chapter, "ambient noise level"
is the level obtained when the noise level is averaged over a period of
fifteen minutes without inclusion of noise from isolated identifiable
sources, at the location and time of day near that at which a comparison is
to be made.



   B.   "Ambient noise level" as referred to in this chapter, means the
higher of the following:



   1.   Actual measured ambient noise level; or



   2.   Presumed ambient noise level as determined from the following
chart:



 


Zone

 

Ambient Base Noise Level

twenty-four hour period as defined in Title 4, Subchapter 6 of the California
Administrative Code.



   D.   "Decibel" (Db) means a unit which denotes the ratio between two
quantities which are proportional to power; the number of decibels
corresponding to the ratio of two amounts of power is ten times the logarithm
to the base ten of this ratio.



   E.   "Sound level" (noise level) in decibels is sound measured using
the "A" weighting network of a sound level meter. Slow response of the sound
level meter needle shall be used except where the sound is impulsive or
rapidly varying in nature in which case fast response shall be used.



   F.   "Sound level meter" means an instrument including a microphone,
an amplifier, an output meter, and frequency weighting networks for the
measurement of sound levels which satisfies the pertinent requirements in
American National Standards Institutes's Specification S1.4 - 1971 or the
most recent revision thereof for Type S-2A general purpose sound level meters.



   G.   "Sound amplifying equipment" means any machine or device for
the amplification of the human voice, music, or any other sound. Sound
amplifying equipment does not include standard automobile radios when used
and heard only by the occupants of the vehicle in which the automobile radio
is installed. Sound amplifying equipment, as used in this chapter, does not
include warning devices on authorized emergency vehicles or horns or other

   ii.   Certification by a state licensed acoustical engineer that
there are no mitigation measures permitted under the Signal Hill Municipal
Code, other than repairs, modifications, or other alteration of the oil field
equipment, which can be properly designed to reduce the effect of oil field
equipment noise on affected dwellings to levels provided for in Section
9.16.020(B).



   B.   The mitigation measures proposed by any oil field equipment
noise mitigation plan shall be subject to review and approval under the
provisions of Chapter 20.52 as a part of the application for the project. No
project subject to the provisions of this section shall be approved without
the approval of an oil field equipment noise mitigation plan. No developer
applicant oil field equipment noise mitigation plan shall be approved until
such plan has been submitted by the director of planning to the operator of
the oil field equipment in question for review and comment. The operator
shall have thirty days to respond to the director of planning regarding such
plan submitted by the applicant and may request a hearing before the director
of planning and the applicant and shall have the right to protest such plan.



   C.   All mitigation measures in the approved oil field equipment
noise mitigation plan must be constructed or implemented as part of the
project construction. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued for any
dwelling until the applicant submits noise measurements taken by a state
licensed acoustical engineer, indicating compliance with the noise standards
provided in Section 9.16.020(B). If such measurements do not indicate
compliance, the applicant shall have ninety days to propose and install
additional mitigation measures to bring the dwelling into compliance.



   D.   If after construction or implementation of all mitigation
measures in an approved oil field equipment noise mitigation plan, and
construction and implementation of additional mitigation measures under
subsection C above, the city determines that the residence cannot be brought
into compliance with the noise standards provided in Section 9.16.020(B), the
city may issue a certificate of noncompliance for the residence. The
certificate of noncompliance shall allow the issuance of a certificate of
occupancy for the residence. The developer shall record the certificate of
noncompliance at the office of the county recorder. After issuance of the
certificate of noncompliance and certificate of occupancy, the residence may
be occupied, and shall be treated as an existing residential unit and nearby
oil field equipment shall be treated as existing oil field equipment for all
purposes under this chapter.

9.16.087   Existing oil field equipment violations and compliance
procedures.



   A.   For existing oil field equipment, residential owners or
occupants within six hundred feet of such equipment may contact the operators
to report offensive oil field equipment noise. It shall be the responsibility
of the operator to respond to any such report within twenty-four hours of
receiving the report. If after having contacted the operator the owner or
occupant is not satisfied with the corrective measures taken by the operator,
the owner or occupant may lodge a complaint with the city. Upon the receipt
of such a complaint, the city shall take noise measurements, using city
equipment and employees of the city trained to operate the equipment, to
determine if the noise as measured from interior areas of the affected
dwelling with windows open or from rear yard patio areas exceeds the noise
levels permitted by Section 9.16.020(B), and if the source of the noise is
oil field equipment. The owner or occupant making the complaint shall agree
to entry onto the affected property by city personnel, and by any state
licensed acoustical engineer retained by an operator pursuant to subsection C
below, for the purposes of making the noise measurements. In the absence of
such consent, the city need take no further action and the owner or occupant
shall be deemed to have abandoned the noise complaint.



   B.   1. Should the noise measurement indicate noise levels exceeding
the noise levels set forth in Section 9.16.020(B), the city shall notify the
operator. The notice shall state the time and date of the city's measurement,
the noise level measured, and shall state that the operator must take
corrective actions to remedy the violation. The corrective actions may
include, but are not limited to, the following:



   a.   Repairs to the oil field equipment motor, belts, transmission,
etc.;



   b.   Construction of an enclosure over the belt, motor, and/or
pulleys of sufficient design and quality to mitigate noise to the greatest
extent possible;



   c.   Construction of a wall between the offending oil field
equipment and the dwelling of sufficient height and density to mitigate noise
to the greatest extent possible;



   d.   Replacement or repair of old aboveground pumping units to
achieve noise levels similar to comparable equipment in good working order.



   2.   The notice shall also provide a reasonable time, not less than
ten days, but not to exceed sixty days, within which the oil field equipment
must be brought into compliance.



   C.   Upon receipt of the notice provided for above, the oil operator
may appeal the city's determination of noise level. The operator must
indicate its intent to appeal the determination in writing to the city clerk
within ten days of the receipt of notice. The appeal must state all grounds
upon which the operator challenges the notice. If the operator appeals the
determination, it shall provide to the city, within twenty days of its notice
of intent to challenge the determination, measurements from a state licensed
acoustical engineer, the engineer being mutually agreed upon by both the

unreasonable disturbances, in violation of California Penal Code Section 415,
and Chapter 9.16 of the Signal Hill Municipal Code, can disturb the public
peace, safety, health and welfare as to require added and extraordinary law
enforcement services particularly where repeated calls for services are made
and where those creating the need for services are failing to act in
accordance with the lawful instructions of law enforcement officers.  It is
in the best interests of the public peace, safety, health and welfare to
require those persons causing the need for special law enforcement services,
beyond those normally provided to the public at large, pay all or a part of
any extraordinary expenses generated by their own conduct. It is in the
interest of law abiding citizens that those persons generating a need for law
enforcement service should pay, in part, the cost therefore.

guardians will be held responsible for the costs of providing special police
services.



   B.   Such person(s) shall be given a first warning, in the form of
written notification by the police officer, that additional police department
responses within a thirty-day period to the same location or address will be
considered special police services subject to a police response service
charge. If no owner or other adult person in charge of the premises can be

shall constitute a valid and subsisting debt in favor of the city and against
the person(s) to whom such services are rendered. Should the amount due not
be paid, the city may collect the debt, as well as any cost incurred in
collecting the debt due to nonpayment, pursuant to any available provision of

Sections:



   9.56.010   Purpose and intent.



   9.56.020   Definitions.



   9.56.030   Unlawful to apply graffiti.

   9.56.120   Civil responsibility for damages for wrongful display or
storage.



   9.56.130   Graffiti declared a public nuisance.



   9.56.140   Right of city to require removal.



   9.56.150   Graffiti attracting surface as a nuisance.



   9.56.160   Right of city to remove.

   9.56.200   Civil remedies available.



9.56.010   Purpose and intent.



   A.   The city council specifically finds that graffiti on public or
private property is a blighting factor which not only depreciates the value
of property which has been the target of such vandalism but also depreciates
the value of the adjacent and surrounding properties so as to create a
negative impact upon the entire city. Graffiti also has been found to be a
means of identification utilized by gangs and its presence may encourage
further gang-related activities.



   B.   California Government Code Section 53069.3 authorizes the city,
under certain circumstances, to provide for the removal of graffiti and other
inscribed materials from private as well as public property. The council
finds and determines that graffiti is obnoxious and a public nuisance and
unless the city causes it to be removed from public and private property, it
tends to remain. Other properties then become the target of graffiti with the
result that entire neighborhoods are affected and become less desirable
places in which to live.



   C.   It is the purpose and intent of the city council, through the
adoption of this chapter, to provide additional enforcement tools to protect
public and private property from acts of vandalism and defacement, including
the application of graffiti on privately and publicly owned walls and
structures. Such acts are inimical to and destructive of the rights and
values of private property owners as well as the total community. It is the
further intent of the city council, through the adoption of the chapter, to
provide notice to all of those who disregard the property rights of others,
that the law enforcement agencies of the city will strictly enforce the law
and vigorously prosecute those persons engaging in the defacement of public
and private property.



(Ord. 94-04-1178 § 1 (part))

implement with a tip which, at its broadest width, is one-eighth (1/8th) of
an inch or greater.



   C.   "Graffiti" means any unauthorized inscription, word, figure,
painting, or other defacement that is written, marked, etched, scratched,
sprayed, drawn, painted, stuck-on, engraved on or otherwise affixed to or on
any surface, regardless of the nature of the material of that structural

be a public nuisance.

building, wall, fence, or other work of improvement on or to real property

tools or other implements capable of scarring glass, metal, concrete or wood.



   F.   "Gum label" means any sheet of paper, fabric, plastic or other
substance with an adhesive backing which, when placed on a surface, is not
easily removable.



   G.   "Paint stick or graffiti stick" means any device containing a
solid form of paint, chalk, wax epoxy, or other similar substance capable of

   D.   The person committing the graffiti-vandalism, and if an

   The city shall reimburse to any person reporting by means of a cellular

   A.   The intent of this chapter is to regulate adult oriented
businesses which, because of their very nature, are believed to have
significant adverse secondary effects on the community which include, but are
not limited to: depreciated property values and increased vacancies in
residential and commercial areas in the vicinity of the adult oriented
businesses; higher crime rates; noise; debris or vandalism in the vicinity of
adult oriented businesses; and blighting conditions such as low level
maintenance of commercial premises and parking lots which thereby have a
deleterious effect upon adjacent areas.  Special regulation of these uses is
necessary to ensure that these adverse effects will not contribute to the
blighting or downgrading of the neighborhoods near the adult oriented
businesses.  It is neither the intent, nor effect of this chapter to impose
limitations or restrictions on the content of any communicative material. 
Similarly, it is neither the intent, nor effect of this chapter to restrict
or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials or merchandise
protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors or
exhibitors of adult oriented businesses to their intended market.



   B.   Nothing in this section is intended to authorize, legalize or
permit the establishment, operation or maintenance of any business, building
or use which violates any city ordinance or any statute of the state of
California regarding public nuisances, unlawful exposure, sexual conduct,
lewdness or obscene or harmful matter or the exhibition or public display
thereof.

(Ord. 85-06-949 § 1)



10.28.240   Preferential parking.



   A.   Authority to Establish Preferential Parking Zones. The city
council may designate, by resolution, certain residential streets or any
portion thereof as preferential parking zones for the benefit of residents
within such zone, in which zone vehicles displaying a permit may be exempt
from parking prohibitions or restrictions otherwise posted, marked or
noticed. Each preferential parking zone shall be designated only upon
findings that such zone is required to enhance or protect the quality of life
in the area of the proposed zone which is threatened by noise, traffic
hazards, environmental pollution, or devaluation of real property resulting
from nonresident vehicular parking or traffic, and that such zone is
necessary to provide reasonably available and convenient parking for the
benefit of the residents within such zone. No resolution designating a
preferential parking zone shall be enforceable until signs or markings giving
adequate notice thereof have been placed.



   B.   Criteria for Findings. The findings set forth in subsection A
of this section shall be based upon the existence of one or more of the
following conditions established to the satisfaction of the city council:



   1.   Nonresident vehicles regularly and substantially interfere with
the use of available public street parking spaces by the residents in the
area of the proposed zone;



   2.   A shortage of reasonably available and convenient
residential-related parking spaces exists in the area of the proposed zone;



   3.   Extended parking during the day or night by a substantial
number of nonresident vehicles in the area of the proposed zone;



   4.   Overnight parking by a substantial number of nonresident
vehicles in the area of the proposed zone.



   C.   Establishment of Specific Zones.



   1.   Upon receipt and verification of a petition on a form supplied
by the public works director, signed by residents of two-thirds of the
dwelling units of the area and proposed for designation, the public works
director and chief of police shall jointly review the petition and submit a
report to the city council.



   2.   After receipt of the report, the city council shall conduct a
public hearing thereon, for the purpose of determining whether such
preferential parking zone should be established by resolution. Notice of such
public hearing shall be given at least ten days prior to the hearing, by
publication in a newspaper of general circulation and by mailing to the
property owners as shown on the last equalized assessment roll, and to the
occupants, of each parcel in the area proposed for designation as a
preferential parking zone.



   3.   As an alternative to the petition described in subsection
(C)(1) of this section, the city council, on its own motion, may initiate the
public hearing process described in subsection (C)(2) of this section if the
city council finds that a petition by two-thirds of the residents is
unnecessary. Prior to the public hearing, the public works director shall
notify the neighborhood residents of the city council's interest in
establishing a preferential parking zone, and shall conduct neighborhood
outreach, through a neighborhood meeting or other means, to ascertain the
neighborhood residents' interest in the establishment of a preferential
parking zone. After the neighborhood outreach effort, the public works
director shall prepare the report as described in subsection (C)(1) of this
section.



   D.   Issuance of Permits.



   1.   Bumper Sticker Permits. The chief of police shall issue
permits, in the form of adhesive labels or decals, for preferential parking
to qualified applicants who have completed an application form supplied by
the chief of police. Applicants for such permits shall present such proof as
may be required by the chief of police of residence within the area
designated as a preferential parking zone. Not more than three permits shall
be issued for each qualified dwelling unit to any qualified applicant.
Applicants requesting more than three permits for any dwelling unit may be
granted additional permits by the chief of police upon a showing that there
are more than three vehicles registered at the address of such dwelling unit
and that insufficient off-street parking is available to the applicants
during the effective hours of the preferential parking zone. The finance
department shall collect a fee for each permit issued.



   2.   Duration of Permit. Permits issued pursuant to this section,
with the exception of visitor permits, shall remain effective so long as the
applicant continues to reside at the address set forth on the application and
continues to own the vehicle to which the permit is attached, and so long as
the zone for which the permit was issued remains in effect.



   3.   Visitor Permit. Any resident eligible for a preferential
parking permit may also apply to the chief of police for a visitor
preferential parking permit for the use of visitors to the home of the
applicant. The chief of police shall collect a refundable fee for each such
permit issued. No more than two visitor preferential parking permits shall be
issued for any one dwelling at any time. Visitor preferential parking permits
shall be valid for a period of thirty days. Visitor preferential parking
permits shall not be replaced if lost or stolen, except upon the payment of
an additional fee as required herein.



   4.   Placement. Permits shall be placed upon the left rear bumper of
each vehicle to be accorded preferential parking privileges, except that
visitor permits shall be placed on the left front vehicle dashboard.



   5.   Conditions of Permit. Each permit shall be subject to all
conditions and restrictions set forth in this section and of the preferential
parking zone for which it is issued. The issuance of such a permit shall not
be construed to be a permit for, or approval of, any violation of any
provision of this code or any other laws or regulations.



   6.   Fees. Such fees as may be required herein shall be set from
time to time by resolution of the city council. Fees shall be waived for
those residents whose monthly income meets the current standards used for
Southern California Edison's California Alternate Rates for Energy (C.A.R.E.)
program.



   E.   Prohibitions.



   1.   No vehicle shall be parked or stopped adjacent to any curb in a
preferential parking zone in violation of any posted or noticed prohibition
or restriction unless such vehicle shall have prominently displayed upon the
left rear bumper thereof a permit indicating the exemption from such
restriction or prohibition, or a visitor preferential parking permit
suspended from the rear view mirror therein indicating such exemption; except
that the following vehicles shall be exempted from this prohibition:



   a.   A motor vehicle identified, in a manner prescribed by the
public works director, as owned by or operated under contract to a utility,
whether privately, municipally or publicly owned, when used in the
construction, operation, removal, or repair of utility property or facilities
or engaged in authorized work in the designated preferential parking zone;



   b.   A motor vehicle identified in a manner prescribed by the public
works director, as owned by or operated under contract to a governmental
agency, when used in the course of official government business;



   c.   A commercial vehicle or trailer engaged in loading or unloading
property, or parked in connection with or in aid of the performance of a
service to or on a property located in the block in which such vehicle is
parked.



   2.   It shall be unlawful for any person to sell, rent or lease, or
cause to be sold, rented or leased, for any value or consideration, any
preferential parking permit. Upon conviction of a violation of this
paragraph, all preferential parking permits issued to, or for the benefit of,
the dwelling unit to which the sold, rented or leased permit is authorized
shall be void.



   3.   It shall be unlawful for any person to buy or otherwise acquire
for value or use any preferential parking permit, except as provided for in
this section.



   F.   Termination of Preferential Parking Zones.



   1.   Upon receipt and verification of a petition supplied by the
public works director, signed by residents living in two-thirds of the
dwelling units of an area established as a preferential parking zone, or upon
a motion by one of its members, the public works director and chief of police
may jointly recommend to the city council that any preferential parking zone
be terminated.



   2.   Upon such a recommendation by the public works director and
chief of police, the city council shall conduct a public hearing thereon, for
the purpose of determining whether a proper basis exists for terminating such
preferential parking zone. Notice of such public hearing shall be given in
the same manner as required for establishment of the zone.



   3.   Such a determination shall be based upon a finding that the
conditions set forth in subsection A of this section no longer exist or have
diminished in degree to such an extent as to make unnecessary the
continuation of the zone.



(Ord. 99-09-1262 §§ 1--4; Ord. 86-12-984 § 1)



10.28.250   Parking restricted for large commercial vehicles.

(Ord. 84-11-937 § 1 (part))



10.38.020   Prohibition of interstate trucks.



   Interstate trucks are prohibited from operating upon streets and
highways within the city except as follows:



   A.   Interstate trucks may operate over routes identified and signed
by the city engineer as connections between the federally designated highway
system and terminals designated pursuant to this chapter.



   B.   Interstate trucks may operate on streets and highways within
one-half road mile of points of ingress and egress identified and signed by
Caltrans on the federally designated highway system, to obtain access to
fuel, food, lodging and/or repair when such access is consistent with the
safe operation of such vehicles.



   C.   Interstate trucks licensed to carry household goods may operate
on streets and highways when directly enroute to or from a point of loading
or unloading, if travel on such streets and highways is necessary and
incidental to the shipment of the household goods.



(Ord. 84-11-937 § 1 (part))



10.38.030   Application.



   A.   Any interested person requiring terminal access for interstate
trucks from the federally designated highway system shall submit an
application, on a form provided by the city, together with such information
as may be required by the city engineer and appropriate fees to the city.



   B.   Upon receipt of the application, the city engineer will cause
an investigation to be made to ascertain whether or not the proposed terminal
facility meets the requirements herein for a terminal. Upon approval of that
designation, the city engineer will then determine the capability of the
route requested and alternate routes, whether requested or not. Determination
of route capability will include, without limitation, a review of adequate
turning radius and lane widths of ramps, intersections and highways and
general traffic conditions such as sight distance, speed and traffic volumes.
No access off a federally designated highway system will be approved without
the approval of Caltrans.



   C.   Should the requested route pass through the city to a terminal
located in another jurisdiction, the applicant shall comply with that
jurisdiction's application process. Coordination of the approval of the route
through the city will be the responsibility of the jurisdiction which
controls the terminal's land use.



(Ord. 84-11-937 § 1 (part))



10.38.040   Fees and costs.



   A.   The applicant shall pay a nonrefundable application fee, as
established from time to time by resolution of the city council, sufficient
to pay the cost of the review of the terminal designation and the review of
the route and alternate routes.



   B.   Upon the approval of the terminal designation and route by the
city and by Caltrans, the applicant shall deposit with the city sufficient
funds as estimated by the city engineer to pay for the purchase and
installation of terminal trailblazer signs. Upon completion of the
installation of the signs, the actual cost shall be computed and any
difference between the actual and the estimated costs shall be billed or
refunded to the applicant, whichever the case may be. No terminal or route
may be used until such signs as may be required are in place. Costs for
trailblazer signs may be proportioned in accordance with the procedures in
Section 10.38.050.



(Ord. 84-11-937 § 1 (part))



10.38.050   Retrofitting.



   A.   If all feasible routes to a requested terminal are found
unsatisfactory by the city engineer, the applicant may request that
improvements be constructed which will correct the deficiencies of the route.
All costs of engineering, construction and inspection will be the
responsibility of the applicant. Except when the retrofitting of deficiencies
is within the jurisdiction of Caltrans, the actual construction will be done
by the city or by a contractor acceptable to it.



   B.   When the work is to be done by the city, the applicant shall
deposit with the city the estimated cost of retro-fitting. Adjustments
between the estimated and actual cost shall be made after completion of the
work and any difference between the actual and the estimated cost shall be
billed or refunded to the applicant as the case may be. When the work is done
by the applicant, the applicant may file with the city engineer, on a form
satisfactory to the city engineer, a statement detailing the actual costs of
the retrofitting.



   C.   If at any time within five years from the date of completion of
the retrofitting by the applicant, an applicant seeks terminal approval which
would use the route upon which such retrofitting was accomplished, any such
applicant's fee may include their proportionate share of the retrofitting, as
determined by the city engineer, which fee shall be reimbursed by the city to
the applicant who paid for the retrofitting, as determined by the city
engineer, which fee shall be reimbursed by the city to the applicant who paid
for the retrofitting, as well as to any applicant who contributed to the cost
of retrofitting under this subsection. Nothing herein shall require the
payment of a proportionate fee if the applicant doing the work failed to file
the report with the city engineer required by subsection B of this section.



(Ord. 84-11-937 § 1 (part))



10.38.060   Revocation of route.



   The city engineer may revoke any approved terminal or route if the
terminal or route becomes a safety hazard for vehicular traffic. A safety
hazard includes the inability of interstate trucks to negotiate the route or
said vehicles causing unsafe driving conditions for other vehicular traffic
or pedestrians.



(Ord. 84-11-937 § 1 (part))



10.38.070   Appeals.



   Any determination made by the city engineer pursuant to this chapter
may be appealed by any aggrieved person within ten days following the date of
decision of the city engineer to the city council in writing. An appeal shall
be made on a form prescribed by the city and shall be filed with the city
clerk. The appeal shall state specifically wherein there was an error or
abuse of discretion by the city engineer or wherein the decision is not
supported by the evidence in the record. The city clerk shall schedule the
matter for hearing by the city council within thirty days and make copies of
all relevant material available to all parties with notice of the date and
time of hearing. The city council shall uphold, revoke or modify the
determination of the city engineer and provide written notice of its decision
to affected parties within fifteen days after conclusion of the hearing.

10.46.010   Declared Nuisance.



   In addition to and in accordance with the determination made and the
authority granted by the State under Section 22660 of the Vehicle Code to
remove abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles or parts
thereof as public nuisances, the City Council makes the following findings
and declarations:



   The accumulation and storage of abandoned, wrecked, dismantled, or
inoperative vehicles or parts thereof on private or public property, not
including highways, is found to create a condition tending to reduce the
value of private property, to promote blight and deterioration, to invite
plundering, to create fire hazards, to constitute an attractive nuisance, to
create a hazard to the health and safety of minors, to create a harborage for
rodents and insects and to be injurious to the health, safety and general
welfare of the public.  Therefore, the presence of an abandoned, wrecked,
dismantled or inoperative vehicle, or parts thereof, on private or public
property, not including highways, is declared to constitute a public nuisance
which may be abated as such in accordance with the provisions of this chapter
and those of Chapter 8.12 of this code.



   Vehicles to which this chapter shall apply include, but are not limited
to, the following:



   A.   Abandoned Vehicles.  Abandoned vehicle means any vehicle, or
vehicle part or parts, that is wrecked, dismantled or otherwise inoperative
which is parked, stored, or left standing where it is visible from the street
or other public or private property, even if partially screened, for more
than five (5) consecutive days.  A vehicle shall be presumed inoperative if
it shows a registration sticker indicating it is registered or certified as a
non-operative vehicle with the Department of Motor Vehicles, or its
registration as an operative vehicle has been expired for at least sixty (60)
days.  A presumption of abandonment shall arise when a vehicle is located in
a residential zone in an area not specifically designed for vehicular
parking.  Areas not specifically designed for vehicular parking in
residential zones shall include, but are not limited to, front, side and rear
yards and unpaved areas.



   B.   Unsightly Vehicles.  Unsightly vehicle means any vehicle,
which becomes unsightly and detracts from the appearance of the neighborhood
due to such factors as excessive rust, corrosion, or faded, chipped or peeled
paint.



(Ord. 2002-01-1301 § 2)



10.46.020   Definitions.



   The following words and phrases shall, for the purpose of this chapter,
have the following meanings ascribed to them:



   A.   "Highway" means a way or place of whatever nature, publicly
maintained and open to the use of the public for purposes of vehicular
travel.  Highway includes street.

12.05.010   Purpose. 



   The purpose of this chapter is to establish standards for the planting,
removal, replacement, and maintenance of all city street trees in accordance
with tree species recommendations contained in the Street Tree Master Plan
and to create a sense of community, pride, and recognition to individual
neighborhoods.  The City wishes to minimize maintenance costs and develop a
cost-effective street tree planting program.  (Ord. 2011-11-1441 § 1(part),
2011)



12.05.020   Definitions. 



   A.   “Adjacent property” means any portion of public
right-of-way that directly abuts private property and falls under the
maintenance responsibility of the requesting property owner.



   B.   “Poorly Structured Tree” means a tree that is growing in
such a way as to cause hazard within the public right-of-way.



   C.   A “Street Tree” is defined as a city-owned tree that is
located in the public rights-of-way which include parkways (between street
curb and sidewalk), trees located in sidewalk tree wells, and behind
sidewalks but within the public street right-of-way.



   D.   The “Street Tree Master Plan” is referenced and
incorporated herein.  It is maintained at the Department of Public
Works/Engineering.  The Street Tree Master Plan serves to establish a
cohesive tree planting program with an appropriate diversity of tree species,
designed to provide an expression of neighborhood identity through
distinctive plantings while minimizing sidewalk damage and excessive
maintenance.  The Street Tree Master Plan is updated approximately every
five years and consists of the following elements:



      1.   A city-wide street tree inventory evaluation listing tree
condition, type of species (10 most common), trunk diameter size, and tree
height, as well as identification of vacant tree sites, stumps and
dead/diseased trees.



      2.   A street tree planting schedule listing the existing
street tree species type along with recommended replacement tree species that
are believed to be most appropriate given the unique characteristics of any
one particular site. 



      3.   A street tree species palette which provides general
parameters of each of the recommended street tree species referenced in the
city street tree planting schedule.    (Ord. 2011-11-1441 § 1(part), 2011)



12.05.030   Street Tree Maintenance. 



   The city strives to maintain city street trees in a healthy and
nonhazardous condition through good arboricultural standards and practices. 
This Section defines both city responsibilities and property owner/resident
responsibilities for the maintenance and overall health of the community's
street tree inventory. 



   A.   City Responsibilities.  City responsibilities include
performing periodic trimming work for all the street trees.  The street tree
trimming schedule is divided up into four maintenance areas as defined in the
city's Street Tree Master Plan.  Street trees located in each of these
maintenance areas are generally trimmed on a two-year cycle as the city
budget allows.  Specific individual street trees may be trimmed on a more
regular basis to ensure sidewalks and streets are clear of any safety hazards
or as otherwise required.   



   B.   Property Owner/Resident Responsibilities.  Property owner and
resident responsibilities include ensuring street trees located adjacent to
the property receive the proper amount of water to ensure the health of the
tree.  Responsibilities also include reporting any damaged or suspected
diseased street trees to the Public Works Department.  Under no
circumstances shall a property owner/resident be permitted to trim or remove
a street tree.



   C.   Unscheduled Street Tree Trimming - Owner Requests.  A property
owner may request that street trees adjacent to their property be trimmed
more frequently than the City's trimming schedule would provide. 



      1.   The cost to perform this additional trimming work, if
ultimately approved, would be that of the property owner.  The property
owner shall complete a street tree request application justifying the need
for expedited street tree trimming. 



      2.   The Public Works Department staff will assess the overall
condition of the existing street tree, the extent of trimming needs, and
estimating the cost of such additional tree trimming.  The property owner's
approval of the cost shall be obtained before the Director of Public Works'
determination is made.        3.   If approved, the assessment
shall include a written recommendation on the extent of trimming that may be
performed along with a written estimated cost for the trimming work. 



      4.   Assessments will be completed on a first-come,
first-served basis and, depending on resources, within 30 days. 



      5.   The Director of Public Works shall make the final
determination on the unscheduled street tree trimming. 



      6.   If mutually agreed to by the applicant and Public Works
Director, the street tree trimming shall be performed within 30 days. 



      7.   Prior to the commencement of the work, the applicant must
deposit funds with the city to cover the cost of the street tree trimming
work, including all incidental costs in compliance with Section 12.05.060 of
this chapter.  (Ord. 2011-11-1441 § 1(part), 2011)



12.05.040   New Street Tree Planting. 



   A.   Placement of Street Trees.  The Director of Public Works shall
make the determination on the placement and selection of new street trees. 
This determination will be based on criteria defined in this section;
however, other criteria that may be unique to a given location will also be
considered. 



   B.   Street tree species selection.  Absent unique circumstances,
the Director of Public Works will make a determination on the selection of
new street trees from the proposed street tree species list in the city's
most current Street Tree Master Plan.  The proposed street tree species must
be listed in the city's most current Street Tree Master Plan Update.  The
Street Tree Planting Schedule contained in the Street Tree Master Plan lists
approved street species based on street name and address blocks.  In most
cases there are at least two or three species that can be selected at a given
location.  The minimum size for a street tree planting/replacement shall be
a 15-gallon container.



   C.   New street tree placement.  Features that may be unique to an
individual street parkway will be taken into consideration by the Director of
Public Works when placing a new street tree.  These include width of
parkway, width of sidewalk, existence of sidewalk, utility poles, street
lights, bus stops, traffic signs, ADA accessibility, utility boxes, and fire
hydrants.  Therefore, the following planting guidelines must be followed by
the Director of Public Works to optimize street tree planting opportunities.



      1.   Street trees shall have an approximate range between
30-foot minimum spacing to a 50-foot maximum spacing.



      2.   Street trees shall be placed 20 feet from a street light,
power pole or bus stops where possible.



      3.   Street trees shall be placed a minimum of 15 feet from
the start of a street curb return.



      4.   Street trees shall be placed a minimum of 10 feet from a
fire hydrant, utility meter, or driveway approach where possible.



      5.   Street trees shall be centered in the parkway between the
sidewalk and curb.



      6.   Street tree well sizes must be a minimum of 30 inches and
provide enough sidewalk clearance to meet ADA access requirements.



   D.   New street tree planting - property owner request.  The
following process shall be utilized by an applicant when requesting a new
street tree to be planted:



      1.   The property owner shall complete a Street Tree Request
Application. 



      2.   The property owner shall include the following
information in the Application: (i) a sketch of the property owner's adjacent
parkway showing all pertinent information as detailed in Subsection C of this
Section, and (ii) choice of tree species out of the proposed street tree
species list in the City's most current Street Tree Master Plan.



      3.   Applications will be reviewed and approved or denied by
the Public Works Director on a case by case basis based on the Public Works
Department staff's assessment of the applicant's request, extent of the need
for the new street tree, and estimating the cost for same.



         a.   If the Application is approved for a property where
street tree(s) currently exist adjacent to the applicant's property, all
costs to have a new tree planted under this Section, shall be that of the
property owner.  If mutually agreed to by the applicant and the Public Works
Director, the new street tree planting shall be performed within 30 days
provided. 



         b.   If the Application is approved and it is determined
that the property owner is responsible for the cost of the work, the city
will prepare a written cost estimate and will forward to the applicant with
written approval of the application.  Prior to the commencement of the work,
the applicant must deposit funds with the city to cover the cost of the
street tree planting work including all incidental costs in compliance with
Section 12.05.060 of this chapter.



         c.   If the application is approved for a property where
street tree(s) currently do not exist adjacent to the applicant's property,
the city is responsible for the cost of the planting of the street trees per
Section 12.05.060 of this chapter and as city budget allows on a first-come,
first-served basis. 



      4.   Any person dissatisfied with the decision of the Public
Works Director may appeal such decision to the City Council in compliance
with Section 12.05.070 of this chapter.  (Ord. 2011-11-1441 §1(part), 2011)



12.05.050   Existing Street Tree Removal/ Replacement.



   A.   The Director of Public Works shall make the determination on
the replacement of existing street trees as defined in this section.



   B.   City Responsibility - Street Tree Replacement.  The Department
of Public Works will assess the overall condition of each street tree as part
of the street tree trimming cycle.  Should one of the following conditions
be observed as part of this assessment, the city will remove and replace the
street tree at no cost to the adjacent property owner:



      1.   Dead, diseased, or severely declining tree.



      2.   Poorly structured tree (potentially hazardous).



      3.   Seedling or volunteer growth (palms, pepper, etc.).



      4.   American's with Disability Act access, utility, or sign
obstruction.



      5.   A tree severely damaging adjacent hardscape or
underground/ overhead utilities.



   Property owners are also responsible to report to the city any observed
decline of the health of a street tree and/or other observations consistent
with the criteria listed above regarding street trees adjacent to their
properties.  Upon receiving these reports the city will take the necessary
actions including possible replacement of the street tree at no cost to the
property owner. 



   C.   Street Tree Replacement - Property Owner Request.  A property
owner may request replacement of a street tree adjacent to the property for
reasons other than defined in Subsection B above.  The entire cost to
perform this replacement work, including incidental cost, if ultimately
approved, shall be the responsibility of the property owner. The following
process shall be followed when making this request:



      1.   The property owner shall complete a street tree request
application describing the reason(s) for the proposed street tree replacement
and choice of tree species out of the proposed street tree species list in
the city's most current Street Tree Master Plan.



      2.   The Public Works Department Staff will assess the overall
condition of the existing street tree proposed for replacement, extent of the
need for the replacement, and estimating the cost for same.  If approved,
the assessment shall include a written recommendation based on the tree
planting guidelines per this chapter with a written estimated cost for the
replacement work.  Assessments will be completed on a first-come,
first-served basis and, depending on resources, within 30 days.



      3.   If mutually agreed to by the applicant and the Public
Works Director, the street tree replacement planting shall be performed
within 30 days. 



      4.   Prior to the commencement of the work, the applicant must
deposit funds with the city to cover the cost of the street tree trimming
work including all incidental costs in compliance with Section 12.05.060 of
this chapter.



   D.   Street Tree Removal (No Street Tree Replacement) - Property
Owner Request.  The city discourages the removal of a street tree unless a
corresponding replacement tree is planted in approximately the same location
consistent with the planting guidelines detailed in Section 12.05.040,
Subsection C of this chapter.  However, the city also recognizes there may
be unique circumstances that warrant removal of a street tree without a
corresponding planting of a replacement street tree. An example of such a
circumstance may include street trees planted at a greater density that is
specified in planting guidelines.  The following process shall be utilized
when making this request:



      1.   The property owner shall complete a street tree request
application describing the reason for the proposed street tree removal.  A
street tree request application may be obtained at the Department of Public
Works/Engineering or on-line at the City's website.  The property owner

for the applicant to supplement the deposit accordingly.  The city will not
continue any work unless the applicant supplements the deposit as demanded by
the city within ten (10) days.  Failure to timely supplement the deposit may
be construed as a waiver of the applicant's rights and requests, and the city
may then finalize the project at its sole discretion as it deems appropriate.

the city engineer, within sixty days after completion of the installation
thereof, a corrected map or set of maps or corrected atlas sheets, each drawn
to a scale of not more than two hundred feet to the inch, which shall
describe and show the location of all parts of the facility; provided,
however, that if the map filed with the city engineer at the time the permit
is issued is correct in every detail, such person may make a notation to that
effect on the map and such map shall constitute a compliance with this

   For purposes of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply:



   A.   "40 CFR" means Title 40 of the Code of Federal Regulations.



   B.   "Automotive Service Facility" A facility that is categorized in
any one of the following Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) and North
American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes. For inspection
purposes, Permittees need not inspect facilities with SIC codes 5013, 5014,
5541, 5511, provided that these facilities have no outside activities or
materials that may be exposed to storm water.

   D.   "Best Management Practice (BMP)" means practices or physical
devices or systems designed to prevent or reduce pollutant loading from storm
water or non-storm water discharges to receiving waters, or designed to
reduce the volume of storm water or non-storm water discharged to the
receiving water.



   E.   "Biofiltration" means A LID BMP that reduces storm water
pollutant discharges by intercepting rainfall on vegetative canopy, and
through incidental infiltration and/or evapotranspiration, and filtration. As
described in the Ventura County Technical Guidance Manual, studies have
demonstrated that biofiltration of 1.5 times the storm water quality design
volume (SWQDv) provides approximately equivalent or greater reductions in
pollutant loading when compared to bioretention or infiltration of the SWQDv
achieving the required pollutant load reduction. Therefore, the term
"biofiltration" as used in this Order is defined to include only systems
designed to facilitate incidental infiltration or achieve the equivalent
pollutant reduction as biofiltration BMPs with an underdrain (subject to
Executive Officer approval). Biofiltration BMPs include bioretention systems
with an underdrain and bioswales.



   F.   "Bioretention" means a LID BMP that reduces storm water runoff
by intercepting rainfall on vegetative canopy, and through evapotranspiration
and infiltration. The bioretention system typically includes a minimum 2-foot
top layer of a specified soil and compost mixture underlain by a
gravel-filled temporary storage pit dug into the in-situ soil. As defined in
this chapter, a bioretention BMP may be designed with an overflow drain, but
may not include an underdrain. When a bioretention BMP is designed or
constructed with an underdrain it is regulated by the MS4 Permit as
biofiltration.



   G.   "Bioswale" means a LID BMP consisting of a shallow channel
lined with grass or other dense, low-growing vegetation. Bioswales are
designed to collect storm water runoff and to achieve a uniform sheet flow
through the dense vegetation for a period of several minutes.



   H.   "Brownfield Development" means real property, the expansion,
redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or
potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant.

complexes, and enclosed shopping malls or shopping centers.



   N.   Conditionally exempt non-storm water discharges are certain
categories of discharges that are not composed entirely of storm water and
that are either not sources of pollutants or may contain only minimal amounts
of pollutants and when in compliance with specified BMPs do not result in
significant environmental effects. (See 55 Fed. Reg. 47990, 47995 (Nov. 16,
1990)).



   O.   "Construction Activity" Construction activity includes any
construction or demolition activity, clearing, grading, grubbing, or
excavation or any other activity that results in land disturbance.
Construction does not include emergency construction activities required to
immediately protect public health and safety or routine maintenance
activities required to maintain the integrity of structures by performing
minor repair and restoration work, maintain the original line and grade,
hydraulic capacity, or original purposes of the facility. See "Routine
Maintenance" definition for further explanation. Where clearing, grading or
excavating of underlying soil takes place during a repaving operation, State
General Construction Permit coverage is required if more than one acre is
disturbed or the activities are part of a larger plan.



   P.   "Control" means to minimize, reduce or eliminate, by
technological, legal, contractual, or other means, the discharge of
pollutants from an activity or activities.



   Q.   "Dechlorinated/debrominated swimming pool discharges" means
swimming pool discharges which have no measurable chlorine or bromine and do

from any "point source" or, any addition of any pollutant or combination of
pollutants to the waters of the "contiguous zone" or the ocean from any point
source other than a vessel or other floating craft which is being used as a
means of transportation. The term discharge includes additions of pollutants
into waters of the United States from: surface runoff which is collected or
channeled by man; discharges through pipes, sewers, or other conveyances
owned by a State, municipality, or other person which do not lead to a
treatment works; and discharges through pipes, sewers, or other conveyances,

any other activity shall be contained at the project site; and



   d.   Erosion from slopes and channels shall be controlled by
implementing an effective combination of BMPs, such as the limiting of
grading scheduled during the wet season; inspecting graded areas during rain
events; planting and maintenance of vegetation on slopes; and covering
erosion susceptible slopes.



   2.   For those construction projects which are one acre and greater,
the owner, operator and person in charge of the day-to-day activities at such
construction site shall meet the following minimum requirements:



   a.   Where coverage is required pursuant to the state construction
general permit, to have proof of a waste discharger identification number for
filing of a notice of intent for permit coverage under the state construction
general permit, as well as a certification that an SWPPP has been prepared;
and



   b.   To show proof of a notice of intent and a copy of the SWPPP
upon the transfer of ownership of any part or portion of the subject
property, while construction activities are ongoing.



   D.   City review and plan approval.



   1.   Prior to the issuance of a permit for a new development or
redevelopment project, the City shall evaluate the proposed project using the
applicable state construction general permit approved by the Regional Board,
and erosion and grading requirements of the City building official or
director to determine (i) its potential to generate the flow of pollutants
into the MS4 during construction; and (ii) how well the SWPPP for the
proposed project meets the goals of this chapter.  Each plan will be
evaluated on its own merits according to the particular characteristics of
the project and the site to be developed.  Based upon the review, the City
may impose conditions upon the issuance of the building permit, in addition
to any required by the state construction general permit for the project, in
order to minimize the flow of pollutants into the MS4.



   2.   No grading permit for developments requiring coverage under the
state construction general permit shall be issued unless the applicant can
show that a notice of intent to comply with the state construction general
permit has been filed and that an SWPPP has been prepared for the project.



   3.   Storm water runoff containing sediment, construction waste or
other pollutants from the construction site and parking areas shall be
reduced to the maximum extent practicable.  The following best management
practices shall apply to all construction projects within the city, and shall
be required from the time of demolition of existing structures or
commencement of construction until receipt of a certificate of occupancy:



   a.   Sediment, construction waste, and other pollutants from
construction activities shall be retained on the construction site to the
maximum extent practicable;



   b.   Structural controls such as sediment barriers, plastic
sheeting, detention ponds, dikes, filter beams and similar controls shall be
utilized to the maximum extent practicable in order to minimize the escape of
sediment and other pollutants from the site;



   c.   All excavated soil shall be located on the site in a manner
that minimizes the amount of sediments running onto the street, drainage
facilities or adjacent properties.  Soil piles shall be covered with plastic
or similar material until the soil is either used or removed from the site;



   d.   No washing of construction or other vehicles is permitted
adjacent to a construction site.  No water from the washing of construction
or other vehicles is permitted to run off the construction site, or to
otherwise enter the MS4.



   4.   As a condition to granting a building permit or grading permit,
the City may set reasonable limits on the clearing of natural vegetation from
construction sites, in order to reduce the potential for soil erosion. 
These limits may include, but are not limited to, regulating the length of
time soil is allowed to remain bare or prohibiting bare soil.



   5.   The Director may require, prior to the issuance of any building
or grading permit, preparation of appropriate wet weather erosion control
plan, SWPPP or other plans consistent with countywide development
construction guidance provisions and the goals of this chapter.



   6.   Full or partial waivers of compliance with the requirements of
this section may be obtained where the project applicant shows by application
in writing that the incorporation and design elements that address the
objectives set forth in this section are impracticable, and are
non-economical or otherwise physically impossible due to the site
characteristics or other characteristics unique to the project.  Any waiver
request shall be in writing to the director and may only be approved where
permitted in accordance with the terms of the existing construction general
permit. 



(Ord. 2013-11-1462 § 1; Ord. 2013-06-1455 § 3)



12.16.114   New development/redevelopment pollutant reduction.



   A.   Objective. The provisions of this section establish
requirements for construction activities and facility operations of
development and redevelopment projects to comply with the MS4 permit, to
lessen the water quality impacts of development by using smart growth
practices, and to integrate LID practices and standards for storm water
pollution mitigation through means of infiltration, evapotranspiration,
biofiltration, and rainfall harvest and use. LID shall be inclusive of new
development and/or redevelopment requirements.



   B.   Scope. This section contains requirements for storm water
pollution control measures in development and redevelopment projects, and
authorizes the City to further define and adopt storm water pollution control
measures, and to develop LID principles and requirements, including but not
limited to the objectives and specifications for integration of LID
strategies. Except as otherwise provided herein, the City shall administer,
implement and enforce the provisions of this section.



   C.   Applicability. This section applies to the following projects:



   1.   All development projects equal to one acre or greater of
disturbed area that adds more than 10,000 square feet of impervious surface
area.



   2.   Industrial parks with 10,000 square feet or more of surface
area.



   3.   Commercial malls with 10,000 square feet or more of surface
area.



   4.   Retail gasoline outlets with 5,000 square feet or more of
surface area.



   5.   Restaurants with 5,000 square feet or more of surface area.



   6.   Parking lots with 5,000 square feet or more of impervious
surface area, or with 25 or more parking spaces.



   7.   Streets and roads construction with 10,000 square feet or more
of impervious surface area. Street and road construction applies to
standalone streets, roads, highways, and freeway projects, and also applies
to streets within larger projects.



   8.   Automotive service facilities with 5,000 square feet or more of
surface area.



   9.   Projects located in or directly adjacent to, or discharging
directly to an environmentally sensitive area, where the development will:



   a.   Discharge storm water runoff that is likely to impact a
sensitive biological species or habitat; and



   b.   Create 2,500 square feet or more of Impervious Surface area.



   10.   Single-family hillside properties.



   11.   Redevelopment projects.



   a.   Construction activity that results in the creation, addition or
replacement of 5,000 square feet or more of impervious surface area on an
already developed site of one of the projects identified in this subsection.



   b.   Where redevelopment results in an alteration to more than fifty
percent of impervious surfaces of a previously existing development, and the
existing development was not subject to post-construction storm water quality
control requirements, the entire project must be mitigated.



   c.   Where redevelopment results in an alteration to less than fifty
percent of impervious surfaces of a previously existing development, and the
existing development was not subject to post-construction storm water quality
control requirements, only the alteration must be mitigated, and not the
entire development.



   d.   Redevelopment does not include routine maintenance activities
that are conducted to maintain original line and grade, hydraulic capacity,
original purpose of facility or emergency redevelopment activity required to
protect public health and safety. Impervious surface replacement, such as the
reconstruction of parking lots and roadways which does not disturb additional
area and maintains the original grade and alignment, is considered a routine
maintenance activity. Redevelopment does not include the repaving of existing
roads to maintain original line and grade.



   e.   Existing single-family dwelling and accessory structures are
exempt from the redevelopment requirements unless such projects create, add,
or replace 10,000 square feet of impervious surface area.



   D.   Requirements. The site for every project identified in §
12.16.114(C) shall be designed to control pollutants, pollutant loads, and
runoff volume to the maximum extent feasible by minimizing impervious surface
area and controlling runoff from impervious surfaces through infiltration,
evapotranspiration, bioretention and/or rainfall harvest and use.  The
project applicant shall prepare a LID plan which implements set LID standards
and practices for storm water pollution mitigation and provides documentation
to demonstrate compliance with the MS4 Permit on the plans and permit
application submitted to the city.  Such a LID plan shall comply with the
following:



   1.   A new single-family hillside property development shall prepare
a LID plan to include mitigation measures to:



   a.   Conserve natural areas;



   b.   Protect slopes and channels;



   c.   Provide storm drain system stenciling and signage;



   d.   Divert roof runoff to vegetated areas before discharge unless
the diversion would result in slope instability; and



   e.   Direct surface flow to vegetated areas before discharge, unless
the diversion would result in slope instability.



   2.   Street and road construction of 10,000 square feet or more of
impervious surface shall follow US EPA guidance regarding managing wet
weather with the city's most current Green Streets Manual to the maximum
extent practicable.



   3.   The remainder of Projects identified in § 12.16.114(C) shall
prepare a LID plan to comply with the following:



   a.   Retain storm water runoff onsite for the storm water quality
design volume (SWQDv) defined as the runoff from:



   i.   The 85th percentile 24-hour runoff event as determined from the
Los Angeles County 85th percentile precipitation isohyetal map; or



   ii.   The volume of runoff produced from a 0.75 inch, 24-hour rain
event, whichever is greater.



   b.   Minimize hydromodification impacts to natural drainage systems.



   E.   Technical Infeasibility.



   1.   Full or partial waivers of compliance with the requirements of
this section may be obtained where the project applicant shows by application
in writing that the incorporation and design elements that address the
objectives set forth in this section are impracticable and are non-economical
or otherwise physically impossible due to the site characteristics or other
characteristics unique to the project.  Any waiver request shall be in
writing to the director and may only be approved where permitted in
accordance with the terms of the MS4 permit.



   2.   To demonstrate technical infeasibility, the project applicant
must demonstrate that the project cannot reliably retain 100 percent of the
SWQDv on-site, even with the maximum application of green roofs and rainwater
harvest and use, and that compliance with the applicable post-construction
requirements would be technically infeasible by submitting a site-specific
hydrologic and/or design analysis conducted and endorsed by a registered
professional engineer, geologist, architect, and/or landscape architect.
Technical infeasibility may result from conditions including the following:



   a.   The infiltration rate of saturated in-situ soils is less than
0.3 inch per hour and it is not technically feasible to amend the in-situ
soils to attain an infiltration rate necessary to achieve reliable
performance of infiltration or bioretention BMPs in retaining the SWQDv
onsite.



   b.   Locations where seasonal high groundwater is within five to ten
feet of surface grade;



   c.   Locations within 100 feet of a groundwater well used for
drinking water;



   d.   Brownfield development sites or other locations where pollutant
mobilization is a documented concern;



   e.   Locations with potential geotechnical hazards; and



   f.   Smart growth and infill or redevelopment locations where the
density and/or nature of the project would create significant difficulty for
compliance with the onsite volume retention requirement.



   3.   If partial or complete onsite retention is technically
infeasible, the project site may biofiltrate 1.5 times the portion of the
remaining SWQDv that is not reliably retained onsite. Biofiltration BMPs must
adhere to the design specifications provided in the MS4 permit.



   4.   Additional alternative compliance options such as offsite
infiltration and groundwater replenishment projects may be available to the
project site. The applicant should contact the director to determine
eligibility.



   5.   The remaining SWQDv that cannot be retained or biofiltered
onsite must be treated onsite to reduce pollutant loading. BMPs must be
selected and designed to meet pollutant-specific benchmarks as required by
the MS4 permit. Flow-through BMPs may be used to treat the remaining SWQDv
and must be sized based on a rainfall intensity of:



   a.   0.2 inches per hour, or



   b.   The one year, one-hour rainfall intensity as determined from
the most recent Los Angeles County isohyetal map, whichever is greater.



   F.   Exemptions from LID requirements.  The provisions of this
section do not apply to any of the following:



   1.   A development involving only emergency construction activity
required to immediately protect public health and safety;



   2.   Infrastructure projects within the public right-of-way;



   3.   A development or redevelopment involving only activity related
to gas, water, cable, or electricity services on private property;



   4.   A development involving only resurfacing and/or re-striping of
permitted parking lots, where the original line and grade, hydraulic
capacity, and original purpose of the facility is maintained;



   5.   A project involving only exterior movie or television
production sets, or facades on an existing developed site;



   6.   A project not requiring a City building, grading, demolition or
other permit for construction activity.



   G.   Any development that is exempted from LID requirements under
division F. of this section has the option to voluntarily opt in and
incorporate into the project the LID requirements set forth herein.



   H.   City review and approval.



   1.   Prior to the issuance of a permit for a new development or
redevelopment project, the City shall evaluate the proposed project using the
MS4 permit, and erosion and grading requirements of the City building
official or director to determine (i) its potential to generate the flow of
pollutants into the MS4 after construction; and (ii) how well the LID plan
for the proposed project meets the goals of this chapter.  Each plan will be
evaluated on its own merits according to the particular characteristics of
the project and the site to be developed.  Based upon the review, the City
may impose conditions upon the issuance of the building permit, in addition
to any required by the State construction general permit for the project, in
order to minimize the flow of pollutants into the MS4.



   2.   The director shall approve or disapprove of the LID plan within
thirty (30) calendar days of submittal, or within thirty (30) days of
approval of the development project by the planning commission, where
planning commission approval is required.  If the LID plan is disapproved,
the reasons for disapproval shall be given in writing to the applicant.  Any
LID plan disapproved may be revised by the applicant and resubmitted for
approval.  A resubmitted plan will be approved or disapproved within thirty
(30) days of submittal.  No building or grading permit shall be issued until
a LID plan has been approved by the director.



   3.   If no building permit has been issued or no construction has
begun on a project within a period of one hundred eighty (180) days of
approval of a LID plan, the LID plan for that project shall expire.  The
director may extend the time by written extension for action by the applicant
for a period not to exceed one hundred eighty (180) days upon written request
by the applicant showing that circumstances beyond the control of the
applicant prevented the construction from commencing.  In order to renew the
LID plan, the applicant shall resubmit all necessary forms and other data and
pay a new LID plan check fee.



   I.   Transfer of properties subject to the requirements of this
section.



   1.   The transfer or lease of a property subject to maintenance
requirements for LID BMPs shall include conditions requiring the transferee
and its successors and assigns to either: (a) assume responsibility for
maintenance of any existing LID BMP, or (b) replace an existing LID BMP with
new control measures or BMPs meeting the then current standards of the City
and MS4 permit.  Such requirement shall be included in any sale or lease
agreement or deed for such property.  The condition of transfer shall
include a provision that the successor property owner or lessee conduct
maintenance inspections of all LID BMPs at least once a year and retain proof
of inspection.



   2.   For residential properties where the LID BMPs are located
within a common area which will be maintained by a homeowners' association,
language regarding the responsibility for maintenance shall be included in
the project's conditions, covenants and restrictions (CC&Rs).  Printed
educational materials will be required to accompany the first deed transfer
to highlight the existence of the requirement and to provide information on
what LID BMPs are present, signs that maintenance is needed, and how the
necessary maintenance can be performed.  The transfer of this information
shall also be required with any subsequent sale of the property.

12.16.116   Small site new development/ redevelopment pollutant reduction.



   A.   LID manual.  The LID manual for small sites shall be prepared,
maintained, and updated, as deemed necessary and appropriate, by the director
and approved by the City Council.  It shall set LID standards and practices
for storm water pollution mitigation, including urban and storm water runoff
quantity and quality control development principles and technologies for
achieving the LID standards for projects not otherwise required to implement
LID strategies by the MS4 permit. The LID manual for small sites shall also
include technical feasibility and implementation parameters, alternative
compliance for technical infeasibility, as well as other rules, requirements
and procedures as the director deems necessary.



   B.   Requirements.  The site for projects not listed in §
12.16.114(C), but resulting in the creation or addition or replacement of 500
square feet or more of impervious surface area shall be designed to control
pollutants, pollutant loads, and runoff volume per the LID manual for small
sites.  The project applicant shall prepare a small site LID plan which
implements set LID standards and practices, as identified in the LID manual
for small sites for storm water pollution mitigation, and provides
documentation to demonstrate compliance with the LID manual for small sites
on the plans submitted to the city.  Such a small site LID Plan shall comply
with the following:



   1.   Storm water runoff will be infiltrated, evapotranspired,
captured and used, biofiltrated/biotreated through high removal efficiency
LID BMP alternatives as identified in the LID manual for small sites, onsite,
through storm water management techniques that comply with the provisions of
the LID manual for small sites. To the maximum extent feasible, onsite storm
water management techniques must be properly sized, at a minimum, without any
storm water runoff leaving the site for at least the volume of water produced
by the water quality design storm event that results from:



   a.   The 85th percentile 24-hour rain event determined as the
maximized capture storm water volume for the area using a 48 to 72-hour draw
down time; or



   b.   The volume of runoff produced from a 0.75 inch, 24 hour rain
event.



   2.   Pollutants shall be prevented from leaving the site for a water
quality design storm event as defined in division B.1. of this section,
unless the site has been treated through an approved LID strategy.



   3.   Any development of four or fewer units intended for residential
use shall implement LID BMP alternatives identified in the LID manual for
small sites for the residential LID category and provide documentation to
demonstrate compliance on the plans and permit application submitted to the
city.



   4.   Any development of five or more units intended for residential
use or any development intended for nonresidential use shall implement LID
BMP alternatives identified in the LID manual for small sites for the
commercial/industrial LID category and provide documentation to demonstrate
compliance on the plans and permit application submitted to the city.



   5.   For any construction activity resulting in an alteration of at
least fifty percent (50%) or more of the impervious surfaces on an existing
developed site, the entire site must comply with the standards and
requirements stated above and with the LID manual for small sites.



   6.   For any construction activity resulting in an alteration of
less than fifty percent (50%) of the impervious surfaces of an existing
developed site, only such incremental development shall comply with the
standards and requirements stated above and with the LID manual for small
sites.



   C.   Technical infeasibility.



   1.   When, as determined by the director, the onsite LID
requirements are technically infeasible, partially or fully, the
infeasibility shall be demonstrated in the submitted small site LID plan,
shall be consistent with other City requirements, and shall be reviewed in
consultation with the Department of Building and Safety.  The technical
infeasibility may result from conditions that may include, but are not
limited to:



   a.   Locations where seasonal high groundwater is within five to ten
feet of surface grade;



   b.   Locations within 100 feet of a groundwater well used for
drinking water;



   c.   Brownfield development sites or other locations where pollutant
mobilization is a documented concern;



   d.   Locations with potential geotechnical hazards;



   e.   Locations with impermeable soil type as indicated in applicable
soils and geotechnical reports; and



   f.   The infiltration rate of saturated in-situ soils is less than
0.3 inch per hour and it is not technically feasible to amend the in-situ
soils to attain an infiltration rate necessary to achieve reliable
performance of infiltration or bioretention BMPs.



   2.   If partial or complete onsite compliance of any type is
technically infeasible, as determined by the director, the project site and
LID plan will be granted a waiver from the requirements of this section and
the LID manual for small sites. If a portion of the project site is deemed
technically infeasible, the project applicant may propose an equivalent area
within the same project area for LID. The director may permit substitutions
of equivalent areas upon request by the project applicant.



   D.   Exemptions from LID requirements.  The provisions of this
section do not apply to any of the following:



   1.   A development involving only emergency construction activity
required to immediately protect public health and safety;



   2.   Infrastructure projects within the public right-of-way;

other permit for construction activity.



   E.   Any development that is exempted from LID requirements under
division D. of this section has the option to voluntarily opt in and
incorporate into the project the LID requirements set forth herein.



   F.   City review and plan approval.



   1.   Prior to the issuance of a permit for a small site, as
described in § 12.16.116(B), the City shall evaluate the proposed project
using the LID manual for small sites and erosion and grading requirements of
the City building official or director to determine (i) its potential to
generate the flow of pollutants into the MS4 after construction; and (ii) how
well the small site LID plan for the proposed project meets the goals of this
chapter.  Each plan will be evaluated on its own merits according to the
particular characteristics of the project and the site to be developed. 
Based upon the review, the City may impose conditions upon the issuance of
the building permit, in order to minimize the flow of pollutants into the MS4.



   2.   The director shall approve or disapprove of the small site LID
plan within thirty (30) calendar days of submittal, or within thirty (30)
days of approval of the development project by the planning commission, where
planning commission approval is required.  If the plan is disapproved, the
reasons for disapproval shall be given in writing to the applicant.  Any
plan disapproved may be revised by the applicant and resubmitted for
approval. A resubmitted plan will be approved or disapproved within thirty
(30) days of submittal.  No building or grading permit shall be issued until
a small site LID plan has been approved by the director.



   3.   If no building permit has been issued or no construction has
begun on a project within a period of one hundred eighty (180) days of
approval of a small site LID plan, the small site LID plan for that project
shall expire.  The director may extend the time by written extension for
action by the applicant for a period not to exceed one hundred eighty (180)
days upon written request by the applicant showing that circumstances beyond
the control of the applicant prevented the construction from commencing.  In
order to renew the small site LID plan, the applicant shall resubmit all
necessary forms and other data and pay a new plan review fee.



   G.   Transfer of properties subject to the requirements of this
section.



   1.   The transfer or lease of a property subject to maintenance
requirements for LID BMPs shall include conditions requiring the transferee
and its successors and assigns to either: (a) assume responsibility for
maintenance of any existing LID BMP, or (b) replace an existing LID BMP with
new control measures or BMPs meeting the then current standards of the City
and MS4 permit. Such requirement shall be included in any sale or lease
agreement or deed for such property.  The condition of transfer shall
include a provision that the successor property owner or lessee conduct
maintenance inspections of all LID BMPs at least once a year and retain proof
of inspection.



   2.   For residential properties where the LID BMPs are located
within a common area which will be maintained by a homeowners' association,
language regarding the responsibility for maintenance shall be included in
the project's conditions, covenants and restrictions (CC&Rs).  Printed
educational materials will be required to accompany the first deed transfer
to highlight the existence of the requirement and to provide information on
what LID BMPs are present, signs that maintenance is needed, and how the
necessary maintenance can be performed.  The transfer of this information
shall also be required with any subsequent sale of the property.



   3.   If LID BMPs are located within an area proposed for dedication
to a public agency, they will be the responsibility of the developer until
the dedication is accepted.

provide a guidance manual to serve as a resource of information and direction
in preparing a compliance plan for City review and approval. The guidance
manual shall be available at City Hall and posted on the City's website. The
property owner or other responsible party may utilize the manual to submit a
compliance plan. However, the property owner or other responsible party is
not limited to the control measures outlined in the manual, as they can
propose alternate devices of equal effectiveness.



   B.   Notice.  The affected property owners will be notified in
writing that their property qualifies under the Vacant Parcel Ordinance. The
notice shall include the City's guidance manual. Furthermore, the notice
shall state their obligations, as responsible property owners, to submit a
compliance plan, construct the improvements (once approved by the City), and
maintain their property in a condition consistent with the approved
compliance plan. All actions must be completed by the established deadlines.



   C.   Compliance Plan.



      1.   Applicability. For vacant parcels that are equal to or
greater than 43,560 square feet (one acre or more), the property owner or
other responsible party shall submit a compliance plan following the guidance
manual for City review and approval.



      2.   Required Components.



         a.   Sediment Control Measures. The compliance plan must
incorporate measures to control sediment. The plan may include the devices
listed in the guidance manual or can propose alternate devices of equal
effectiveness.



         b.   Maintenance Plan. The compliance plan must also
include a maintenance section detailing procedures to ensure soil erosion and
sediment control measures are in proper working condition indefinitely. The
guidance manual contains procedures for proper maintenance of various types
of soil erosion and sediment control measures.



      3.   Evaluation. The compliance plan will be reviewed by the
City's stormwater consulting firm. The guidance manual shall serve as the
standard for review.



   D.   Time Frame for Compliance.  Regardless of whether the
compliance plan is approved or disapproved by the Director, the property
owner shall bring the parcel into compliance by installing devices consistent
with the guidance manual, no later than 180 days from the date of the
original mailing or posting, unless additional time is granted by the
director. Any request for additional time shall be made in writing, shall
include agreement to comply with the requirements of this section, shall
provide justification for the request, shall state an estimated completion
date, and shall be signed by the property owner(s).



   E.   Maintenance, Inspections, and Corrections.



      1.   The property owner or other responsible party shall
conduct proper maintenance of soil erosion and sediment control measures as
defined in the approved compliance plan. Additionally the property owner
shall not create a nuisance as defined in SHMC Chapter 8.12.



      2.   The Director shall conduct annual or as necessary
inspections of the parcels subject to this section to ensure proper
installation and maintenance of the soil erosion and sediment control
measures in the approved compliance plan.



      3.   Adequate maintenance of soil erosion and sediment control
measures identified in the approved compliance plan shall be determined by
the Director following inspections. Vacant parcels will be determined to be
in compliance with this section by inspection of soil erosion and sediment
control measures which must be maintained to the standards described in the
approved compliance plan.



      4.   If the vacant parcel is not in compliance, property
owners will be notified in writing that corrective actions are required. The
property owner or other responsible party shall be required to address
corrective actions by:



         a.   Fixing or replacing the existing soil erosion and
sediment control measures on the approved compliance plan; and



         b.   Submitting an amendment to the previously approved
compliance plan to propose additional measures or new replacement measures.



      5.   If, subsequent to such notification of corrective
actions, the Director determines that any vacant parcel has become
non-compliant with this section, improperly operated and maintained, or that
the use of the parcel has changed significantly, the Director may require a
new compliance plan, which shall require the property owner to complete
repairs of damaged or deteriorated soil erosion and sediment control measures.



   F.   Penalties.



      1.   Any property owner failing to submit a compliance plan as
required by this chapter shall be considered in violation and is subject to
enforcement pursuant to Section 12.16.120(B).

hazardous to life or property.  For the purpose of making such repairs, or
of determining the identity of the pipeline in which the leak exists, or of
protecting life or property from hazards created by or likely to result from
such leak, the administrative officer and any person authorized by him may
enter upon private property without notice to the occupant or owner to
control or shut off the flow of any pipeline located in the area in which the
leak is occurring, and may cause such excavations to be made in or temporary
dikes to be erected upon both public and private property as are reasonably
necessary to minimize the hazard of injury to persons or damage to property.



   B.   For the purpose of carrying out the authority and duties
delegated to the administrative officer under subsection A of this section,
the administrative officer may assign city personnel to perform any work he
is authorized to perform or he may engage the performance of such work on the
city's behalf by an independent contractor.

12.21.010   Purpose.



   The purpose and intent of this chapter is to provide a uniform and
comprehensive set of regulations and standards for the permitting,
development, siting, installation, design, operation and maintenance of
wireless telecommunications facilities in the city’s public right-of-way.
These regulations are intended to prescribe clear and reasonable criteria to
assess and process applications in a consistent and expeditious manner, while
reducing the impacts associated with wireless telecommunications facilities.
This chapter provides standards necessary (1) for the preservation of the
public right-of-way (PROW) in the city for the maximum benefit and use of the
public. (2) to promote and protect public health and safety, community
welfare, visual resources and the aesthetic quality of the city consistent
with the goals, objectives and policies of the general plan. and (3) to
provide for the orderly, managed and efficient development of wireless
telecommunications facilities in accordance with the state and federal laws
rules and regulations, including those regulations of the Federal
Communications Commission (FCC) and California Public Utilities Commission
(CPUC), and (4) to ensure that the use and enjoyment of the PROW is not
inconvenienced by the use of the PROW for the placement of wireless
facilities. The city recognizes the importance of wireless facilities to
provide high-quality communications service to the residents and businesses
within the city, and the city also recognizes its obligation to comply with
applicable Federal and State laws. This chapter shall be constructed and
applied in consistency with the provisions of state and federal laws, and the
rules and regulations of FCC and CPUC. In the event of any inconsistency
between any such laws, rules and regulations and this chapter, the laws,
rules and regulations shall control. (Ord. 2019-04-1504 § 6)



12.21.020   Definitions.



   “Accessory equipment” means any and all on-site equipment.
including, without limitation, back-up generators and power supply units,
cabinets. coaxial and fiber optic cables, connections, equipment buildings,
shelters, radio transceivers, transmitters, pedestals, splice boxes, fencing
and shielding, surface location markers, meters, regular power supply units,
fans, air conditioning units, cables and wiring, to which an antenna is
attached in order to facilitate the provision of wireless telecommunication
services.



   “Antenna” means that specific device for transmitting and/or
receiving radio frequency or other signals for purposes of wireless
telecommunications services. “Antenna” is specific to the antenna portion
of a wireless telecommunications facility.



   “Antenna array” shall mean two or more antennas having active
elements extending in one or more directions, and directional antennas
mounted upon and rotated through a vertical mast or tower interconnecting the
beam and antenna support, all of which elements are deemed to be part of the
antenna.



   “Base station” shall have the meaning as set forth in Title 47 Code
of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.) Section 1.40001(b)(1), or any successor
provision. This means a structure or equipment at a fixed location that
enables FCC-licensed or authorized wireless communications between user
equipment and a communications network (regardless of the technological
configuration, and encompassing distributed antenna system and small cells).
Base station does not encompass a tower or any equipment associated with a
tower. “Base station” includes without limitation:



      1.   Equipment associated with wireless communications
services such as  private, broadcast, and public safety services, as well as
unlicensed wireless services and fixed wireless services such as microwave
backhaul.



      2.   Radio transceivers. antennas. coaxial or fiber-optic
cable, regular and backup power supplies, and comparable equipment regardless
of technological configuration (including Distributed Antenna Systems and
small cells).



      3.   Any structure other than a tower that, at the time the
relevant application is filed with the city under this chapter, supports or
houses equipment described in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this definition that has
been reviewed and approved under the applicable zoning or siting process, or
under another state or local regulatory review process, even if the structure
was not built for the sole or primary purpose of providing that support.



      4.   ‘Base station” does not include any structure that,
at the time the relevant application is filed under this chapter does not
support or house equipment described in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this
definition. Other structures that do not host wireless telecommunications
facilities are not “base stations.”



      As an illustration and not a limitation, the FCC’s definition
of “base station” refers to any structure that actually supports wireless
equipment even though it was not originally intended for that purpose.
Examples include: but are not limited to: wireless facilities mounted on
buildings, utility poles, light standards or traffic signals. A structure
without wireless equipment replaced with a new structure designed to bear the
additional weight from wireless equipment constitutes a base station.



   “Cellular” means an analog or digital wireless telecommunications
technology that is based on a system of interconnected neighboring cell sites.



   “City” means the City of Signal Hill.



   “Code” means the Signal Hill Municipal Code.



    ‘Collocation” bears the following meanings:



    For the purposes of any eligible facilities request, the same as
defined by the FCC in 47 C.F.R. § 1.40001(b)(2) as may be amended, which
defines that term as “[t]he mounting or installation of transmission
equipment on an eligible support structure for the purpose of transmitting
and/or receiving radio frequency signals for communications purposes.” As
an illustration and not a limitation. the FCC’s definition means to add
transmission equipment to an existing facility and does not necessarily refer
to two or more different facility operators in the same location; and



   2.   For all other purposes, the same as defined in 47 CFR
1.6002(g)(1) and (2), as may be amended, which defines that term as (1)
mounting or installing an antenna facility on a pre-existing structure,
and/or (2) modifying a structure for the purpose of mounting or installing an
antenna facility on that structure.



   “Collocation facility” means the eligible support structure on, or
immediately adjacent to, which a collocation is proposed. or a wireless
telecommunications facility that includes collocation facilities. (See, Gov.
Code, § 65850.6(d).)



   “COW” means a “cell on wheels,” which is a portable,
self-contained wireless telecommunications facility that can be moved to a
location and set up to provide wireless telecommunication services which
facility is temporarily rolled in, or temporarily installed, at a location.
Under this chapter, the maximum time a facility can be installed to be
considered a “COW” is five days. A “COW” is normally vehicle-mounted
and contains a telescoping boom as the antenna support structure.



   “Distributed antenna system” or “DAS” means a network of
spatially separated antennas (nodes) connected to a common source (a hub) via
a transport medium (often fiber optics) that provide wireless
telecommunications service within a specific geographic area or building. DAS
includes the transport medium, the hub: and any other equipment to which the
DAS network or its antennas or nodes are connected to provide wireless
telecommunication services.



   “Eligible facilities request” means any request for modification to
an existing eligible support structure that does not substantially change the
physical dimensions of such structure, involving:



      1.   Collocation of new transmission equipment;



      2.   Removal of transmission equipment;



      3.   Replacement of transmission equipment (replacement does
not include completely replacing the underlying support structure); or



      4.   Hardening through structural enhancement where such
hardening is necessary to accomplish the eligible facilities request, but
does not include replacement of the underlying support structure.



   “Eligible facilities request” does not include modifications or
replacements when an eligible support structure was constructed or deployed
without proper local review, was not required to undergo local review, or
involves equipment that was not properly approved. “Eligible facilities
request” does include collocation facilities satisfying all the
requirements for a non-discretionary collocation facility pursuant to
Government Code § 65850.6.



   “Eligible support structure” means any support structure located in
the PROW that is existing at the time the relevant application is filed with
the city under this chapter.



   “Existing” means a support structure. wireless telecommunications
facility, or accessory equipment that has been reviewed and approved under
the city’s applicable zoning or siting process, or under another applicable
state or local regulatory review process, and lawfully constructed prior to
the time the relevant application is filed under this chapter. However, a
support structure, wireless telecommunications facility or accessory
equipment that has not been reviewed and approved because it was not in a
zoned area when it was built, but was lawfully constructed, is existing for
purposes of this chapter. “Existing” does not apply to any structure that
(1) was illegally constructed without  all proper local agency approvals, or
(2) was constructed in noncompliance with such approvals. “Existing” does
not apply where an existing support structure is proposed to be replaced in
furtherance of the proposed wireless telecommunications facility.



   “Facility(ies)” means wireless telecommunications facility(ies).



   “FCC” means the Federal Communications Commission.



   “Ground-mounted” means mounted to a pole, tower or other
freestanding structure which is specifically constructed for the purpose of
supporting an antenna or wireless telecommunications facility and placed
directly on the ground at grade level.



   “Lattice tower” means an open framework structure used to support
one or more antennas, typically with three or four support legs.



   “Located within (or in) the public right-of-way” includes any
facility which in whole or in part, itself or as part of another structure,
rests upon, in, over or under the PROW.



   “Modification” means a change to an existing wireless
telecommunications facility that involves any of the following: collocation,
expansion, alteration, enlargement, intensification, reduction, or
augmentation, including, but not limited to, changes in size, shape, color,
visual design, or exterior material. “Modification” does not include
repair, replacement or maintenance if those actions do not involve an
expansion, alteration, enlargement, intensification, reduction, or
augmentation of an existing wireless telecommunications facility.



   “Monopole” means a structure composed of a pole or tower used to
support antennas or related equipment. A “monopole” also includes a
monopine, monopalm and similar monopoles camouflaged to resemble faux trees
or other faux objects attached on a monopole (e.g. water tower).



   “Mounted” means attached or supported.



   “OTARD antennas” means antennas covered by the “over-the-air
reception devices” rule in 47 C.F.R. sections 1.4000 et seq. as may be
amended or replaced from time to time.



   “Permittee” means any person or entity granted a WTFP pursuant to
this chapter.



   “Personal wireless services” shall have the same meaning as set
forth in 47 United States Code § 332(c)(7)(C)(i).



   “Pole” means a single shaft of wood, steel, concrete or other
material capable of supporting the equipment mounted thereon in a safe and
adequate manner and as required by provisions of this code.



   “Public works director” means the director of public or his or her
designee.



   “Public right-of-way” or “PROW” means a strip of land acquired
by reservation, dedication, prescription, condemnation, or easement that
allows for the passage of people and goods. The “PROW” includes, but is
not necessarily limited to, streets, curbs, gutters, sidewalks, roadway
medians, and parking strips. The “PROW” does not include lands owned,
controlled or operated by the city for uses unrelated to streets or the
passage of people and goods, such as, without limitation, parks, city hall
and community center lands, city yards, and lands supporting reservoirs,
water towers, police or fire facilities and non-publicly accessible utilities.



   “Replacement” refers only to replacement of transmission equipment
wireless telecommunications facilities or eligible support structures where
the replacement structure will be of like-for-like kind to resemble the
appearance and dimensions of the structure or equipment replaced: including
size, height, color, landscaping, materials and style.



      1.   In the context of determining whether an application
qualifies as an eligible facilities request, the term “replacement”
relates only to the replacement of transmission equipment and does not
include replacing the support structure on which the equipment is located.



      2.   In the context of determining whether a SWF application
qualifies as being placed upon a new eligible support structure or qualifies
as a collocation, an application proposing the replacement of the underlying
support structure qualifies as a new pole proposal.



   “RF” means radio frequency.



   “Small cell” means a low-powered antenna (node) that has a range of
ten meters to two kilometers. The nodes of a “small cell” may or may not
be connected by fiber. “Small,” for purposes of “small cell,” refers
to the area covered. not the size of the facility. “Small cell” includes,
but is not limited to, devices generally known as microcells, picocells and
femtocells.



   “Small cell network” means a network of small cells.



   “Spectrum Act” means § 6409(a) of the Middle Class Tax Relief Act
and Job Creation Act of 2012, 47 U.S.C. § 1455(a).



   “Substantial change” has the same meaning as “substantial
change” as defined by the FCC at 47 C.F.R. § 1.40001(b)(7).
Notwithstanding the definition above, if an existing pole-mounted cabinet is
proposed to be replaced with an underground cabinet at a facility where there
are no pre-existing ground cabinets associated with the structure, such
modification may be deemed a non-substantial change, in the discretion of the
public works director and based upon his/her reasonable consideration of the
cabinet’s proximity to residential view sheds, interference to public views
and/or degradation of concealment elements. If undergrounding the cabinet is
technologically infeasible such that it is materially inhibitive to the
project, the public works director may allow for a ground mounted cabinet. A
modification or collocation results is a substantial change to the physical
dimensions of an eligible support structure if it does any of the following:



      1.   It increases the height of the structure by more than ten
percent or more than ten  feet, whichever is greater;



      2.   It involves adding an appurtenance to the body of the
structure that would protrude from the edge of the structure by more than six
feet;



      3.   It involves installation of more than the standard number
of new equipment cabinets for the technology involved, but not to exceed four
cabinets. However, for towers and base stations located in the public
right-of-way, it involves installation of any new equipment cabinets on the
ground if there are no pre-existing ground cabinets associated with the
structure, or else involves installation of ground cabinets that are more
than ten percent larger in height or overall volume than any other ground
cabinets associated with the structure.



      4.   It entails any excavation or deployment outside the
current site. For purposes of this subsection, excavation outside the current
site occurs where excavation more than twelve feet from the eligible support
structure is proposed;



      5.   It defeats the concealment or stealthing elements of the
eligible support structure; or



      6.   It does not comply with conditions associated with the
siting approval of the construction or modification of the eligible support
structure, provided however that this limitation does not apply to any
modification that is non-compliant only in a manner that would not exceed the
thresholds identified in paragraphs 1 through 4 of this definition.



      7.   For all proposed collocations and modifications. a
substantial change occurs when:



         a.   The proposed collocation or modification involves
more than the standard number of new equipment cabinets for the technology
involved, but not to exceed four equipment cabinets;



         b.   The proposed collocation or modification would
defeat the concealment elements of the support structure; or



         c.   The proposed collocation or modification violates a
prior condition of approval, provided however that the collocation need not
comply with any prior condition of approval that is inconsistent with the
thresholds for a substantial change described in this Section.



         The thresholds and conditions for a “substantial
change” described in this Section are disjunctive such that the violation
of any individual threshold or condition results in a substantial change. The
height and width thresholds for a substantial change described in this
Section are cumulative for each individual support structure. The cumulative
limit is measured from the physical dimensions of the original structure for
base stations, and for all other facilities sites in the PROW from the
smallest physical dimensions that existed on or after February 22, 2012,
inclusive of originally approved-appurtenances and any modifications that
were approved prior to that date.



   “Support structure” means a tower, pole, base station or other
structure used to support a wireless telecommunications facility.



   “SWF” means a “small wireless facility” as defined by the FCC
in 47 C.F.R. § 1.6002(1) as may be amended, which are personal wireless
services facilities that meet all the following conditions that, solely for

is located to a height of more than fifty feet or by more than ten percent,
whichever is greater;



      2.   Each antenna associated with the deployment, excluding
associated antenna equipment (as defined in the definition of antenna in 47
C.F.R. § 1.1320(d)), is no more than three cubic feet in volume;



      3.   All other wireless equipment associated with the
structure, including the wireless equipment associated with the antenna and
any pre-existing associated equipment on the structure, is no more than 28

      4.   Once a WTFP is approved, no changes shall be made to the
approved plans without review and approval in accordance with this chapter.



   E.   Appeals.



      1.   Appeals for eligible facilities requests. The decision of
the public works director that an application for an eligible facility(ies)
request does not qualify as an eligible facilities request (or if the
applicant fails to provide information sufficient to make such determination)
and/or that the proposed facility will not comply with all generally
applicable laws shall be final. Otherwise, if the proposed facility qualifies
as an eligible facilities request and will be in compliance with all
applicable laws, the proposed eligible facilities request must be approved by
the public works director.



      2.   SWF appeals. The decision of the public works director as
to any SWF Administrative WTFP shall be final.



      3.   Appeals on Major WTFPs. Any aggrieved person or entity
may appeal a decision by the public works director on a Major WTFP by filing
a written notice of appeal after the decision. Such appeal shall set forth
the reasons therefor and must be filed within two business days of the
written administrative decision, unless the public works director extends the
time therefor. An extension may not be granted where extension would result
in approval of the application by operation of law. The city council shall
hear such appeals not less than ten nor more than sixty days after the filing
of the appeal. The city council may hear the appeal de novo.



   F.   Notice of shot clock expiration. The city acknowledges there
are federal  and state shot clocks which may be applicable to a proposed
wireless telecommunications facility. That is, federal and state law provide
time periods in which the city must approve or deny a proposed wireless
telecommunications facility. As such, the applicant is required to provide
the city written notice of the expiration of any shot clock, which the
applicant shall ensure is received by the city (e.g. overnight mail) no later
than twenty days prior to the expiration. (Ord. 2019-04-1504 § 6)



12.21.070   Design and development standards.



   A.   SWF design and development standards. SWFs are subject to those
design and development standards and conditions of approval set forth in the
SWF regulations. The city’s grant of a WTFP for a SWF does not waive, and
shall not be construed to waive, any standing by the city to challenge any
FCC orders or rules related to small cell facilities, or any modification to
those FCC orders or rules.



   B.   Eligible facilities request design and development standards.
Approved eligible facilities requests for which the findings set forth in §
12.21.060 have been made are subject to the following conditions, unless
modified by the approving authority:



      1.   WTFP subject to conditions of underlying permit. Any WTFP
granted in response to an application qualifying as an eligible facilities
request shall be subject to the terms and conditions of the underlying permit
and all such conditions that were applicable to the facility prior to
approval of the subject eligible facility request.



      2.   No permit term extension. The city’s grant or grant by
operation of law of an eligible facilities request permit constitutes a
federally-mandated modification to the underlying permit or approval for the
subject tower or base station. Notwithstanding any permit duration
established in another permit condition, the city’s grant or grant by
operation of law of an eligible facilities request permit will not extend the
permit term for the underlying permit or any other underlying regulatory
approval, and its term shall have the same term as the underlying permit or
other regulatory approval for the subiect tower or base station.



      3.   No waiver of standing. The city’s grant or grant by
operation of law of an eligible facilities request does not waive, and shall
not be construed to waive, any standing by the city to challenge § 6409(a)
of the Spectrum Act, any FCC rules that interpret § 6409(a) of the Spectrum
Act or any modification to § 6409(a) of the Spectrum Act.



   C.   Major WTFP design and development standards. All wireless
telecommunications facilities subject to a Major WTFP that are located within

in the public right-of-way for undergrounding, or that undergrounding is not
feasible, an exception pursuant to § 12.21.080 shall be required in order to
place accessory equipment above-ground and concealed with natural or manmade
features to the maximum extent possible.



         b.   When above-ground is the only feasible location for
a particular type of accessory equipment and will be ground-mounted, such
accessory equipment shall be enclosed within a structure, and shall not
exceed a height of five feet and a total footprint of fifteen square feet,
and shall be fully screened and/or camouflaged, including the use of
landscaping architectural treatment, or acceptable alternate screening.
Required electrical meter cabinets shall be screened and/or camouflaged.
Also, while pole-mounted equipment is generally the least favored
installation, should pole-mounted equipment be sought, it shall be installed
as required in this chapter.



         c.   In locations where homes are only along one side of
a street, above-ground accessory equipment shall not be installed directly in
front of a residence. Such aboveground accessory equipment shall be installed
along the side of the street with no homes. However, if said location is
located within the landslide hazard area or the liquefaction hazard area
referenced in the Safety Element of the General Plan pages 32 and 33 and
illustrated on Figure 5., then such locations shall be referred to the
city’s geotechnical staff for review and recommendations.



      12.   Landscaping. Where appropriate, each facility shall be
installed so as to maintain and enhance existing landscaping on the site,
including trees, foliage and shrubs. Additional landscaping shall be planted,
irrigated and maintained by applicant where such landscaping is deemed
necessary by the city to provide screening or to conceal the facility.



      13.   Signage. No facility shall bear any signs or advertising

shall be included when calculating the height of facilities such as towers,
lattice towers and monopoles.



         c.   Any required lighting shall be shielded to
eliminate, to the maximum extent possible, impacts on the surrounding
neighborhoods.



         d.   Unless otherwise required under FAA or FCC
regulations, applicants may install only timed or motion-sensitive light
controllers and lights, and must install such lights so as to avoid
illumination impacts to adjacent properties to the maximum extent feasible.
The city may, in its discretion, exempt an applicant from the foregoing
requirement when the applicant demonstrates a substantial public safety need.



         e.   The applicant shall submit a lighting study which
shall be prepared by a qualified lighting professional to evaluate potential
impacts to adjacent properties. Should no lighting be proposed, no lighting
study shall be required.

      16.   Security. Each facility shall be designed to be
resistant to, and minimize opportunities for, unauthorized access. climbing,
vandalism, graffiti and other conditions that would result in hazardous
situations, visual blight or attractive nuisances. The public works director
or the approving city body, as applicable, may require the provision of
warning signs, fencing, anti-climbing devices, or other techniques to prevent
unauthorized access and vandalism when, because of their location and/or
accessibility, a facility has the potential to become an attractive nuisance.
Additionally, no lethal devices or elements shall be installed as a security
device.



      17.   Modification. Consistent with current state and federal
laws and if permissible under the same, at the time of modification of a
wireless telecommunications facility, existing equipment shall, to the extent
feasible, be replaced with equipment that reduces visual, noise and other
impacts, including, but not limited to, undergrounding the equipment and
replacing larger, more visually intrusive facilities with smaller, less
visually intrusive facilities.



      18.   The installation and construction approved by a wireless
telecommunications facility permit shall begin within one year after its
approval or it will expire without further action by the city.



      19.   Conditions of approval. All Major WTFPs shall be subject
to such conditions of approval as reasonably imposed by the public works
director or the approving city body, as applicable, as well as any
modification of the conditions of approval deemed necessary by the public
works director or the approving city body. (Ord. 2019-04-1504 § 6)



12.21.080   Location restrictions; exceptions for non-compliant major
wireless telecommunications facilities.



   A.   Locations requiring an exception. Major WTFPs are strongly
disfavored in certain areas and on certain support structures. Therefore the
following locations are permitted only when an exception has been granted
pursuant to subsection B hereof:



      1.   PROW within those zones as identified in the general plan
as residential zones;



      2.   PROW within or immediately adjacent to the following
historically significant properties and areas as identified in the general
plan;



         a.   The Crescent Heights Historic District Specific
Plan (SP-4) zoning district.



         b.   Any existing historically significant structures as
referenced in the Historic Resources section of the Environmental Resources
Element of the General Plan and illustrated in Figure 3, the “Windshield
Survey of Historic Resources” dated January 1985.



      3.   PROW if mounted to a new pole that is not replacing an
existing pole in an otherwise permitted location.



   B.   Required findings for an exception on Major WTFPs. For any
Major WTFP requiring an exception under this chapter, no such exception shall
be granted unless the applicant demonstrates with clear and convincing
evidence all the following requirements are satisfied:



      1.   The proposed wireless facility qualifies as a “personal
wireless services facility” as defined in United States Code, Title 47, §
332(c)(7)(C)(ii).



      2.   The applicant has provided the city with a clearly
defined significant gap (as established under state and federal law) and a
clearly defined potential site search area.



         a.   In the event the applicant seeks to install a
wireless telecommunications facility to address service coverage concerns,
the applicant shall provide the city with full color signal propagation maps
with objective units of signal strength measurement that show the
applicant’s current service coverage levels from all adjacent wireless
telecommunications facilities without the proposed facility, predicted
service coverage levels from all adjacent facilities serving applicant with
the proposed facility, and predicted service coverage levels from the
proposed facility without all adjacent facilities.



         b.   In the event the applicant seeks to address service
capacity concerns, the applicant shall provide city with a written
explanation and propagation maps identifying the existing facilities with
service capacity issues together with competent evidence to demonstrate the
inability of those facilities to meet capacity demands.



      3.   The applicant has provided the city with a meaningful
comparative analysis that includes the factual reasons why any alternative
location(s) or design(s) suggested by the city or otherwise identified in the
administrative record, including but not limited to potential alternatives
identified at any public meeting or hearing, are not technically feasible or
reasonably available.



      4.   The applicant has provided the city with a meaningful
comparative analysis that includes the factual reasons why the proposed
location and design deviates is the least noncompliant location and design
necessary to reasonably achieve the applicant’s reasonable objectives of
covering an established significant gap (as established under state and
federal law).



      5.   The applicant has demonstrated that strict compliance
with any provision in this chapter for a Major WTFP would effectively
prohibit the provision of personal wireless services.



   C.   Scope. The public works director shall limit an exemption for a
Major WTFP to the extent to which the applicant demonstrates such exemption
is necessary to reasonably achieve its objectives of covering an established
significant gap (as established under state and federal law). The public
works director may adopt conditions of approval as reasonably necessary to
promote the purposes in this chapter and protect the public health, safety
and welfare. (Ord. 2019-04-1504 § 6)

conditions of approval. The permittee, when directed by the city, must
perform an inspection of the facility and submit a report to the public works
director on the condition of the facility to include any identified concerns
and corrective action taken. Additionally, as the city performs maintenance
on city-owned infrastructure additional maintenance concerns may be
identified. These will be reported to the permittee. The city shall give the
permittee thirty days to correct the identified maintenance concerns after
which the city reserves the right to take any action it deems necessary,
which could include revocation of the permit. The burden is on the permittee
to demonstrate that it complies with the requirements herein. Prior to
issuance of a permit under this chapter, the owner of the facility shall sign
an affidavit attesting to understanding the city’s requirement for
performance of annual inspections and reporting.



   L.   All facilities permitted pursuant to this chapter shall comply
with the Americans with Disabilities Act.



   M.   The permittee is responsible for obtaining power to the
facility and for the cost of electrical usage.

after written notice and reasonable opportunity to cure have been given shall
be grounds for the city to revoke the permit.



   O.   Interference.



      1.   The permittee shall not move, alter, temporarily
relocate, change, or interfere with any existing structure, improvement, or
property without the prior consent of the owner of that structure,
improvement, or property. No structure, improvement, or property owned by the
city shall be moved to accommodate a permitted activity or encroachment,
unless the city determines that such movement will not adversely affect the
city or any surrounding businesses or residents, and the permittee pays all
costs and expenses related to the relocation of the city’s structure,
improvement. or property. Prior to commencement of any work pursuant to a
wireless encroachment permit, the permittee shall provide the city with
documentation establishing to the city’s satisfaction that the permittee
has the legal right to use or interfere with any other structure,
improvement, or property within the PROW or city utility easement to be
affected by permittee’s facilities.



      2.   The facility shall not damage or interfere in any way
with city property, the city’s operations or the operations of
prior-existing, third party installations. The city will reasonably cooperate
with the permittee and/or carrier to carry out such activities as are
necessary to correct the interference.



         a.   Signal interference. The permittee shall correct
any such interference within twenty-four hours of written notification of the
interference. Upon the expiration of the twenty-four hour cure period and
until the cause of the interference is eliminated, the permittee shall cease
operation of any facility causing such interference until such interference
is cured.



         b.   Physical interference. The city shall give the
permittee thirty days to correct the interference after which the city
reserves the right to take any action it deems necessary, which could include
revocation of the permit.



      3.   The city at all times reserves the right to take any
action it deems necessary, in its sole discretion, to repair, maintain,
alter, or improve the sites. Such actions may temporarily interfere with the
operation of the facility. The city will in all cases, other than
emergencies, give the applicant thirty days written notification of such
planned, non-emergency actions.



   P.   RF exposure compliance. All facilities must comply with all
standards and  regulations of the FCC and any other state or federal
government agency with the authority to regulate RF exposure standards. After
transmitter and antenna system optimization, but prior to unattended
operations of the facility, the permittee or its representative must conduct
on-site post-installation RF emissions testing to demonstrate actual
compliance with the FCC Office of Engineering and Technology Bulletin 65 RF
emissions safety rules for general population/uncontrolled RF exposure in all
sectors. For this testing, the transmitter shall be operating at maximum
operating power, and the testing shall occur outwards to a distance where the
RF emissions no longer exceed the uncontrolled/general population limit.



      1.   Testing of any equipment shall take place on weekdays
only, and only between the hours of 8:30 a.m. and 4:30 p.m., except that
testing is prohibited on holidays that fall on a weekday. In addition,
testing is prohibited on weekend days.

copies of all permits and other regulatory approvals issued in connection
with the facility, which includes without limitation this approval, the
approved plans and photo simulations incorporated into this approval, all
conditions associated with this approval and any ministerial permits or
approvals issued in connection with this approval. In the event that the
permittee does not maintain such records as required in this condition or
fails to produce true and complete copies of such records within a reasonable
time after a written request from the city, any ambiguities or uncertainties
that would be resolved through an inspection of the missing records will be
construed against the permittee.



   R.   Attorney’s fees. In the event the city determines that it is
necessary to take legal action to enforce any of these conditions, or to
revoke a permit, and such legal action is taken, the permittee shall be
required to pay any and all costs of such legal action, including reasonable
attorney’s fees, incurred by the city, even if the matter is not prosecuted
to a final judgment or is amicably resolved, unless the city should otherwise
agree with permittee to waive said fees or any part thereof. The foregoing
shall not apply if the permittee prevails in the enforcement proceeding.

any PROW, when such installation, use or maintenance endangers or is
reasonably likely to endanger the safety of persons or property. or when such
site or location is used for public utility purposes, public transportation
purposes or other governmental use, or when such facility unreasonably
interferes with or unreasonably impedes the flow of pedestrian or vehicular
traffic including any legally parked or stopped vehicle, the ingress into or

approval shall be construed as a warranty of title.



   B.   No possessory interest is created by a WTFP. However, to the
extent that a possessory interest is deemed created by a governmental entity
with taxation authority, the permittee acknowledge that the city has given to
the applicant notice pursuant to California Revenue and Taxation Code §
107.6 that the use or occupancy of any public property pursuant to a WTFP may
create a possessory interest which may be subject to the payment of property
taxes levied upon such interest. Wireless telecommunications facility
operators shall be solely liable for, and shall pay and discharge prior to
delinquency, any and all possessory interest taxes or other taxes, fees, and
assessments levied against their right to possession, occupancy, or use of
any public property pursuant to any right of possession, occupancy, or use
created by the WTFP.



   C.   The permission granted by a WTFP shall not in any event
constitute an easement on or an encumbrance against the PROW. No right,
title, or interest (including franchise interest) in the PROW, or any part
thereof, shall vest or accrue in permittee by reason of a wireless
encroachment permit or the issuance of any other permit or exercise of any
privilege given thereby. (Ord. 2019-04-1504 § 6)



12.21.120   Permit expiration; abandonment of applications.



   A.   Permit term. Unless Government Code § 65964, as may be
amended, authorizes the city to issue a permit with a shorter term, a permit
for any wireless telecommunications facility shall be valid for a period of
ten years, unless pursuant to another provision of this code it lapses sooner
or is revoked. At the end of ten years from the date of issuance, such permit
shall automatically expire.



   B.   A permittee may apply for a new permit within one
hundred-eighty days prior to expiration. Said application and proposal shall
comply with the city’s current code requirements for wireless
telecommunications facilities.



   C.   Timing of installation. The installation and construction
authorized by a WTFP shall begin within one year after its approval, or it
will expire without further action by the city. The installation and
construction authorized by a WTFP shall conclude, including any necessary
post-installation repairs and/or restoration to the PROW, within thirty days
following the day construction commenced.



   D.   Commencement of operations. The operation of the approved
facility shall commence no later than ninety days after the completion of
installation. or the WTFP will expire without further action by the city. The

12.21.130   Cessation of use or abandonment.



   A.   A wireless telecommunications facility is considered abandoned
and shall be promptly removed as provided herein if it ceases to provide
wireless telecommunications services for ninety or more consecutive days
unless the permittee has obtained prior written approval from the director
which shall not be unreasonably denied. If there are two or more users of a
single facility, then this provision shall not become effective until all
users cease using the facility.



   B.   The operator of a facility shall notify the public works
director in writing of its intent to abandon or cease use of a permitted site
or a nonconforming site (including unpermitted sites) within ten days of
ceasing or abandoning use. Notwithstanding any other provision herein, the
operator of the facility shall provide written notice to the public works
director of any discontinuation of operations of thirty days or more.



   C.   Failure to inform the public works director of cessation or
discontinuation of operations of any existing facility as required by this
Section shall constitute a violation of any approvals and be grounds for:



      1.   Litigation;



      2.   Revocation or modification of the permit;



      3.   Acting on any bond or other assurance required by this
article or conditions of approval of the permit;

extensions, earlier termination or revocation of the WTFP or abandonment of
the facility, the permittee, owner or operator shall remove its wireless
telecommunications facility and restore the site to the condition it was in
prior to the granting of the WTFP, except for retaining the landscaping
improvements and any other improvements at the discretion of the city.
Removal shall be in accordance with proper health and safety requirements and
ail ordinances, rules, and regulations of the city. Expired, terminated or
revoked wireless telecommunications facility equipment shall be removed from
the site at no cost or expense to the city.



   B.   Failure of the permittee, owner or operator to promptly remove
its facility and restore the property within ninety days after expiration,
earlier termination or revocation of the WTFP, or abandonment of the
facility, shall be a violation ofthis code. Upon a showing of good cause, an
extension may be granted by the public works director where circumstances are
beyond the control of the permittee after expiration. Further failure to
abide by the timeline provided in this Section shall be grounds for:



      1.   Prosecution;



      2.   Acting on any security instrument required by this
chapter or conditions of approval of permit;



      3.   Removal of the facilities by the city in accordance with
the procedures established under this code for abatement of a public nuisance
at the owner’s expense; and/or



      4.   Any other remedies permitted under this code or by law.



   C.   Summary removal. In the event any city director or city
engineer determines that the condition or placement of a wireless
telecommunications facility located in the PROW constitutes a dangerous
condition, obstruction of the PROW, or an imminent threat to public safety,
or determines other exigent circumstances require immediate corrective action
(collectively, “exigent circumstances”), such director or city engineer
may cause the facility to be removed summarily and immediately, without
advance notice or a hearing. Written notice of the removal shall include the
basis for the removal and shall be served upon the permittee and person who
owns the facility, within five business days of removal and all property
removed shall be preserved for the owner’s pick-up as feasible. If the
owner cannot be identified following reasonable effort or if the owner fails
to pick-up the property within sixty days, the facility shall be treated as
abandoned property.



   D.   Removal of facilities by city. In the event the city removes a
wireless telecommunications facility in accordance with nuisance abatement
procedures or summary removal, any such removal shall be without any
liabilitv to the city for any damage to such facility that may result from
reasonable efforts of removal. In addition to the procedures for recovering
costs of nuisance abatement, the city may collect such costs from the
performance bond posted and to the extent such costs exceed the amount of the
performance bond, collect those excess costs in accordance with this code.
Unless otherwise provided herein, the city has no obligation to store such
facility. Neither the permittee, owner nor operator shall have any claim if
the city destroys any such facility not timely removed by the permittee,
owner or operator after notice, or removal by the city due to exigent
circumstances. (Ord. 2019-04-1504 § 6)



12.21.150   Effect on other ordinances.



   Compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall not relieve a
person from complvinq with any other applicable provision of this code. In
the event of a conflict between any provision of this chapter and other
sections of this code, this chapter shall control. (Ord. 2019-04-1504 § 6)



12.21.160   State or federal law.



   The implementation of this chapter and decisions on applications for
placement of wireless telecommunications facilities in the PROW shall at a
minimum ensure that the requirements of this chapter are satisfied, unless it
is determined that the applicant has established that denial of an
application would, within the meaning of federal law, prohibit or effectively
prohibit the provision of personal wireless services, or otherwise violate
applicable laws or regulations. If that determination is made, the
requirements of this chapter may be waived, but only to the minimum extent
required to avoid the prohibition or violation. (Ord. 2019-04-1504 § 6)



12.21.170   Legal nonconforming wireless telecommunications facilities in
the right-of-way.



   A.   Legal nonconforming wireless telecommunications facilities are
those facilities that existed but did not conform to this chapter on the date
this chapter became effective.



   B.   Legal nonconforming wireless telecommunications facilities
shall, within ten years from the date this chapter became effective, be
brought into conformity with all requirements of this article; provided,
however, that should the owner desire to expand or modify the facility,
intensify the use, or make some other change in a conditional use, the owner
shall comply with all applicable provisions of this code at such time, to the
extent the city can require such compliance under federal and state law.



   C.   An aggrieved person may file an appeal to the city council of
any decision of the public works director or other deciding body made
pursuant to this Section. In the event of an appeal alleging that the
ten-year amortization period is not reasonable as applied to a particular
propety, the city council may consider the amount of investment or original
cost, present actual or depreciated value, dates of construction,
amortization for tax purposes, salvage value, remaining useful life, the
length and remaining term of the lease under which it is maintained (if any),
and the harm to the public if the structure remains standing beyond the
prescribed amortization period, and set an amortization period accordingly
for the specific property. (Ord. 2019-04-1504 § 6)

of the public rights-of-way and/or provider of public utility services. 
This chapter is further intended to establish nondiscriminatory procedures
for the granting of franchises to use and occupy the public rights-of-way
and/or provide public utilities and services.  The requirement for franchise
agreements shall enhance the safety and ongoing maintenance of the city's
rights-of-way and the quality of public services while ensuring a uniform
procedure that provides equal treatment for members of the public.  The city
has the authority to manage public property through its police power and
other statutory and constitutional powers granted to municipalities.  The
authority and procedures contained herein are intended to preserve the city's
responsibility to control and protect the public from unsatisfactory public
service providers and to maintain the city's ability to demand a fair rate of
compensation in exchange for the grant of franchise rights and use of public
rights-of-way, while establishing procedures to treat franchise applicants
fairly in the interest of due process.

qualifications ("RFQ") and permitting evaluation of qualifications and
developing competing proposals by qualified entities and awarding to the best
qualified; or



   C.   If the public service or public utility is already being
provided by an existing franchisee, the city manager may, subject to any
required approvals by the city council, initiate negotiations with such
existing franchisee for its continued provision of said public services or
utilities if the existing franchisee's services have historically been
performed in a lawful, professional and workmanlike manner to the full
satisfaction of the city.

13.01.070   Resolution of intention to grant franchise; notice and public
hearing.



   A.   Before granting any franchise, the city council shall pass a
resolution declaring its intention to grant the franchise, stating the name
of the proposed franchisee, the character of the franchise and the terms and
conditions upon which it is proposed to be granted.  Such resolution shall
fix and set forth the day, hour and place when and where any persons having
any interest therein or any objection to the granting thereof may appear
before the city council and be heard thereon.  The city council shall direct
the city clerk to publish said resolution at least once, within fifteen days
of the passage thereof, in a newspaper of general circulation in the city. 
Said notice shall be published at least ten days prior to the date of hearing
for the grant of franchise and approval of the franchise agreement.



   B.   At the time set for the hearing for the grant of franchise, the
city council shall proceed to hear and pass upon all protests and its
decision thereon shall be final and conclusive.  Thereafter, the city
council  may, by ordinance, grant the franchise on the terms and conditions
specified in the resolution of intention to grant the same and/or the terms
of the franchise agreement (subject to the right of referendum of the people)
or it may deny the same.  If the city council determines that changes should
be made in the terms and conditions upon which the franchise is proposed to
be granted, it may order further negotiations between the city and franchisee
and an amended franchise agreement shall be subject to a new resolution of
intention and like proceedings thereon. 



   C.   No resolution granting a franchise for any purpose shall be
passed by the city council on the day of its introduction, nor within five
days thereafter, nor at any time other than a regular or adjourned regular
meeting.

13.01.080   Findings for exclusivity.



   The city may grant exclusive franchises, unless prohibited by State or
Federal Law, after public hearing pursuant to Section 13.01.070 where on a
four/fifths vote of the city council, the council finds good cause therefore
based on the following findings:



   A.   That the qualifications, experience and financial standing of
the franchisee make franchisee uniquely qualified to provide the franchised
services;



   B.   That the city has engaged in a reasonable process to determine
franchisee's qualification and the qualifications of other potential
franchisees. 



   C.   That the nature of the franchised services, of the needed
investment and the requirements of the franchise agreement are such that the
community will best be served by a single franchisee rather than by providing
competitive services. 



   D.   That the franchise agreement with the conditions required in
Section 13.01.090 will fully protect the interests of the public. 



   E.   That there are adequate provisions in the franchise agreement
to permit updating the agreement during the whole term of the agreement for
changes in service needs, changes in law, advances in technology, changes in
the market place, and other factors.

the exercise of its jurisdiction under this chapter and may determine any
question of fact which may arise during the existence of any franchise
granted hereunder. 



   D.   Franchisee shall be required to perform all business and
activities undertaken pursuant to a franchise agreement in a manner that does

other reason which promotes the public health, safety or welfare.



(Ord. 2009-08-1401 § 1(part), 2009)



13.01.140   Eminent domain; valuation of franchise in the event of
acquisition by the city.



   No grant of franchise grant shall in any way, or to any extent, impair
or affect the right of the city to acquire the property of the franchisee
either by purchase or through the exercise of the right of eminent domain. 
In the event the city should acquire the physical assets of a system or
property held pursuant to a franchise or any portion thereof through
voluntary acquisition or through the use of its power of eminent domain, the
city shall pay for the fair market value of the facilities and property
acquired, and the franchise agreement shall be deemed automatically

(Ord. 2009-08-1401 § 1(part), 2009)



13.01.150   Posting of security.



   In granting any franchise, the city council shall determine the amount
of financial security, if any, which shall be posted to secure franchisee's
obligations under the franchise.  The financial security shall be such
amount as will cover the cost of franchisee fulfilling its obligations
hereunder, and may be utilized if franchisee fails to perform as required
hereunder or fails to reimburse the city in the  event city has to remedy
any breaches by franchisee.



The security may be a bond, letter of credit, cash deposit, deed of trust or
other form approved by the city attorney.  The security shall be drawn on a

granting of the franchise by the city council, the franchisee shall have
sixty days to file all certificates of insurance, post all bonds, comply with
all other conditions set by the city council and file franchisee's
certificate of acceptance.  The execution of the certificate of acceptance
and filing of the same with the city clerk shall be franchisee's
acknowledgment that all conditions of the franchise are acceptable and shall
constitute a waiver of all claims by franchisee, and thereafter franchisee
shall be estopped from challenging such approval or the terms thereof.  In
the event franchisee fails to timely file such acceptance, the franchise and
the city council's approval thereof shall be null and void.



(Ord. 2009-08-1401 § 1(part), 2009)

use of a franchise relating to the occupation of a public right-of-way is
discontinued for any reason for a period of twelve consecutive months, or in
the event such franchise has been installed into the public right-of-way
without complying with the requirements of the franchise agreement or this
chapter, or the franchise has been terminated, canceled or has expired, the
franchisee shall within thirty days upon being given written notice from the

abandonment of equipment and facilities.  Within thirty days of the removal
plan approval, franchisee shall commence removal in accordance with the plan.



   B.   In lieu of abandonment in place, the franchisee may pay a fee
for the maintenance of inactive facilities.  In such case franchisee remains

fund to be utilized to assist franchisees in removing facilities in the
future as a part of the public or private public right of way improvement
projects.

right-of-way, the franchisee shall promptly restore the right-of-way to a
condition satisfactory to the city's public works director.



   D.   Failure of the franchisee to submit a removal plan, as provided
in division A. of this Section 13.01.170 within thirty days, or failure to
complete removal in accordance with such plan, shall result in the city
making a determination as to whether to cause the removal or leave the
property or equipment abandoned in-place.  Any removal or legal costs or
fees incurred by city pursuant to this Section shall be repaid by franchisee.



   E.   The removal or abandonment of any property or equipment shall
not release the franchisee from any warranty and indemnity provisions in the
franchise or the franchise agreement, including but not limited to any
hazardous waste indemnity, which shall survive the termination of the
franchise agreement unless otherwise provided therein.



(Ord. 2009-08-1401 § 1(part), 2009)

temporarily or permanently, as may be required, remove or relocate, without
expense to the city or any other governmental entity, any facilities or
utilities installed, used, and maintained under the franchise in a public
right-of-way, if and when made necessary by any lawful change of grade,
alignment, or width of any public street including the construction of any
subway or viaduct, by the city or any other governmental entity or made
necessary by any other public improvement or alteration in, under, on, upon
or about the public right-of-way, whether such public improvement or
alteration is at the instance of the city or another governmental or
propriety function, or made necessary by traffic conditions, public safety,
street vacation or any other public project or purpose of the city or any
other governmental entity.

reserves the right to revoke any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter,
and all rights and privileges pertaining thereto, in the event that the
franchisee violates any material provision of the franchise agreement, this
chapter, or any other material provision of this code or other law subject to
enforcement by the city.  Upon suspicion of such a violation, the city
manager shall provide written notice to the franchisee with a time for curing
the violation.  Failure to cure within the specified time shall result in a
hearing before the city manager.  If the city manager believes a violation
is occurring and not cured in a timely fashion, he may schedule a hearing
before the city council to consider revocation of the franchise and notify
franchisee thereof by certified and regular first class mail at least thirty
days prior to said hearing.  Franchisee may present evidence rebutting the
violation or evidence showing an effort to correct the violation and mitigate
its effects.  Following the hearing, the city council may revoke the
franchise, continue the franchise, or continue the franchise subject to
additional conditions, at its discretion.  The right to revoke any franchise
granted pursuant to this chapter is in addition to, and not in lieu of, any
other remedies available to the city.

application, supporting documents, or such additional information as may be
requested, and on water use information for the property as shown by the
records of the city, all of the following:



   a.   That the waiver does not constitute a grant of special
privilege inconsistent with the limitations upon other residents and
businesses.



   b.   That because of special circumstances applicable to the
property or its use, the strict application of this chapter would have a
disproportionate impact on the property or use that exceeds the impact to
residents and businesses generally.



   c.   That the authorizing of such waiver will not be of substantial
detriment to adjacent properties, and will not materially affect the ability
of the city to effectuate the purpose of this chapter and will not
detrimental to the public interest; and



   d.   That the condition or situation of the subject property or the
intended use of the property for which the waiver is sought is not common,
recurrent, or general in nature.

exercise approval authority and act upon any completed application no later
than fifteen business days after submittal and may approve, conditionally
approve, or deny the waiver. The applicant requesting the waiver shall be
promptly notified in writing of any action taken. Unless specified otherwise
at the time a waiver is approved, the waiver applies to the subject property
during the term of the mandatory water supply shortage condition.



   5.   Appeals to the City. An applicant may appeal a decision or
condition of the city manager or the city manager's designee, on a waiver

the season, and the consumption shown by the meter when in use and
registering accurately.



(Ord. 596 § 2 (part), 1966: prior code § 21.04.030)

(Ord. 68-1-613 § 2: prior code § 21.04.062)



13.04.120   Meter–Multiple services prohibited–Exceptions.



   Service of water shall not be made through a single meter on a common
service to two or more parcels of property, whether or not they are
separately owned; provided, however that in the event there is no main
contiguous to the property for which service may be requested, the department
may grant a consumer a permit authorizing him to supply water to the parcel
for which service is requested. The consumer holding the permit shall be
solely responsible to the city for payment of all the department's charges
and any such permit may be revoked by the public works director upon thirty
days' written notice. Charges for water used through such a common service
shall be based on a monthly block rate for a single meter rate equal to the
monthly block rate for a single meter multiplied by the number of parcels
served. For example, a meter serving two parcels would be charged two
minimums, and be allowed twice the consumption allowance under the minimum
charge. Contiguous lots or parcels which are owned by the same consumer shall
be deemed to be one parcel if all are occupied by him for business,
industrial or horticultural uses. Each lot which is separately occupied for
residential purposes shall be deemed a separate parcel even though owned by
the same person.

   The deposit will be refunded when a customer closes the account.
Interest earned will be utilized in the water fund's operations to reduce
rates.



   2.   Delinquent Service Charges. All water bills shall become due
and payable on the twentieth day of the month, provided the water bills are
mailed the last working day of the prior month. Upon failure of a water user
to pay the water bill in full on the twentieth day of the month, the bill
shall be deemed delinquent and a delinquent service charge shall be added to
the bill. Delinquent service charges are applied to cover a portion of the
city's costs caused by such delinquencies. It is found and determined that
the charges are as follows:



      a.   Ten percent of the outstanding balance over: ten dollars.



      b.   Minimum delinquent service charge: one dollar.

determined that the charge does not exceed the administrative costs incurred.



   Returned check charge: twenty dollars.



   4.   Meter Re-reads and Efficiency Checks. A service charge will be
made whenever a customer requests that their meter be re-read or checked for
efficiency resulting in a bench test of the meter. If the city is in error
due to the meter read being incorrect, the water billing will be adjusted and
the meter re-read. The service charge will be refunded. Meter re-read and
efficiency check service charges are applied to cover a portion of the city's
administrative costs associated with such meter re-reads and efficiency
checks. It is found and determined that the charge does not exceed the
administrative costs incurred.



   Meter re-read/efficiency check charge: twenty-five dollars.



   5.   Discontinued Service and Turn-On Charges. Upon failure of a
water user to pay the bill in full no later than twenty days following date
of delinquency, the city may, after complying with the state law on
discontinuance of utility service for nonpayment, discontinue the water
service and shall not again furnish water service to such a user until all
previous water charges, delinquent service charges, a customer deposit, and a
disconnection/reconnection service charge are paid in full. The
disconnection/reconnection service charge shall apply whenever water service
is discontinued for nonpayment. This disconnection/reconnection service
charge is applied to cover a portion of the city's administrative costs
caused by discontinuing service for nonpayment of water billings. It is found
and determined that the charge does not exceed the administrative costs
incurred.



   Disconnection/reconnection charge: twenty- five dollars.



   Water service will not be withheld from a new residential user because
of outstanding charges on the account of the preceding residential lessee or
renter.



   6.   Hang Tag Charges for Last Notification Before Shut-Off. A
service charge will be made whenever a customer has been determined to be so
delinquent that a water shut-off notice must be hand delivered to the
customer. Hang tag charges are applied to cover the city's administrative
costs associated with the shut-off notices. It is hereby found and determined
that the charge does not exceed the administrative costs incurred.



   Hang tag charge: ten dollars.



   7.   Applications for Service. Applications for water connections or
water service of any and all types shall be on a form provided by the city
and shall be signed by the applicant, and shall include the following
provision:



   Applicant understands and agrees that water supplies and pressures are
subject to interruption and variation. Applicant releases city and its
officers, agents and employees from, and agrees that they shall not be liable
with respect to any injury or damage, whether to person or property,
sustained by applicant by reason of any interruption in or variation of water
supplies or pressures, whether occurring at the location for which connection
or service is being applied for, or at any other location, and whether
occurring with or without the fault or negligence of city officers, agents or
employees.

13.04.135   Exemptions.



   Residential Fire Sprinkler and Submeter Exemptions.  Where the
installation of a fire sprinkler system or a water submeter in a residential
use causes an increase in the monthly water service charge, the following
exemptions shall apply to Section 13.04.130(A), solely for the purposes of
calculating applicable fees:



   A.   Where fire sprinklers are required by the California Building
Code for new single family dwellings and duplexes, the water monthly service
charge shall be based on the meter size determined by the fixture count
instead of the meter size required due to the additional fire sprinkler flow.



   B.   Where the installation of submeters alone causes head losses
that increases the water meter size, the monthly water service charge listed
in Section 13.04.130(A) shall be based on sizing without the submeter
losses.  This exemption shall not reduce the fee where other factors, other
than the submeter losses, cause a larger meter size to be required.



(Ord. 2012-08-1450, § 2, 2012)



13.04.140   Vacant property rate.



   The minimum monthly rate shall be charged and collected from a
subscriber notwithstanding that his property is vacant and no water is
delivered through his meter. If a property serviced through a meter becomes
vacant, the subscriber may in writing request the department to shut off the
meter, in which event the minimum charge shall not be payable until the meter
is reopened.

13.04.150   Bills–Payment–Delinquencies.



   A.   The department's charges for labor and materials furnished in
installing or altering a service connection shall be paid in advance or, in
those instances where the cost thereof cannot be determined in advance, upon
presentation of a statement after the cost is determined.



   B.   Water bills and other service charges shall be due and payable
upon presentation and shall become delinquent twenty days thereafter.



   C.   If a statement of a customer's account is not paid on or before
the expiration of forty days after presentation, the department shall turn
off the service and it shall not be turned on again until all delinquent
items in the account have been fully paid, together with a service charge in
the amount of five dollars to cover the cost of closing and opening the
service. In addition to such action, the city may bring suit for any amount
due for labor or materials or water service furnished to any consumer by the
department, and any such demand may be assigned for collection upon the order
of the council upon such terms as it shall determine to be proper.



(Ord. 596 § 2 (part), 1966: prior code § 21.04.045)



13.04.160   Bills–Adjustments by superintendent.



   A.   The public works director may serve water to indigent persons
without charge but all such instances shall be promptly reported to the
council, which may authorize the continuance of free service upon such terms
and conditions as it shall deem proper.



   B.   Disputes involving the accuracy of meters or their reading or
the computation of charges for water or services may be adjusted and settled
by the public works director.



   C.   If a consumer is dissatisfied with any decision of the public
works director respecting the service of water to him or the amount of the
department's charges for water or services furnished, he may appeal such
decision to the city council whose determination shall be final.



(Ord. 596 § 2 (part), 1966: prior code § 21.04.040)



13.04.170   Turning water on after shut off.



   After any water service has been turned off, it shall be unlawful for
any person other than an authorized employee of the department to tap, open,
and connect to, or cause, permit or allow to be turned on, in any way, the
water supply to such service.



(Ord. 596 § 2 (part), 1966: prior code § 21.04.175)



13.04.200   Bypass connections prohibited.



   Any bypass or connection around the meter between the service and the
main shall be prohibited. All water used, except as provided in Section

city will require the water user to install an approved backflow prevention
device at his/her expense for continued services or before a new service will
be granted.



   4.   Wherever the city engineer, health agency or local health
agency determines that backflow protection is required on a water supply line
entering a water user's premises, then any and all water supply lines from
the city's mains entering such premises, buildings or structures shall be
protected by an approved backflow prevention device, to be installed at the
water user's expense. The type of device to be installed will be in
accordance with the requirements of this chapter.



   5.   Every fire protection system served by the water supplier shall
be separately connected to the public water system, and not interconnected to
plumbing systems serving domestic or irrigation water.



   B.   Where Protection is Required.



   1.   Each service connection from the city water system for
supplying water to premises having an auxiliary water supply shall be
protected against backflow of water from the premises into the public water
system unless the auxiliary water supply is accepted as an additional source
by the city, and is approved by the public health agency having jurisdiction.

bottom of the device and with a minimum of twelve inches side clearance. The
device shall be installed so that it is readily accessible for maintenance
and testing. Water supplied from any point between the service connection and
the RP device shall be protected in a manner approved by the city engineer.



   c.   Double Check-Valve Assembly (DC). The approved double
check-valve assembly shall be located as close as practical to the user's
connection and shall be installed above grade, if possible, and in a manner
where it is readily accessible for testing and maintenance. If a double
check-valve assembly is put below grade it must be installed in a vault such
that there is a minimum of six inches between the bottom of the vault and the
bottom of the device, so that the top of the device is no more than eight
inches below grade, so there is a minimum of six inches of clearance between
the side of the device with the test cocks and the side of the vault, and so
there is a minimum of three inches clearance between the other side of the
device and the side of the vault. Double check-valve assemblies of the "Y"
type must be installed on their "side" with the test cocks in a vertical
position so that either the check-valve may be removed for service without
removing the device. Vaults which do not have an integrated bottom must be
placed on a three-inch layer of gravel.



   C.   Backflow Prevention Device Testing and Maintenance.



   1.   The owners of any premises on which, or on account of which,
backflow prevention devices are installed, shall have the devices tested by a
person approved by the city engineer. Backflow prevention devices must be
tested at least annually and immediately after installation, relocation or
repair. The city engineer may require a more frequent test schedule if it is
determined to be necessary. No device shall be placed back in service unless
it is functioning as required. A report in a form acceptable to the city
engineer shall be filed with the city each time a device is tested, relocated
or repaired. These devices shall be serviced, overhauled or replaced whenever
they are found to be defective and all costs of testing, repair and
maintenance shall be borne by the water user.



   2.   The city will supply affected water users with a list of
persons acceptable to the city to test backflow prevention devices. The city
will notify affected customers by mail when annual testing of a device is
needed and also supply users with the necessary forms which must be filled
out each time a device is tested or repaired.

   1.   The city shall review all requests for new services to
determine if backflow protection is needed. Plans and specifications must be
submitted to the city upon request for review of possible cross-connection
hazards as a condition of service for new service connections. If it is
determined that a backflow prevention device is necessary to protect the
public water system, the required device must be installed before service
will be granted.



   2.   The city engineer may require an on-premises inspection to
evaluate cross-connection hazards. The city will transmit a written notice
requesting an inspection appointment to each affected water user. Any
customer which cannot or will not allow an on-premises inspection of their
piping system shall be required to install the backflow prevention device the
city engineer considers necessary.



   3.   The city engineer may, in his discretion, require a
reinspection for cross-connection hazards of any premises to which it serves
water. The city will transmit a written notice requesting an inspection
appointment to each affected water user. Any customer which cannot or will
not allow an on-premises inspection of their piping system shall be required
to install the backflow prevention device the city engineer considers
necessary.



   B.   Customer Notification -- Device Installation.



   1.   The city will notify any affected water user of the survey
findings, listing corrective action to be taken if required. A period of
sixty days will be given to complete all corrective action required including
installation of backflow prevention devices.



   2.   A second notice will be sent to each water user which does not
take the required corrective action prescribed in the first notice within the
sixty-days period allowed. The second notice will give the water user a
two-week period to take the required corrective action. If no action is taken
within the two-week periods the city may terminate water service to the
affected water user until the required corrective actions are taken.



   C.   Customer Notification--Testing and Maintenance.



   1.   The city will notify each affected water user when it is time
for the backflow prevention device installed on their service connection to
be tested. This written notice shall give the water user thirty days to have
the device tested and supply the water user with the necessary form to be
completed and resubmitted to the city.



   2.   A second notice shall be sent to each city water user which
does not have his/her backflow prevention device tested as prescribed in the
first notice within the thirty-day period allowed. The second notice will
give the water user a two-week period to have his/her backflow prevention
device tested. If no action is taken within the two-week period the city may
terminate water service to the affected water user until the subject device
is tested.

thereto, the city engineer may, in lieu of providing the required underground
facilities, have the authority to order the disconnection and removal of any
and all overhead service wires and associated facilities supplying
utility-service to the property. Upon completion of the work by the city
engineer, he shall file a written report with the city council setting forth
the fact that the required underground facilities have been provided and the
cost thereof, together with a legal description of the property against which
such cost is to be assessed. The council shall thereupon fix a time and place

giving of the notice to provide the required underground facilities, of the
time and place that the council will pass upon such report and will hear
protests against such assessment. Such notice shall also set forth the amount
of the proposed assessment.



   F.   Upon the date and hour set for the hearing of protests, the
council shall hear and consider the report and all protests, if there be any,
and then proceed to affirm, modify or reject the assessment.



   G.   If any assessment is not paid within five days after its
confirmation by the council, the amount of the assessment shall become a lien
upon the property against which the assessment is made by the city engineer,
and the city engineer is directed to turn over to the assessor and tax
collector a notice of lien on each of the properties on which the assessment
has not been paid, and the assessor and tax collector shall add the amount of
the assessment to the next regular bill for taxes levied against the premises
upon which the assessment was not paid. The assessment shall be due and
payable at the same time as property taxes are due and payable, and if not
paid when due and payable, shall bear interest at the rate of six percent per
year.

13.10.010   Purpose.



   A.   The state legislature has found that:



   1.   The water of the state is of limited supply and is subject to
ever increasing demands;



   2.   The continuation of California’s economic prosperity is
dependent on the availability of adequate supplies of water for future uses;



   3.   It is the policy of the state to promote the conservation and
efficient use of water and to prevent the waste of this valuable resource;



   4.   Landscapes are essential to the quality of life in California,
by providing areas for active and passive recreation, as an enhancement to
the environment by cleaning air and water, preventing erosion, offering fire
protection and replacing ecosystems lost to development; and



   5.   Landscape design, installation, maintenance and management can
and should be water efficient; and



   6.   Section 2 of Article X of the California Constitution specifies
that the right to use water is limited to the amount reasonably required for
the beneficial use to be served and the right does not and shall not extend
to waste or unreasonable method of use.



   B.   Consistent with these legislative findings, the purpose of this
chapter is to:



   1.   Promote the values and benefits of landscaping practices that
integrate and go beyond the conservation and efficient use of water;



   2.   Establish a structure for planning, designing, installing,
maintaining and managing water efficient landscapes in new construction and
rehabilitated projects by encouraging the use of a watershed approach that
requires cross-sector collaboration of industry, government and property
owners to achieve the many benefits possible;



   3.   Establish provisions for water management practices and water
waste prevention for existing landscapes;



   4.   Use water efficiently without waste by setting a maximum
applied water allowance as an upper limit for water use, and reduce water use
to the lowest practical amount;



   5.   Promote the benefits of consistent landscape ordinances with
neighboring local and regional agencies;



   6.   Encourage the use economic incentives that promote the
efficient use of water; and



   7.   Encourage implementation and enforcement of the provisions of
the water conservation in landscaping ordinance.



   C.   Landscapes that are planned, designed, installed, managed and
maintained with the watershed based approach can improve California’s
environmental conditions and provide benefits and realize sustainability
goals. Such landscapes will make the urban environment resilient in the face
of climatic extremes. Consistent with the legislative findings and purpose of
the ordinance, conditions in the urban setting will be improved by:



   1.   Creating the conditions to support life in the soil by reducing
compaction, incorporating organic matter that increases water retention, and
promoting productive plant growth that leads to more carbon storage, oxygen
production, shade, habitat, and esthetic benefits.



   2.   Minimizing energy use by reducing irrigation water
requirements, reducing reliance on petroleum based fertilizers and
pesticides, and planting climate appropriate shade trees in urban areas.



   3.   Conserving water by capturing and reusing rainwater and
graywater wherever possible and selecting climate appropriate plants that
need minimal supplemental water after establishment.



   4.   Protecting air and water quality by reducing power equipment
use and landfill disposal trips, selecting recycled and locally sourced
materials, and using compost, mulch and efficient irrigation equipment to
prevent erosion.



   5.   Protecting existing habitat and creating new habitat by
choosing local native plants, climate adapted non-natives and avoiding
invasive plants. Utilizing integrated pest management with the least toxic
methods as the first course of action. (Ord. 2015-11-1481 § 1 (part))

   c.   Plants shall be selected and planted appropriately, based upon
their adaptability to the climatic, geologic and topographical conditions of
the project site. Methods to achieve water efficiency shall include one or
more of the following:



   i.   Use the Sunset Western Climate Zone System, which takes into
account temperature, humidity, elevation, terrain, latitude and varying
degrees of continental and marine influence on local climate;



   ii.   Recognize the horticultural attributes of plants (i.e., mature
plant size, invasive surface roots) to minimize damage to property or
infrastructure (e.g., buildings, sidewalks, power lines); allow for adequate
soil volume for healthy root growth; and



   iii.   Consider the solar orientation for plant placement, to
maximize summer shade and winter solar gain.



   d.   Turf is not allowed on slopes greater than twenty-five per
cent, where the toe of the slope is adjacent to an impermeable hardscape, and
where twenty-five per cent means one foot of vertical elevation change for
every four feet of horizontal length (rise divided by run x 100 = slope
percent).



   e.   High water use plants, characterized by a plant factor of 0.7
to 1.0, are prohibited in street medians.



   f.   A landscape design plan for projects in fire-prone areas shall
address fire safety and prevention. A defensible space or zone around a
building or structure is required per Public Resources Code Section 4291(a)
and (b). Avoid fire-prone plant materials and highly flammable mulches. Refer
to the local fuel modification plan guidelines.



   g.   The use of invasive plant species, such as those listed by the
California Invasive Plant Council, is strongly discouraged.



   h.   The architectural guidelines of a common interest development,
which include community apartment projects, condominiums, planned
developments, and stock cooperatives, shall not prohibit or include
conditions that have the effect of prohibiting the use of low-water use
plants as a group.



   2.   Water features.



   a.   Recirculating water systems shall be used for water features.

   3.   Soil preparation, mulch and amendments.



   a.   Prior to the planting of any materials, compacted soils shall
be transformed to a friable condition. On engineered slopes, only amended
planting holes need meet this requirement.



   b.   Soil amendments shall be incorporated according to
recommendations of the soil report and what is appropriate for the plants
selected (see Section 13.10.090).



   c.   For landscape installations, compost at a rate of a minimum of
four cubic yards per one thousand square feet of permeable area shall be
incorporated to a depth of six inches into the soil. Soils with greater than
six percent organic matter in the top six inches of soil are exempt from
adding compost and tilling.



   d.   A minimum three-inch layer of mulch shall be applied on all
exposed soil surfaces of planting areas, except in turf areas, creeping or
rooting groundcovers, or direct seeding applications where mulch is
contraindicated. To provide habitat for beneficial insects and other
wildlife, up to five percent of the landscape area may be left without mulch.
Designated insect habitat must be included in the landscape design plan as
such.



   e.   Stabilizing mulching products shall be used on slopes that meet
current engineering standards.



   f.   The mulching portion of the seed/mulch slurry in hydro-seeded
applications shall meet the mulching requirement.



   g.   Organic mulch materials made from recycled or post-consumer
shall take precedence over inorganic materials or virgin forest products
unless the recycled post-consumer organic products are not locally available.
Organic mulches are not required where prohibited by local fuel modification
plan guidelines or other applicable local ordinances.



   B.   At a minimum, the landscape design plan shall:



   1.   Delineate and label each hydrozone by number, letter or other
method;



   2.   Identify each hydrozone as low, moderate, high water or mixed

13.10.110   Irrigation design plan.



   A.   This section applies to landscaped areas requiring permanent
irrigation, not areas that require temporary irrigation solely for the plant
establishment period. For the efficient use of water, an irrigation system
shall meet all the requirements listed in this section and the
manufacturers’ recommendations. The irrigation system and its related
components shall be planned and designed to allow for proper installation,
management and maintenance. An irrigation design plan meeting the following
design criteria shall be submitted as part of the landscape documentation
package.



   1.   System.



   a.   To facilitate water management, landscape water meters defined
as either a dedicated water service meter or private submeter, shall be
installed for all non-residential irrigated landscapes of one thousand square
feet but not more than five thousand square feet (the level at which State
Water Code 535 applies) and residential irrigated landscapes of five thousand
square feet or greater. A landscape water meter may be either:



   i.   A customer service meter dedicated to landscape use provided by
the local water purveyor; or



   ii.   A privately owned meter or submeter.



   b.   Automatic irrigation controllers utilizing either
evapotranspiration or soil moisture sensor data utilizing non-volatile memory
shall be required for irrigation scheduling in all irrigation systems.



   c.   If the water pressure is below or exceeds the recommended
pressure of the specified irrigation devices, the installation of a pressure
regulating device is required to ensure that the dynamic pressure at each
emission device is within the manufacturer's recommended pressure range for
optimal performance.



   i.   If the static pressure is above or below the required dynamic
pressure of the irrigation system, pressure-regulating devices, such as
inline pressure regulators, booster pumps or other devices, shall be
installed to meet the required dynamic pressure of the irrigation system.



   ii.   Static water pressure, dynamic or operating pressure and flow
reading of the water supply shall be measured at the point of connection.
These pressure and flow measurements shall be conducted at the design stage.
If the measurements are not available at the design stage, the measurements
shall be conducted at installation.



   d.   Sensors (rain, freeze, wind, and the like), either integral or
auxiliary, that suspend or alter irrigation operation during unfavorable
weather conditions shall be required on all irrigation systems, as
appropriate for local climatic conditions. Irrigation should be avoided
during rain or windy or freezing weather.



   e.   Manual shut-off valves (such as a gate valve, ball valve or
butterfly valve) shall be required, as close as possible to the point of
connection of the water supply, to minimize water loss in case of an
emergency (such as a main line break) or routine repair.



   f.   Backflow prevention devices shall be required to protect the
water supply from contamination by the irrigation system. A project applicant
shall refer to Section 13.05.040 for additional backflow prevention
requirements.



   g.   Flow sensors that detect high flow conditions created by system
damage or malfunction are required for all non-residential landscapes and
residential landscapes of five thousand square feet or larger.



   h.   Master shut-off valves are required on all projects except
landscapes that make use of technologies that allow for the individual
control of sprinklers that are individually pressurized in a system equipped
with low pressure shut down features.



   i.   The irrigation system shall be designed to prevent runoff, low
head drainage, overspray, or other similar conditions where irrigation water
flows onto non-targeted areas, such as adjacent property, non-irrigated
areas, hardscapes, roadways, or structures.



   j.   Relevant information from the soil management plan, such as
soil type and infiltration rate, shall be utilized when designing irrigation
systems.



   k.   The design of the irrigation system shall conform to the
hydrozones of the landscape design plan.



   l.   The irrigation system must be designed and installed to meet,
at a minimum, the irrigation efficiency criteria, as described in Section
13.10.080, regarding the maximum applied water allowance.



   m.   All irrigation emission devices must meet the requirements set
in the American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard, American
Society of Agricultural and Biological Engineers/International Code Council's
(ASABE/ICC) 802-2014 “Landscape Irrigation Sprinkler and Emitter
Standard.” All sprinkler heads installed in the landscape must document a
distribution uniformity low quarter of 0.65 or higher using the protocol
defined in ASABE/ICC 802-2014.



   n.   It is highly recommended that the project applicant or local
agency inquire with the local water purveyor about peak water operating
demands (on the water supply system) or water restrictions that may impact
the effectiveness of the irrigation system.



   o.   In mulched planting areas, the use of low volume irrigation is
required to maximize water infiltration into the root zone.



   p.   Sprinkler heads and other emission devices shall have matched
precipitation rates, unless otherwise directed by the manufacturer’s
recommendations.



   q.   Head-to-head coverage is recommended. However, sprinkler
spacing shall be designed to achieve the highest possible distribution
uniformity using the manufacturer’s recommendations.



   r.   Swing joints or other riser-protection components are required
on all risers subject to damage that are adjacent to hardscapes or in high
traffic areas of turf.



   s.   Check valves or anti-drain valves are required on all sprinkler
heads where low point drainage could occur.



   t.   Areas less than ten feet wide in any direction shall be
irrigated with subsurface irrigation or other means that produces no runoff
or overspray.



   u.   Overhead irrigation shall not be permitted within twenty-four
inches of any non-permeable surface. Allowable irrigation within the setback
from non-permeable surfaces may include drip, drip line, or other low flow
non-spray technology. The setback area may be planted or unplanted. The
surfacing of the setback may be mulch, gravel or other porous material. These
restrictions may be modified if:



   i.   The landscape area is adjacent to permeable surfacing and no
runoff occurs; or



   ii.   The adjacent non-permeable surfaces are designed and
constructed to drain entirely to landscaping; or



   iii.   The irrigation designer specifies an alternative design or
technology as part of the landscape documentation package, and clearly
demonstrates strict adherence to irrigation system design criteria in Section
13.10.110A.1.h. Prevention of overspray and runoff must be confirmed during
the irrigation audit.



   v.   Slopes greater than twenty-five per cent shall not be irrigated
with an irrigation system with an application rate exceeding three-quarters
of an inch per hour. This restriction may be modified if the landscape
designer specifies an alternative design or technology as part of the
landscape documentation package, and clearly demonstrates no runoff or
erosion will occur. Prevention of runoff and erosion must be confirmed during
the irrigation audit.



   2.   Hydrozone.



   a.   Each valve shall irrigate a hydrozone with similar site, slope,
sun exposure, soil conditions, and plant materials with similar water use.



   b.   Sprinkler heads and other emission devices shall be selected
based on what is appropriate for the plant type within that hydrozone.



   c.   Where feasible, trees shall be placed on separate valves from
shrubs, groundcovers and turf to facilitate the appropriate irrigation of
trees. The mature size and extent of the root zone shall be considered when
designing irrigation for the tree.



   d.   Individual hydrozones that mix plants of moderate and low water
use, or moderate and high water use, may be allowed if:



   i.   Plant factor calculation is based on the proportions of the
respective plant water uses and their plant factors; or



   ii.   The plant factor of the higher water-using plant is used for
calculations.



   e.   Individual hydrozones that mix high and low water use plants
shall not be permitted.



   f.   On the landscape design plan and irrigation design plan,
hydrozone areas shall be designated by number, letter or other designation.
On the irrigation design plan, designate the areas irrigated by each valve,
and assign a number to each valve. Use this valve number in the hydrozone
information table which is on file and available from the community
development department. This table can also assist with the irrigation audit
and programming the controller.



   B.   The irrigation design plan, at a minimum, shall contain:



   1.   Location and size of separate water meters for landscape;



   2.   Location, type and size of all components of the irrigation
system, including controllers, main and lateral lines, valves, sprinkler
heads, moisture-sensing devices, rain switches, quick couplers, pressure
regulators, and backflow prevention devices;



   3.   Static water pressure at the point of connection to the public
water supply;



   4.   Flow rate (gallons per minute), application rate (inches per
hour), and design operating pressure (pressure per square inch) for each
station;



   5.   The following statement: “I have complied with the criteria
of the ordinance and applied them accordingly for the efficient use of water
in the irrigation design plan”; and



   6.   The signature of a licensed landscape architect, certified
irrigation designer, licensed landscape contractor, or any other person
authorized to design an irrigation system. (See Sections 5500.1, 5615, 5641,

and Professions Code, Section 832.27 of Title 16 of the California Code of
Regulations, and Section 6721 of the Food and Agricultural Code.) (Ord.
2015-11-1481 § 1 (part))



13.10.120   Grading design plan.



   A.   For the efficient use of water, grading of a project site shall
be designed to minimize soil erosion, runoff and water waste. A grading plan
shall be submitted as part of the landscape documentation package. A
comprehensive grading plan prepared by a civil engineer for other local
agency permits satisfies this requirement.

10:00 a.m. unless weather conditions prevent it. If allowable hours of
irrigation differ from any city-imposed water conservation restrictions (such
as those contained in Chapter13.03), the stricter of the two shall apply.
Operation of the irrigation system outside the normal watering window is
allowed for auditing and system maintenance.



   3.   For implementation of the irrigation schedule, particular
attention must be paid to irrigation run times, emission device, flow rate,
and current reference evapotranspiration, so that applied water meets the
estimated total water use. Total annual applied water shall be less than or
equal to maximum applied water allowance (MAWA). Actual irrigation schedules
shall be regulated by automatic irrigation controllers using current
reference evapotranspiration data (e.g., CIMIS) or soil moisture sensor data.



   4.   Parameters used to set the automatic controller shall be
developed and submitted for each of the following:



   a.   The plant establishment period;



   b.   The established landscape; and



   c.   Temporarily irrigated areas.



   5.   Each irrigation schedule shall consider for each station all of
the following that apply:



   a.   Irrigation interval (days between irrigation);



   b.   Irrigation run times (hours or minutes per irrigation event to
avoid runoff);



   c.   Number of cycle starts required for each irrigation event to
avoid runoff;



   d.   Amount of applied water scheduled to be applied on a monthly

   i.   Slope factor setting;



   j.   Shade factor setting; and



   k.   Irrigation uniformity or efficiency setting. (Ord. 2015-11-1481
§ 1 (part))



13.10.150   Landscape and irrigation maintenance schedule.



   A.   Landscapes shall be maintained to ensure water use efficiency.
A regular maintenance schedule shall be submitted with the certificate of
completion.



   B.   A regular maintenance schedule shall include, but not be
limited to, routine inspection; auditing, adjustment and repair of the
irrigation system and its components; aerating and dethatching turf areas;
topdressing with compost, replenishing mulch; fertilizing; pruning; weeding
in all landscape areas; and removing obstructions to emission devices.
Operation of the irrigation system outside the normal watering window is
allowed for auditing and system maintenance.



   C.   Repair of all irrigation equipment shall be done with the
originally installed components or their equivalents or with components with
greater efficiency.



   D.   A project applicant is encouraged to implement established
landscape industry sustainable best practices for all landscape maintenance
activities.



(Ord. 2015-11-1481 § 1 (part))



13.10.160   Irrigation audit, irrigation survey, and irrigation water use
analysis.



   A.   All landscape irrigation audits shall be conducted by a local
agency landscape irrigation auditor or a third party certified landscape
irrigation auditor. Landscape audits shall not be conducted by the person who
designed the landscape or installed the landscape.



   B.   In large projects or projects with multiple landscape
installations (i.e., production home developments) an auditing rate of one in
seven lots or approximately fifteen percent will satisfy this requirement.



   C.   For new construction and rehabilitated landscape projects
installed after December 1, 2015, as described in Section 13.10.020:



   1.   The project applicant shall submit an irrigation audit report
with the certificate of completion to the director, which may include, but is
not limited to: inspection, system tune-up, system test with distribution
uniformity, reporting overspray or run off that causes overland flow, and
preparation of an irrigation schedule, including configuring irrigation
controllers with application rate, soil types, plant factors, slope, exposure
and any other factors necessary for accurate programming.



   2.   The director shall administer programs that may include, but
not be limited to, irrigation water use analysis, irrigation audits, and
irrigation surveys for compliance with the maximum applied water allowance.
(Ord. 2015-11- 1481 § 1 (part))



13.10.170   Irrigation efficiency.



   For the purpose of determining estimated total water use, average
irrigation efficiency is assumed to be 0.75 for overhead spray devices and
0.81 for drip system devices. (Ord. 2015-11-1481 § 1 (part))etermining
maximum applied water allowance, average irrigation efficiency is assumed to
be 0.71. Irrigation systems shall be designed, maintained and managed to meet
or exceed an average landscape irrigation efficiency of 0.71.



(Ord. 2009-12-1409 § 1 (part))



13.10.180   Recycled water.



   The installation of recycled water irrigation systems shall not be
required by the city, as the local water purveyor has determined that
recycled water meeting all public health codes and standards is not and will
not be available for the foreseeable future. (Ord. 2015-11-1481 § 1 (part))



13.10.185   Graywater systems.



   Graywater systems promote the efficient use of water and are encouraged
to assist in on-site landscape irrigation. All graywater systems shall
conform to the California Plumbing Code (Title 24, Part 5, Chapter 16) and
any applicable local ordinance standards. Refer to Section 13.10.020D., for
the applicability of this chapter to landscape areas less than two thousand
five hundred square feet with the estimated total water use met entirely by
graywater. (Ord. 2015-11-1481 § 1 (part))



13.10.190   Stormwater management and rainwater retention.



   A.   Stormwater management practices minimize runoff and increase
infiltration, which recharges groundwater and improves water quality.
Implementing stormwater best management practices into the landscape and
grading design plans, to minimize runoff and to increase on-site rainwater
retention and infiltration, is encouraged.



   B.   Project applicants shall refer to Chapter 12.16 for information
on applicable stormwater technical requirements.



   C.   All planted landscape areas are required to have friable soil
to maximize water retention and infiltration. Refer to Section 13.10.100.



   D.   It is strongly recommended that landscape areas be designed for
capture and infiltration capacity that is sufficient to prevent runoff from
impervious surfaces (i.e. roof and paved areas) from either: (1) the one
inch, twenty-four-hour rain event or (2) the eighty-fifth percentile,
twenty-four-hour rain event, and/or additional capacity as required by any
applicable local, regional, state or federal regulation.



   E.   It is recommended that stormwater projects incorporate any of
the following elements to improve on-site stormwater and dry weather runoff
capture and use:



   1.   Grade impervious surfaces, such as driveways, during
construction to drain to vegetated areas;



   2.   Minimize the area of impervious surfaces such as paved areas,
roof and concrete driveways;



   3.   Incorporate pervious or porous surfaces (e.g., gravel,
permeable pavers or blocks, pervious or porous concrete) that minimize runoff;



   4.   Direct runoff from paved surfaces and roof areas into planting
beds or landscaped areas to maximize site water capture and reuse;



   5.   Incorporate rain gardens, cisterns, and other rain harvesting
or catchment systems;



   6.   Incorporate infiltration beds, swales, basins and drywells to
capture stormwater and dry weather runoff and increase percolation into the
soil; and



   7.   Consider constructed wetlands and ponds that retain water,
equalize excess flow, and filter pollutants. (Ord. 2015-11-1481 § 1 (part))



13.10.200   Public education.



   A.   Publications.



   1.   Education is a critical component to promote the efficient use
of water in landscapes. The use of appropriate principles of design,
installation, management and maintenance that save water is encouraged in the
community.



   2.   The director shall provide information to owners of new
permitted renovations and new single-family residential homes regarding the
design, installation, management and maintenance of water efficient
landscapes based on a water budget.



   B.   Model homes. All model homes shall be landscaped and use signs
and written information to demonstrate the principles of water efficient
landscapes described in this chapter.



   1.   Signs shall be used to identify the model as an example of a
water efficient landscape, featuring elements such as hydrozones, irrigation
equipment, and others that contribute to the overall water efficient theme.
Signage shall include information about the site water use as designed per
the local ordinance; specify who designed and installed the water efficient
landscape; and demonstrate low water use approaches to landscaping such as
using native plants, graywater systems, and rainwater catchment systems.



   2.   Information shall be provided about designing, installing,
managing and maintaining water efficient landscapes. (Ord. 2015-11-1481 § 1
(part))



13.10.210   Irrigation audit, irrigation survey, and irrigation water use
analysis for existing landscapes.



   A.   This section shall apply to all existing landscapes that were
installed before December 1, 2015, and are over one acre in size.



   1.   For all landscapes in this subsection that have a water meter,
the director shall administer programs that may include, but not be limited
to, irrigation water use analyses, irrigation surveys and irrigation audits,
to evaluate water use and provide recommendations as necessary to reduce
landscape water use to a level that does not exceed the maximum applied water
allowance for existing landscapes. The maximum applied water allowance for
existing landscapes shall be calculated as: MAWA = (0.8) (ETo)(LA)(0.62).



   2.   For all landscapes in this subsection that do not have a water
meter, the director shall administer programs that may include, but not be
limited to, irrigation surveys and irrigation audits, to evaluate water use
and provide recommendations as necessary in order to prevent water waste.



   B.   All landscape irrigation audits shall be conducted by a
certified landscape irrigation auditor.



(Ord. 2015-11-1481 § 1 (part))



13.10.220   Water waste prevention.



   A.   The director shall enforce restrictions to prevent water waste
resulting from inefficient landscape irrigation, by prohibiting runoff from
leaving the target landscape due to low head drainage, overspray, or other
similar conditions where water flows onto adjacent property, non-irrigated
areas, walks, roadways, parking lots, or structures. Penalties for violation
of these prohibitions are contained in Section 13.03.100.



   B.   Restrictions regarding overspray and runoff may be modified if:



   1.   The landscape area is adjacent to permeable surfacing and no
runoff occurs; or



   2.   The adjacent non-permeable surfaces are designed and
constructed to drain entirely to landscaping. (Ord. 2015-11-1481 § 1 (part))



13.10.230   Effective precipitation.



   The director may consider effective precipitation (twenty-five per cent
of annual precipitation) in tracking water use, and may use the following
equation to calculate maximum applied water allowance:



      MAWA = (ETo - Eppt) (0.62) [(0.55 x LA) + (0.45 x SLA)] for
residential areas.



      MAWA= (ETo - Eppt) (0.62) [(0.45 x LA) + (0.55 x SLA)] for
non-residential areas.



(Ord. 2015-11-1481 § 1 (part))



13.10.240   Reporting.



   A.   The director shall prepare a report on implementation and
enforcement of the updated ordinance. The report shall be submitted to the
State by December 31, 2015. Subsequently, reporting will be due by January
31st of each year.



   B.   Reports are to address the following:

area specified in the approved franchise agreement. Service to the areas
prescribed in that agreement shall be provided within the period stated

The proposed construction schedule shall not, in any event, exceed two years,
except that, by resolution, the city, in its discretion, may extend the time
for the commencement and the completion of installation and construction for
additional periods in the event the grantee, acting in good faith,
experiences delays by reason of circumstances beyond his control.



   D.   By acceptance of the franchise granted hereunder, grantee
agrees that failure to comply with any time requirements referred to in
Subsections A, B and C of this section, or as may be extended by council, may

proprietary, of any poles, conduits or similar facilities erected,
controlled, or maintained exclusively by or for the grantee in any street,
provided such use does not interfere with the use of grantee.

facilities underground, with the exception of any "active device" as defined
in Section 13.12.010. Any active device to be located above the ground shall
first be approved by the city engineer, who will approve the location and
design if grantee has ensured to the city engineer's satisfaction that such

hereafter adopted, including but not limited to those pertaining to works and
activities in, on, over, under and about streets.

thereof to be paid by the grantee. If such trimming is performed by grantee

city manager, or is the cause for numerous complaints, the city manager may
issue a stop work order for all permits issued to the grantee and/or his
subcontractors for construction, and may stop work until such time as the
city manager believes that the cause for such complaint has been remedied.



   If the city requires replacement of any subcontractor employed by the
grantee, then the grantee shall be given an automatic extension of any
construction deadline for thirty additional days from the date of receipt of
written notification of any such action by the city.



   J.   Grantee shall, except as provided herein, provide services to
the entire residential area of the city, including future annexations, in
accord with subsection C of this section and the schedule provided pursuant
thereto, and herein referred to as the "subscriber network." Any limitations
on system extensions, or exclusions, must be made a part of the franchise
agreement approved by council.

network," services shall be provided in accord with the terms and conditions
of that network as specified in the franchise agreement approved by council.

the resultant tests reveal grantee has failed to correct said deficiency, or
if thirty days have elapsed and grantee has not corrected the deficiency, the
city may request the engineer to demonstrate, at the grantee's cost, the
appropriate correction to the grantee. Grantee shall then have sixty days or
other reasonable time required as approved by the city to correct the
deficiency. If at the end of the approved time, the deficiency still has not
been corrected, the city shall have the option of assessing liquidated
damages in accordance with Section 13.12.245 for each and every day the

of a franchise shall be deemed to be the date the ordinance or resolution, as

and insurance policies specified herein, and his agreement to be bound by and
to comply with and to do all things required of him by the provisions of this
chapter and the franchise. Such acceptance and agreement shall be
acknowledged by the grantee before a notary public, and shall in form and
content be satisfactory to and approved by the city attorney.

13.12.212   Franchise renewal.



   A.   During the six-month period which begins with the thirty-sixth
month before the franchise expiration, the city may on its own initiative,
and shall at the request of the grantee, commence proceedings which afford
the public in the franchise area appropriate notice and participation for the
purpose of:



   1.   Identifying the future cable-related community needs and
interest; and



   2.   Reviewing the performance of the grantee under the franchise
during the then-current franchise terms.



   B.   Upon completion of a proceeding under subsection A of this
section, the grantee seeking renewal of a franchise may on its own initiative
or at the request of city submit a proposal for renewal. The request shall be
accompanied by both the application and fee as provided in Section 13.12.060
except to the extent that the city waives such provisions. In addition, such
request shall, at the minimum, specify the following:

existing franchise and applicable law, for the extension;



   2.   Number of years of the requested franchise extension;

   C.   Upon submittal by grantee of an application for renewal, the
city shall provide prompt public notice and during the four-month period
beginning on completion of the proceedings under subsection A of this
section, either renew the franchise or issue a preliminary assessment that
the franchise should not be renewed. In the event that the city should issue
such assessment and upon the request of grantee, the city shall initiate
administrative proceedings, after providing notice to the grantee and public
to consider whether the franchise should be renewed in accordance with this
section. Any determination by the council shall be based upon the grounds
stated in this chapter or other applicable law and shall be transmitted to
the grantee in writing within ten days following such determination.



   D.   A final decision and agreement between grantee and the city
shall be resolved at the earliest possible date, but in no event, later than
eighteen months prior to the expiration of the existing franchise. In the
event agreement is not concluded prior to that time, notice shall be given to
the grantee of the city's intent to reopen the franchise to interested
applicants. Nothing herein shall be construed to prevent the city in its sole
discretion from reopening the franchise to interested applicants.

   A.   Any franchise granted pursuant to this chapter shall be a
privilege to be held in personal trust by the original grantee. It cannot in
any event be sold, transferred, leased, assigned, hypothecated, or disposed
of in whole or in part, either by forced or involuntary sale, or by voluntary
sale, merger, consolidation, or otherwise, without the prior consent of the
council expressed by resolution, after receipt of any proposed contractual
documents, including the considerations and then only under such reasonable
conditions as may be prescribed in said resolution. Council consent shall not
be necessary for any transfer or assignment to an affiliated entity which
does not result in an actual change in ultimate control of the franchise;
provided, that council consent shall be required where there is a change in
control or ownership where a person or group of persons acting in concert
acquire more than fifty percent of the voting stock of the franchisee.
Council consent shall also not be necessary for a transfer in trust,
mortgage, pledge, or other hypothecation of less than twenty-five percent of
the market value of the property used in the conduct of the Signal Hill CATV
System, unless made to avoid or evade the other provisions of this chapter
affecting transfers.



   B.   Any transfer or assignment shall be made only by an instrument
in writing, a duly executed copy of which shall be filed in the office of the
city clerk within thirty days after any such transfer or assignment. The
consent of the council, when required by this section, shall not be
unreasonably refused; provided, however, the proposed assignee must submit an
application in accordance with Section 13.12.060 except to the extent that
the city waives such provisions. The fee for such application shall be one
thousand dollars. The proposed assignee shall show financial responsibility
and must agree to comply with all provisions of this chapter and of the
franchise agreement. Failure to comply with all provisions of this section
may result in termination of this franchise in accordance with Section
13.12.240.

ARTICLE VIII. MODIFICATION, REMOVAL AND ABANDONMENT OF FACILITIES



13.12.220   Removal and abandonment of property of grantee.



   A.   In the event that the use of any part of the CATV system is
discontinued for any reason for a continuous period of twelve months, or in
the event such a system or property has been installed in any street or
public place without complying with the requirements of grantee's franchise,
or this chapter, or in the event such system or property is determined by the
city engineer to threaten the public health, safety or general welfare, or
the franchise has been terminated, cancelled, revoked, or expired, the
grantee shall promptly, at grantee's sole expense, upon being given ten days'
notice, remove from the streets or public places all such property of such
system. The city engineer may permit such abandoned property to either be
abandoned in place or removed at the sole expense of the grantee. In the
event of such removal, the grantee shall promptly restore the street or other
area from which such property has been removed to a condition satisfactory to
the city engineer.



   B.   Any property of grantee which is not removed by grantee nor is
permitted by the city engineer to be abandoned in place may be removed by
city and grantee shall be liable for the expense of such removal and the
restoration of the street or other area from which such property has been
removed.



   C.   Any property of the grantee remaining in place sixty days after
the termination, cancellation, revocation, or expiration of the franchise
shall be considered permanently abandoned. The city engineer may extend such
time, not to exceed an additional thirty days.



   D.   Any property of the grantee to be abandoned in place shall be
abandoned in such manner as the city engineer shall prescribe. Upon permanent
abandonment of the property of the grantee in place, the property shall, if
accepted by city become that of the city, and the grantee shall submit to the
city engineer such written instruments in the form required by the city
attorney, transferring to the city the ownership of such property, except as
may be included within the provisions of any utility joint use attachment
agreements.



(Ord. 85-07-950 § 1 (part))



13.12.230   Changes required by public improvements.



   The grantee shall, from time to time protect, support, dislocate,
temporarily or permanently, as may be required, remove or relocate, without
expense to the city or any other governmental entity, any facilities
installed, used, and maintained under the franchise, if and when made
necessary by any lawful change of grade, alignment, or width of any public
street, including the construction of any subway or viaduct, water, sewer, or
storm drain lines by the city or any other governmental entity and including
when any underground utility district is formed, or made necessary by any
other public improvement or alteration in, under, on, upon, or about any
public street or other public property, whether such public improvements or
alteration be at the insistence of the city or another governmental entity,
and whether such improvement or alteration is for a government or proprietary
function, or made necessary by traffic conditions, public safety, street
vacation, or any other public project or purpose of city or any other
governmental entity. The decision of the city engineer under this section
shall be final and binding upon grantee.



(Ord. 85-07-950 § 1 (part))



ARTICLE IX. VIOLATIONS, REMEDIES AND PENALTIES



13.12.240   Procedure to establish violation.



   A.   In the event of the failure, refusal, or neglect by grantee to
do or comply with any material requirement or limitation contained in this
chapter or the franchise agreement or any material rule or regulation of the
council or city manager validly adopted pursuant to this chapter or the
franchise agreement, (herein "violation"), the city, in its sole discretion
and, provided that the city complies with the procedures set forth in this
section, may impose any of the remedies provided in Section 13.12.245.



   B.   If the city manager determines that a violation exists, the
city manager shall serve a written notice on grantee specifying the nature of
the violation, any proposed corrective action, the period of time permitted
to cure the violation, and any remedies or penalties to be imposed if the
violation is not cured. The grantee may respond in writing to the city
manager seeking reconsideration of the determination or any extension of time
to cure the violation, or may in writing appeal the city manager's
determination to the city council, except that any determination in which the
city manager proposes to terminate the franchise shall go automatically to
the city council for consideration. The city manager's determination shall be
deemed final unless the violation is cured within thirty days after the date
grantee receives notice of the determination, or such longer time as may be
specified in the notice or any extension of such time as may be granted by
the city manager, unless an appeal is taken to the city council. Once the
determination becomes effective, the city manager may impose the remedies or
damages specified in the determination.



   C.   Any appeal of a determination by the city manager shall be
placed by the city clerk in the city council's next regular agenda. The city
council shall determine whether to hear such appeal and whether a public
hearing should be held for such purpose, provided that in the event
termination of the franchise is proposed, the council shall set the matter
for a public hearing. The grantee shall be given ten days' written notice of
the time the council will consider any appeal. In the event of a public
hearing, at least ten days' prior notice shall be published in a newspaper of
general circulation, and the council may compel grantee, at grantee's
expense, to send a special written notice to any or all subscribers.



   D.   At the time set for the hearing, the council shall hear any
persons interested therein, and shall determine, in its discretion, whether:



   1.   The violation existed;



   2.   The violation was excused by just cause;



   3.   The violation has been cured;



   4.   The period to cure the violation is adequate;



   5.   The grantee has shown good faith;



   6.   The remedies or damages are appropriate. The council, after
determining the foregoing, shall make such order as they deem appropriate to
cure the violation and prevent reoccurrence of such violations. The order
shall be in writing, contain appropriate findings, and be served on grantee.
The order of the council shall be final.



   E.   The termination and forfeiture of any franchise shall in no way
affect any of the rights of the city under the franchise or any provisions of
law.



(Ord. 85-07-950 § 1 (part))



13.12.245   Remedies and damages.



   In the event that, pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section
13.12.240, a final determination is rendered that a violation existed or
exists, then any one or more of the remedies contained within this section
may be imposed by the city manager or council as the case may be. The
determination of the severity of the remedy shall be based upon the severity
of the violation. The remedies shall be as follows:



   A.   Liquidated damages may be imposed in an amount not exceeding
five hundred dollars per day, in particular for failure by the grantee to
commence or complete construction, commence service, or to correct
deficiencies in performance pursuant to Sections 13.12.080 and 13.12.125;



   B.   Shortening the term of the franchise by one day for each day
the violation exists;



   C.   Criminal prosecution for a misdemeanor;



   D.   Forfeiture of the performance bond or other security pursuant
to Section 13.12.090;



   E.   In the event any subscriber fails to receive services as
prescribed by this chapter or the franchise agreement, reimbursement to the
subscriber of their monthly charges prorated for the period the violation
continues;



   F.   Termination of the franchise and franchise agreement prior to
the expiration of the term. In the event of termination for cause, the city
shall have the right to acquire the CATV system at an equitable price,
pursuant to Section 13.12.285;



   G.   If there exists any holding over after expiration of any
franchise granted hereunder, without the prior consent of the city, expressed
by resolution, the grantee shall pay to the city reasonable compensation and
damages, of not less than one hundred percent of its gross revenue during
said period;



   H.   City or its agents may enter upon grantee's property, correct
the violation, and hold grantee liable for the expense thereof;



   I.   Any other remedy or action permitted by law.



(Ord. 85-07-950 § 1 (part))



13.12.250   Other violations.



   A.   From and after the effective date of the ordinance codified in
this chapter, it is unlawful for any person to construct, install, or
maintain within any public street in the city, or within any other public
property of the city, or within any privately owned area within the city
which has not yet become a public street but is designated or delineated as a
proposed public street on an adopted general plan of arterial highways or on
any tentative subdivision map approved by the city, any equipment or
facilities for distributing any television signals or radio signals through a
cable television communications system, unless a franchise authorizing such
use of such street or property or area has first been obtained pursuant to
the provisions of this chapter, and unless such franchise is in full force
and effect.



   B.   It is unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to make any
unauthorized connection, whether physically, electrically, acoustically,
inductively or otherwise, with any part of a franchised cable communication
system within this city for the purpose of taking or receiving television
signals, radio signals, pictures, programs, or sound.



   C.   It is unlawful for any person, firm, or corporation to make any
unauthorized connection, whether physically, electrically, acoustically,
inductively, or otherwise, with any part of a franchised cable communication
system within this city for the purpose of enabling himself or others to
receive any television, radio signal, picture, program, or sound, without
payment to the owner of said system.



   D.   It is unlawful for any person, without the consent of the
owner, to wilfully tamper with, remove, or injure any cables, wires, or
equipment used for distribution of television signals, radio signals,
pictures, programs, or sound.



   E.   A violation of the foregoing subsections A, B, C or D of this
section shall constitute a misdemeanor and be punishable by imprisonment in
the county jail not exceeding six months, and/or by a fine not exceeding five
hundred dollars for each and every offense.

ARTICLE X. MISCELLANEOUS SECTIONS



13.12.260   Inspection of property and records.



   A.   At all reasonable times, and with reasonable notice, the
grantee shall permit any duly authorized representative of the city to
examine all property of the grantee, together with any appurtenant property
of the grantee situated within or without the city, and to examine and
transcribe any and all maps and other records kept or maintained by the
grantee or under its control which deal with the operations, affairs,
transactions, or property of the grantee with respect to its franchise,
except for that subscriber demographic data protected under Section 13.12.180
of this chapter. If any such maps or records are not kept in the city, or
upon reasonable request made available in the city, and if the city council
determines that an examination thereof is necessary or appropriate, then all
travel and maintenance expense necessarily incurred in making such
examination shall be paid by the grantee.



   B.   The grantee shall prepare and furnish to the city manager at
the time and in the form prescribed by said officer, such reports with
respect to its operations, affairs, transactions, or property as may be
reasonably necessary or appropriate to the performance of any of the rights,
functions, or duties of the city or any of its officers in connection with
the franchise.



   C.   The grantee shall at all times make and keep in the local
business office (Section 13.12.195) full and complete plans and records,

   D.   City shall keep all proprietary records of grantee confidential
to the extent permitted by the California Public Records Act.



(Ord. 85-07-950 § 1 (part))



13.12.270   Limitations of franchise.



   A.   No privilege or exemption shall be granted or conferred by any
franchise granted under this chapter except those specifically prescribed
herein.



   B.   Any privilege claimed under any such franchise by the grantee
in any public street or other public property shall be subordinate to any
prior or subsequent lawful occupancy or use thereof by the city or any other
governmental entity and shall be subordinate to any easements therein,
whether created prior or subsequent to the granting of any franchise
hereunder.



   C.   The grantee shall not be relieved of his obligation to comply
promptly with any of the provisions of this chapter or by any failure of the
city to enforce prompt compliance.



   D.   Any right or power in, or duty impressed upon, any officer,
employee, department, or board of the city shall be subject to transfer by
the city to any other officer, employee, department, or board of the city.



   E.   The grantee shall have no recourse whatsoever against the city
for any loss, cost, expense, or damage arising out of any provision or
requirement of this chapter or of any franchise issued hereunder or because
of its enforcement.



   F.   The grantee shall be subject to all requirements by city
ordinances, rules, regulations, and specifications heretofore or hereafter
enacted or established, and shall comply with all applicable state and
federal laws and regulations heretofore or hereafter enacted or established.



   G.   Any such franchise granted shall not relieve the grantee of any
obligation involved in obtaining pole space from any department of the city,
utility company, or from others maintaining poles in streets.



   H.   Any franchise granted hereunder shall be in lieu of any and all
other rights, privileges, powers, immunities, and authorities owned,
possessed, controlled, or exercisable by grantee, or any successor to any
interest of grantee, of or pertaining to the construction, operation, or
maintenance of any cable communications system in the city; and the
acceptance of any franchise hereunder shall operate, as between grantee and
the city as an abandonment of any and all of such rights, privileges, powers,
immunities, and authorities within the city, to the effect that, as between
grantee and the city any and all construction, operation, and maintenance by
any grantee of any cable communication system in the city shall be, and shall
be deemed and construed in all instances and respects to be, under and
pursuant to said franchise, and not under or pursuant to any other right,
privilege, power, immunity, or authority whatsoever.



(Ord. 85-07-950 § 1 (part))



13.12.280   Rights reserved to the city.



   A.   There is reserved to the city every right and power which is
required to be herein reserved or provided by any ordinance of the city, and
the grantee, by acceptance of any franchise, agrees to be bound thereby and
to comply with any action or requirements of the city in its exercise of such
rights or power, heretofore or hereafter enacted or established.



   B.   Consistent with the rights and obligations set forth herein,
and pursuant to its lawful exercise of the police power, there is reserved to
the city the power to amend any section or part of this chapter so as to
require additional or greater standards of construction, operation,
maintenance, level of service, or otherwise, on the part of the grantee, when
such action can be shown to be in the public's safety and/or welfare.



   C.   Neither the granting of any franchise nor any provision hereof
shall constitute a waiver or bar to the exercise of any governmental right or
power of the city, now existing or hereafter granted.



   D.   The council may do all things which are necessary and
convenient in the exercise of its jurisdiction under this chapter and may
determine any question of fact which may arise during the existence of any
franchise granted hereunder; provided, however, that nothing herein shall
limit any party's right to seek a judicial determination of any claim or
controversy prior to or following any determination made by the city council.
The city manager and/or his designee, is authorized and empowered to provide
day-to-day administration and enforcement of the provisions of the franchise.



   E.   All notices which city may give to grantee or which grantee may
give to city shall be given in writing and shall be delivered personally or
by certified mail, return receipt requested, addressed to grantee's most
recent address on file with the city, and addressed to the city at the
official city hall address. Such notices, so sent by mail, shall be deemed
given five days after deposit in the United States Postal Service if so
deposited in Los Angeles County; otherwise they shall be deemed given upon
receipt.



(Ord. 85-07-950 § 1 (part))



13.12.285   Right of city to acquire.



   A.   Nothing herein shall be deemed or construed to impair or
affect, in any way, to any extent, the right of the city to acquire the
property of the grantee, either by purchase or through the exercise of the
right of eminent domain, at fair market value determined on the basis of the
cable system valued as a going concern, but with no value allocated to any
amounts expended to obtain the franchise, or any value allocated to the
franchise itself, and nothing herein contained shall be construed to contract
away or to modify or abridge, either for a term or in perpetuity, the city's
right of eminent domain.



   B.   In the event the city wishes to acquire part or all of the
cable communications system either by purchase or through the exercise of the
right of eminent domain, city and grantee will each appoint one appraiser to
establish the value of the system to be acquired by city. The two appraisers
will select a third appraiser who will be chairman of the appraisal board.
The board will, by majority vote, determine the value of the system to be
acquired by the city. This value will be final and binding on both city and
grantee and will be used as the purchase price for just compensation in any
purchase by the city or eminent domain proceeding between city and grantee.



   C.   In the event grantee receives an offer to acquire the CATV
system from any person or entity other than the city, grantee shall comply
with the procedure herein before such offer may be accepted by grantee.
Grantee shall transmit the offer to city, including all material terms and
conditions thereof. If city makes an equivalent or better offer within
forty-five days of receipt of original offer, then grantee shall convey the
CATV system to city upon said terms and conditions, but if the city fails to
make such offer, then grantee shall have ninety days to enter into an
agreement with the original offeror. In the event such agreement is not
entered into within ninety days, or in the event the offer is significantly
revised in favor of grantee, or in the event a new offer is received from
another offeror, no agreement may be made for conveyance of the CATV system
without first providing the city with the right of first refusal as provided
herein. Any agreement entered into in violation of this section shall be void
and shall be grounds for termination of the franchise by city.



   D.   The provisions of this section governing the city's right to
acquire the CATV system may be modified or supplemented by the franchise
agreement, and in the event of any inconsistency between the provisions of
this section and the agreement, the provisions of the agreement shall govern.



   E.   In the event of purchase by the city, or a change of grantee,
the current grantee shall cooperate with the city, or with a representative
appointed by the city, to operate the system for such period as may be
necessary to obtain a new operator and to maintain continuity of service.



(Ord. 85-07-950 § 1 (part))



13.12.290   Uses permitted to grantee.



   Any franchise granted pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall
authorize and permit the grantee to engage in the business of operating and
providing a cable communications system in the city, and for that purpose to
install, erect, construct, repair, replace, reconstruct, maintain, and retain
in, on, under, upon, across and along any public street, such wires, cables,
conductors, conduits, ducts, vaults, manholes, amplifiers, appliances,
attachments, and other property as may be necessary and appurtenant to the
cable communications system; and, in addition, so to use, operate, and
provide similar facilities or properties rented or leased from other persons,
firms, or corporations, including but not limited to any public utility or
other grantee franchised or permitted to, do business in the city.



(Ord. 85-07-950 § 1 (part))



13.12.300   No impairments of contract.



   Pursuant to Section 53066.1(p) of the California Government Code,
neither the city nor any grantee shall be entitled, with respect to any
franchise agreement, to raise the defense of impairment of contract in any
case where the due and proper exercise of police power, or the limits
thereof, is at issue.

prevented by installation of non-erosive down drains, riprap, energy
dissipaters or other approved devices including a return of flow to a natural
sheet flow condition provided the potential effects of greater volume than
existing conditions generated are accounted for. Where surface waters are to
be conveyed or directed onto adjacent property in an unnatural manner, the
applicant shall be required, prior to issuance of a grading permit, to obtain
a drainage easement from the owner of said property. This easement shall be
recorded. There shall be a drainage gradient of two percent (2%) from the
building pad toward an approved drainage facility.



   Section J109.4 Interceptor drains. Paved interceptor drains shall be

including any provisions of any code adopted by this chapter, or shall fail
to comply with any of the requirements thereof, or who shall erect, install,
alter, repair, or do work in violation of the approved construction documents
or directive of the fire code official, or of a permit or certificate used
under provisions of this code, shall be guilty of a misdemeanor unless such
violation is declared to be an infraction by Chapter 82 of the 2017 County of
Los Angeles Fire Code, punishable by a fine of not more than one thousand
dollars or by imprisonment not exceeding six months, or both such fine and
imprisonment. Each day that a violation continues after due notice has been
served shall be deemed a separate offense. For the purposes of this section,
a forfeiture of bail shall be equivalent to a conviction.



   B.   In addition to the imposition of penalties herein described,
the fire code official is authorized to institute appropriate action to
prevent unlawful construction or to restrain, correct, or abate a violation;
or to prevent illegal occupancy of a structure or premises; or to stop an
illegal act, conduct of business, or occupancy of a structure on or about any
premises. The owner of any parcel upon which a nuisance is found to exist
may, as provided for by state, county, and local law, be liable for all costs
of abatement of the nuisance.



   C.   Any person: (1) who negligently, or in violation of the law,
sets a fire, allows a fire to be set, or allows a fire kindled or attended by
him to escape onto any public or private property; (2) other than a
mortgagee, who, being in actual possession of a structure, fails or refuses
to correct, within the time allotted for correction, despite having the right
to do so, a fire hazard prohibited by law, for which a public agency properly
has issued a notice of violation respecting the hazard; or (3) including a
mortgagee, who, having an obligation under other provisions of law to correct
a fire hazard prohibited by law, for which a public agency has properly
issued a notice of violation respecting the hazard, fails or refuses to
correct the hazard within the time allotted for correction, despite having
the right to do so, is liable for the fire suppression costs incurred in
fighting the fire, for the cost of providing rescue or emergency medical
services, for the cost of investigating and making any reports with respect
to the fire, and for the costs relating to accounting for that fire and the
collection of any funds pursuant to state or local law, including but not
limited to, administrative costs of operating a fire suppression cost
recovery program to the fullest extent authorized by law. All of these costs
shall be a charge against that person, shall constitute a debt of that
person, and is collectible by the federal, state, county, public, or private
agency, incurring those costs in the same manner as in the case of an
obligation under a contract, expressed or implied.



   D.   All expenses of an emergency response necessary to protect the

15.24.060   Permit--Grounds for denial--Issuance terms.



   A.   No permit shall be issued to move and relocate any building or
structure within the city which is so constructed or in such condition as to
be dangerous; or which is infested with pests or is unsanitary; or which, if
it is a dwelling or habitation, is unfit for human habitation; or which is so
dilapidated, defective, unsightly or is in such a condition of deterioration
or disrepair that its location at the proposed site would cause appreciable
harm to or be materially detrimental to the property or improvements on both
sides of the street within three hundred feet of the proposed location; or if
the proposed use is prohibited by the zoning laws of the city; or if the
structure is of a type otherwise prohibited at the proposed location by any
other law or ordinance; or if the proposed moving or relocation would violate
any other law or code or violate or disturb the public safety, welfare or
peace.



   B.   If the condition of the building or structure, in the
reasonable judgment of the building inspector, admits of practical and
effective repair and its proposed moving or relocation does not violate any
law or ordinance, the inspector may issue a permit for such moving and
relocation upon condition as provided in this chapter and complying with
other provisions of this chapter. The building inspector shall, in granting
any permit, impose thereon such terms and conditions as he may deem
reasonable and proper, including, but not limited to, the requirements of
changes, alterations, additions, or repairs to be made to or upon the
building or structures, set forth in Section 15.24.040 to the end that the
moving or relocation thereof will not be materially detrimental or injurious
to public safety or to public welfare or to the property and improvements, or
either, in the area, as limited in this section, to which it is to be moved.



   C.   The terms and conditions upon which any permit may be granted
shall be written upon the permit or attached in writing thereto.

   A.   Upon receiving an application for a permit to move a building,
the building inspector shall make an examination of the building described in
the application and shall examine the proposed location.



   B.   If it is found that no ordinance or law will be violated and
that the public welfare, safety, or peace will not be endangered, he shall
cause a notice to be posted on the front and rear of the lot or land to which
it is proposed to move the building and shall cause a similar notice to be
posted on the front of the building which is desired to be moved. Such
notices shall bear a title in letters not less than three inches in height
consisting of the words "Moving Notice." Said notices shall also state the
location of the house by street and number, and the location of the lot or
land to which it is proposed to move said building, together with the name of
the applicant. Each of said notices shall be so placed that the bottom
thereof shall be not less than four feet above the ground. All notices shall
be placed not more than ten feet from the front and rear lines of the lot or
land to which the building is to be moved. All signs shall face outward from
the lot or property. Should the building which is proposed to be moved be
located more than ten feet back from the property line, the notice shall be
posted not more than ten feet back from the property line as well as upon the
building proposed to be moved.



   C.   If upon the examination of the building, it is found by the
building inspector to be constructed or in such condition to be dangerous; or
is infested with pests or is unsanitary; or which is so dilapidated,
defective, unsightly or in such condition of deterioration or disrepair that
its location at the proposed site would cause appreciable harm to or be
materially detrimental to the property and improvement in the neighborhood,
the application for a moving permit shall be denied by the building inspector.

   A.   Anything in this chapter to the contrary notwithstanding, no
housemoving permit shall be issued unless the applicant therefor shall first
post with the building inspector a bond executed by the owner of the premises
where the building or structure is to be located, as principal, and by a
surety company authorized to do business in this state, as surety. Such bond
shall be subject to the approval of the city attorney as to form and, in the
event of such approval, shall be filed with the building inspector.



   B.   The bond, which shall be in form joint and several, shall name
the city as obligee, and shall be in an amount equal to twice the cost of the
work required to be done in order to comply with all of the conditions of the
housemoving permit, as estimated by the building inspector, and not less than
two thousand five hundred dollars.



   C.   In lieu of a surety bond, the applicant may post a bond
executed by the owner, as principal, which is secured by a deposit of cash in
the amount named in subsection B of this section and conditioned as required
in the case of a surety bond. Such a bond as so executed is called a "cash
bond" for the purpose of this section.



(Prior code § 14.24.060(A) (Ord. 387 § 6(a), 1954))



15.24.110   Bond--Conditions.



   A.   Every bond posted pursuant to this chapter shall be conditioned
as follows:



   1.   That each and all of the terms and conditions of the
housemoving permit shall be complied with to the satisfaction of the building
inspector;



   2.   That all of the work required to be done pursuant to the terms
and conditions of the housemoving permit shall be fully performed and
completed within ninety days after the date of the issuance by the building
inspector of the housemoving permit. The time limit specified in this section
or the time limit specified in any permit, may be extended for good and
sufficient cause by the building inspector.



   B.   No such extension of time shall be valid unless written and no
such extension shall release any surety upon any bond.



(Prior code § 14.24.060(B) (Ord. 387 § 6(b), 1954))



15.24.120   Bond--Defaults.



   A.   Whenever the building inspector finds that a default has
occurred in the performance of any term or condition of any permit, written
notice thereof shall be given to the principal and to the surety on the bond.
Such notice shall state the work to be done, the estimated cost thereof and
the period of time deemed by the building inspector to be reasonably
necessary for the completion of such work.



   B.   After receipt of such notice the surety must, within the time
therein specified, either cause the required work to be performed or, failing
therein, must pay over to the building inspector twice the estimated cost of
doing the work, as set forth in the notice. Upon the receipt of such money,
the city shall proceed, by such mode as it deems convenient to cause the
required work to be performed and completed, but no liability shall be
incurred therein other than for the expenditure of the sum of money in hand
therefor.



   C.   If a cash bond has been posted, notice of default as provided
in subsection A of this section shall be given to the principal and, if
compliance is not had within the time specified, the city shall proceed
without delay and without further notice of proceedings whatever, to use the
cash deposit, or any portion of such deposit, to cause the required work to
be done, by contract or otherwise, in the discretion of the city. The
balance, if any, of such cash deposit shall, upon the completion of the work,
be returned to the depositor or to his successors or assigns after deducting
the cost of the work, plus twenty-five percent to cover cost of supervision
and direction of work of completion.



   D.   When any default has occurred on the part of the principal
under the preceding provisions of this section, the surety shall have the
option, in lieu of completing the work required, to demolish the building or
structure, and to clear, clean and restore the site within ninety days of the
default. If the surety defaults, the city shall have the same option.



(Prior code § 14.24.060(C), (D) (Ord. 387 § 6(c), (d), 1954))



15.24.130   Bond--Term.



   The term of each bond posted pursuant to this chapter shall begin upon
the date of the posting thereof and shall end upon the completion, to the
satisfaction of the building inspector, of the performance of all the terms
and conditions of the housemoving permit. Such completion shall be evidenced
by a statement thereof, signed by the building inspector, a copy of which
will be sent to any surety or principal upon request. When a cash bond has
been posted, the cash shall be returned to the depositor, or to his
successors or assigns, upon the termination of the bond, except any portion
thereof that may have been used or deducted as provided in this chapter.

   A.   The building inspector, any member of the city council, the
surety, and the duly authorized representatives of either, shall have access
to the premises described in the housemoving permit for the purpose of
inspecting the progress of the work.



   B.   In the event of any default in the performance of any term or
condition of the housemoving permit with reference to the relocation of a
structure, the surety or any person employed or engaged on its behalf, or the
building inspector or any person employed or engaged on his behalf, or any

the Oil Services Coordinator and submitted for review by the city’s
Petroleum Engineer. The report shall include an assessment which is based on
the DOGGR well bore data and well history including all correspondence with
DOGGR regarding all abandonment proceedings. The assessment shall state
whether each well meets, or does not meet, the City’s equivalency standard
pursuant to Section 16.24.070.



   a.   If a well is determined not to meet the city’s equivalency
standard, a reabandonment plan shall be submitted to the Oil Services
Coordinator and shall include a copy of the DOGGR well bore data, well
history and an assessment statement that following reabandonment, the
abandoned well is likely to meet the city’s equivalency standard pursuant
to Section 16.24.070.



   b.   If the well is determined to meet the city’s equivalency
standard the applicant shall submit the DOGGR documentation used to make the
determination, including a copy of the DOGGR well bore data, well history and
DOGGR confirmation of completion of the abandonment work.



   4.   An abandonment activities plan that details the estimated hours
of operation, number of workers, structures proposed for decommissioning,
projected method and routes of transporting equipment, structures, and
estimated debris from the property to the place of disposition as well as the

   7.   A restoration plan pursuant to Section 16.24.090 that details
grading, drainage and measures proposed to prevent or reduce nuisance effects
(e.g., dust, fumes, glare, noise, odor, smoke, traffic congestion, vibration)
and to prevent danger to life and property, including a list of any other
permits, as may be required for restoration pursuant to Title 15 of the city
code.



   8.   Any other information deemed reasonably necessary by the Oil
Services Coordinator to address site-specific factors.



   D.   City assessment letter. The city’s Petroleum Engineer shall
review the equivalency standard assessment report and provide an assessment
letter and a recommendation to the Oil Services Coordinator confirming
whether the wells meet, do not meet, or if a reabandonment plan is required,
are likely to meet the city’s equivalency standard pursuant to Section
16.24.070.



   E.   City summary report. Following receipt of the assessment letter
from the city’s Petroleum Engineer, the Oil Services Coordinator shall
prepare a summary report for the well assessments and, for each well marked
“no access & methane mitigation required” on the well access exhibit,
providing one of the following determinations:



   1.   For wells that meet the city’s equivalency standard, a
finding that “no additional work is required” shall be made and a
determination that the project may proceed with site plan and design review
pursuant to Chapter 20.52.



   2.   For wells that do not meet the city’s equivalency standard,
but are confirmed as likely to meet the standard, the Oil Services
Coordinator shall make a finding that reabandonment shall proceed and shall
issue a permit for proposed well abandonments pursuant to Section 16.24.090.
Following completion of reabandonments the property owner or responsible
party shall submit well bore data and well history, including all
correspondence with DOGGR regarding abandonment proceedings and any field
changes with an assessment from the applicant’s registered petroleum
engineer, registered petroleum geologist, or a professional with the
equivalent of these registrations as determined by the Oil Services
Coordinator that the abandonment meets the city’s equivalency standard. The
Oil Services Coordinator shall make a finding that the abandonment meets the
city’s equivalency standard and that “no additional work is required”
and the project may proceed with site plan and design review pursuant to
Chapter 20.52.



   3.   If the applicant does not wish to complete the abandonments for
wells qualified as described in subparagraph 2 above, the Oil Services
Coordinator shall make a finding that an “at risk” letter is required.
The letter from the applicant shall acknowledge that the success or failure
to complete well abandonments in compliance with the city’s equivalency
standard will determine whether wells may be built over or in close proximity
to. Further, the letter shall state that it is understood that failure to
abandon wells to the city’s equivalency standard will prohibit development
over or in close proximity to the wells resulting in revisions to the site
plan and potentially additional site plan and design review pursuant to
Chapter 20.52. Following receipt of the “at risk” letter, the Oil
Services Coordinator shall make a finding that “reabandonment work is
required and an ‘at risk’ letter has been provided” and the project may
proceed with site plan and design review pursuant to Chapter 20.52.



   4.   City abandonment and restoration permit. All abandonments and
reabandonments shall require a city abandonment and restoration permit issued
by the Oil Services Coordinator pursuant to Section 16.24.090.



   a.   Field modifications. It is the obligation of the property owner
or responsible party to notify the Oil Services Coordinator prior to any
changes made in the field to the abandonment plan. The applicant’s
registered petroleum engineer, registered petroleum geologist, or a
professional with the equivalent of these registrations as determined by the
Oil Services Coordinator shall provide a revised assessment report with a
determination that the final abandonment with intended field changes meets,
or does not meet the city’s equivalency standard.



   b.   Verification of abandonment. Following completion of any
abandonment work, the applicant shall submit all available DOGGR well bore
data and well history including all correspondence with DOGGR regarding
abandonment proceedings and any field changes from the initial abandonment
plan with an assessment from the applicant’s registered petroleum engineer,
registered petroleum geologist, or a professional with the equivalent of
these registrations as determined by the Oil Services Coordinator that each
well meets, or does not meet, the city’s equivalency standard pursuant to
Section 16.24.070. The Oil Services Coordinator shall verify that
abandonments for wells proposed to be built over or marked as “no access”
pursuant to Section 16.24.050(B), meet the city’s equivalency standard
prior to issuing a final of the permit. Any well that does not meet the
standard shall not be built over or in close proximity to “Improvements”
pursuant to Section 16.24.070.



(Ord. 2015-05-1475 § 8)



16.24.070   Abandonment equivalency standard.



   A.   Determination of equivalency standard. Improvements proposed
over or within close proximity to abandoned wells, shall not be permitted
unless the Oil Services Coordinator has determined that the well has been
abandoned to the city’s equivalency standard.



   1.   Improvements are considered permanent structures or other
construction that would be difficult or expensive to demolish should the
abandoned or reabandoned well leak oil or gas in the future.



   2.   Pervious improvements, such as landscaping and parking areas
with adequate landscape buffers, may be located on top of a previously



abandoned or reabandoned well which has passed the leak test pursuant to
Section 16.24.020.



   B.   Equivalency standard. The following equivalency standard shall
be required for construction of improvements over abandoned wells or within
close proximity of abandoned wells pursuant to Section 16.24.050(B):



   1.   A cement plug located at the depth of the last zone produced
from the well. All perforations shall be plugged with cement, and the plug
shall extend at least 100 feet above the top of a landed liner, the uppermost
perforations, the casing cementing point, the water shut-off holes, or the
oil or gas zone, whichever is higher. If wellbore conditions prevent
placement of the plug at the depth of the last zone produced from the well,
approximately 100 feet of cement shall be placed inside and outside of the
casing above (but as close as possible to) the last zone produced from the
well.



   2.   A cement plug located at the depth of the base of the fresh
water zone in the well. If there is cement behind the casing across the
fresh-saltwater interface, a 100 foot cement plug shall be placed inside the
casing across the interface. If the top of the cement behind the casing is
below the top of the highest saltwater sands, squeeze-cementing shall be
required through perforations to protect the freshwater deposits. In
addition, a 100 foot cement plug shall be placed inside the casing across the
fresh-saltwater interface. If wellbore conditions prevent placement of the
plug at the depth of the base of the fresh water zone in the well,
approximately 100 feet of cement shall be placed inside and outside of the
casing above (but as close as possible to) the base of the fresh water zone
in the well. This plug is to be separate and apart from the plug referenced
in subparagraph 1 above.



   3.   A cement plug located at the surface. The hole and all annuli
shall be plugged at the surface with a cement plug extending at least 25 feet
from the top of the cut off well casing.



   4.   The intent of these plugs is to ensure that the abandonment is
adequate to prevent hydrocarbons from reaching the surface. One continuous
plug that significantly exceeds 100 feet located below the surface plug and
located in close proximity to the base of the fresh water zone could be
adequate to meet (1) and (2). Also, one plug that meets either (1) or (2) and
a surface plug that significantly exceeds 100 feet could be found to prevent
hydrocarbons from reaching the surface.



   5.   The city’s consulting petroleum engineer shall determine if
these conditions have been met and the abandonment is adequate to prevent
hydrocarbons from reaching the surface of the well. The determination shall
be based on, at a minimum, a review of a history of all work performed on the
well and a detailed wellbore diagram showing the current condition of the
well. The well bore diagram shall include details on:



   a.   Hole size.



   b.   Casing and liner specifications and setting depths.



   c.   All cementing operations.



   d.   Depths of various hydrocarbon zones.



   e.   Any other data required to analyze the current conditions of
the well including casing recovery operations and the presence of junk in the
hole.



(Ord. 2015-05-1475 § 8)



16.24.080   Methane assessment and mitigation standards.



   A.   Assessment requirements. The area of development on all
properties in the city, whether or not they contain abandoned wells, shall be
tested for methane gas prior to issuance of construction or development
permits unless otherwise approved by the Oil Services Coordinator. In no case
shall methane testing of the property be conducted less than 30 days after
site disturbance.



   B.   Permit. A methane site test permit is required on all
development sites where construction permits are required, whether or not
there are wells located within the area of development. No methane tests
shall be conducted without a permit issued by the Oil Services Coordinator.



   C.   Site assessment. A Site Methane Assessment is required for any
property proposed for development. The assessment shall be conducted to the
satisfaction of the Oil Services Coordinator and in accordance with the
city’s “methane assessment minimum requirements standard” on file in
the Community Development Department and publicly available. The assessment
report shall be signed and stamped by a State of California registered
geologist and submitted for review to the Oil Services Coordinator prior to
any mitigation activity, if required, on the property. Methane assessment
shall be conducted no less than 30 days following any soils disturbance on
the site.



   D.   Mitigation plan. If the methane site assessment requires
mitigation, or if the well access exhibit is labeled “no access & methane
mitigation required”, a methane mitigation plan shall be prepared in
accordance with the city’s “methane mitigation minimum requirements
standard” on file in the Community Development Department and publicly
available and submitted for review and approval by the Oil Services
Coordinator prior to commencement of any mitigation work on site.



   E.   Letter of intent. For properties subject to site plan and
design review, pursuant to Chapter 20.52, if the applicant does not wish to
complete the methane assessment and mitigation, if required prior to site
plan and design review, the Oil Services Coordinator shall require that a
letter of intent be submitted by the applicant stating their intent to
conduct the property methane assessment and submit a mitigation plan, if
required, as a condition of the site plan and design review.



(Ord. 2015-05-1475 § 8)



16.24.090   Abandonment and restoration standards.



   A.   Permit requirements. A well abandonment and restoration permit
shall be required for all properties in the city where a well abandonment
permit is required whether or not the property is to be developed following
the abandonment, or if development is proposed on a property with abandoned
wells and a well abandonment report is not required pursuant to Section
16.24.060. The permit shall be issued following approval of the prerequisites
to site plan and design review pursuant to Section 16.24.020.



   B.   Restoration requirements. A well shall be considered properly
abandoned for purposes of this chapter after restoration of the drill site or
oil operation site and subsurface thereof to its original condition, as
nearly as practical, and in conformity with the following requirements:



   1.   A copy of the abandonment plan submitted to DOGGR and DOGGR and
authorization to abandon, reabandon or remediate the well is provided;



   2.   All equipment and surface installations used in connection with
the well which are not necessary as determined by the Oil Services
Coordinator for the operation or maintenance of other wells of operator or
permittee on the drill or operation site shall be removed from the premises;



   3.   The premises, all sumps, cellars, and ditches which are not
necessary for the operation or maintenance of other wells of operator or
permittee on the site shall be cleaned out and all oil, oil residue, drilling
fluid, and rubbish shall be removed or bioremediated to reduce hydrocarbons
to standards acceptable to federal, state, or local agencies. All sumps,
cellars, and ditches shall be leveled or filled. Where such sumps, cellars,
and ditches are lined with concrete, permittee or operator shall cause the
walls and bottoms to be broken up and all concrete shall be removed;



   4.   The premises shall be cleaned and graded and left in a clean
and neat condition free of oil, rotary mud, oil-soaked earth, asphalt, tar,
concrete, litter, and debris and any facilities to remain shall be painted
and maintained reasonably free of rust, oil, or stains, to the satisfaction
of the Oil Services Coordinator;



   5.   NPDES standards for stormwater run-off and dust and erosion
mitigation measures shall be complied with, to the satisfaction of the City
Engineer and the Oil Services Coordinator; and



   6.   All public streets, alleys, sidewalks, curbs and gutters, and
other places constituting public property which may have been disturbed or
damaged in connection with any operation, including operations for the
abandonment of the well, shall be cleaned, and, except for ordinary wear and
tear, shall be repaired and restored to substantially the same condition
thereof as the same existed at the time of issuance of the permit, or at the
time operations were first commenced in connection with the drilling,
operation, or maintenance of the well.



   C.   CC&Rs. Prior to issuance of any certificate of occupancy for
developments constructed over abandoned wells, or for abandoned wells marked
“no access” pursuant to Section 16.24.050(B), the property owner shall
record a declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions (CC&Rs), in a
form subject to the review and approval of the City Attorney, putting future
owners and occupants on notice of the following: the existence of abandoned
wells on the site; that the wells within the area of development have been
leak tested and found not to leak; description of any methane mitigation
measures employed; disclosure that access to these wells has been provided to
address the fact that they may leak in the future causing potential harm;
acknowledgment that the state may order the reabandonment of any well should
it leak in the future; acknowledgment that the state does not recommend
building over wells; and releasing and indemnifying the city for issuing
project permits.



   D.   DOGGR authority. Nothing herein is intended to displace any
authority of DOGGR under Chapters 2, 3 and 4 of Division 2 of Title 14 of the
California Code of Regulations or set aside or annul any action of DOGGR
pursuant to its authority. However, these provisions shall control the
development of property where DOGGR merely makes advisory recommendations
beyond the agency’s statutory authority.



   E.   Grandfathering. This section shall not apply to any project
which has been approved by the city or its constituent boards, commissions or
officials prior to the date of the adoption of this section, so long as such
approvals remain valid. The required approvals include a valid approval from
DOGGR, but if such approvals have expired, the project shall be governed by
this section. Any application for discretionary land use development
entitlements under Chapter 20.52 of the Municipal Code which is being
processed shall be subject to the requirements hereof.

than one percent away from tanks and fittings to a sump, drain box, or other
safe means of disposal located within the diked impounding area and at the
greatest possible distance from the shell of the tank to provide drainage
sufficient to prevent overflow of the dike and to effectively control the
flow of fluids and runoff. Traps shall be provided with no less than six
inches of liquid seal provided between the sumps, drain boxes, or drains
intended for the disposal of spills. Catch basins or traps used for tank farm
drainage shall not connect directly to the city sewer system. Fluids shall be
pumped or gravity fed into a tank, interceptor outside of the tank
containment, or diked area or directly into a pipeline for that purpose.

finance and/or conveyance maps (collectively referred to as “finance
maps”) may only be accepted under one of the following criteria:



   1.   A future final map for development purposes must be processed
and recorded in order for any development on the site to occur, and this fact
is clearly stated on the face of the map; or



   2.   An approved site plan and design review or conditional use
permit is approved for the site, has not expired, and all conditions of
approval, expected exactions, and mitigation measures associated with the
underlying approval(s) shall be implemented as previously prescribed, or as
properly modified, for any development on the property to occur.  (Ord.

18.13.020   Definition.



   “Finance and conveyance map” means a map used to parcelize
undivided undeveloped land, parcel maps, or tract maps for non-buildable
reasons.  (Ord. 2015-11-1482 § 1 (part))

   Filing and processing. The finance and conveyance map and all other
information required for processing shall be filed with the community
development department. Filing fees and deposits shall be those prescribed by
resolution of the city council.  (Ord. 2015-11-1482 § 1 (part))



18.13.040   Submittal requirements.



   A.   The form, content and supplementary information that must
accompany a finance and conveyance map shall conform to the submittal
requirements for tentative maps set forth in Section 18.12.030 of this code
except as hereafter provided.



   1.   Notwithstanding the requirements set forth in Section
18.12.030, the director of community development or designee may waive the
following requirements in writing if requested in advance by the applicant:



   a.   Internal streets and access ways within the boundary of the
finance map (with concurrence of the city engineer);



   b.   Dimensions and location of sidewalks and common areas;



   c.   Soils and geology report;



   d.   Regional housing needs statement; and/or



   e.   Other submittal requirements set forth in Chapter 18.12

Subdivision Map Act, provided, the city engineer determines in advance, that
tentative tract or parcel map continues to comply with the spirit and intent
of the Subdivision Map Act, the subdivision ordinance, and these subdivision
regulations.



   2.   The following statements must be clearly printed on the face of
the proposed finance map: “FOR FINANCE AND CONVEYANCE PURPOSES ONLY.” and
“THIS FINANCE MAP DOES NOT CREATE A LEGAL BUILDING SITE. FURTHER
APPLICATIONS ARE NECESSARY TO DEVELOP THIS PROPERTY.”



   3.   If a previously approved tentative map, vesting tentative map,
site plan and design review or conditional use permit is in place on the
property, the face of the finance map must include the following additional
statement in addition to the statement required in Section 18.13.040(2):
“THIS FINANCE MAP DOES NOT REMOVE ANY CONDITIONS OF APPROVAL SET FORTH WITH
APPROVAL OF SITE PLAN AND DESIGN REVIEW AND TENTATIVE TRACT {insert case
number(s)}, WHICH MUST BE SATISFIED WITH CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT OF THE
PROPERTY.” (Ord. 2015-11-1482 § 1 (part))



18.13.050   Review procedure.



   A.   Except as otherwise noted herein, finance maps shall be
processed in the same manner and shall be subject to the same requirements as
specified for tentative maps in Section 18.12.060 of the Signal Hill
Municipal Code. The community development department will distribute copies
of the finance map to the appropriate reviewing bodies to determine whether
the finance map conforms to the requirements of this chapter, and the
Subdivision Map Act.



   1.   Criteria. The reviewing authority shall base its decision to
approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove the proposed finance map on the
information required under this chapter, and any additional information
reasonably necessary to determine that the property covered by the finance
map can be feasibly developed under the existing zoning and general plan
designations for the site. At a minimum, the advisory agency/reviewing
authority must ensure the following:



   a.   The parcel (or parcels) of land covered by the finance map meet
the minimum size requirements to ensure that future development can meet all
applicable site development standards imposed by Title 20 of the Signal Hill
Municipal Code;



   b.   The parcel (or parcels) of land have access from a public road,
or access is both feasible and required by a condition of approval for the
proposed finance map;



   c.   The parcel lines do not conflict with any public easements;



   d.   There are not physical constraints or other issues which may
affect the feasibility of future development on the site (e.g., vehicular
access, utility service extensions). If necessary in order to adequately
evaluate the finance map, additional technical studies (e.g., access study)
should be required prior to finding the application complete;



   e.   The finance map provides sufficient information on future uses
and feasibility of future uses to ensure consistency with the general plan
and zoning designations for the site;



   f.   The site is suitable for the future permitted or proposed uses;



   g.   The finance map provides sufficient information on the
subdivision design and future improvements to evaluate its potential impact
on the environment in compliance with the California Environmental Quality
Act; and



   h.   There is sufficient information on the subdivision design and
future improvements to enable the city to determine whether the finance map
complies with applicable water quality standards, particularly with respect
to future discharge of waste into the sewer system.



   2.   Findings. A tentative map for finance and conveyance purposes
shall be approved or conditionally approved only if the advisory agency can
make the following findings:



   a.   That the proposed finance map is consistent with applicable
general and specific plans and the zoning ordinance;



   b.   That the design or improvement of the proposed subdivision is
consistent with applicable general and specific plans and zoning ordinance;



   c.   That the site is physically suitable for the type of
development;



   d.   That the site is physically suitable for the proposed density
of development;



   e.   That the design of the subdivision or the proposed improvements
are not likely to cause substantial environmental damage or substantially and
avoidably injure fish or wildlife or their habitat;



   f.   That the design of the subdivision or type of improvements is
not likely to cause serious public health problems;



   g.   That the design of the subdivision or the type of improvements
will not conflict with easements, acquired by the public at large, for access
through or use of, property within the proposed subdivision; and



   h.   That the requirements of the California Environmental Quality
Act have been satisfied.



   B.   Mandatory conditions of approval. In addition to the standard
subdivision conditions of approval applied to all maps for development
purposes, the following shall apply to all finance maps:



   1.   Any submittal requirements which were waived in connection with
the finance map in accordance with Section 18.13.040(1) shall be submitted
concurrently with the first discretionary application for development of the
property covered by the finance map (i.e., with an application for a future
final map, a conditional use permit, site plan and design review or specific
plan), or shall be submitted as prescribed by conditions of approval already
in place with underlying entitlement approvals that govern continued or
subsequent development of the property as described on the face of the
finance map per Section 18.13.040(4).



   2.   This finance map is approved for finance and land conveyance
purposes only. No applications for building or grading permits shall be
accepted for the parcel or parcels created by this finance map until a future
final map, a conditional use permit, site plan design and review or specific
plan for development has been approved by the city, or as prescribed by
conditions of approval already in place with underlying entitlement approval
that govern continued or subsequent development of the property as described
on the face of the finance map per Section 18.13.040(4). (Ord. 2015-11-1482
§ 1 (part))



18.13.060   Appeal.



   The approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall
expire at the end of the same time period, and shall be subject to the same

the provisions of the Subdivision Map Act and the Subdivision Ordinance of
the city. Except as otherwise set forth in the provisions of this chapter,
all other provisions of Title 18 of the Signal Hill Municipal Code shall
apply to vesting tentative maps. In the event of any inconsistency between
the provisions of this chapter and of Title 18, the provisions of this
chapter shall govern. The regulations outlined in this chapter are determined
to be necessary for the preservation of the public health, safety and general
welfare, and for the promotion of orderly growth and development in the city
of Signal Hill.



(Ord. 85-12-966 § 1 (part))



18.14.020   Definitions.



   A.   A "vesting tentative map" means a "tentative map" for a

   A.   This chapter shall apply only to residential developments.
Whenever a provision of the Subdivision Map Act, as implemented and
supplemented by this title, requires the filing of a tentative map or
tentative parcel map for a residential development, a vesting tentative map
may instead be filed, in accordance with the provisions hereof.



   B.   If a subdivider does not seek the rights conferred by the
Vesting Tentative Map Statute, the filing of a vested tentative map shall not
be a prerequisite to any approval for any proposed subdivision, permit for
construction, or work preparatory to construction.



(Ord. 85-12-966 § 1 (part))



18.14.040   Procedures.



   A.   Filing and Processing. A vesting tentative map shall be filed
in the same form and have the same contents, accompanying data and reports

tentative map, except as hereinafter provided:



   1.   At the time a vesting tentative map is filed, it shall have
printed conspicuously on its face the words "Vesting Tentative Map."

planning commission or deemed necessary by the director of the department of
planning and community development, or the city engineer, which will enable
the director or city engineer to evaluate compliance with the city code,
including Title 15 thereof.



   B.   Fees. Upon filing a vesting tentative map, the subdivider shall
pay such fees and deposits as the city council may prescribe from time to
time by resolution.

this title.



(Ord. 85-12-966 § 1 (part))



18.14.060   Vesting on approval of vesting tentative map.



   A.   The approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map
shall confer a vested right to proceed with development in substantial
compliance with the conditions of approval, and the ordinances, policies and
standards described in Government Code Section 66474.2. In the event that
Section 66474.2 of the Government Code is repealed, the approval or
conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall confer a vested right
to proceed with development in substantial compliance with the conditions of
approval, and ordinances, policies and standards in effect at the time the
vesting tentative map is approved or conditionally approved.



   B.   Notwithstanding subsection A above, a permit, approval,
extension or entitlement sought by an applicant for property for which a
vested right to proceed with development has been obtained may be made
conditional or denied if any of the following are determined:



   1.   A failure to do so would place the residents of the subdivision
or the immediate community, or both, in a condition dangerous to their health
or safety, or both;



   2.   The condition or denial is required, in order to comply with
state or federal law.



   C.   The rights referred to herein shall expire if a final map is
not approved prior to the expiration of the vesting tentative map, as
provided in Section 18.14.050 of this chapter. If the final map is approved,
these rights shall last for the following periods of time:



   1.   An initial time period of one year. Where several final maps
are recorded on various phases of a project covered by a single vesting
tentative map, this initial time period shall begin for each phase when the
final map for that phase is recorded;



   2.   The initial time period set forth in subsection C1 shall be
automatically extended by any time used for processing a complete application
for a grading permit or for site plan review, if such processing exceeds
thirty days, from the date a complete application is filed;



   3.   A subdivider may apply for a one-year extension at any time
before the initial time period set forth in subsection C1 expires. If the
extension is denied, the subdivider may appeal that denial to the planning
commission within fifteen calendar days by filing an appeal in writing with
the director of planning and community development;



   4.   If the subdivider submits a complete application for a building
permit during the periods of time specified in subsections C1 through C3, the
rights referred to herein shall continue until the expiration of that permit,
or any extension of that permit.

land, pay a fee in lieu thereof, or a combination of both, at the option of
the city, as determined at the time of approval of the tentative map. The
land dedication, or fee in lieu thereof, shall be used for park and
recreational purposes.



   C.   Standards.



   1.   The general plan of the city sets a standard of four acres per
one thousand people as the appropriate ratio for a proper well-balanced
recreational program as it relates to local facilities.



   2.   Population density for the purposes of this section shall be
3.2 persons per single-family dwelling unit and 2.2 persons per dwelling unit
for multiple-family dwellings.



   3.   Based on the preceding, five hundred sixty square feet of land
per single-family dwelling unit and three hundred eighty-five square feet of
land per multiple-family dwelling unit shall be dedicated. If a fee in lieu
of dedication is required, the amount of such fee shall be based on the
average estimated fair market value of the land being subdivided which would
otherwise be required to be dedicated.



   "Fair market value" shall mean the value of the assessable lot area at
its highest and best use as determined by a qualified appraiser as of a date
of value within a three-month period immediately prior to the date of
issuance of a certificate of occupancy or other final entitlement for use.
The qualified appraiser to make this determination shall be selected by the
director of community development.



   4.   In the event that the applicant disputes the determination of
fair market value reached by the qualified appraiser selected by the director
of community development, the applicant may select another qualified
appraiser who shall appraise the assessable lot area in the development
project. Upon conclusion of such appraisal, the fee shall be determined as
follows:



   a.   If the fair market value determination made by the second
appraiser is within five percent of the fair market value determination of
the first qualified appraiser, the applicant's fee shall be determined by
taking the average of the two determinations of fair market value, so long as
the fee calculated from this average does not vary from the fee which would
result from calculation from the first appraiser's determination of fair
market value by more than twenty-five thousand dollars for the entire
development project.



   b.   In the event that determination of fair market value of the
second appraiser varies from that of the first appraiser by more than five
percent, or if the average of the two determinations of fair market value
would result in a variation in total fees of more than twenty-five thousand
dollars for the entire development project, the first appraiser and the
second appraiser shall mutually appoint a third qualified appraiser. The
third appraiser shall then determine the fair market value of the assessable
lot area. The fee shall be determined based upon the fair market value which
is the average between the third appraisal and the appraisal which is closest
to it.



   5.   It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to ensure that
any determinations of fair market value required hereunder are made before
the issuance of any certificates of occupancy. No certificates of occupancy
shall be issued for any property or development project for which fees have
not been determined and paid.



   6.   All appraisal costs as may be required hereunder shall be paid
by the applicant. Prior to any appointment of a qualified appraiser or
appraisers, the applicant shall deposit with the city such funds in the
amount the director of community development estimates will be necessary to
pay for all required appraisal services. Any portions of funds deposited by
an applicant and not used for appraisal services will be refunded. Whenever
such deposit is insufficient to cover the costs of appraisal services, the
director of community development shall notify the applicant, and the
applicant shall increase the deposit as required by director.



   7.   Where private open space for park and recreational purposes is
provided in a proposed subdivision and such space is to be privately owned
and maintained by the future residents of the subdivisions, partial credit,
not to exceed fifty percent, may be given against the requirements of land
dedication or payment of fees in lieu thereof if the city council finds that
it is in the public interest to do so, subject to the following terms and
conditions:



   a.   The subdivider shall submit for review and approval of the city
a plan for installation of private recreation facilities to be used in common
by residents of the project.



   b.   The yards, and other open areas required to be maintained by
the zoning and building ordinances are not included in the private
recreational facilities.



   c.   The use of the private recreational facilities are restricted
for park and recreational purposes by recorded covenant, which will run with
the land in favor of the future owners of the property and which cannot be
defeated or eliminated without the consent of the city or its successor.



   D.   Choice of Land or Fees.



   1.   The procedure for determining whether the subdivider is to
dedicate land, pay a fee, or both, shall be as follows:



   a.   Subdivider. At the time of filing a tentative map for approval,
the owner of the property shall, as a part of such filing, indicate whether
he desires to dedicate property for park and recreational purposes, or
whether he desires to pay a fee in lieu thereof. If he desires to dedicate
land for this purpose, he shall designate the area thereof on the tentative
tract map as submitted.



   b.   Action of City. At the time of the tentative map approval, the
planning commission or city council, if appealed, shall determine, as a part
of their approval, whether to require a dedication of land within or adjacent
to the subdivision, payment of a fee in lieu thereof, or a combination of
both.



   c.   Prerequisites for Approval of Final Map. Where dedication is
required, it shall be accomplished in accordance with the provisions of the
Subdivision Map Act. Where fees are required, same shall be deposited with
the city prior to the approval of the final map.



   2.   Whether the planning commission or city council accepts land
dedication or elects to require payment of a fee in lieu thereof, or a
combination of both, it shall be determined by consideration of the following:



   a.   Parks and recreational master plan, open space and recreational
element of the city's general plan;



   b.   Topography, geology, access, and location of land in the
subdivision available for dedication;



   c.   Size and shape of the subdivision and land available for
dedication.



   3.   The determination of the planning commission or city council as
to whether land shall be dedicated, or whether a fee shall be charged, or a
combination thereof, shall be final and conclusive; provided, however, if
land is made available, it shall be land that is acceptable to the city. On
subdivisions involving fifty parcels or less, only the payment of fees shall
be required except that if a condominium project exceeds fifty dwelling
units, dedication of land may be required notwithstanding that the number of
parcels may be less than fifty.



   E.   Use of Fees. The fees received under this chapter shall be
deposited in the park facilities fund and shall be used for the purchase of
or development of park and recreational facilities, to serve the subdivision
for which these were received.

general plan, any specific plans adopted by the city, and the requirements
established by the city engineer.



   B.   Improvement plans shall be prepared by a registered civil

regulate and limit the height, number of stories, and size of buildings and
other structures hereafter designed, erected or altered; to regulate and
determine the size of yards and other open spaces; and to regulate and limit
the density of population; and, for these purposes, to divide the city into
districts of such number, shape, and area as may be deemed best suited to
carry out these regulations and provide for their enforcement. Further, such
regulations are deemed necessary in order to encourage the most appropriate
use of land; to conserve and stabilize the value of property; to provide
adequate open spaces for light and air and to prevent and fight fires; to
prevent undue concentration of population; to lessen congestion of streets;
to facilitate adequate provisions for community utilities such as
transportation, water, sewerage, schools, parks, and other public
requirements; and to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare.

administer oaths to any person testifying. The commission may for any reason,
when it deems such action necessary or desirable, continue any hearing to a
certain date, time, and place, and public announcement of such date, time,
and place of hearing to be continued shall for all purposes be sufficient
notice thereof to all persons.



(Prior code § 19.96.020 (Ord. 557 § 411, 1964))



20.02.050   Nuisance declared–Legal remedies.

to be unlawful and a public nuisance; and the city attorney, at the request
of the city engineer, shall immediately commence action or proceedings for
the abatement and removal and the enjoining thereof in the manner prescribed
by law. The remedies provided in this title shall be cumulative.

   20.09.020   Planned development districts created.



   20.09.030   Site plan review required.



20.09.010   Authority and purpose.



   The purpose of this chapter is to authorize the creation of planned
development districts as an additional zoning classification in the city
where the creation of such districts will foster innovative development of
large areas of land by encouraging their development in a comprehensive
integrated manner in accordance with the goals and policies of the general
plan. It is the further purpose of a planned development district to provide
protection in areas of the city subject to unique environmental constraints
such as severe slope, geological hazards such as seismic activity and
landslides, severe noise, and soil impacted by oil extraction and production
activity, as well as unique environmental opportunities such as the
preservation of panoramic views, scenic beauty, and open space. It is
intended that planned development districts will allow for flexible
approaches to develop the land in ways which will accommodate its unusual
constraints and opportunities so as to protect the integrity of the property
of those citizens who will inhabit and use it.

   Planned development districts shall be created by zoning ordinances
adopted in accordance with the procedures of Chapter 20.86 of this title and
state law. All planned development districts created shall permit only those
uses provided for in the general plan or determined by the planning
commission to be consistent therewith. A planned development district shall
be authorized only on sites containing five or more acres of land.

   A.   Planned development districts shall require that any
development proposed thereunder shall be subject to the discretionary
approval of the planning commission pursuant to the site plan review process
set forth at Chapter 20.52, and may establish special development standards
and require compliance with special findings and/or procedures which will
further the purposes of the districts and the general plan.



   B.   In addition to the submittal information for site plan review
required by Chapter 20.52, the following information shall be submitted by
the proponent of any project in a planned development district pursuant to

corner cutoff area shall be measured from a point not less than thirty feet
from the intersection of the two property lines. Nothing in excess of three
feet in height, including landscaping, may be located within the corner
cutoff area. Where due to an irregularly shaped lot or a lot on a curved
street, the required corner cutoff area cannot be provided as above, an area
shall be established which will adequately protect intersection visibility.
Such area shall be approved by the director of planning.



   B.   Permitted Fences, Walls and Hedges. Fences, walls and hedges
not greater than six feet in height shall be permitted at all rear and side
property lines and within required rear or side yards, and at or to the rear
of all front setback lines. No fence, wall or hedge over four feet in height
shall be permitted in any required front yard or in the required street side
of a corner lot.



   C.   Architectural Embellishments. Architectural embellishments such
as pilasters, archways, sculptures, etc., may be permitted to project above
the maximum height on any fence, hedge or wall, subject to approval of the
planning director, provided that such embellishment does not significantly
increase the overall average height or apparent mass of the wall.



   D.   Except for retaining walls, the height of the fence, wall or
hedge shall be measured from the lowest finished grade on either side of any
fence, wall or hedge.



   E.   Fences, walls and/or hedges shall be measured as a single unit
if built or planted within three feet of each other.



   F.   Retaining Wall­Protecting Cut Below Natural Grade. Where a
retaining wall protects a cut below natural grade and is located within three
feet of a property line separating lots, such retaining wall may be topped by
a fence, wall or hedge, but the height shall be measured from the highest
actual finished grade on either side.



   G.   Retaining Wall­Containing Fill. When a retaining wall contains
a fill, the height of the retaining wall built to retain the fill shall be
considered as contributing to the permissible height of a fence, solid wall
or hedge providing that in any event a protective fence or wall not more than
forty-two inches in height, as measured from the grade retained, may be
erected at the top of such retaining wall and any portion of such fence, wall
or hedge above the otherwise permitted height shall comply with Section
20.04.291, Fence.



   H.   Nothing in this section shall be deemed to set aside or reduce

required before a site plan for a development proposed pursuant to this
chapter may be approved under Section 20.16.160. Density increments up to the
maximum allowed by this section may be approved in order to provide an
incentive for design excellence. Criteria for such density increments shall
include, but not be limited to, the following:



   1.   Where the planned development project to be approved preserves
natural features that enhance both the specific development proposed and the
community, including trees, scenic points, view corridors, unique geological
formations and other community assets.



   2.   Where review of the proposed development indicates distinctive
design, including site planning, structural design, architectural treatments,
and the harmonious blending of buildings and landscaping.



   3.   Where usable open space is maximized and where greenbelt areas
and/or parkland facilities are provided.



   4.   Where passive recreational areas adjacent to the Alamitos
Number 1 Historical Landmark are provided.

streets and circulation systems are designed and located so as to minimize
expansive impervious surface areas.



   7.   Where the proposed development provides for the use of passive
and active energy conservation measures.



   8.   Where a development to be accomplished in stages is designed to
coordinate improvement of open space, construction of buildings, structures
and dwelling units so that each development stage achieves a proportionate
share of open space and environmental quality of the total planned
development.



   B.   Any person constructing a project of five or more dwelling
units may apply for one or more bonus incentives, to complement general plan
housing element policy where twenty-five percent of the units to be
constructed in a project of five or more units are to be constructed for low
to moderate income households or when ten percent of the units in such a
project are constructed for low income households as defined by the
California Health and Safety Code and as approved by the city council. The
acceptable combination of incentives shall be as determined by the city
council, provided that any individual incentive or combination of incentives
shall have the equivalent financial value of at least a twenty-five percent
density bonus. Potential bonus incentives shall be as follows:



   1.   A density bonus not to exceed twenty-five percent over the
otherwise permitted density. The density bonus shall not be included when
determining the number of housing units which are equal to the ten percent or
twenty-five percent of the project constructed for low or moderate income
households;



   2.   Exemption of the development from the requirements of Section
18.21.120;



   3.   Relief from the construction of public improvements appurtenant
to the proposed development, which may include, but shall not be limited to,
streets, sewers, and sidewalks;



   4.   Utilization of federal or state grant moneys or local revenues
to provide land for the project at reduced cost;



   5.   Waiver of building, zoning, subdivision, or environmental
impact fees and deposits;



   6.   Expedited case processing;



   7.   Exemption of the project from any other municipal code
provisions which may cause an increase in the cost of the housing units to be
developed.



   In order to ensure compliance with this subsection, the owner(s) of the
property to be developed and/or the developer shall execute and record an
agreement with the city, in a form approved by the city attorney. The city
council shall ensure that units constructed for low or moderate income
households, where bonus incentives have been provided pursuant to this
subsection, are sold or leased to persons and/or families of low or moderate
income.

on both sides and front, or rear, property lines at a distance of thirty feet
from the intersection of such lines at the corner of a street or highway.



   2.   There shall be a corner cutoff area on each side of an alley
intersecting a street or alley. The cutoff lines shall be in a horizontal
plane, making an angle of forty-five degrees with the side, front, or rear
property line, as the case may be. They shall pass through a point not less
than ten feet from the edges of the alley where it intersects the street or
alley right-of-way.



   3.   Where, due to an irregular lot shape, a line at a forty-five
degree angle does not provide for intersection visibility, the corner cutoff
shall be defined by a line drawn from a point on the front or rear property
line that is not less than thirty feet from the intersection of the side and
front, or rear, property lines and through a point on the side property line
that is not less than thirty feet from the intersection of the side and
front, or rear, property lines.



   C.   Permitted Fences, Hedges and Walls. Fences, hedges, and walls
not greater than six feet in height shall be permitted only where they do not:



   1.   Impair the view opportunities of the district,

20.16.170   Single-family detached dwelling units.



   A.   Purpose. It is the goal of the city to provide a mix of housing
opportunities, including single-family residential neighborhoods, within
residential districts. To this end, within the PD-1 and PD-2 districts, for
projects where area of the parcels exceed forty thousand square feet (prior
to dedications), at least thirty percent of the dwelling units shall be
single-family detached units, except as otherwise provided herein.



   B.   Reduction in Single-family Units. With approval by the planning
commission of a conditional use permit the percentage of single-family
detached dwelling units may be reduced, within the PD-1 and PD-2 districts,
but shall not be less than fifteen percent of the total dwelling units;
provided, that the planning commission makes one or more of the following
findings:



   1.   Slopes in excess of fifteen percent, or other features of
topography; excessive grading; lack of usable open space; the protection of

   The OS open space district shall have the following purposes:



   The OS open space district is intended to provide for orderly
establishment of parks, schools, public or institutional facilities, and
other open space and recreational uses. It is also intended to allow the
expansion of operations or improvement of facilities on lands owned, leased
or otherwise controlled by governmental agencies. In establishing this
district, the city has found and determined a need to designate open space
areas for both outdoor recreation, resource conservation and public health
and safety purposes. Areas given special attention in this district include,
but are not limited to, areas of outstanding scenic, historical and cultural
value; areas particularly suited for park and recreation purposes; areas
which serve as links between major recreation and open space reservations;
areas which require special management or regulation because of hazardous or
special conditions such as unstable soil areas and areas presenting high fire
risks; areas which must be preserved to promote natural resource
conservation, including oil production; areas necessary to establish view
corridors and promote view protection; areas required for the protection of
water quality and water reservoirs; and areas required for the protection and
enhancement of air quality. Overall, it is the city's intent to help
preserve, enhance and maintain a quality environment through the development
standards for this district. Notwithstanding the foregoing, it is expressly
acknowledged that development is permitted within the open space district and
the owner of property should be able to realize a reasonable return on the
property. In recognition of this principle, extensive development standards
are provided. It is hoped that these standards will, however, promote and
enhance the open space policies and values contained herein.

intersection of any two streets, a street and alley, or any two alleys. The
corner cutoff area shall be measured from a point not less than thirty feet
from the intersection of the two property lines. Nothing in excess of three
feet in height, including landscaping, may be located within the corner
cutoff. Where, due to an irregularly shaped lot, or a lot on a curved street,
the corner cutoff area cannot be provided as above, an area shall be
established which will adequately protect intersection visibility. Such area
shall be approved by the director of planning.



   B.   Permitted Fences, Walls and Hedges. Fences, walls and hedges
not greater than six feet in height shall be permitted on or within all rear
and side property lines and on or to the rear of all front setback lines. No
fence, wall or hedge over four feet in height shall be permitted in any
required front yard or in the required street side of a corner lot.



   C.   Exceptions. The director of planning may permit fences, hedges
and walls in excess of six feet where it is determined that the additional
height is necessary due to unusual site conditions such as sloped lots, grade
differences between lots, existing adjacent development or specialized
security needs. However, in no event shall a fence, wall or hedge be
permitted in excess of ten feet.



   D.   Except for retaining walls, the height of a fence, wall or
hedge shall be measured from the lowest finished grade on either side of any
fence, wall or hedge.



   E.   Fences, walls and/or hedges shall be measured as a single unit
if built or planted within three feet of each other.



   F.   Retaining Wall–Protecting Cut Below Natural Grade. Where a
retaining wall protects a cut below natural grade and is located within three
feet of a property line separating lots, such retaining wall may be topped,
by a fence, wall or hedge, but the height shall be measured from the highest
actual finished grade on either side.



   G.   Retaining Wall–Containing Fill. When a retaining wall
contains a fill, the height of the retaining wall built to retain the fill
shall be considered as contributing to the permissible height of a fence,
solid wall or hedge, providing that in any event a protective fence or wall
not more than forty-two inches in height, as measured from the grade
retained, may be erected at the top of such retaining wall and any portion of
such fence, wall or hedge above the otherwise permitted height shall comply
with Section 20.04.291.



   H.   Nothing in this section shall be deemed to set aside or reduce
the requirements for fencing by local, state or federal law or regulation.

   The commercial and industrial districts listed below shall have the
following purposes:



   A.   The CO commercial office district is intended to provide areas
for the development of professional offices and limited commercial uses.
Other permitted uses will include commercial offices, medical offices and
hospitals.



   B.   The CTC commercial town center district is intended to serve as
a concentrated commercial core for the city. Retail outlets typical of
community shopping centers or districts along with general retail uses and
professional offices will be among the uses permitted in this district.



   C.   The CG commercial general district is intended to provide for a
wide variety of service and retail uses, many of which are highway-oriented.
The portion of this district along Pacific Coast Highway should be treated
with special zoning and development standards due to unique characteristics
including, but not limited to small lot sizes, substantial existing
nonconforming development, nonconforming and illegal sign proliferation, and
lack of off-street parking.



   D.   The CR commercial residential district is intended to provide
for limited small scale commercial and office uses along, or in conjunction
with, medium density residential uses. Such mixed uses on a single parcel
shall be compatible and where possible, mutually supportive.



   E.   The CI commercial industrial district is intended to provide
for a wide variety of commercial uses and limited compatible light industrial
uses. Commercial or industrial uses which might create offensive levels of
noise, air pollution, glare, radioactivity or other nuisances shall be
prohibited from this district.



   F.   The LI light industrial district is designed to accommodate a
variety of light industrial uses which are nonpolluting and which can coexist
with surrounding land uses. In addition, limited complimentary commercial
uses shall be permitted.



   G.   The GI general industrial district is intended to provide for
the development of a variety of general industrial and service uses which do
not generate obnoxious or offensive impacts which might affect persons
residing or conducting business in the city.

intersection of any two streets, a street and alley, or any two alleys. The
corner cutoff area shall be measured from a point not less than thirty feet
from the intersection of the two property lines. Nothing in excess of three
feet in height, with the exception of buildings, may be located within the
corner cutoff. This includes fences, walls, monument signs, hedges and other
landscaping. Where due to an irregularly shaped lot, or a lot on a curved
street, when a typical corner cutoff area cannot be provided, an area shall
be established which will adequately protect intersection visibility. Such
area shall be approved by the director of planning.



   D.   Permitted Fences, Walls and Hedges. Fences, walls and hedges
not greater than six feet in height shall be permitted on or within all rear
and side property lines and on or to the rear of all front setback lines. No

in height shall be permitted in any required front yard or in the required
street side of a corner lot.



   E.   Exceptions. The director of planning may permit fences, hedges
and walls in excess of six feet where it is determined that the additional
height is necessary due to unusual site conditions such as sloped lots, grade
differences between lots, existing adjacent development or specialized
security needs. However, in no event shall a fence, wall or hedge be
permitted in excess of ten feet.



   F.   Retaining Wall--Protecting Cut Below Natural Grade. Where a
retaining wall protects a cut below natural grade and is located within three
feet of a property line separating lots, such retaining wall may be topped by
a fence, wall or hedge, but the height shall be measured from the highest
actual finished grade on either side.



   G.   Retaining Wall--Containing Fill. When a retaining wall contains
a fill, the height of the retaining wall built to retain the fill shall be
considered as contributing to the permissible height of a fence, solid wall
or hedge, providing that in any event a protective fence or wall not more
than forty-two inches in height, as measured from the grade retained, may be
erected at the top of such retaining wall and any portion of such fence, wall
or hedge above the otherwise permitted height shall comply with Section
20.04.291.



   H.   Nothing in this section shall be deemed to set aside or reduce
the requirements for fencing by local, state or federal law or regulation.

   20.22.015   Defined



   20.22.020   Application to all storage yards and outdoor storage
areas.

   20.22.070   Appeals.



   20.22.080   Penalties.



20.22.010   Purpose.



   A.   The purpose of this chapter is to establish standards for
storage yard fences and to improve the appearance of the city by improving
the appearance of existing legal nonconforming storage yards that have fallen
into disrepair and have become unattractive and detract from the high quality
appearance of the commercial and industrial areas. The requirements of this
chapter to replace existing privacy fences to screen storage yards from view
from public rights-of-way are necessary because many existing storage yard
privacy fences are chain link fences in poor repair and unsightly condition
due to damaged fence posts and gates, deteriorated, broken or missing wood,
metal or plastic privacy slats or sagging, torn or faded mesh screen fabric
fence coverings. The unsightly condition of these existing storage yard
fences detracts from the neat and orderly appearance of the city and
negatively affects property values.



   B.   The City recognizes the need for outdoor storage yards and
outdoor storage areas.  The additional standards as found in section
20.22.055 of this chapter are necessary to maintain and conceal the storage
within storage yards and outdoor storage areas from view from adjacent public
rights-of way and to reduce the discharge of sediment, debris, oils, greases
and other pollutants  in urban and storm water runoff.  These standards
serve to improve the appearance of existing commercial and industrial
properties.



(Ord. 2011-04-1423 § 5(part))



20.22.015   Defined.

of a property, used for the primary purpose of storing, keeping or
maintaining, whether on a temporary or permanent basis, durable goods,
materials, equipment, vehicles, stockpiles or other similar items outside. 
All outdoor storage areas shall comply with the provisions of Chapter 20.22,
unless exempted.



   B.   Storage yards.  "Storage yard" means any property used for the
primary purpose of storing, keeping, or maintaining, whether on a temporary
or permanent basis, durable goods, materials, equipment, vehicles,
stockpiles, or other similar items outside.  All storage yards shall comply
with the provisions of Chapter 20.22, unless exempted.

and outdoor storage areas located in the city shall be enclosed by a fence,
wall, or gate, installed and maintained in a good first class condition.



   B.   Those portions of the fence, wall or gate which are visible
from a public right-of-way, including the public view across vacant parcels,
shall comply with compliance plans in accordance with this chapter, except
for those storage yards which are exempt under Section 20.22.030. In
addition, for purpose of this chapter only, public alleys shall not be
construed as a public right-of-way.



   C.   Storage within the storage yard or outdoor storage area that is
visible from public rights-of-way shall be maintained and concealed in
accordance with Section 20.22.055. 



   D.   For the purpose of this chapter, the property owner(s) shall be
determined as the taxpayer shown in the most recent Los Angeles County
Assessor's Tax Rolls. All property owner(s) shall be jointly and severably
liable with tenants, uses, businesses, and licensees of the property
responsible for any failure to comply with the provisions of this chapter. In
the case of property owned by a corporation, trust or other similar entity,
the corporate officer(s) or persons responsible for the trust or similar
entity shall be jointly and severably liable for failure to comply with the
provisions of this chapter.



(Ord. 2011-04-1423 § 5(part))



20.22.030   Exempt storage yards.



   A.   The director shall exempt the following storage yards from the
replacement fence requirements:

20.23.010   Purpose.



   A.   The purpose of this chapter is to establish minimum performance
standards for newly established and existing legal nonconforming trucking
yards in order to: 1) reduce the negative impacts of trucking yard operations
on adjacent properties, public streets and rights-of-ways, 2) insure that
properties are regularly and properly maintained, and 3) require that all
trucking yards meet best management practices for the National Pollutant
Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) for urban and storm water runoff to
reduce discharge of sediment, debris, oils, greases and other pollutants.



   B.   The City recognizes the desire for trucking yard operators to
locate in Signal Hill, due in part to the close proximity of the ports of Los
Angeles and Long Beach.  The performance standards for maintenance and
operations found in this chapter are necessary to reduce the negative impacts
of the existing nonconforming trucking yard operations and to provide ongoing
maintenance and oversight for newly established trucking yards. These
standards serve to improve the appearance of the three existing legal
nonconforming trucking yards described in Exhibit “A” on file at the
community development department and any other existing trucking yards not
yet identified. 



(Ord. 2013-07-1457 § 1 (part))

   B.   N.P.D.E.S. compliance - Maintain Best Management Practices
under the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System in accordance with
California Storm Water Quality Association (CASQA) standards (i.e. curb cut,
driveway throat and shaker plate for entrances, elevate and cover outdoor
storage) designed to City standards, as recommended by the City’s storm
water consultant and to the satisfaction of the City Engineer.



   C.   Dust compliance - Gravel grindings or paving for interior
parking and storage areas, shall be provided and maintained to reduce dust
and track out onto public streets.



   D.   Screening - Each property shall be fully fenced and screened
per City Standard Plan No. 230.



   E.   Landscaping - Existing setbacks and perimeter planters shall be
landscaped and maintained with an automatic irrigation system.



   F.   Increased intensity of use - Nonconforming trucking yards may
not be constructed, established, altered, modified, reconstructed, replaced
or enlarged in any way which increases the nonconformity, pursuant to Section
20.82.040 of this Code. 



   G.   Annual inspections - Each trucking yard shall be subject to an
annual inspection by the City, the results of which shall be reported
annually to the City Council. 



(Ord. 2013-07-1457 § 1 (part))



20.23.040   Compliance plans.



   A.   Non-Compliant Properties. The director of community development
shall determine whether each of the trucking yards on the list of existing
legally nonconforming trucking yards, as revised on the effective date of
this chapter (as listed in Exhibit “A” on file in the community
development department) is in compliance with this chapter.  For each
trucking yard that is not in compliance, the director shall prepare a
compliance plan to advise the property owner how to bring the trucking yard
into compliance. 



   1.   Notice. The compliance plan shall be mailed to the property
owner and tenants by certified mail return receipt requested, and posted on
the property in a conspicuous manner.



   2.   Compliance Plan. The property owner shall be responsible for
compliance with the plan even in cases where the property is leased to one or
more tenants. The property owner shall within one hundred eighty days of the
date of mailing or posting, whichever is later, bring the subject property
into compliance with this chapter as described in the compliance plan.



   3.   Alternative Compliance Plan. Any property owner may, within
sixty days of the date of mailing or posting, whichever is later, propose an
alternative compliance plan by submitting detailed site or building plans as
necessary, and if required, prepared by a state licensed architect or
engineer. The director may approve an alternative compliance plan if

items on the compliance plans shall be determined annually by the director
following annual inspections. Property owners and tenants of trucking yards
who are notified in writing that compliance corrections are complete and are
in compliance with the provisions of this chapter shall be responsible for
maintaining the property in accordance with this chapter. If, subsequent to
such notification of compliance, the director determines that any trucking
yard has become damaged, deteriorated, not repaired, improperly operated and
maintained, or that the intensity of the operations has significantly
increased, or has otherwise become non-compliant with this chapter, the
director may create a new compliance plan in accordance with Section
20.23.040, which shall require the property owner to complete repairs and/or
maintenance of damaged or deteriorated items.



   C.   Existing nonconforming trucking yards as inventoried and on
file in the community development department may continue as provided in
Chapter 20.82, subject to compliance with Sections 20.23.030 and 20.23.040 of
this chapter.  This chapter shall govern in the event of any conflict
between its provisions and the provisions of Chapter 20.82.

   20.24.050   Term II permanent improvements compliance plan.



20.24.010   Purpose.



   The purpose of this chapter is to provide for and regulate uses which
are determined to be accessory to the Signal Hill Auto Center dealerships.
This chapter allows Signal Hill Auto Center dealerships to operate accessory
uses on properties outside of the SP-4 Auto Center Specific Plan and provides
much needed additional space for Signal Hill Auto Center dealerships to store
inventory, conduct wholesale facilities for trade-in vehicles and previously
leased vehicles and provide other Auto Center related services on properties
in the industrial zoning districts. 



(Ord. 2016-06- 1487, § 3)



20.24.020   Determination of permitted accessory use.



   A.   Required Findings.  The approving body shall only approve the
accessory use if the following findings are made:



      1.   That the proposed use will not be detrimental to the
community and to property in the vicinity.



      2.   That based on one of the two following criteria the
proposed use qualifies as an Auto Center accessory use:



         a.   The proposed use is owned or operated by a
factory-authorized or nationally franchised automobile, truck and motorcycle
sales and service dealership which has a permitted facility located in the
SP-4 Auto Center Specific Plan zoning district or;



         b.   The proposed use is not owned or operated by a
factory-authorized or nationally franchised automobile, truck and motorcycle
sales and service dealership located in the SP-4 Auto Center Specific Plan
zoning district however, it can be determined that it is the "sole or
majority service provider" of the specific service to a factory-authorized or
nationally franchised automobile, truck and motorcycle sales and service
dealership located in the SP-4 Auto Center Specific Plan zoning district.



   B.   Factors For Determination of "Sole or Majority Service
Provider". When making a determination of what constitutes a "sole or
majority service provider", the applicant shall submit documentation in
support thereof and the approving body shall consider the following factors
for such determination including, but not limited to:



      1.   Whether the proposed accessory use is consistent with the
purpose of the SP-4 Auto Center Specific Plan pursuant to Section 20.47.010;



      2.   Whether the proposed accessory use is automobile, truck
or motorcycle sales and service related;



      3.   Whether the proposed accessory use is incidental and
subordinate to a permitted factory-authorized or nationally franchised
automobile, truck and motorcycle sales and service dealership located in the
SP-4 Auto Center Specific Plan zoning district;



      4.   Whether the proposed accessory use has an existing
contract for a significant period of time to do business with or can
reasonably be associated with a factory-authorized or nationally franchised
automobile, truck and motorcycle sales and service dealership located in the
SP-4 Auto Center Specific Plan zoning district; and



      5.   Whether the proposed accessory use can demonstrate that
it is the "sole or majority service provider" of the specific use being
provided to a dealership located within the SP-4 Auto Center Specific Plan
zoning district.



(Ord. 2016-06-1487, § 3)



20.24.030   Tiered compliance and property improvement plans for vehicle
storage accessory uses.



   A.   Compliance Plans.  Two compliance plans for property
improvements, maintenance and operations for the vehicle storage uses shall
be prepared and submitted for review.  First, following a finding of
determination that the proposed vehicle storage is an Auto Center accessory
use pursuant to Section 20.24.020, the property owner or applicant shall
prepare and submit term I interim improvements compliance plan pursuant to
Section 20.24.040.  Second, if the property is intended to be used as
vehicle storage beyond term I, the property shall be subject to the term II
permanent improvement plan requirements pursuant to Section 20.24.050. 
Within one year of initiation of the vehicle storage use, the property owner
or applicant shall prepare and submit a term II permanent improvements plan
pursuant to Section 20.24.050 unless a statement of intent to terminate the
use and vacate the property at the end of term I is submitted.



      1.   Deposit. A deposit of one thousand dollars shall be
submitted and maintained on-file during the use of the property for auto
storage, to cover the cost of plan review, annual property inspections and
other expenses as provided in the developer deposit policy established by
city council resolution.



      2.   Application. The property owner or applicant shall submit
a compliance plan application for the proposed property improvements,
maintenance and operations for the vehicle storage use, including but not
limited to the compliance requirements provided in this Section, to the
community development department prior to initiation of the use.



   B.   Term Time Limits.



      1.   Term I shall be a maximum of three years from the date of
initiation of the use, unless a one year extension is granted by the director
of community development, pursuant to Section 20.24.040(D).



      2.   Term II does not have a maximum time limit.



   C.   Approved compliance plans shall be mailed to the applicant and
shall be kept on file in the community development department. Noncompliant
properties are subject to remedy and revocation pursuant to Section
20.24.030(F)2.



   D.   Improvement Installation.



      1.   Term I interim improvements shall be installed before
initial use of the site for vehicle storage, to the satisfaction of the
director of community development.



      2.   Term II permanent improvements shall be installed on or
before the expiration of the term I or extension of term I, to the
satisfaction of the director of community development.



   E.   Compliance Plans Run With the Land. Compliance plans shall
continue to be valid upon a change of property ownership. The vehicle storage
use may continue with a change in tenancy as long as the new tenants
demonstrate that they are a "sole or majority service provider" pursuant to
Section 20.24.020(B). In the event the new tenants cannot demonstrate that
they are a "sole or majority service provider" pursuant to Section
20.24.020(B), the use shall be terminated and the site shall be restored in
accordance with a property restoration plan.



   F.   Annual Review and Maintenance.



      1.   Annual Inspections. The community development department
shall inspect all properties with approved compliance plans on an annual
basis for compliance. The results of the annual inspection will be documented
in an inspection report and shall be mailed to the property owner and kept on
file in the community development department.



      2.   The property owner shall be responsible for compliance
with all compliance plans even in cases where the property is leased to one
or more tenants.



      3.   The director of community development or property owner
may request revisions to the compliance plans as deemed necessary to promote
the public health, safety, and general welfare.



   G.   Remedy or Revocation of Permit.



      1.   Remedy. The property owner shall be provided with 30 days
from the date of the written notice to correct any violation or notice of
noncompliance. The property owner may, prior to the thirty day expiration,
request additional time and shall demonstrate reasonable cause for the delay.
The director of community development may approve an extension to correct the
noncompliant items, written notice of any extension granted will be provided
to the property owner.



      2.   Revocation. The director of community development may
revoke the compliance plan and auto storage accessory use, if violations or
items of noncompliance are not remedied pursuant to Section 20.24.030(F)(1).
Upon revocation, the property owner shall restore the property in accordance
with the property restoration plan.



      3.   Appeal to the Planning Commission. Any property owner, or
applicant wishing to appeal the remedy action or revocation, shall file such

SP-22 SUMMERLAND RESIDENTIAL SPECIFIC PLAN



Sections:



   20.27.010   Purpose.



   20.27.020   Adoption of SP-22, Summerland Residential Specific Plan.

   20.27.070   Required setbacks.



   20.27.080   Yard requirements.



   20.27.090   Permitted projections into required yards.

20.27.010   Purpose.



   A.   Application of the Specific Plan Concept. A Specific Plan and
its function may be described by comparison with the General Plan. The
General Plan expresses, in very broad terms, the city’s planning of its
future environment, generally on a long-term basis. Adopted by the city as a
legislative act, the General Plan may be amended, as required by changing
circumstances. The Specific Plan, on the other hand, is a device used to
implement the General Plan by focusing on a particular parcel or parcels. The
Specific Plan sets standards, against which developments can be judged, and
imposes controls on the use of the subject parcels. The Specific Plan is more
detailed than a General Plan and can be viewed as a bridge between the
General Plan and individual project submittals.



   The intent and purpose of this chapter is to establish a Specific Plan
to guide the physical development of a particular geographic area within the
City. The subject site is constrained due to the size, site configuration
(deep and narrow), location of one abandoned oil well, and potential view
impacts to adjacent residential and commercial developments. The site is an
infill parcel surrounded by existing high density residential developments to
the immediate east and west, and light industrial development to the
immediate north. In an effort to mitigate these constraints and to
accommodate the city’s diverse housing needs, the concepts, regulations and
conditions set forth in the SP-22, Summerland Residential Specific Plan are
added to provide for the development of the site with single-family dwellings.



   The specific plan has been prepared in accordance with the requirements
of the California Government Code §§ 64540 through 65507, and addresses all
of the issues and topics specified in that code.



   B.   Location and boundary. The Specific Plan includes an
approximate 0.96-acre area generally located on the north side of E. 23rd
Street between Orange Avenue and Walnut Avenue. The boundaries of the area
are more specifically set forth in Tentative Tract Map 82304.



   C.   Goals and objectives. Goals for the development within the
SP-22, Summerland Residential Specific Plan, include the following:



      1.   Reduce the density allowed on the site from twenty
dwelling units to sixteen dwelling units; and



      2.   Encourage the development of privately owned detached
single-family dwellings; and



      3.   Provide architectural diversity and avoid uniformity of
appearance while achieving a streetscape with pedestrian scale and ambiance
consistent with Signal Hill’s small town character. (Ord. 2019-05-1506 § 1)



20.27.020   Adoption of SP-22, Summerland Residential Specific Plan.



   The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all property shown as
SP-22, Summerland Residential Specific Plan on the official zoning map. (Ord.

agreement shall be recorded in a form approved by the City Attorney requiring
a parking management plan establishing operating restrictions dealing with
parking, use of garages, and similar provisions to enforce the parking,
landscape maintenance, and other provisions of the specific plan. The city

General Plan expresses, in very broad terms, the city's planning of its
future environment, generally on a long-term basis. Adopted by the city as a
legislative act, the General Plan may be amended, as required by changing
circumstances.  The Specific Plan, on the other hand, is a device used to
implement the General Plan by focusing on a particular parcel or parcels. The
Specific Plan sets standards, against which developments can be judged, and
imposes controls on the use of the subject parcels.  The Specific Plan is
more detailed than a General Plan and can be viewed as a bridge between the
General Plan and individual project submittals.



   The intent and purpose of this chapter is to establish a Specific Plan
to guide the physical development of a particular geographic area within the
City of Signal Hill.  In an effort to accommodate the City's diverse housing
needs, the concepts, regulations and conditions set forth in the Freeman
Heights Residential Specific Plan is added to provide for the development of
the site with market-rate single-family dwellings.  Given existing oil
operations at the site, the project will be built in phases.



   The Freeman Heights Residential Specific Plan has been prepared in
accordance with the requirements of the State Government Code (Section 64540
through 65507) and addresses all of the issues and topics specified in that
code.



   B.   Location and Boundary. The Specific Plan includes an area of
approximately 2.6-acres located on the east flank of Signal Hill between
Freeman and Obispo Avenues north of 20th Street. The boundaries of the area
are more specifically set in the approved plans on file in the Community
Development Department at City Hall and as shown on the Official Zoning Map.



   C.   Goals and Objectives. Goals for the development within the
SP-20, Freeman Heights Residential Specific Plan include the following:



   1.   Encourage the development of privately sponsored low-density
housing developments; and



   2.   Provide architectural treatment that is compatible with the
architectural styles identified as preferred in the Freeman Heights Specific
Plan design guidelines; and



   3.   Apply design standards that result in the highest quality
development and achieve streetscapes with pedestrian scale and ambiance
consistent with Signal Hill's small town character.



   4.   Provide architectural diversity and avoid uniformity of
appearance.

   A.   Application of the Specific Plan Concept. A specific plan and
its function may be described by comparison with the general plan. The
general plan expresses in very broad terms the city's planning of its future
environment, generally on a long-term basis. Adopted by the city as a
legislative act, the general plan may be amended as required by changing
circumstances. The specific plan, on the other hand, is a device used to
implement the general plan by focusing on a particular parcel or parcels. The
specific plan sets standards against which development can be judged and
imposes controls on the use of the subject parcels. The specific plan is more
detailed than a general plan and can be viewed as a bridge between the
general plan and individual project submittals. The intent and purpose of
this chapter is to establish a specific plan to guide the physical
development of a particular geographic area within the city. In an effort to
accommodate the city's diverse housing, commercial and industrial needs, the
concept, regulations and conditions set forth in the Pacific Coast Highway
specific plan provide for the development of projects that will stimulate the
economic vitality of the project area. The Pacific Coast Highway specific
plan document and Chapter 20.30 are implementation documents, consistent with
the adopted goals and policies of the city of Signal Hill general plan and
prepared in conformance with California Government Code Sections 65450
through 65457.



   B.   Location and Boundaries of the Specific Plan. The specific plan
area encompasses an approximately one-mile stretch along the north side of
Pacific Coast Highway, located within the incorporated border of Signal Hill;
extending from the alley just east of Junipero Avenue to Reservoir Drive.
Major intersecting streets include Stanley, Molino, Temple, Orizaba, Freeman,
Obispo, Coronado and Redondo Avenues.



   C.   Goals and objectives of the Pacific Coast Highway specific plan
define the intended focus of the document. Future amendments to this specific
plan will be consistent with the goals and objectives stated as follows:



   1.   Enhance the visual image and livability of the residential
neighborhoods adjoining Pacific Coast Highway by assuring that new commercial
uses do not infringe upon the peace, quiet and security of the neighborhood;



   2.   Improve the appearance and economic vitality of Pacific Coast
Highway by establishing consistent design themes for public and private
improvements including enhanced paving, landscaping, community walls, entry
points, street furniture, lighting, building architecture, signage, awnings,
banners, etc.;



   3.   Provide opportunities for development of limited commercial
uses compatible with adjacent residential uses;



   4.   Encourage the development of residential uses along Pacific
Coast Highway as a means of consolidating and recycling substandard size
commercial parcels, and providing a customer base for Pacific Coast Highway
commercial uses;



   5.   Establish precise zoning areas and land use designations for
permitted, prohibited and conditional land uses, and allow opportunities for
the reuse of existing commercial and industrial buildings;



   6.   Encourage lot consolidation and comprehensively planned
commercial, industrial, residential or mixed-use development projects by
providing development incentives and facilitating the entitlement process;



   7.   Encourage mixed-use type development adjacent to PCH transit
corridor facilities;



   8.   Establish an implementation program with funding strategies and
achievable near and long-term objectives.

serves as a basis for the city to consider and act upon more detailed
development proposals submitted by landowners and developers.



   B.   The Crescent Heights Historic District Specific Plan provides
guidelines, concepts, regulations and conditions for relocating historically
significant dwellings to the Crescent Heights Historic District as well as
guidelines for modifications to historic buildings and the new construction
of dwellings which are compatible with the historic buildings in the
district.  This chapter will implement the city's General Plan objectives,
policies and programs as they pertain to the SP-11 area, and establish
consistency between the general plan and zoning ordinance.

20.32.010   Purpose.



   A.   Application of the Specific Plan Concept. A specific plan and
its function may be described by comparison with the general plan.  The
general plan expresses in very broad terms the city's planning of its future
environment, generally on a long-term basis.  Adopted by the city as a
legislative act, the general plan may be amended as required by changing
circumstances.  The specific plan, on the other hand, is a device used to
implement the general plan by focusing on a particular parcel or parcels. 
The specific plan sets standards against which development can be judged and
imposes controls on the use of the subject parcels.  The specific plan is
more detailed than a general plan and can be viewed as a bridge between the
general plan and individual project submittals.



   The intent and purpose of this chapter is to establish a specific plan
to guide the physical development of a particular geographic area within the
city, which is well-suited to development of a self-storage facility given
its proximity to and visibility from the freeway. 



   The freeway self-storage specific plan document and Chapter 20.32 are
implementation documents, consistent with the adopted goals and policies of
the city general plan and prepared in conformance with California Government
Code Sections 65450 through 65457.



   B.   Location and Boundaries of the Specific Plan.  The specific
plan area encompasses an area about 4.4 acres generally located on the west
side of California Avenue between the 405 Freeway to the south and property
currently developed with a Target retail store to the north.



   C.   Goals and Objectives of the Freeway Self-Storage Specific Plan.



   1.   Enhance the visual image and livability of the adjacent North

Area One



20.33.010   Purpose.



   A.   Application of the Specific Plan Concept.



   1.   A specific plan and its function may be described by comparison
with the general plan. The general plan expresses, in very broad terms, the
city's planning of its future environment, generally on a long-term basis.
Adopted by the city as a legislative act, the general plan may be amended, as
required by changing circumstances. The specific plan, on the other hand, is
a device used to implement the general plan by focusing on a particular
parcel or parcels. The specific plan sets standards, against which
development can be judged, and imposes controls on the use of the subject
parcels. The specific plan is more detailed than a general plan and can be
viewed as a bridge between the general plan and individual project submittals.



   2.   The intent and purpose of this chapter is to establish a
specific plan to guide the physical development of a particular geographic
area within the city. In an effort to accommodate the city's diverse housing
needs, the concepts, regulations and conditions set forth in the Cherry
Avenue Corridor residential specific plan, area one, provide for the
development of the site as market rate housing.



   3.   The specific plan has been prepared in accordance with the
requirements of the State Government Code (Section 64540 through 65507) and
addresses all of the issues and topics specified in that code.



   B.   Location and Boundary of Area One. The specific plan area one
is an area of 1.75 acres generally located on the east side of Cherry Avenue
between 19th and 20th Streets. The boundaries of the area are more
specifically set forth in Figure 1, attached to the ordinance codified in
this chapter and on file in the office of the city clerk.



   C.   Goals and Objectives. Goals for the development within the
SP-13, Cherry Avenue Corridor residential specific plan, area one, include
the following:



   1.   Encourage the development of privately sponsored housing
developments.



   2.   Apply design standards which result in the highest quality
development and achieve streetscapes with pedestrian scale and ambiance
consistent with Signal Hill's small town character.



   3.   Provide architectural diversity and avoid uniformity of
appearance.

   1.   A specific plan and its function may be described by comparison
with the general plan. The general plan expresses, in very broad terms, the
city's planning of its future environment, generally on a long-term basis.
Adopted by the city as a legislative act, the general plan may be amended, as
required by changing circumstances. The specific plan, on the other hand, is
a device used to implement the general plan by focusing on a particular
parcel or parcels. The specific plan sets standards, against which
developments can be judged, and imposes controls on the use of the subject
parcels. The specific plan is more detailed than a general plan and can be
viewed as a bridge between the general plan and individual project submittals.



   2.   The intent and purpose of this chapter is to establish a
specific plan to guide the physical development of a particular geographic
area within the city. In an effort to accommodate the city's diverse housing
needs, the concepts, regulations and conditions set forth in the Cherry
Avenue Corridor residential specific plan, area two, provide for the
development of the site as market rate housing.



   3.   The specific plan has been prepared in accordance with the
requirements of the State Government Code (Section 64540 through 65507) and
addresses all of the Issues and topics specified in that code.



   B.   Location and Boundary of Area Two. The specific plan area two
is an area of approximately 0.31 acres generally located on the south side of
19th Street between Cherry and St. Louis Avenues. The boundaries of the area
are more specifically set forth in Figure 1, attached to the ordinance
codified in this chapter and all file in the office of the city clerk.



   C.   Goals and Objectives. Goals for the development within the
SP-13, Cherry Avenue Corridor residential specific plan, area two, include
the following:



   1.   Encourage the development of privately sponsored housing
developments; and



   2.   Apply design standards that result in the highest quality
development and achieve streetscapes with pedestrian scale and ambiance
consistent with Signal Hill's small town character; and



   3.   Provide architectural diversity and avoid uniformity of
appearance.

20.35.010   Purpose.



   A.   Application of the Specific Plan Concept. A specific plan and
its function may be described by comparison with the general plan. The
general plan expresses, in very broad terms, the city's planning of its
future environment, generally on a long-term basis. Adopted by the city as a
legislative act, the general plan may be amended, as required by changing
circumstances. The specific plan, on the other hand, is a device used to
implement the general plan by focusing on a particular parcel or parcels. The
specific plan sets standards, against which developments can be judged, and
imposes controls on the use of the subject parcels. The specific plan is more
detailed than a general plan and can be viewed as a bridge between the
general plan and individual project submittals.



   The intent and purpose of this chapter is to establish a specific plan
to guide the physical development of a particular geographic area within the
city. The subject site is constrained due to its shape, sloping terrain and
on-going oil operations. In an effort to accommodate the city's diverse
housing needs, the concepts, regulations and conditions set forth in the
Cityview Residential Specific Plan provide for the development of the site as
market rate, townhome-style housing.



   The specific plan has been prepared in accordance with the requirements
of the State Government Code (Sections 64540 through 65507) and addresses all
of the issues and topics specified in that code.



   B.   Location and Boundary. The specific plan includes an area of
approximately 3.14 acres generally located on Orizaba Avenue south of 19th
Street. The boundaries of the area are more specifically set forth in Figure
1, attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter and on file in the
office of the city clerk.



   C.   Goals and Objectives. Goals for the development within the
SP-15, Cityview Residential Specific Plan, include the following:



   1.   Encourage the development of privately sponsored housing
developments; and



   2.   Apply design standards that result in the highest quality
development and achieve streetscapes with pedestrian scale and ambiance
consistent with Signal Hill's small town character and serve to buffer
existing residential neighborhoods from commercial uses along Pacific Coast
Highway; and



   3.   Provide architectural diversity and avoid uniformity of
appearance.

detailed than a general plan and can be viewed as a bridge between the
general plan and individual project submittals.



   The intent and purpose of this chapter is to establish a specific plan
to guide the physical development of a particular geographic area within the
city. The subject site is constrained due to sloping terrain, on-going oil
operations, earthquake faults and potential view impacts to adjacent
condominium development. In an effort to mitigate these constraints and to
accommodate the city's diverse housing needs, the concepts, regulations and
conditions set forth in the Villagio Residential Specific Plan provide for
the development of the site with detached single-family dwellings.



   The specific plan has been prepared in accordance with the requirements
of the State Government Code (Section 64540 through 65507) and addresses all
of the issues and topics specified in that code.



   B.   Location and Boundary. The specific plan includes an area of
approximately 1.15 acres generally located on the east side of Gundry Avenue
south of Willow Street. The boundaries of the area are more specifically set
forth in Tentative Tract Map 54375.



   C.   Goals and Objectives. Goals for the development within the
SP-16, Villagio Residential Specific Plan, include the following:



   1.   Reduce the density allowed on the site from twenty-one dwelling
units per acre to ten dwelling units per acre; and



   2.   Attempt to mitigate impacts on views from existing dwellings in
accordance with the city's view policy; and



   3.   Provide architectural diversity and avoid uniformity of
appearance while achieving a streetscape with pedestrian scale and ambiance
consistent with Signal Hill's small town character.

   A.   Application of the specific plan concept.



   1.   A specific plan and its function may be described by comparison
with the general plan. The general plan expresses, in very broad terms, the
city's planning of its future environment, generally on a long-term basis.
Adopted by the city as a legislative act, the general plan may be amended, as
required by changing circumstances. The specific plan, on the other hand, is
a device used to implement the general plan by focusing on a particular
parcel or parcels. The specific plan sets standards, against which
developments can be judged, and imposes controls on the use of the subject
parcels. The specific plan is more detailed than a general plan and can be
viewed as a bridge between the general plan and individual project submittals.



   2.   The intent and purpose of this chapter is to establish a
specific plan to guide the physical development of a particular geographic
area within the city.  The subject site is constrained due to its shape,
sloping terrain and on-going oil operations.  In an effort to accommodate
the city's diverse housing needs, the concepts, regulations and conditions
set forth in the Crescent Square Residential Specific Plan provide for the
development of the site as market rate housing.



   3.   The specific plan has been prepared in accordance with the
requirements of the State Government Code (Section 64540 through 65507) and
addresses all of the issues and topics specified in that code.



   B.   Location and boundary. The specific plan includes an area of
approximately 3.18 acres generally located at the northeast corner of Walnut
Avenue and Crescent Heights Street. The boundaries of the area are more
specifically set forth in the approved plans on file with the Community
Development Department.



   C.   Goals and objectives. Goals for the development within the
SP-17, Crescent Square Residential Specific Plan, include the following:



   1.   Encourage the development of privately sponsored housing
developments; and



   2.   Provide architectural treatment that is compatible with the
architectural styles identified as preferred in the adjacent Crescent Heights
Specific Plan District; and



   3.   Apply design standards that result in the highest quality
development and achieve streetscapes with pedestrian scale and ambiance
consistent with the city's small town character.

20.39.010   Purpose and intent.



   A.   The intent and purpose of this chapter is to establish a
specific plan to guide the physical development of a particular geographic
area within the city well suited for the development of job producing
industrial uses, but constrained due to existing commercial zoning
designations, small size lots, lack of infrastructure and ongoing oil field
operations or leaseholds that prevent or discourage development. In an effort
to accommodate the city's employment needs, the concepts, regulations and
conditions set forth in the general industrial specific plan provide for the
development of industrial uses compatible with surrounding land uses and the
existing circulation system. This specific plan has been prepared in
accordance with the requirements of the State Government Code (Sections 65450
through 65457) and addresses all of the issues and topics specified in those
codes.



   B.   Location and Boundaries. The specific plan includes different
planning areas.  Maps of the planning areas are on file in the offices of
the Community Development Department.



   C.   Goals and Objectives. The following are the goals and
objectives for development within the general industrial specific plan:



   1.   Encourage the development of privately sponsored, jobs
producing, industrial development;



   2.   Encourage the consolidation of existing substandard lots into
parcels of suitable size for contemporary planned industrial development with
adequate parking and good access to major arterial roads and the freeway
system;



   3.   Apply design standards that result in quality development and
achieve streetscapes with attractive buildings, enclosed industrial yards and
well landscaped yards that provide an aesthetically pleasing buffer for
passers-by and neighboring land uses;



   4.   Preserve the quality appearance of an industrial area by
providing good quality landscaping initially and by the establishment of
controls requiring good quality maintenance thereafter; and



   5.   Provide for the development of safe and secure industrial
facilities with adequate infrastructure improvements to promote safe and
efficient vehicular traffic flows of goods and materials, and assure security
through lighting and alarm systems and site designs that discourage
vandalism, theft and other criminal activities.



   D.   Distribution of Land Uses. The distribution of land uses, and
extent of the uses of land, including landscaped setbacks or open spaces,
within the area covered by the plan is shown in the diagram entitled
"Illustrative Site Plan" on file in the offices of the community development
department. The text specifying distribution, location and extent of the uses
of land is contained herein.



   E.   Public and Private Infrastructure. The proposed distribution,
location, and extent and intensity of major components of public and private
transportation, sewage, water, drainage, solid waste disposal, energy and
other essential facilities proposed to be located within the area covered by
the plan and needed to support the land uses described in the plan are shown
in the diagrams entitled "Technical Site Plan/Grading Plan/Street Improvement
Plan" on file in the offices of the community development department. The
text describing the distribution, location, and extent of public and private
improvements is contained in the conditions of approval attached to the
specific plan project and on file in the community development department.



   F.   Development Standards. Development standards and criteria by
which development will proceed and standards for conservation, development,
and utilization of natural resources, where applicable, shall be as described
herein.



   G.   Program Implementation. Program implementation measures
including regulations, public works projects, and financing measures
necessary to carry out projects shall be included in development plans for
each project. The city may implement public works projects to facilitate
coordinated development of and among development projects, and conditions of
approval of development projects may require construction of public
improvements.

20.39.160   Planning areas and additional uses.



   Within the specific plan area it is envisioned that there may be
different planning areas and additional industrial uses may be permitted.
Rather than establish all such uses initially, the intent is to permit uses
to be proposed and then be analyzed environmentally to determine mitigation
and appropriate land use conditions. Accordingly, property within the
atlantic/spring neighborhood and designated 4.2 general industrial on the
general plan land use element, generalized land use map, Figure 3, may be
designated as planning areas of SP-19, and Section 20.39.030 will be amended
to designate the planning area and the permitted uses, and other appropriate
amendments may be made to this specific plan to regulate such uses. Principal
uses, which may be considered within additional planning areas include but
are not limited to manufacturing, machine shop, auto repair, auto body and
paint, warehousing and distribution, assembly, outdoor storage, lumber yard,
roofing yard, light and heavy recycling facilities, hazardous waste
management facilities, solid waste transfer stations, and utility
distribution or generation facilities.  However, nothing herein would
currently permit such uses within SP-19 except through an amendment of SP-19,
which would include the performance of appropriate environmental analysis of
the appropriateness of such use.

I. Area One



20.41.010   Purpose.



   A.   Application of the Specific Plan Concept. A specific plan and
its function may be described by comparison with the general plan. The
general plan expresses in very broad terms the city's planning of its future
environment, generally on a long-term basis. Adopted by the city as a
legislative act, the general plan may be amended as required by changing
circumstances. The specific plan on the other hand is a device used to
implement the general plan, by focusing on a particular parcel or parcels.
The specific plan sets standards against which development can be judged and
imposes controls on the use of the subject parcels. The specific plan is more
detailed than a general plan and can be viewed as a bridge between the
general plan and individual project submittals.



   The intent and purpose of this chapter is to establish a specific plan
to guide the physical development of a particular geographic area within the
city. In an effort to accommodate the city's diverse housing needs, the
concepts, regulations and conditions set forth in the special purpose housing
specific plan, area one, provide for the development of the site as housing
for persons with physical disabilities. The city does not contemplate
development of a facility which provides extensive social and rehabilitation
services. Rather, the project is intended to expand the housing opportunities
available to persons with disabilities.



   The special purpose specific plan has been prepared in accordance with
the requirements of the State Government Code (Section 64540 through 65507)
and addresses all of the issues and topics specified in that Code.



   B.   Location and Boundaries of Area One. The specific plan area is
an area of about 1.23 acres generally located at the northeast corner of
Gaviota and Alamitos Avenues. The boundaries of the area are more
specifically set forth in Figure 1, attached to the ordinance codified in
this chapter and on file in the office of the city clerk.



   C.   Goals and Objectives. Goals for the development within the
SP-7, special purpose housing specific plan, include the following:



   1.   Assure that a specialized population, persons with
disabilities, has access to adequate and affordable housing opportunities;



   2.   Support development of dwelling units expressly designed for
the special needs of disabled persons;



   3.   Encourage the development of privately sponsored housing
developments intended to be occupied by special needs populations;



   4.   Apply design standards which result in the highest quality
development and achieve streetscapes with pedestrian scale and ambiance
consistent with Signal Hill's small town character;



   5.   Provide architectural diversity and avoid uniformity of
appearance; and



   6.   Enhance aesthetic considerations and minimize view impacts by
maintaining finished grades at or below existing grades as identified on the
Official 1960 Topographic Map.



(Ord. 98-12-1243 § 4 (part); Ord. 98-09-1240 (part): Ord. 94-10-1186 § 1
(part))



20.41.020   Adoption of SP-7, special purpose housing specific plan.



   The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all property shown as
SP-7, special purpose housing specific plan on the official zoning map.



(Ord. 94-10-1186 § 1 (part))



20.41.030   Use classifications.



   A.   Principal Uses. The following uses shall be permitted within
the SP-7, special purpose housing specific plan, area one. Unlisted uses
shall be prohibited.



   1.   Multifamily dwelling units available for rent.



   2.   Transitional housing, supportive housing and licensed group
homes serving six persons or fewer are an allowed land use “by right” per
Cal. Gov’t Code § 65583.



   B.   Accessory Uses. The following accessory uses shall be permitted
in conjunction with the development of a multifamily housing project at the
site.



   1.   Home occupations, not to exceed one such use per dwelling;



   2.   Open space and recreational facilities including swimming
pools, spas and community meeting rooms;



   3.   Common-area parking lot.



   C.   Occupancy Restrictions. Except for the manager's unit,
occupancy of the dwelling units developed pursuant to the special purpose
housing specific plan shall be restricted to persons with physical
disabilities and their attendants/companions consistent with the terms of the
"regulatory agreement and declaration of covenants and restrictions" executed
between the city and the Crippled Children's Society. Upon expiration of the
agreement, the developer or subsequent property owner(s) shall have the
option of:



   1.   Entering into a new agreement with the city which would
restrict occupancy of the project to persons with physical disabilities and
their attendants/companions; or



   2.   Upon the construction of any additional parking as may be
required pursuant to Section 20.41.120 of this chapter, offering the units
for rent to the general public.

II. Area Two



20.41.170   Purpose.



   A.   Application of the Specific Plan Concept. A specific plan and
its function may be described by comparison with the general plan. The
general plan expresses in very broad terms the city's planning of its future
environment, generally on a long-term basis. Adopted by the city as a
legislative act, the general plan may be amended as required by changing
circumstances. The specific plan, on the other hand, is a device used to
implement the general plan by focusing on a particular parcel or parcels. The
specific plan sets standards against which development can be judged and
imposes controls on the use of the subject parcels. The specific plan is more
detailed than a general plan and can be viewed as a bridge between the
general plan and individual project submittal.



   The intent and purpose of this chapter is to establish a specific plan
to guide the physical development of a particular geographic area within the
city of Signal Hill. In an effort to accommodate the city's diverse housing
needs, the concepts, regulations and conditions set forth in the special
purpose housing specific plan provide for the development of area two with
single-family, detached dwellings, some of which will be restricted for sale
to households earning no more than one hundred twenty percent of the median
income for Los Angeles County.



   The special purpose specific plan has been prepared in accordance with
the requirements of the State Government Code (Section 65450 through 65457)
and addresses all of the issues and topics specified in that code.



   B.   Location and Boundaries of Area Two. The specific plan area is
an area of about one acre generally located at the northeast corner of
Pacific Coast Highway and Junipero Avenue. The boundaries of the area are
more specifically set forth in Figure 1, attached to the ordinance codified
in this part and on file in the office of the city clerk.



   C.   Goals and Objectives. Goals for the development within the
SP-7, special purpose housing specific plan area two, include the following:



   1.   Assure that a particular segment of the population, households
earning no more than one hundred twenty percent of the median income for Los
Angeles County has access to adequate and affordable housing opportunities;



   2.   Encourage the development of privately sponsored housing
developments which include dwelling units intended to be occupied by
households earning no more than one hundred twenty percent of the median
income for Los Angeles County;



   3.   Apply design standards which result in the highest quality
development and achieve streetscapes with pedestrian scale and ambiance
consistent with Signal Hill's small town character;



   4.   Provide architectural diversity and avoid uniformity of
appearance.

20.41.560   Purpose.



   A.   Application of the Specific Plan Concept. A specific plan and

general plan and individual project submittals.



   The intent and purpose of this chapter is to establish a specific plan
to guide the physical development of a particular geographic area within the
city of Signal Hill. In an effort to accommodate the city's diverse housing
needs, the concepts, regulations and conditions set forth in the special
purpose housing specific plan, Area four is added to provide for the
development of an affordable multi-family housing project, childcare center
and public park. Services envisioned for the housing development include:
on-site childcare, offices and classroom facility for provision of on-site
social services programs, communal laundry facilities, a community room with
associated support space, a police resource center and a public park. With
the exception of the public park and the police resource center, the city
does not contemplate development of a facility which relies on extensive city
services and the operator shall be responsible for providing services to the
residents.



   The special purpose specific plan has been prepared in accordance with

20.41.800   Purpose.



   A.   Application of the Specific Plan Concept. A specific plan and
its function may be described by comparison with the general plan. The
general plan expresses, in very broad terms, the city's planning of its
future environment, generally on a long-term basis. Adopted by the city as a
legislative act, the general plan may be amended, as required by changing
circumstances. The specific plan, on the other hand, is a device used to
implement the general plan by focusing on a particular parcel or parcels. The
specific plan sets standards, against which developments can be judged, and
imposes controls on the use of the subject parcels. The specific plan is more
detailed than a general plan and can be viewed as a bridge between the
general plan and individual project submittals.



   The intent and purpose of this chapter is to establish a specific plan
to guide the physical development of a particular geographic area within the
City of Signal Hill. In an effort to accommodate the city's diverse housing
needs, the concepts, regulations and conditions set forth in the Special
Purpose Housing Specific Plan, Area 5 is added to provide for the development
of an affordable multi-family housing project for both senior and family
households. The city does not contemplate development of a facility that
relies on extensive city services and the operator shall be responsible for
providing services to the residents.



   The Special Purpose Specific Plan has been prepared in accordance with
the requirements of the State Government Code (Section 64540 through 65507)
and addresses all of the issues and topics specified in that code.



   B.   Location and Boundary of Area 5. The Specific Plan Area 5 is an
area of approximately 1.42 acres located on the east side of California
Avenue between Burnett and Willow Streets. The boundaries of the area are
more specifically set forth on the approved site plan on file with the
community development department.



   C.   Goals and Objectives. Goals for the development within the
SP-7, Area 5, Special Purpose Housing Specific Plan include the following:



   1.   Assure that low-income senior and family households have access
to adequate and affordable housing opportunities.



   2.   Support development of dwelling units expressly designed for
the special needs of senior households.



   3.   Support development of dwelling units expressly designed for
the special needs of low-income families including both two- and
three-bedroom rental units.



   4.   Encourage the development of privately sponsored housing
developments intended to be occupied by low- and moderate-income families.



   5.   Apply design standards which result in the highest quality
development and achieve streetscapes with pedestrian scale and ambiance
consistent with Signal Hill's small town character.



   6.   Provide architectural diversity and avoid uniformity of
appearance.

20.41.925   Purpose.



   A.   Application of the Specific Plan Concept.  A Specific Plan and
its function may be described by comparison with the General Plan.  The
General Plan expresses, in very broad terms, the city's planning of its
future environment, generally on a long-term basis.  Adopted by the city as
a legislative act, the General Plan may be amended, as required by changing
circumstances.  The Specific Plan, on the other hand, is a device used to
implement the General Plan by focusing on a particular parcel or parcels. 
The Specific Plan sets standards, against which developments can be judged,
and imposes controls on the use of the subject parcels.  The Specific Plan
is more detailed than a General Plan and can be viewed as a bridge between
the General Plan and individual project submittals.



   The intent and purpose of this chapter is to establish a Specific Plan
to guide the physical development of a particular geographic area within the
City of Signal Hill. In an effort to accommodate the city's diverse housing
needs, the concepts, regulations and conditions set forth in the Special
Purpose Housing Specific Plan, Area 6 is added to provide for the development
of an affordable multi-family housing project for both senior and family
households.  The city does not contemplate development of a facility that
relies on extensive city services and the operator shall be responsible for
providing services to the residents.



   The Special Purpose Specific Plan has been prepared in accordance with
the requirements of the State Government Code (Sections 64540 through 65507)
and addresses all of the issues and topics specified in that code.



   B.   Location and Boundary of Area 6.  The Specific Plan Area 6 is
an area of approximately  1.61-acres located on the south side of Hill
Street between Gundry and Walnut Avenues and shown on the Official Zoning
Map. 



   C.   Goals and Objectives.  Goals for the development within the
SP-7, Area 6, Special Purpose Housing Specific Plan include the following:



   1.   Assure that low-income households have access to adequate and
affordable housing opportunities.



   2.   Support development of dwelling units expressly designed for
the special needs of low-income families including both two and three bedroom
living rental units.



   3.   Encourage the development of privately sponsored housing
developments intended to be occupied by low- and moderate- income families.



   4.   Apply design standards which result in the highest quality
development and achieve streetscapes with pedestrian scale and ambiance
consistent with Signal Hill’s small town character.



   5.   Provide architectural diversity and avoid uniformity of
appearance.

   A.   Application of the Specific Plan Concept. A specific plan and
its function may be described by comparison with the general plan. The
general plan expresses, in very broad terms, the city's planning of its
future environment, generally on a long term basis. Adopted by the city as a
legislative act, the general plan may be amended as required by changing
circumstances. The specific plan, on the other hand, is a device used to
implement the general plan by focusing on a particular parcel or parcels. The
specific plan sets standards against which development can be judged, and
imposes controls on the use of the subject parcels. The specific plan is more
detailed than a general plan and can be viewed as a bridge between the
general plan and individual project submittals.



   The intent and purpose of this chapter is to establish a specific plan
to guide the physical development of a particular geographic area within the
city. In an effort to accommodate the city's diverse housing needs, the
concepts, regulations and conditions set forth in the Signal Hill village
specific plan provide for the development of the site with single-family,
detached dwelling units some of which will be restricted for sale to
households earning no more than one hundred twenty percent of the median
income for Los Angeles County.



   The Signal Hill village specific plan has been prepared in accordance
with the requirements of the State Government Code (Section 64540 through
65507) and addresses all of the issues and topics specified in that code.



   B.   Location and Boundaries of the Specific Plan. The specific plan
area is an area of about 2.75 acres generally located along Pacific Coast
Highway between the former Pacific Electric Railroad right-of-way to the west
and Junipero Avenue to the east. The boundaries of the area are more
specifically set forth in Exhibit A, attached to the ordinance codified in
this chapter and on file in the office of the city clerk.



   C.   Goals and Objectives. Goals for the development within the
SP-8, Signal Hill village specific plan, include the following:



   1.   Assure that a particular segment of the population, households
earning no more than one hundred twenty percent of the median income for Los
Angeles County, has access to adequate and affordable housing opportunities;



   2.   Encourage the development of privately sponsored housing
developments which include dwelling units intended to be occupied by
households earning no more than one hundred twenty percent of the median
income for Los Angeles County;



   3.   Apply design standards which result in the highest quality
development and achieve streetscapes with pedestrian scale and ambiance
consistent with Signal Hill's small town character; and



   4.   Maintain continuity in character with the adjacent existing
neighborhood and present variety in architectural style.

20.49.010   Purpose.



   A.   The purpose of this chapter is to guide the physical
development of various parcels of land which are well-suited to large,
single-tenant retail commercial uses because of their accessibility and
visibility to users of adjoining major surface streets. The highest quality
development of these parcels, however, may be hindered by certain
combinations of site characteristics, including two or more of the following:



   1.   Topography which makes compliance with city parking and grading
standards impractical without expensive retaining walls;



   2.   Lot frontage-to-depth ratios greater than one-to-one which make
unified development of relatively large parcels infeasible;



   3.   Presence of operating or previously abandoned oil wells;



   4.   Frontage on heavily-travelled thoroughfare where minimizing
number of mid-block vehicle ingress and egress driveways promotes safe and
efficient traffic flow.



   B.   Parcels subject to this code section share the following traits
advantageous to orderly development and promotion of the highest quality
physical development through application of the development standards in this
section:



   1.   Location at the intersection of a major surface street with
another surface street of any designation, excepting alleys;



   2.   Location within the landscape overlay zone;



   3.   Lot size of one hundred thousand square feet or more.



   C.   Goals for development within the SP-6, commercial corridor
specific plan include the following:



   1.   To achieve optimal use of each site for the purposes of
providing a strong retail base and generating sales tax revenues to the city;



   2.   To achieve a cohesiveness in building design on and among
parcels within the specific plan, and with parcels in different zoning
classifications located along the same major surface street corridor;



   3.   To achieve site design that facilitates safe and efficient
vehicular flow to, from, and on each site.

residential uses, and promotes the goals of the zone more than the previous
use.



   4.   In making a determination that a particular use is a less
intensive industrial use, the community development director may require
repair and/or exterior rehabilitation of an industrial building to reduce or
mitigate the building's aesthetic impact on surrounding residential areas.



   5.   On any application for a determination of less intensive
industrial use, the party seeking the determination shall provide the
community development director with such information as the community
development director deems necessary to make the determination.



   F.   Permitted Repairs and Alterations for Nonconforming Uses.
Repairs and alterations of nonconforming uses shall be subject to the
limitations contained in Signal Hill Municipal Section 20.82.030.

   A.   Prior to receipt of an application for a conditional use
permit, the department of planning and community development shall cause an
inspection to be made of all buildings and structures in the proposed
condominium conversion project. The department shall prepare an inspection
report identifying all items in violation of Title 15 of this code, and any
equipment and facilities determined to be deteriorated or hazardous. The
applicant shall pay a fee for the inspection as established by resolution of
the city council.



   B.   The applicant shall correct all violations of Title 15 of this
code and repair or replace any equipment or facilities determined by the
building inspector to be deteriorated or hazardous prior to approval of the
final map for the conversion. The applicant shall pay a fee for any
additional inspections required to determine compliance as established by
resolution of the city council.



   C.   The department of planning and community development shall
issue a certificate of occupancy for all condominium conversion projects upon
satisfactory compliance with all conditions of approval, requirements of this
chapter, Title 18 of this code, and state law. Said certificate shall be
required prior to the sale, lease, use or occupancy of any building or
structure as a condominium, regardless of the previous use, occupancy or
tenancy, and regardless of whether any changes, alterations or modifications
have been made to any portion of any existing building or structure.



(Ord. 83-03-904 § 5 (part))



20.50.090   Conversions–Special standards.



   A.   All condominium conversions shall comply with all requirements
of Title 15 of this code.



   B.   In addition to any other requirements of this chapter, any
condominium conversion shall comply with the following requirements, unless
waived by the commission in accordance with the provisions of this chapter:



   1.   The off-street parking requirements of the RH zoning district
in effect at the date of application shall apply, but available off-street
unenclosed surface parking spaces located on the property to be converted,
with the exception of a tandem space(s), and/or parking space located within
the front yard setback, shall count towards meeting the parking requirements.



   2.   The consumption of gas and electricity within each condominium
unit shall be separately metered so that the unit owner can be separately
billed for each utility. Either a separate water shutoff valve shall be
provided for each condominium unit, or a separate water shutoff valve shall
be provided for each plumbing fixture in each condominium unit.



   3.   The density provisions of the zoning district in effect at the
time of application shall apply, but the conversion of multiple residential
units constructed under a different density standard may be approved if the
number of condominium units does not exceed twice the number of units
allowable under the standards existing at the time of application.



   4.   The outdoor living space provisions of the zoning district in
effect at the time of application shall apply, but the conversion of multiple
residential units constructed under a different standard may be approved
where at least half of the current area requirements for outdoor living space
are met.



   5.   The trash storage area requirements of Ordinance No. 78-4-789*
shall apply to condominium conversions in the zoning districts specified
therein and also to conversions involving more than two units.



(Ord. 2006-09-1364 § 11: Ord. 83-03-904 § 5 (part): Ord. 80-7-849 § 1;

20.50.100   Conversions–Waiver of special standards.



   In granting a conditional use permit for condominium conversion the
commission or council may waive any of the special requirements of Section
20.50.090 where the condominium conversion development taken as a whole and
subject to the conditions of the conditional use permit achieves the intent
of Section 20.50.010 and of this chapter.



(Ord. 83-03-904 §§ 5 (part) and 6; Ord. 78-11-809 § 2 (part): prior code
§ 19.52. 620 (D))



20.50.110   Conversions–Tenants' rights.



   A.   No final subdivision map shall be approved by the planning
commission or city council until the developer presents satisfactory evidence
that the developer has complied with all notice requirements of the
Subdivision Map Act, including giving each tenant written notice of the
intention to convert and of the tenants' exclusive right to contract for
purchase of their respective units. The developer shall give special
consideration to tenants who are senior citizens and to tenants who are
handicapped.



   B.   The applicant shall provide moving expenses equal to three
times the monthly rent to any tenant who was a tenant at the time of the
condominium conversion application and who relocates from the building to be
converted after approval of the conversion by the city, except when the
tenant has given notice of his intent to move prior to receipt of
notification from the applicant of his intent to convert.



(Ord. 83-07-910 § 3: Ord. 83-03-904 § 5 (part): Ord. 78-11-809 § 2 (part):

20.50.120   Conversions–Maximum number.



   A.   The maximum number of units which may be approved for
conversion to condominiums in any fiscal year, commencing July 1st and ending
June 30th of each year, shall not exceed the number of new two-family or
multiple-family rental dwelling units for which building permits were issued
by the city during the previous fiscal year. In the event that fewer than the
maximum number of units permissible are converted in a given fiscal year, the
surplus will be carried over to the following fiscal year. In the event that
any application for condominium conversion would cause or result in the
number of units in the city converted to condominiums during that fiscal year
to exceed the number of new two-family or multiple-family rental dwelling
units for which building permits were issued by the city during the previous
fiscal year, then that application shall be denied but, upon the request of
the applicant at the time of denial, shall be reconsidered for approval or
disapproval by the city during the next fiscal year ahead of other
condominium conversion applications which were subsequently filed with the
city.



   B.   Exceptions. This section shall not be applicable to any project
having a total of four units or less, provided that the number of units in
said project shall be considered as approved for conversion for purposes of
calculating the maximum number of units which may be approved for conversion
to condominiums in any fiscal year, in accordance with subsection A of this
section.



   C.   Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the planning
commission or city council may approve a condominium conversion use permit
where such approval causes the number of units converted to condominiums to
exceed the number of new two-family or multiple-family rental dwelling units
for which building permits were issued by the city during the previous fiscal
year, if all of the following findings are made:



   1.   The proposed conversion will not displace a significant
percentage of low- and moderate-income tenants, senior citizen tenants, or
tenants with children, or delete a significant number of low- and
moderate-income rental units from the city's housing stock, at a time when
sufficient equivalent housing is not readily available in the area;



   2.   The community benefits which are derived from the provisions of
affordable home ownership opportunities are increased by the conversion of
the proposed project;



   3.   If the existing apartment complex contains fifty percent or
more low- and moderate-income households, as defined by Section 50093 of the
California Health and Safety Code, the applicant agrees to enter into and
record a development agreement with the city, approved as to form and content
by the city attorney, which guarantees at least one of the following:



   a.   Retention of an adequate supply of affordable dwelling units
for low- and moderate-income households, as determined by the planning
commission or city council, as part of the conversion project;



   b.   Provision of an adequate supply of affordable dwelling units,
prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the conversion project,
for low- or moderate-income households on alternative sites in the city.



   The number of dwelling units to be afforded to low- and moderate-income
households pursuant to this subsection shall be determined by the planning
commission or city council, based on the number and characteristics of
existing tenant households in the proposed conversion project, including
income, family size, length of residence, age of tenants, and similar
criteria. In order to meet the requirements of this subsection, the applicant
shall submit as part of his condominium conversion application a report and
supporting data concerning the above criteria.



   4.   Tenants of twenty-five percent or more of the units proposed
for conversion have consented to the proposed conversion.



(Ord. 83-03-904 § 5 (part))



20.50.130   Conversions–Organizational documents.



   All organizational documents described in Section 20.50.050 shall be
submitted to and approved by the city prior to issuance of building permits,
if any are required, or at the time of approval of the conversion if no
building permits are required.

20.50.150   Conditional use permit determinations.



   A.   Following the filing of an application for a condominium
conversion or the filing of a subdivision map application for condominium
purposes where a conditional use permit is required, the planning commission
shall hold a public hearing and make findings, establish conditions, and make
recommendations as provided in Chapter 20.64, except that the public hearing
need not be held until the time at which the commission considers the
subdivision map.



   B.   In addition to the findings required in Chapter 20.64, the
planning commission or city council shall not approve or conditionally
approve a conditional use permit for condominium conversion unless they find
that:



   1.   All provisions of this chapter are met and the project will not
be detrimental to the health, safety and general welfare of the city;



   2.   The overall design and physical condition of the conversion
project will result in a project which is aesthetically attractive, safe, and
of quality construction;



   3.   The proposed conversion will not displace a significant
percentage of low- and moderate-income or senior citizen tenants, or tenants
with children, at a time when sufficient equivalent housing is not readily
available in the area;



   4.   The proposed conversion will not delete a significant number of
low- and moderate-income rental units from the housing stock which would
preclude the reasonable mobility of tenants within the city;



   5.   The applicant has not engaged in any coercive or retaliatory
action regarding the tenants following the submittal of the initial
application to the city for condominium conversion. In making this finding,
consideration shall be given to:



   a.   Whether there have been rent increases at a rate greater than
the rate of increase in the Consumer Price Index (Los Angeles-Long Beach),
unless such increases are provided for in written agreements in existence
prior to the submittal to the city of the initial application for condominium
conversion,



   b.   Any other action which is taken against tenants to coerce them
to refrain from opposing the project. An agreement with tenants which
provides for benefits to the tenants after condominium conversion approval
shall not be considered a coercive or retaliatory action;



   6.   The requirements of Section 20.50.120 have been met.

20.52.010   Generally.



   No person shall construct any building or structure or make structural
and physical improvements, additions, extensions and/or exterior alterations,
and no permit shall be issued for each construction until the site plan and
design has been submitted to, reviewed by, and approved in accordance with
this chapter. The property may only be developed, used and maintained in
accordance with the approved site plan and design review.



(Ord. 91-09- 1112 (part): Ord. 90-05-1067 § 1 (part))



20.52.020   Purposes of provisions.



   A.   General. The purpose of site plan and design review is to
ensure that proposed development is in conformity with the intent and
provisions of this title and to guide city departments in the issuance of
permits. In addition, it is the purpose of this chapter to ensure that
proposed development relates to the topography, and to prevent excessive
similarity, dissimilarity or inappropriateness in building design and
appearance in relation to present and proposed buildings and structures,
because such would adversely affect the development, use, occupancy, health,
safety and welfare of surrounding areas for residential, commercial or
industrial uses or purposes, and by so doing, impair the benefits of
occupancy of existing property in such areas; such would impair the stability
and value of both improved and unimproved real property in such areas and
prevent appropriate development of such areas.



   B.   Redevelopment Approval. An additional purpose of this chapter
is to provide a means of regulation and control of construction of all new
improvements and the substantial modification, alteration, repair or
rehabilitation of existing improvements, within any Signal Hill redevelopment
project area adopted by the redevelopment agency and the city council
pursuant to the community redevelopment law of the state, as well as all
amendments thereto. Under the provisions of community redevelopment law, the
height of buildings, and land coverage, building, utility, landscaping, signs
and design criteria, traffic circulation, traffic access and other
development and design controls for proper development of both public and
private areas within a project as may be established by the agency. Within
any project area, no new improvements shall be constructed and no existing
improvements shall be substantially modified, altered, repaired or
rehabilitated except in accordance with plans submitted to and approved by
the agency. In addition, all development in any project area shall comply
with all applicable state and local laws, codes and ordinances in effect from
time to time, including the zoning ordinance, and, in addition, any
requirement of the redevelopment agency imposed from time to time by or
pursuant to any redevelopment plan. It shall be a purpose and function of
site plan and design review to review and pass on all such new improvements
or substantial modification, alteration, repair or rehabilitation of any
existing improvements within any redevelopment project area, in accordance
with the approved redevelopment plan, as well as all applicable state and
local laws, codes and ordinances in effect from time to time, the zoning
ordinance, and, in addition, any requirement of the redevelopment agency
imposed by or pursuant to community redevelopment law. Therefore, no building
permit or occupancy permit can be issued for construction or occupancy of any
new improvement or any modification, alteration, repair or rehabilitation of
an existing improvement within the project area until the application for
such a permit has been found by the agency to be consistent with the
redevelopment plan.



   C.   In addition, pursuant to community redevelopment law, the
redevelopment agency may require the owner or purchaser of the property to
enter into an agreement, in which such owner or purchaser shall agree to the
imposition of such restrictions as are necessary to carry out any
redevelopment plan. The redevelopment agency may require such an agreement as
a condition to the issuance of a building permit. In those cases where such
an agreement is made and entered into, the purpose of site plan and design
review shall be to ascertain compliance with the agreement.



(Ord. 91-09-1112 (part): Ord. 90-05-1067 § 1 (part))



20.52.030   Review procedures.



   A.   Informal Review. Prior to filing a formal application for site
plan and design review, applicants are encouraged to submit drawings to the
department of planning and community development for informal review and
comments. Applicants with applications subject to planning commission site
plan and design review are further encouraged to schedule, through the
department of planning and community development, an informal review workshop
with the planning commission prior to processing a final application for site
plan and design review.



   B.   Prerequisites to Review. For properties with abandoned wells,
prior to filing a formal application for site plan and design review,
applicants must complete the prerequisite requirements pursuant to Section
16.24.020 and the Oil Services Coordinator shall submit a summary report
pursuant to Section 16.24.060, including provision of an “at risk” letter
if the intent is not to complete well abandonments prior to site plan and
design review. The letter shall acknowledge that the success or failure to
complete well abandonments in compliance with the city’s equivalency
standard will determine whether wells may be built over or in close proximity
to as indicated on the well access exhibit marked “no access”, pursuant
to Section 16.24.050(B). Further, the letter shall state that it is
understood that failure to abandon wells to the city’s equivalency standard
will prohibit development over or in close proximity to the wells resulting
in revisions to the site plan and potentially additional site plan and design
review pursuant to Chapter 20.52.



   C.   Review by the Director. The site plan and design review
applications set forth in this section shall be reviewed and approved,
conditionally approved, or denied by the director of the department of
planning and community development or the director’s designated
representative, based on findings made pursuant to Section 20.52.050 and
without prior notice to the applicant. However, the applicant shall be
notified in writing of the director’s decision. If the director of the
department of planning and community development approves a site plan or
design review application under this section, the applicant shall be entitled
to issuance of necessary permits upon compliance with all preconditions to
such issuance after expiration of the appeal period as provided in subsection
D of this section. The director of the department of planning and community
development may refer any application made pursuant to this section to the
planning commission for determination. All site plan and design review
applications filed in conjunction with variance, conditional use permit,
zoning ordinance amendment and tentative tract map requests will be reviewed
by the planning commission. Those site plan and design review applications
subject to the director’s approval are as follows:



   1.   Construction of new buildings, additions or extensions which
are ten thousand square feet or less in gross floor area in any commercial or
industrial zone;



   2.   Construction of first story additions or extensions of five
hundred square feet or less (exclusive of garages, covered or uncovered
patios, balconies, and walkways, eaves for other architectural projections,
and uncovered tennis courts, pools, spas, and similar recreational
facilities) to an existing dwelling unit;



   3.   All exterior structural and physical improvements relocations,
and/or exterior alterations of or to existing buildings and structures,
including physical site improvements. Physical site improvements shall
include, but are not limited to, landscaping, parking and loading areas,
driveways, walls, signs, fences and trash enclosures.



   D.   Review by the Planning Commission. The director of the
department of planning and community development or the director’s
designated representative shall review all applications and site plans
submitted pursuant to Section 20.52.040 to determine if they are complete.
Except as provided in subsection B of this section, the application and
accompanying drawings, if deemed complete, shall be forwarded to the planning
commission for review and determination at a regularly scheduled meeting in
accordance with the submittal deadlines for such meetings as posted in the
department of planning and community development. The applicant shall be
notified within thirty calendar days on the completeness of the application.
If the application is deemed complete, notification will include the
tentatively scheduled date of the formal review. If the application is deemed
incomplete, notification will include a list of items necessary to complete
the application, and a date by which all of the information must be submitted
in order to be scheduled for the next regular hearing date. Notice of the
hearing on the application for site plan or design review shall be given as
provided in subsection G of this section. The planning commission shall make
findings as set forth in Section 20.52.050, and based on such finds shall
either approve, conditionally approve, or deny any application for site plan
or design review. The planning commission may, from time to time, continue
its deliberations on any application to another meeting or meetings.



   E.   Appeals to Planning Commission. Except as otherwise provided in
subsection B of this section, the applicant or any aggrieved party may appeal
to the planning commission a decision of the director of the department of
planning and community development to deny or conditionally approve any
application for site plan and design review by filing an appeal in writing
with the director of the department of planning and community development
within ten calendar days following the date of written notification to the
applicant of the director’s decision. If a timely appeal is not filed, the
director’s decision shall be final. The planning commission shall hear the
matter at their next regularly scheduled meeting at which the matter can be
heard. Notice of the hearing on the application for site plan and design
review shall be given as provided in subsection F of this section. The
planning commission may sustain, modify, or overrule the decision of the
director. In so doing, the planning commission shall make the findings and
apply the standard of review contained in Section 20.52.050. The
determination of the planning commission shall be final unless an appeal to
the city council is timely filed.



   F.   Appeals to the City Council. The applicant or any aggrieved
party may appeal to the city council any decision of the planning commission
on an application for site plan and design review by filing an appeal in
writing with the city clerk within ten calendar days of the planning
commission meeting at which the matter can be heard. Notice of the hearing on
the application for site plan and design review shall be given as provided in
subsection G of this section. The city council may sustain, modify, or
overrule any decision of the planning commission. In so doing, the city
council shall make findings and apply the standard of review set forth in
Section 20.52.050. The decision of the city council shall be final.



   G.   Notice of the Hearing. Whenever notice of a planning commission
or city council hearing on a site plan or design review application is
required by this section, such notice shall be sufficient if given in writing

   2.   The proposed project is in conformance with any redevelopment
plan and regulations of the redevelopment agency and any executed owner’s
participation agreement or disposition and development agreement;



   3.   The following are so arranged as to avoid traffic congestion,
to ensure the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to prevent
adverse effect on surrounding properties:



   a.   Facilities and improvements;



   b.   Pedestrian and vehicular ingress, egress, and internal
circulation;



   c.   Setbacks;



   d.   Height of buildings;



   e.   Signs;



   f.   Mechanical and utility service equipment;



   g.   Landscaping;



   h.   Grading;



   i.   Lighting;



   j.   Parking;



   k.   Drainage;



   l.   Intensity of land use;



   4.   The topography is suitable for the proposed site plan and the
site plan, as proposed, is suitable for the use intended;



   5.   The proposed development provides for appropriate exterior
building design and appearance consistent and complementary to present and
proposed buildings and structures in the vicinity of the subject project
while still providing for a variety of designs, forms and treatments.



   B.   Site Plan and Design Review Criteria. In reviewing any site
plan or design review application pursuant to the requirements of this
chapter, the director of the department of planning and community
development, the planning commission, or the city council, as the case may
be, shall utilize the following criteria:



   1.   The overall development plan integrates land with building
forms and achieves architectural unity and environmental harmony within the
development, consistent with the objective of emphasizing and enhancing the
positive aesthetic characteristics existing, developing or to be developed in
the surrounding area;



   2.   Structures shall be situated so as to respect and respond to
the existing topography, to minimize alteration of natural land forms, to
minimize disruption of desirable trees and vegetation, and to minimize
interference with the privacy of and views from surrounding properties;



   3.   Building pads should be established and graded as near to
existing topographic elevations as possible and in such manner as to blend
with contours of adjoining properties and avoid abrupt transitions;



   4.   The size and location of proposed structures enhance, protect
or minimize interference with the views of or vistas to the hill which is
that area generally bounded by Willow Street on the north, 21st Street on the
south, Cherry Avenue on the west and Temple Avenue on the east, from major,
modified, and secondary modified streets and from any other public areas;



   5.   Exterior building treatments are restrained, not harsh or
garish, and selected for durability, wear characteristics, ease of
maintenance, and initial beauty. All exterior treatments are coordinated with
regard to color, materials, architectural form and detailing to achieve
design harmony and continuity. Exposed metal flashing or trim should be
anodized or painted to blend with the exterior colors of the building;



   6.   Rooflines on a building are compatible through-out the
development and with surrounding development;



   7.   Buildings and related outdoor spaces are designed to avoid
abrupt changes in building scale. The height and bulk of buildings are in
scale with surrounding sites and do not visually dominate the site or call
undue attention to buildings. Structures higher than two stories emphasize
horizontal, as well as vertical appearance, e.g., by the use of projection or
recession of stories, balconies, horizontal fenestration, changes in roof
levels or planes, landscaping or outdoor structures or detailing, to convey a
more personal scale;



   8.   The development protects the site and surrounding properties
from noise, vibration, odor, and other factors which may have an adverse
effect on the environment;



   9.   The designs of buildings, driveways, loading facilities,
parking areas, signs, landscaping, lighting and other project features are
responsive both to functional requirements, such as automobile, pedestrian
and bicycle circulation, and to aesthetic concerns including the visual
impact on other properties and from the view of the public street;



   10.   The designs of accessory structures, fences and walls are
harmonious with main buildings, insofar as possible, the same building
materials are used on all structures on the site;



   11.   Proposed signs, and the materials, size, color, lettering,
location and arrangement thereof, are an integrated part of and complementary
to the overall design of the entire development;



   12.   Landscaping is incorporated in such a way as to complement the
overall development, enhance visual interest and appeal, and visually
integrate buildings within the natural setting. Landscaping shall include
combinations of trees, shrubs, turf, and groundcover with major emphasis on
utilization and retention of native species and drought tolerant plant
materials suited to local climatic conditions. Landscaping in parking areas
shall be located so as to provide visual relief from expanses of paved
surfaces. Landscaping buffers shall be used to screen exterior trash and
recycling areas, loading docks and ramps, electrical utility boxes and
transformers, and fire flow valves and backflow preventers;



   13.   Landscape buffers should also be used, in conjunction with
earthen berms, to minimize the visual impact and presence of vehicles by
screening them from view to the extent feasible from both on-site and
off-site vantage points;



   14.   Mechanical and utility service equipment is designed as part
of the structure or is screened consistent with building design. Electrical
transformers shall not be located in required front yard setbacks. Large vent
stacks and similar features should be avoided, but if essential, are screened
from view or painted to be nonreflective and compatible with building colors.
Rooftop mechanical equipment shall be screened from view of public
rights-of-way or integrated into the design of the structure. Particular
attention should be paid to minimizing the visual impact of rooftop equipment
which may be visible from properties or rights-of-way at higher elevations;



   15.   Natural space-heating, cooling, ventilation and day lighting
are provided, to the extent possible, through siting, building design and
landscaping. Deep eaves, overhangs, canopies and other architectural features
that provide shelter and shade should be encouraged;



   16.   Trash enclosures and truck loading areas, to the extent
feasible, shall be located out of view from public rights-of-way, and shall
be of appropriate size and shape to accommodate additional receptacles for
recycling materials;



   17.   Proposed building, walkway, and parking lighting enhances
building design and landscaping, as well as security and safety, and does not
create glare for occupant on adjoining properties;



   18.   Drainage is provided so as to avoid flow onto adjacent
property;



   19.   On new development, all utility facilities are underground;



   20.   Adequate provisions are made for fire safety;



   21.   All Oil and Gas Code development standards contained in
Chapter 16.24 are met., and a condition of approval has been added that prior
to issuance of any certificate of occupancy for developments constructed over
or in close proximity to abandoned wells, the property owner shall record a
declaration of CC&Rs, in a form subject to the review and approval of the
City Attorney, putting future owners and occupants on notice of the
following: the existence of abandoned wells on the site; that the wells
within the area of development have been leak tested and found not to leak;
description of any methane mitigation measures employed; disclosure that
access to these wells has been provided to address the fact that they may
leak in the future causing potential harm; acknowledgment that the state may
order the reabandonment of any well should it leak in the future;
acknowledgment that the state does not recommend building over wells; and
releasing and indemnifying the city for issuing project permits.



   22.   All zoning ordinance development standards are met.

community development may grant an extension of site plan and design review
approval for a period not to exceed six months from the original date of
expiration, or may refer such request to the planning commission for
determination. In no event, however, shall any such extension be granted for
a period which exceeds one year from the original expiration date.



   B.   Any changes or revisions to an approved site plan shall be
subject to approval in accordance with this chapter.



   C.   Notwithstanding subsection (A), any site plan and design review
approval shall expire and become null and void at the same time any building,

20.52.070   Required dedications and improvements.



   A.   If the director of the department of planning and community
development, the director of public works, the planning commission, or the
city council finds that the development of the property subject to site plan
and design review will increase vehicular traffic in that area, the director
of planning and community development, the director of public works, the
planning commission, or the city council may require as a condition to the
approval of a site plan that an applicant provide the following street
dedications and improvements reasonably in proportion to increased vehicular
traffic which the director of the department of planning and community
development, the director of public works, planning commission, or the city
council determines is caused by development on the subject property:



   1.   When the development borders or is traversed by an existing
street, the following may be required:



   a.   Minor Streets, Local Streets, and Cul-de-sacs. Dedication of
all necessary rights-of-way to widen the street to its ultimate width
determined by the city in accordance with city ordinances and regulations;

and grading and improving the roadway for a distance of eighteen feet from
the curb.



   2.   When the development does not border or is not traversed by an
existing street, frontage roads or new roads of any class determined by the
director of the department of planning and community development, the
director of public works, the planning commission, or the city council to be
necessary due to the development shall be dedicated to the city. Such streets
or roads shall be fully graded and improved with curbs, gutters, sewers,
drainage; sidewalks, street trees, street signs, street lighting, water
mains, driveway approaches, required utilities, and grading and paving;
provided, that where the street or road is indicated as an eventual major
street on the general plan, the amount of grading and paving required shall
not exceed that required for such existing streets under subsection (A)(1)(a)
of this section.



   B.   All improvements shall be made in accordance with Chapter 12.04
of this code. If the city determines that it is impractical to require
installation of required improvements at the time of the development of the
subject property, the applicant shall enter into a written agreement to make
such improvements in the future. In the event that such an agreement is
required, the applicant shall, at the time of entering into the agreement,
deposit with the city funds in an amount equal to the estimated costs of the
improvement, as determined by the city, or the applicant shall post with the
city a performance bond to guarantee the completion of such improvements in
the future. In any event, the applicant shall be required to install such
improvements upon written demand therefor by the city.

limit is about to expire.  Failure to provide such notice shall not prevent
a permit from being declared null and void pursuant to subsection (A). 



(Ord. 2013-06-1454 § 1)



20.52.110   Construction time limits - Extensions.



   A.   The time periods in section 20.52.100(A)(3) above may be
extended, provided a written request for extension is submitted by the permit
holder to the Director of Community Development, the Building Official, or
his or her appointed representative, at least thirty calendar days prior to
expiration of the time period.  The request for extension must contain
written justification for the extension and must include documentation of
financing, if any, obtained to complete the project.  A fee shall be
required for any request for extension, in an amount established by City
Council resolution; but in the event a deposit is already on file for the
project, the city's costs of processing the request for extension shall be
deducted from the deposit.



   B.   Upon receiving a request for extension, the Director of
Community Development shall provide notice of the request to all property
owners within a one-hundred-foot radius of the boundary of the subject
property as shown on the last equalized assessment roll (unless the City View
Policy applies, in which case noticing shall be consistent with the
procedures of the View Policy).  The notice shall provide a ten calendar day
public comment period during which any person may submit written comments to
the Director of Community Development regarding the request for extension.



   C.   If no written public comments postmarked or hand-delivered
during the public comment period are received, the Director of Community
Development shall be the approving authority for any first extension
request.  If one or more public comments postmarked or hand-delivered during
the public comment period are received, the Planning Commission shall be the
approving authority for any first extension request.  The Planning
Commission shall be the approving authority for all second extension
requests.  No second extension request may be made unless a first extension
request has been approved previously. 



   D.   The approving authority shall approve a request for extension
when, in its discretion, the request demonstrates good cause.  In
determining whether a request demonstrates good cause, the approving
authority shall consider each of the following criteria:



   1.   Whether substantial progress has been made toward project
completion.



   2.   Whether the condition of the property presents health or safety
hazards. 



   3.   Delays due to difficulties related to site topography.



   4.   Delays due to material suppliers or labor-related issues.



   5.   Delays due to an earthquake, fire, flood, explosion, act of
God, or other circumstances beyond the applicant's control.



   6.   Delays caused by the City or other government entity. 



   7.   Other unusual factors, if any. 



   The applicant's financing, or lack thereof, shall not be considered in
deciding whether there is good cause for an extension. 



   E.   When the Planning Commission is the approving authority, it
shall hold a public hearing on the request, to be noticed in the same manner
as provided in section 20.52.030(F).  The decision of the approving
authority shall be by letter or resolution, describing the reasons for the
decision based on the criteria in section 20.52.110(D).  The Director of
Community Development shall mail the approving authority's decision to the
permit holder by first-class mail, postage prepaid, enclosing an affidavit or
certificate of mailing.  The decision of the approving authority shall be
final, unless appealed pursuant to subsection (F) or (G) below. 



   F.   Any decision of the Director of Community Development to deny a
request for extension may be appealed to the Planning Commission, which shall
conduct a public hearing and de novo review, applying the criteria listed in
subsection (D).  The public hearing shall be noticed in the same manner as
provided in section 20.52.030(F).  Any such appeal shall be filed in writing
within seven days of service of the decision of the Director of Community
Development.  The Planning Commission's decision on such an appeal shall
state its reasons for decision, shall be served on the permit holder in the
same manner as described in subsection (E), and shall be final unless
appealed pursuant to subsection (G) below.



   G.   Any decision of the Planning Commission on a request for
extension may be appealed to the City Council, which shall conduct a public
hearing and de novo review, applying the criteria listed in subsection (D). 
The public hearing shall be noticed in the same manner as provided in section
20.52.030(F).  Any such appeal shall be filed in writing within seven days
of service of the decision of the Planning Commission. The City Council's
decision on such an appeal shall state its reasons for decision, shall be
served on the permit holder in the same manner as described in subsection
(E), and shall be final.



   H.   Upon a final decision approving a request for extension, the
time period in section 20.52.100(A)(3) shall be extended by the time listed
in Table 2 below, based on project size.  No permit shall be deemed null and
void pursuant to section 20.52.100 while a valid request for extension is
pending.  If the project's construction time limit has already expired at
the time of the final decision, the extension time shall run from the date of
service by mail of the final decision.

   1.   For the first thirty days after expiration of the construction
time limit, there shall be no penalty.



   2.   For each day thereafter, the City may impose a penalty of two
hundred dollars per day. The total sum of penalties imposed pursuant to this
section shall not exceed thirty-six thousand dollars for any single project.



   B.   Imposition of any penalties pursuant to this section shall not
prevent the Building Official or Community Development Director from later
deeming a permit null and void pursuant to section 20.52.100.



   C.   After a building, grading, or demolition permit has been deemed
null and void pursuant to section 20.52.100, any conditions on the project
site that constitute a public nuisance as described in section 8.12.010 may
be abated as provided in Chapter 8.12 of this code, in addition to any other
remedies provided by law. 



   D.   Any continuance of the work authorized by the building,
grading, or demolition permit after it has been deemed null and void shall
constitute a public nuisance that may be abated as provided in Chapter 8.12
of this code, in addition to any other remedies provided by law.

20.58.150   Enforcement--Removal of signs.



   The requirements for enforcement of sign regulations and removal of
illegal signs are as follows:



   A.   Where it is determined that a sign has been erected or
installed in violation of this chapter, abandoned as defined in Section
20.58.050, improperly maintained as provided in Section 20.58.140(C), or is
otherwise in violation of this chapter, written notice of this determination
and the grounds therefor shall be sent or delivered to the owner of the sign
or, where ownership of the sign is not known, to the owner of the property
where the sign is posted. If the notice cannot be sent or delivered to the
owner of the sign, then the notice shall also be attached to the sign. The
notice shall give the owner of the sign or property, as the case may be, ten
business days from the date of mailing or attachment, as the case may be, to
remove the sign or to appeal the determination and shall include instructions
for how such appeal may be made.



   B.   To appeal the determination, the owner of the sign or the
property, as the case may be, may file a written request with the director of
planning and community development no later than the deadline given to remove
the sign. The director or designee shall arrange an appointment to review the
notice of violation and to allow the owner to present evidence to rebut the
determination. After all of the facts have been reviewed, the director shall
write a decision setting forth the basis of the final determination. The
decision shall be delivered to the owner of the sign or the property, as the
case may be, personally or by certified mail within ten days of the decision.
The owner of the sign or the property, as the case may be, may appeal the
decision in accordance with Chapter 20.52.



   C.   If neither the owner of the sign nor the owner of the property
responds to the notice of violation under subsection A of this section, the
director of planning and community development shall then notify the owner of
the property by certified mail, that the period to appeal has passed and that
if the sign is not removed within ten business days from the date of the
notice, a misdemeanor citation will be filed.



   D.   Notwithstanding any other provisions herein to the contrary,
public information signs in the public right-of-way have been determined by
the director of planning and community development to have nominal value and
if posted in clear disregard of the provisions of this chapter, may be
removed without notice or hearing.



   E.   Where it is determined that the sign in question poses an
imminent safety hazard or dangerous condition, which may affect the public
health, safety and welfare, such sign may be removed immediately and stored
by the city. As soon as practical following removal, the owner of the sign
shall be given notice of violation and the right to a hearing pursuant to
subsection B of this section, and if the owner establishes such removal to be
improper, the owner shall be entitled to return of the signs without charge.
In all other cases, the sign will be returned to the owner only upon payment
of removal and storage costs. If the sign is not claimed within thirty days
after the decision become final, the sign may be destroyed.

20.65.010   Purpose.



   A.   It is the policy of the City of Signal Hill, pursuant to the
Federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 and the California's Fair
Employment and Housing Act, to provide people with disabilities and
developers of housing for the disabled reasonable accommodation in rules,
policies, practices and procedures that may be necessary to ensure eoual
access to housing. Both the Federal Fair Housing Amendment Act of 1988 and
the California's Fair Employment and Housing Act impose an affirmative duty
on local governments to make reasonable accommodations (modifications or
exceptions) in their zoning and land use regulations and practices when such
accommodations may be necessary to afford disabled persons an equal
opportunity to housing. Section 804(f)(3)(B) of the Federal Fair Housing
Amendments Act of 1988 states that the following is a prohibited practice: "a
refusal to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or
services, when such accommodations may be necessary to afford such person
egual opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling."



   B.   The purpose of this chapter is to codify a process for making
reguests for reasonable accommodation to zoning and land use decisions and
procedures regulating the siting, funding, development and use of housing for
people with disabilities. In these regulations, "use of housing" includes,
but is not limited to, housing related services and the use and enjoyment of
the property.



(Ord. 2016-10-1492 § 1)



20.65.020   Definitions.



   For the purpose of this chapter, the following definitions shall apply
unless the context clearly indicates or requires a different meaning.



   A.   “Acts.” The Federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 and
California's Fair Employment and Housing Act.



   B.   “Person with a disability.” As defined under the Acts, a
person who has a physical or mental impairment that limits or substantially
limits one or more major life activities, anyone who is regarded as having
such impairment or. anyone who has a record of such impairment. The term
physical or mental impairment may include conditions such as blindness,
hearing impairment, mobility impairment. HIV infection, mental
retardation-chronic fatigue, learning disability, head injury, and mental
illness. The term major life activity may include seeing, hearing, walking,
breathing, performing manual tasks, caring for oneself, learning, speaking,
or working.



(Ord. 2016-10-1492 § 1)



20.65.030   Procedures.



   A.   At all public counters where application is made for a permit,
license or other authorization for the siting, funding, development, or use
of housing, a notice shall be prominently displayed advising applicants that
they may reguest a reasonable accommodation of existing rules, policies,
practices and procedures, and the process for requesting an accommodation
shall be available at all public counters where decisions are made regulating
the siting, funding, development and use of housing.



   B.   In order to make specific housing available to an individual
with a disability, any person may reguest a reasonable accommodation in the
rules, policies, practices and procedures regulating the siting, funding,
development or use of housing by submitting a Fair Housing Accommodation
Request letter and filing it with the community development department.



   C.   If an individual needs assistance in making the reguest for
reasonable accommodation, the community development department shall provide
the assistance necessary to ensure that the process is accessible to the
applicant.



   D.   A request letter for reasonable accommodation shall be
addressed to the director of community development and shall state the basis
of the request, including but not limited to a modification or exception to
the regulations, standards and practices for the siting, development and use
of housing or housing related facilities that would eliminate regulatory
barriers and provide an individual with a disability egual opportunity to
housing of his or her choice.



   E.   If the project for which the reguest for reasonable
accommodation is being made also reguires some other discretionary approval
(including, but not limited to, conditional use permit, design review,
general plan amendment, zone change- annexation, and the like), then the
applicant shall file the required Fair Housing Accommodation Reguest for
concurrent review with the application for discretionary approval.



   F.   The director of community development, or his or her designee,
shall investigate the facts bearing on the application, and compile the
information necessary for a decision on the application.



   G.   The director of community development, or his or her designee,
may reguest additional information necessary for making a determination on
the reouest for reasonable accommodation that complies with the fair housing
law protections and the privacy rights of the individual with a disability to
use the specified housing. If additional information is requested, the 30-dav
time period for making a determination on the reguest stops running until the
additional information is provided.



   H.   The director of community development shall issue a written
notice of decision within thirty (30) days of the date of the submittal of a
complete application and may grant the accommodation request, deny the
reguest, offer approval of an alternate accommodation, or approve the reguest
with conditions. The written decision is to be based on the contents of the
application and a consideration of the factors set forth in this chapter.



(Ord. 2016-10-1492 § 1)



20.65.040   Findings.



   A.   The written decision to grant, grant with modifications, or
deny a reguest for reasonable accommodation shall be consistent with the
Acts, and shall, if granted, be granted to an individual and shall not run
with the land (unless the director of community development or designee
determines that such modification is physically integrated into the
residential structure and cannot easily be removed), and shall be based on
consideration of the following factors:



   1.   Whether the housing, which is the subject of the reguest for
reasonable accommodation, will be used by an individual with disabilities
protected under the Acts;



   2.   Whether the reguested accommodation is necessary to make
housing available to an individual with disabilities protected under the Acts;



   3.   Whether the reguested accommodation would impose an undue
financial or administrative burden on the city;



   4.   Whether the reguested accommodation would require a fundamental
alteration in the nature of the city's zoning and land use regulations: and



   5.   Whether there are any alternative reasonable accommodations
which may provide an eguivalent level of benefit to the applicant.



   B.   All written decisions shall give notice of the applicant's
right to appeal and to reguest reasonable accommodation in the appeals
process as set forth in Section 20.65.060.



(Ord. 2016-10-1492 § 1)



20.65.050   Conditions of approval.



   A.   The conditions of approval, if any, may, where deemed
appropriate, provide for any or all of the following:



   1.   Inspection of the affected premises periodically, as specified
in the conditions, to verify compliance with any applicable conditions of
approval.



   2.   Prior to any transfer of interest in the premises, notice to
the transferee of the existence of the modification, that the modification is
granted to an individual and does not run with the land, and the requirement
that the transferee apply for a new modification if necessary. Once such
transfer takes effect, the modification shall have no further validity.



   3.   Removal of the improvements, where removal would not constitute
an unreasonable and unfair financial burden, if the need for which the
accommodation was granted no longer exists.



   4.   Time limits and/or expiration of the approval if the need for
which the accommodation was granted no longer exists.



   5.   Other conditions deemed necessary to protect the public health,
safety and welfare.



   B.   Any grant of accommodation for an individual with a disability
may, at the discretion of the decision maker, be considered as a personal
accommodation for the individual applicant and may, at the determination of
the decision maker, not run with the land. Accordingly, any approval may be
conditioned to provide for its rescission or automatic expiration under
appropriate circumstances.



   C.   The violation of a required condition shall constitute a
violation of this chapter and may constitute grounds for revocation of the
grant of accommodation.



(Ord. 2016-10-1492 § 1)



20.65.060 Appeals.



   The applicant or any aggrieved party may appeal to the planning
commission a decision of the director of community development by filing an
appeal in writing with the director of community development within ten (10)
calendar days following the date of written notification to the applicant of
the director's decision. If a timely appeal is not filed, the director's
decision shall be final. The planning commission shall hear the matter at
their next regularly scheduled meeting at which the matter can be heard.
Notice of the hearing on the appeal shall be given in accordance with Section
20.52.030(G). The planning commission may sustain, modify, or overrule the
decision of the director. In so doing, the planning commission shall make the
findings and apply the standard of review contained in Section 20.65.040. The
planning commission's decision may be appealed to the city council in
accordance with Section 20.52.030(F) and Section 20.52.030(G).

recordation of any map or by voluntary sale, contract of sale, or conveyance
of any kind which creates a new parcel of land under separate ownership which
consists of less than the minimum lot area required for the district of which
such lot is a part; provided, however, that a tolerance of ten percent shall
be allowed as to this requirement when the parcel so created is irregular in
shape.



   B.   Any person participating in such division in violation of this
section, whether as seller, grantor, purchaser, or grantee, shall as
principal in the transaction be guilty of a misdemeanor. Any deed or

poorer overall project design, the planning commission upon request or upon
its own initiative may select an alternate front lot line.

20.70.070   Access and location.



   There shall be adequate vehicular access from a dedicated and improved
street, service road or alley. The design, number and location of such access
route(s) shall be approved by the city engineer. Access to parking lots and
parking spaces shall comply with the following standards:



   A.   No parking space shall be so located as to require the moving
of any vehicle on the premises in order to enter or leave any other parking
stall, unless an attendant is present at all times during the use of the
parking facility.



   B.   In all commercial and industrial districts, including
commercial uses with the CR district, all access to individual parking spaces
shall be from the property itself and shall not be directly from a public
street or alley.



   C.   Automobile parking shall be so arranged as to prevent vehicles
from backing into major, secondary modified highways or local collector
streets. This standard may be waived by the city engineer when both of the
following conditions exist: 1) the property has no access to a public alley,
and 2) the width of the lot and location of existing structures make is
possible for vehicles to feasibly turn around on site so as to enter the
street moving forward.

20.72.090   Traffic study areas.



   There are a number of areas throughout the city where conditions exist
which require a more thorough and special traffic analysis based upon future
development projects before precise street alignment can be identified. The
conditions which exist in these areas, which areas are shown by the letter
"A" on the "Official Plan Lines Map of the City of Signal Hill," include the
following:



   A.   Undeveloped and/or substandard streets which primarily provide
access to oil operations. Such roadways were mapped more than fifty years ago
and may not adequately address such issues as design speeds, severe grade
changes, circulation, property access, view corridors, indirect traffic
impacts and development potential;



   B.   A number of relatively long dead-end streets exist where there
is still a reasonable possibility for continuation through to other existing
streets in order to improve overall traffic circulation and public safety;



   C.   Areas exist where large scale development may occur based upon
developable land areas available. In some cases the need for new streets may
exist while certain existing streets and alleys may be eliminated, modified
or realigned in order to better serve overall traffic circulation.



   Development in each study area shall include a complete traffic
analysis of the study area, prepared by a registered traffic engineer for
review and approval by the city engineer. The study shall review existing and
proposed roadway alignments, traffic patterns, view corridors, property
access, cumulative traffic impacts, need for traffic control devices,
development potential and zoning. The study shall recommend the precise
alignment of streets within the subject study area. The study shall avoid the
following conditions: cul-de-sacs on streets exceeding six hundred feet in
length, street grades exceeding ten percent, creation of double-frontage
lots, offset intersections less than one hundred fifty feet apart, inadequate
design speeds and skewed intersections. The development shall be in
accordance with the recommendations in the study, as approved by the city
engineer.



(Ord. 87-11-997 § 5 (part))



20.72.100   Violations prohibited.

privately owned, shall be erected, altered, moved in or placed within the
official plan lines of streets and highways as adopted by this chapter except
for signs as specified in Chapter 20.58, Signs; and no permit or approval in
any other manner therefore shall be issued by any official or employee of the
city.



   Any permit or approval issued in violation of this chapter, unless
approved by proper procedure for a variance as outlined in this title, shall
be null and void. This section shall not apply to gardens or to other
permitted front yard uses.

review upon request.



(Ord. 87-11-997 § 5 (part))



20.72.130   Exceptions.



   The city engineer may make minor reductions to any of the standards
contained herein of up to five percent of the right-of-way width, except for
the drivable width of streets and alleys as identified in the official plan
lines pursuant to Section 20.72.020 of this chapter, upon request or upon his
or her own initiative, including but not limited to reducing the amount of
dedication necessary on given streets or alleys. The city engineer may also
require minor additional dedication beyond the standard street width, where a
proposed development is adjacent to a public transportation facility and
where improvements thereto are warranted. In addition, the following streets
and alleys shall have the following right-of-way widths notwithstanding

   20.82.070   Provisions applicable to lawful uses only.



*   Prior ordinance history: Prior code §§ 19.80.010--19.80.060; Ord.
557 § 406 as amended by Ord. 582 § 1(59, 60) and Ords. 69-10-647, 78-9-808
and 79-11-833.



20.82.010   Purpose of provisions.



   Within the districts established by this title there exist lots,
buildings, and uses which were lawful before the ordinance codified in this
title was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or
restricted under the terms of the zoning ordinance or future amendment. It is
the intent of this chapter to permit these noncon-formities to continue
subject to certain conditions. For the purpose of protecting the public
health, safety, and general welfare, however the enlargement or alteration of
such nonconformities shall be regulated. Nothing within this chapter shall be
deemed to permit the continuation of a public nuisance.



(Ord. 88-12-1023 § 1 (part))



20.82.020   Continuation of nonconforming uses permitted.



   Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, nonconforming lots,
structures, or uses existing in any zoning district may be continued but may
not be constructed, established, altered, modified, reconstructed, replaced,
or enlarged in any way which increases the nonconformity.



(Ord. 88-12-1023 § 1 (part))



20.82.024   Nonconforming industrial uses in residential zones.



   A.   For any property containing a nonconforming industrial use in a
residential zone, the use may be continued, sold or ownership transferred
without forfeiting any nonconforming rights previously established, but
subject to the limitations of Sections 20.82.020 and 20.82.030.



   B.   For any property containing a nonconforming industrial use in a
residential zone, a less intensive industrial use may be permitted on the
property without loss of all nonconforming status, subject to the approval of
the director of planning. The director of planning shall determine, based
upon the standards contained in this section what constitutes a less
intensive industrial use. Once the property has been changed to a less
intensive use, it may not be restored to the more intensive use.



   C.   Factors which the director of planning may consider in making a
determination of what constitutes a less intensive industrial use may
include, but are not limited to the following:



   1.   Whether the proposed use will generate less odor, dust, or
fumes than the prior nonconforming use;



   2.   Whether the proposed use will generate less noise which may
negatively impact nearby residents than the prior use;



   3.   Whether the proposed use will generate less traffic than the
prior use, or will otherwise diminish traffic congestion in the area or will
promote traffic safety more than the prior use;



   4.   Whether the proposed use would lessen any danger of water
contamination or degradation, soil contamination, or other environmental
hazard; and



   5.   Whether the proposed use is harmonious with surrounding
residential uses, and promotes the goals of the zone more than the previous
use.



   D.   In making a determination that a particular use is a less
intensive industrial use, the director of planning may require repair and/or
exterior rehabilitation of an industrial building to reduce or mitigate the
building's aesthetic impact on surrounding residential areas.



   E.   On any application for a determination of less intensive
industrial use, the party seeking the determination shall provide the
director of planning with such information as the director of planning deems
necessary to make the determination.



   F.   The director of planning shall advise the applicant of the
determination in writing and shall state the reasons therefor.



(Ord. 90-03-1060 § 1)



20.82.030   Permitted repairs and alterations.



   A.   Repairs and alterations which do not enlarge or increase the
size or scope of a nonconforming structure or use may be made, provided that
the aggregate value of all such repairs or alterations from the time the
structure or use became nonconforming shall not exceed fifty percent of the
reasonable replacement value of the nonconforming building or use immediately
prior to such repair and/or alterations.



   B.   Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 20.82.020, the
provisions of this chapter shall not prevent the reconstruction, repair, or
rebuilding of any nonconforming commercial or industrial building or of any
building in which a nonconforming use is conducted when such building is
damaged by fire, explosion, or act of God, provided that the cost of such
reconstruction, repair, or rebuilding shall not exceed fifty percent of the
reasonable replacement value of the building immediately prior to the damage.



   C.   For purposes of this chapter, "reasonable replacement value"
shall be based upon current per/square/foot building valuation data as
published periodically by the International Conference of Building Officials
for the structure and occupancy type of the destroyed or damaged structure.
"Cost of repair" shall be based upon the average of at least two bona fide
bids submitted by contractors licensed by the state of California to perform
such repairs.



   D.   A nonconforming residential structure damaged or destroyed by
fire, explosion, or act of God may be reconstructed in conformity with all
applicable provisions of the zoning ordinance in effect at such time as the
original building permits were issued for such structure subject to the
following:



   1.   The density, height, and lot area coverage of a replacement
structure or reconstructed structure shall not exceed that of the destroyed
or damaged structure;



   2.   Setback dimensions, open space area, and the number of garages
and on-site parking shall not be less than that which existed prior to damage
or destruction;



   3.   A nonconforming residential structure for which building
permits were issued prior to April 7, 1964, and which is damaged by any means
may be reconstructed in conformity with the provisions of the zoning
ordinance in effect as of April 7, 1964, and subject to subparagraphs 1 and 2
of subsection D of this section.



   E.   A nonconforming residential structure in a district in which
residential uses are no longer permitted may be reconstructed regardless of
the extent of damage, subject to the applicable zoning ordinance as
determined in subsection D. Development standards for reconstruction shall be
those of the residential district of the applicable zoning ordinance which
allows maximum permissible densities not greater than the density represented
by the sum of all residential units on the subject property immediately prior
to damage, provided the reconstructed habitable floor area and number of
units do not exceed that of the destroyed structure(s).



(Ord. 88-12-1023 § 1 (part))



20.82.040   Permitted additions and expansion.



   A.   Structures which are nonconforming only as to setbacks and/or
building height may be expanded subject to present development standards of
the zoning ordinance provided that the total floor area of all such
expansions permitted subsequent to April 7, 1964, is not greater than fifty
percent of the floor area of the original structure.



    B.   Residential structures in districts permitting residential
uses and which are nonconforming only as to on-site parking may be expanded
provided that, if cumulative expansion from the time the structure became
nonconforming exceeds two hundred square feet of habitable area, such
structures shall be brought into conformity as to present on-site parking
requirements.



    C.   Additions to single-family and duplex structures with
nonconforming sideyard setbacks may be constructed so as to extend the
building wall(s) adjoining such nonconforming sideyard(s) provided the
cumulative habitable area of all such additions does not exceed two hundred
square feet.



    D.   Any addition or expansion permitted pursuant to this chapter
shall comply with all present development standards contained in the zoning
ordinance applicable to the nonconforming structure or use.



(Ord. 88-12-1023 § 1 (part))



20.82.050   Nonconforming lots.



   Legally created residentially-zoned lots of record as of the effective
date of the ordinance codified in this chapter which are nonconforming as to
minimum lot area may be developed with not more than one dwelling unit.



(Ord. 88-12-1023 § 1 (part))



20.82.060   Effect of discontinuance.



   A.   The discontinuance of use of a nonconforming structure, or use
for a continuous period of one hundred eighty days, or the intentional
abandonment of a nonconforming building or use, shall be deemed to constitute
abandonment of any nonconforming rights ascribed to the property under this
chapter.



   B.   Any change in a nonconforming lot, building, or use to a more
restrictive or conforming status shall constitute abandonment of the previous
nonconforming rights.



20.82.070   Provisions applicable to lawful uses only.



   This chapter applies only to nonconforming lots, buildings, and uses
lawfully established and used and conducted in accordance with all applicable
laws, except to the extent of the nonconformity with the zoning ordinance
codified in this title.

20.84.010   Purpose and authority.



   When practical difficulties, unnecessary hardships, or results
inconsistent with the general intent and purpose of this title occur by
reason of strict interpretation of any of its provisions, the planning
commission, upon its own motion may, or upon a verified application shall,
initiate proceedings for consideration of a variance from the provisions of
this title.



(Prior code § 19.84.010 (Ord. 557 § 407 (part), 1964))



20.84.020   Conditions required prior to granting variance.



   The planning commission, before it may grant a variance, shall make a
finding that in the evidence presented all five of the following conditions
exist in reference to the property being considered:



   A.   There are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or
conditions applicable to the property involved or to the intended use of the
property which do not apply generally to other property in the same district.



   B.   Such variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment
of a substantial property right of the applicant, which right is possessed by
other property owners under like conditions in the same district.



   C.   The granting of such a variance will not be materially
detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to property and improvement in
the district in which the property is located.



   D.   The granting of such a variance will not be contrary to the
objectives of the general plan.



   E.   A variance is for the purpose of permitting the use of a lot to
the same level as other lots in the same district, and under no conditions
shall such variance be used to grant special privilege or the development of
uses not specifically permitted in the district.



(Prior code § 19.84.020 (Ord. 557 § 407(A), 1964))



20.84.030   Application procedure.

the plaintiff in an action in eminent domain to acquire the property.



   B.   Application shall be made to the commission on forms furnished
by the city, shall set forth in detail the reasons for the requested
variance, shall show how the conditions set forth in Section 20.84.020 are
satisfied, and shall provide other information as may be prescribed by the
commission to assist in determining the validity of the request.



   C.   The building inspector, or a person delegated by him, shall
verify the accuracy and completeness of the application. The date of
verification shall be noted on the application, and such date shall be deemed
to be the filing date. Verification shall be made within fifteen days of the
date of the filing of the application.



   D.   In cases where the building inspector considers the reasons as
set forth on the application not all within the scope of the variance
procedure, the applicant shall be so informed; whereupon, if the application
is filed and the fees are accepted, the application shall be signed by the
applicant to the effect that he was so informed. Acceptance of an application
does not constitute an indication of approval.

party owning property within three hundred feet of the external boundaries of
the subject property.



   B.   The council, upon receipt of an appeal, if it finds that the
facts stated by the applicant in his written notice of appeal do not warrant
a further hearing, shall affirm the action of the commission and deny the
appeal.



   C.   The council, upon determining that an appeal is for good cause
warranted, shall enter such decision upon the minutes and set the matter for
a public hearing. Notices shall be given as provided in Section 20.84.060.



   D.   The council shall, not less than ten nor more than forty days
after legal notice of a public hearing on a variance application, hold the
public hearing. The appellant shall present at the hearing information and
data to indicate the manner in which the commission erred in its decision.
The council decision shall be final unless appealed of competent jurisdiction
within fifteen days.



(Prior code § 19.84.040 (Ord. 557 § 407(C), 1964))



20.84.100   Revocation for noncompliance--Voiding of variance.



   A.   The commission may revoke any variance for noncompliance with
the conditions set forth in granting the variance after notice and hearing.
Upon instruction from the commission, the city engineer shall cause ten days'
notice of hearing to be given to the holder of the variance which is being
considered for revocation. The action of the commission in revoking any
variance may be appealed to the council in the same manner as an appeal from
a decision of the commission in granting or denying a variance.



   B.   Each variance granted under the provisions of this chapter
shall become void when:



   1.   The construction authorized by the variance is not commenced
within one year after the granting of the variance or is not pursued
diligently to completion; or



   2.   The occupancy or use of land or buildings authorized by the
variance has not taken place within one year after the granting of the
variance; or



   3.   There is a cessation in the occupancy or use of land or
buildings authorized by the variance for a period in excess of one year.



   C.   Where circumstances beyond the control of the applicant cause
delays which do not permit compliance with the time limitation established in
subsection B of this section, the commission may grant an extension of time
for a period not to exceed an additional one-year period. Application for
such extension of time must set forth in writing the reasons for the
extension and must be filed with the city clerk before the expiration of the
variance.



   D.   The provisions of this section shall apply to variances issued
prior to May 7, 1964, including variances issued by the legislative bodies or
planning commissions of other political jurisdictions covering territory
subsequently annexed to the city, but the one-year period specified in
subsection B(2) of this section shall not commence to run until May 7, 1964,
or the date of annexation, whichever occurs later. The provisions of
subsection C of this section shall also apply to such variances provided the
commission finds that an extension would not be detrimental or injurious to
property in the neighborhood.

20.84.110   Minor deviations.



   A.   The purpose of a minor zoning adjustment procedure is to
provide a simplified means of considering minor deviations from certain
development standards set forth in any zone which are not detrimental to the
public health, safety or welfare.



   B.   Any person, firm, corporation or other entity may apply in
writing to the director of the department of planning and community
development for a minor zoning adjustment. The director of the department of
planning and community development shall review and make a determination
concerning all applications for minor zoning adjustments. Applications for
minor zoning adjustments shall be limited to an application for any one or
more of the following:



   1.   A reduction in lot and building area requirements by not more
than ten percent of that otherwise required in any zone;



   2.   A reduction in setback requirements by permitting portions of a
building to extend into and occupy not more than ten percent of the required
setback;



   3.   A reduction in parking requirements for commercial or
industrial uses by not more than ten percent; provided, that the reduction
does not exceed two parking spaces for any lot.



   C.   In approving or conditionally approving a minor zoning
adjustment, the director of the department of planning and community
development shall find that because of special circumstances applicable to
the property, including size, shape, topography, location or surroundings,
the strict application of development standards set forth for the zone
deprives such property of privileges enjoyed by other property in the zone.
In addition, the director of the department of planning and community
development shall find:



   1.   There are practical reasons or benefits of improved design
which justify a deviation from prescribed development standards.



   2.   The adjustment, with any conditions imposed, will provide equal
or greater benefit to adjacent property.



   3.   The adjustment is not in conflict with the objectives of the
general plan or the general intent of this title.



   D.   Upon appeal to the planning commission of any decision of the
director of the department of planning and community development made
pursuant to this section, the planning commission shall set the matter for
hearing and determination in accordance with this chapter.

   No person, including the original applicant, shall reapply for a
similar variance on the same land, building, or structure within a period of
one year from the date of the final decision on such previous application,
unless such decision is a denial without prejudice.

   A.   The secretary of the planning commission shall set all
proposals for amendments for public hearing not more than forty days after

the city council, planning commission, or director of planning and community
development, as the case may be.



   B.   Notice of the required public hearing shall contain a general
explanation of the matter to be considered, a general description of the
property and area affected, the time and place of the hearing, and other
pertinent data.



   C.   When the zoning ordinance amendment involves a change in the
zoning regulations prescribed in the ordinance, notice shall be given by at
least one publication in a newspaper of general circulation in the city; or
if there is none, it shall be posted in at least three public places in the
city, at least ten days before the hearing.



   D.   When the zoning ordinance amendment involves the
reclassification of property, in addition to giving notice, as specified by
subsection C of this section, notice of the hearing shall be given by mail or
delivered to all persons, including businesses, corporations, or other public
or private entities, shown on the last equalized assessment roll as owning

will be continued, and such announcement will serve as sufficient notice of
such continuance and without recourse to the form of public notice as
provided for in Section 20.86.060.



   C.   Upon the completion of a public hearing, the commission shall

21.04.010   Purpose.



   This title is intended to provide a method whereby the burdens of
installing public improvements, the need  for which  is created by
residential, commercial, and industrial development projects and which will
benefit certain land in addition to such development projects, will be
required to  be  borne  by  all  of the land so benefitted.  Areas of
benefit may be identified and fees chargeable to such lands may be imposed in
accordance with the procedures set forth in this title.  It is further the
intent of this title that all such development projects which impact
surrounding properties and create a need for new or expanded public
improvements be required to dedicate land, construct improvements and/or pay
impact fees sufficient to mitigate all adverse environmental and
infrastructure impacts.  To this end, areas of impact may be identified, the
need for improvements within such area determined, and the proportionate
responsibility of any development project for such cost fixed by the method
or methods set forth in this title.  This may be done within certain areas
of the city prior to the submission of development projects or in connection
with specific development project applications.



(Ord. 91-06-1100 § 1 (part))



21.04.020   Application.



   All development projects which are not otherwise exempt pursuant this
chapter shall be reviewed in accordance herewith to determine whether the
project will be required to construct and dedicate to the city public
improvements within the area of impact of the development project, or whether
the project will be required  to  pay,  in-lieu,  developer  impact
fees.  The level of construction and dedication, or level of fees, shall be
as determined hereunder.  The city shall have the sole and absolute
discretion to determine whether the share of public improvements allocated to
a given project shall be assumed by direct construction and dedication or by
payment of an impact fee.



(Ord. 91-06-1100 § 1 (part))



21.04.030   Standards.



   All public improvements provided in accordance with this title shall
meet the standards, specifications and requirements of the general plan of
the city, including the circulation element, and any specific plan adopted
thereto, and any other ordinance, resolution, policy, or standard of the city.



(Ord. 91-06-1100 § 1 (part))



21.04.040   Effect on other laws.



   The authority created hereunder for the imposition of impact fees shall
be in addition to any other authority established by this code and shall not
supersede any other provisions or authority adopted by ordinance or
resolution of the city council unless expressly stated herein.  The city
council may adopt by ordinance or resolution impact fees in addition to those
specified in this title.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, nothing herein
shall authorize any excessive fee which is not reasonably necessary to meet
the public needs arising as a result of the development project.



(Ord. 91-06-1100 § 1 (part))



21.04.050   Exemptions.



   The following development projects shall be exempt from the provisions
of this title:



   A.   Any addition to or modification, improvement, or reconstruction
to an existing single-family residential unit;



   B.   The reconstruction of any residential, commercial, or
industrial structure which has been damaged or destroyed, or reconstruction
for the purpose of preserving or rehabilitating residential housing, except
to the extent the reconstruction results in assessable lot area or chargeable
space in excess of that of the structure or property that was damaged or
destroyed.  In such event, the applicant shall pay fees or provide
dedication imposed under this title only upon the assessable lot area or
chargeable space by which the reconstructed structure or property exceeds
that of the original structure or property.



   C.   Single-Family Residential Dwellings Located in the Crescent
Heights Historic District.  Single-family residential dwellings located in
the  Crescent Heights Historic District developed in accordance with all
provisions of the Crescent Heights Historic District specific plan as defined
in Chapter 20.31 shall be exempt from impact fees in accordance with the
following:



   1.   True restorations of residential dwellings originally
constructed in the above-mentioned style before 1940 and relocated to the
Crescent Heights Historic District shall be exempt from all impact fees.



   2.   Construction of new residential dwellings constructed in the
above-mentioned style shall be exempt from one-half of all impact fees.



   The determination of qualification for this exemption and the amount of
exemption shall be determined during site plan review by the director of
community development, who shall have the right to subsequently revoke his
determination if the applicant does not build according to plans submitted. 
Appeal of the determination shall be conducted pursuant to Section 21.12.060
of this code.

constructed as part of the development project;



   7.   Those impact fees which should be provided by the development
project, and those impact fees which should be reimbursed to the development
project.



   C.   If a prior improvement study exists which addresses the items
listed in subsection B of this section for the development project, and there
have been no substantial changes in the matters included in the improvement
study or the surrounding facts or circumstances, such that the prior
improvement study can be determined to still be accurate or easily updated to
become currently accurate, the director of community development may, in his
or her sole discretion, permit the prior improvement study to be adopted as
the improvement study for the development project, or to be updated as may be
necessary to meet the requirements of this chapter.

21.17.010   Construction of improvements.



   Unless otherwise provided in this title, the developer shall, prior to
the issuance of any certificate of occupancy or other final approval for the
development project, complete construction of all local improvements and all
area-wide improvements required hereunder, or provide the security
established by Section 18.40.030, or pay any impact fee imposed, whichever
the approving body imposes as a condition of approval.



(Ord. 91-06-1100 § 1 (part))



21.17.020   Determination of need for construction.



   In the event the approving board determines that the developer is
unable to construct the improvements required hereunder due to any of the
following reasons:



   A.   The improvements will be located wholly or in part on private
land not accessible to the developer, or the developer otherwise does not
have the legal authority to construct the improvement; or



   B.   Although there is a need for the improvement created by the
development project, due to fiscal, legal, governmental or other
considerations, as determined by the city, it is not appropriate to
immediately construct such improvements; or



   C.   There is insufficient aggregate current public need to warrant
construction of the improvement at the present time; or



   D.   The improvements have been previously installed by others;



then the approving body may waive the requirement that the improvement be
constructed in conjunction with the development project and, in lieu thereof,
may collect impact fees from the developer in the amount of the cost of
constructing improvements allocated to the development project. The approving
body may also require a combination of construction of public improvements
and payment of impact fees to fulfill the requirements of this chapter.

plan, or other public documents identifying the facilities;



   C.   Determine how there is a reasonable relationship between the
fee's use and the type of development project on which the fee is imposed;



   D.   Determine how there is a reasonable relationship between the
need for the public facility or other use of the fee and the type of
development project on which the fee is imposed.



   These findings may be made with reference to an engineer's report,
improvement study, capital improvement plan, master plan, general or specific
plan, or other such document, and shall be supported by substantial evidence.



(Ord. 91-06-1100 § 1 (part))



21.18.040   Findings, impact fees imposed on a specific development
project.



   Before imposing payment of any impact fee as a condition of approval
for any development project, the approving body shall determine how there is
a reasonable relationship between the amount of the fee and the cost, or
portion of the cost, of the public facility or other public expenditure
attributable to the development project on which the fee is imposed. These
findings shall be supported by substantial evidence.



(Ord. 91-06-1100 § 1 (part))



21.18.050   Conditions of approval.



   As a condition of approval of any development project, the approving
body shall impose conditions requiring that the developer comply with the
provisions of this title. Such conditions may include specification of the
required improvements; time for construction; phasing of the development
project in accordance with construction of the improvements; posting of
security for construction; dedication of land; payment of impact fees;
reimbursement for improvements constructed, or fees paid by others;
performance of necessary studies and design services; reimbursement of staff
or legal expenses; and related matters. At the time of development project
approval, the approving body may permit the later establishment of any of the
foregoing based upon any further studies it determines to be necessary to

make findings with respect to any portion of any fee remaining unexpended or
uncommitted in its account five or more years after deposit, identifying the
purpose to which the fee is to be put and demonstrating the reasonable
relationship between the fee and the purpose for which it was charged, and
shall refund to the then-current record owner of the development project(s),
on a pro rata basis, such unexpended or uncommitted portion of such fee for
which such need cannot be demonstrated. These findings need not be made with
respect to bonds, letters of credit, or similar instruments of credit, or for
moneys not in the city's possession. If the administrative costs of making
the refund exceed the amount of refund, the funds may be kept by the city and
reallocated to another project serving the development project which paid the
fee, following a noticed public hearing.

the following exemptions to the water system connection charges in Section
21.44.030(B) shall apply: 



   A.   Affordable Housing Exemption.  The water system connection
charge shall not apply to new construction of residences which are sold and
leased to very low and low income persons and which are sold or leased at
rates affordable to very low and low income persons. To qualify for this
exemption, the applicant must submit an agreement in a form acceptable to the
city attorney binding the development project to a guarantee that the unit to
be exempted from the charge shall remain affordable to very low and low
income persons for a period of not less than twenty years, and making the
city a party to the covenant such that the restriction is enforceable by the
city. The agreement shall be executed by the owner of the property upon which
the development project is situated, and shall be recorded against the
property in the office of the county recorder. 



   B.   Residential Fire Sprinkler and Submeter Exemptions.  Where the
installation of a fire sprinkler system or a water submeter in a residential
use causes an increase in the connection charge, the following exemptions
shall apply to Section 21.44.030, solely for the purposes of calculating
applicable fees:



   1.   Where fire sprinklers are required by the California Building
Code for new single family dwellings and duplexes, the water connection
charge shall be based on the meter size determined by the fixture count
instead of the meter size required due to the additional fire sprinkler flow.



   2.   Where the installation of submeters alone causes head losses
that increases the water meter size, the water connection charge listed in
Section 21.44.030 shall be based on sizing without the submeter losses. 
This exemption shall not reduce the fee where other factors, other than the
submeter losses, cause a larger meter size to be required.

   The purpose of this chapter is to provide a means by which the city can
collect funds for the acquisition, improvement, and expansion of street,
parkway, thoroughfare, intersection, and other traffic and circulation
improvements.  This chapter is intended to authorize the imposition of
reasonable fees related to new development so that the burdens of installing
public improvements, the need for which is created by certain new development
projects and which will benefit certain land in addition to such development
projects, will be required to be borne by all of the land so benefited.



(Ord. 2003-10-1323 § 8)



21.48.020   Traffic impact fee study.



   The city has prepared a city-wide traffic impact fee study which
projects street and roadway improvements needed to provide adequate traffic
flow and safety from growth projected pursuant to the general plan.  The
study separates growth caused by existing development from that caused by
future development, distributes trips caused by future development by the
nature of the use, and determines the method of calculating the fee based on
the nature and intensity of the development.  This chapter establishes the
method of implementing the study for future development.  It is the intent
of the study and this chapter that this program be carried out in accordance
with state law, both in the method of determining the fee, administering the
program, and expending the funds.  The city may from time to time update the
study and modify the fee to keep the program current with the needed
infrastructure and development projections.



(Ord. 2003-10-1323 § 8)



21.48.030   Project review.



   A.   Review of Projects by Director.  All development projects
which are not otherwise exempt pursuant to Section 21.04.050 shall be
reviewed by the director of public works to determine the amount of traffic
impact fees chargeable to the project consistent with this chapter.



   B.   Calculation of Trips.  The Institute of Transportation
Engineers (ITE) publishes a Trip Generation Manual (the "Manual") that is
updated from time to time and is based on nation-wide measurement of
automobile trips generated by various land uses.  The manual shall be used
to calculate the trip rate generated by new development.



(Ord. 2003-10-1323 § 8)



21.48.040   Calculation of minimum traffic impact fees.



   The minimum traffic impact fee (the "Minimum Traffic Impact Fees")
established under this chapter shall be calculated in accordance with the
provisions of this section as follows:



   A.   Residential Uses.  Traffic impact fees for residential uses
shall be based upon the number of dwelling units and shall be equal to
$337.99 per dwelling unit.



   B.   Industrial Uses.  Traffic impact fees for industrial uses
shall be based upon the chargeable space in square feet of the building and
shall be equal to $0.48 per square foot.



   C.   Commercial Uses.  Traffic impact fees for commercial uses
shall be based upon the chargeable space in square feet of the building and
shall be equal to the following:



   1.   For high intensity commercial uses, the fee shall be $4.00 per
square foot.  "High intensity commercial" shall include discount club,
drive-through fast food restaurants, drive-through banks or savings and
loans, and other commercial uses determined by the director of community
development to be high-traffic generating commercial uses.  Generally such
uses would be those projected to generate over six p.m. peak hour trips per
one thousand square feet.



   2.   For office uses, the fee shall be $0.78 per square foot. 
"Office," as determined by the director of community development, shall
generally include property used exclusively for professional offices,
including accounting, architectural, engineering, insurance, legal, medical,
dental, optometric and clinical.



   3.   For all other commercial uses, the fee shall be $2.00 per
square foot.



(Ord. 2003-10-1323 § 8)



21.48.050   Alternate traffic impact fees.



   A.   The minimum traffic impact fees calculated pursuant to Section
21.48.040 is intended to represent the fair and reasonable impact
attributable to each new development calculated on a per-foot basis. 
However, due to variations in the intensity of commercial and industrial
uses, it is necessary to provide an alternative method of fee calculation
where the intensity of use will generate additional trips beyond those
calculated pursuant to Section 21.48.040 to ensure all new development
adequately contributes to new transportation improvements.  Accordingly,
notwithstanding Section 21.48.040, an alternate traffic impact fee of $333.29
per peak hour trip (the "Alternative Fee") shall apply if the director of
public works determines that a particular project's total p.m. peak hour trip
generation is fifty percent or more above the p.m. peak hour trip generation
which would typically be anticipated for the use.  The p.m. peak hour trip
generation rates published in the manual shall be used to make the
determination.  Accordingly, the alternative fee will apply if the p.m. peak
hour trip generation rates exceed the following:



   1.   Industrial Uses.  If an industrial project will generate more
than 2.16 p.m. peak hour trips per one thousand square feet, then the
applicant shall be charged the alternate traffic impact fee.



   2.   High Intensity Commercial Uses.  If a high intensity
commercial project will generate more than 18 p.m. peak hour trips per one
thousand  square feet, then the applicant shall be charged the alternate
traffic impact fee.



   3.   Office.  If an office project will generate more than 3.51
p.m. peak hour trips per one thousand  square feet, then the applicant shall
be charged the alternate traffic impact fee.



   4.   Commercial Uses.  If a commercial project, other than a
project determined to be a high intensity commercial or office project, will
generate more than nine p.m. peak hour trips per one thousand square feet,
then the applicant shall be charged the alternate traffic impact fee.



   5.   Mixed Uses.  Total project p.m. peak trip generation for mixed
use development shall be determined by calculating the trip generation of
each use in the project using the trip generation rates established in
Section 21.48.040 above.



   B.   Offset for Transportation Mitigation Measures.  In the event
the director of public works does determine that the alternative fee applies,
the director of public works shall inform the applicant of such
determination, the reasons therefor, and the calculation of the alternative
fee.  The applicant may then propose a transportation mitigation program
(the "Mitigation Program").  The mitigation program may include an array of
measures to reduce trips, modify trip profiles, alter the means of
transportation, promote public transportation, construct or contribute to
additional infrastructure improvements, or other similar measures.  The
mitigation program must be long term and incorporated in a recorded covenant,
agreement, or other agreement in a form approved by the city attorney.  The
director of public works shall determine the number of peak hour trips that
should be credited against the alternative fee due to the implementation of
the mitigation program, but in no event shall the fee be reduced below the
minimum traffic impact fee.

(Ord. 2003-10-1323 § 8)



21.48.070   Adjustments to impact fees.



   A.   Adjustment for Inflation.  On an annual basis, and in
connection with the preparation and review of the city's annual budget, the
minimum and alternative traffic impact fees shall be increased by any annual
increase in the construction cost index for Los Angeles or the surrounding
areas as published in the Engineering News Record.  Any further or other
adjustments to the traffic impact fee shall require an engineering report,
public hearing, and findings pursuant to Section 21.18.030.



   B.   Credit for Fees Paid.  If traffic impact fees have been paid
under this chapter or any prior ordinance and the development project
subsequently modified in a manner which would increase traffic impacts, any
previously paid fees shall be credited against the new total fee due, as
determined by the director of public works; provided, however, that, in no
event, shall the city refund fees previously paid because of a change in land
use.



   C.   Change in Use.  Development impact fees for additions to, or
replacement or intensification of an existing nonresidential use, shall be
paid only on the net increase in habitable and enclosed square footage of
building compared to that which existed within the territory of the city as
of January 1, 2003.



(Ord. 2003-10-1323 § 8)



21.48.080   Fees paid upon issuance of permit.



   A traffic impact fee shall be imposed and due upon issuance of any
development permit.  The fee shall be paid at the rate in effect on the day
of payment.  Payment of fees shall be made prior to issuance of a
certificate of occupancy for the project, or at such earlier time permitted
by law as set forth in Government Code Section 66007.



(Ord. 2003-10-1323 § 8)



21.48.090   Impact fee exemptions.



   A.   In addition to those exemptions stated in Section 21.04.050,
the traffic impact fee shall not apply to new construction of residences
which are sold and leased to low and very low income persons and which are
sold or leased at rates affordable to very low and low income persons.  To
qualify for this exemption, the applicant must submit an agreement in a form
acceptable to the city attorney binding the development project to a
guarantee that the assessable lot area shall remain affordable to low and
very low income persons for a period of not less than twenty years, and
making the city a party to the covenant such that the restriction is
enforceable by the city.  The agreement shall be executed by the owner of
the property upon which the development project is situated, and shall be
recorded against the property in the office of the county recorder.



(Ord. 2003-10-1323 § 8)



21.48.100   Deposit in fund.



   The finance director shall receive all fees paid and place them in a
separate traffic impact fund.  The finance director shall keep account of
all funds received, their source, all expenditures therefrom and the purpose
of all expenditures.  The finance director shall prepare an annual report
thereon pursuant to Government Code 66006, and shall periodically prepare a
public report stating: (1) the type of fee in the account; (2) the amount of
the fee; (3) the beginning and ending balance of the account or fund; (4) the
amount of the fees collected and the interest earned; (5) information
relating to the public improvements on which the fees were expended; (6) the
approximate date by which the construction of the improvement will commence
if sufficient funds have been collected; (7) a description of interfund
transfers or loans; and (8) the amount of any refunds.



(Ord. 2003-10-1323 § 8)



21.48.110   Previously issued permits.



   Any project which has been issued a building permit to proceed under
the fee policy existing prior to the date of adoption of this chapter shall
proceed under Chapter 21.48 of the previous fee policy and shall not be
subject to the terms of this chapter.
