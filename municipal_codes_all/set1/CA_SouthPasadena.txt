1A.5    Contents of administrative citation.

1A.6    Amount of fines.

1A.1 Authority and purpose.

(a)    The city council finds and declares there is a need for an alternative method of enforcement for violations of the Municipal Code and that an appropriate method of enforcement is an administrative citation program.

(b)    The city council additionally finds it is in the public’s interest to streamline enforcement of violations of city laws by providing for administrative citations because the issuance of an administrative citation provides for a quick resolution of uncontested violations, while continuing to give persons who have been issued citations a hearing before a neutral party. It also allows the city to recover costs associated with the enforcement process, which can only be done in very limited circumstances with a criminal citation. This makes code enforcement equitable since the community is not forced to fund correction of the impacts a code violation can cause to the community.

(c)    Pursuant to Article XI section 7, of the California Constitution, the city has the authority to make and enforce within its jurisdictional limits all laws for the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of South Pasadena which are not in conflict with general state laws. In addition, California Government Code 36901 specifically provides that the city may impose civil fines, penalties and forfeitures, up to a maximum of one thousand dollars, for violations of city ordinances. Further, California Government Code 53069.4 expressly authorizes the city to establish an administrative citation program for violations of city ordinances. (Ord. No. 2098 § 1.)


1A.2 Applicability.

This chapter provides for administrative citations which are in addition to all other legal remedies, criminal or civil, which may be pursued by the city to address any violations of this code. Use of this chapter shall be at the sole discretion of the city.

(b)    “Enforcement officer” means any person authorized to enforce violations of this code.

(c)    “Hearing officer” means any person appointed by the city manager to preside over the administrative hearings provided for by this chapter.

(d)    “Person” means any natural person, firm, association, business, trust, organization, corporation, partnership, company or any other entity.

(e)    “Responsible party” means any person who is responsible for violating any provision of this code. (Ord. No. 2098, § 1.)


1A.4 Administrative citation.

(a)    Whenever an enforcement officer determines a violation of this code has occurred, the enforcement officer shall have the authority to issue an administrative citation to any responsible party.

(b)    Prior to issuance of an administrative citation, the enforcement officer shall issue a written notice to the responsible party of the violation. The notice shall contain the following information:

(1)    The date of the violation;

(2)    The address or a specific description of the location where the violation occurred;

(3)    The section of this code violated and a description of the violation;

(4)    Identification of the action necessary to correct the violation;

(5)    A date by which the correction must be made, which shall be not less than ten days from the date of the notice, unless the enforcement officer determines that the violation contains an immediate danger to the public health, safety or welfare, in which case the enforcement officer, in his or her discretion, may provide for a lesser time or require immediate correction; and

(6)    An explanation of the consequences of a failure to correct the violation.

(c)    If, after the expiration of the time period provided to the responsible party to correct the violation, the responsible party has not corrected the violation, the enforcement officer may issue an administrative citation to the responsible party in the manner prescribed in Section 1A.16.

(e)    The notice provided pursuant to subsection (b) of this section shall be sufficient notice for any violation of the same code section even if the violation occurs at a different location, date or time, and the enforcement officer may proceed directly to an administrative citation on any future violation of the same code section by the same responsible party. (Ord. No. 2098, § 1.)


1A.5 Contents of administrative citation.

The administrative citation shall contain, in addition to all the contents of the notice specified in subsection (b) of Section 1A.4, the following information:

(a)    The amount of the fine for the code violation(s);

(b)    A description of the fine payment process, including a description of the time within which and the place to which the fine shall be paid;

(c)    An order prohibiting the continuation or repeated occurrence of the code violation described in the administrative citation;

(d)    A description of the administrative citation review process, including the time within which the administrative citation may be contested and the place from which a request for hearing form to contest the administrative citation may be obtained; and

1A.8 Hearing request.

(a)    By completing a request for hearing form and returning it to the planning department of the city within thirty days after the date of the administrative citation, together with an advance deposit of the fine or notice that a request for an advance deposit hardship waiver has been filed pursuant to Section 1A.9, any recipient of an administrative citation may contest whether (i) a violation of the code occurred or (ii) he/she/it is the responsible party.

The person who requested the hearing may obtain review of the hearing officer’s administrative decision regarding the administrative citation by filing a petition for judicial review pursuant to the provisions of California Government Code 53069.4. (Ord. No. 2098, § 1.)


1A.16 Notices.

(a)    The administrative citation and all notices required to be given by this chapter shall be served on the responsible party either by personal delivery or by deposit in the United States mail, in a sealed envelope postage prepaid, addressed to such person at his/her/its last known business or residence address as the same appears in the public records or other records pertaining to the matter to which such notice is directed. Service by mail shall be deemed to have been completed at the time of deposit in the post office.

(b)    Failure to receive any notice specified in this chapter does not affect the validity of proceedings conducted thereunder. (Ord. No. 2098, § 1.)


1A.1 Authority and purpose.

(a)    The city council finds and declares there is a need for an alternative method of enforcement for violations of the Municipal Code and that an appropriate method of enforcement is an administrative citation program.

(b)    The city council additionally finds it is in the public’s interest to streamline enforcement of violations of city laws by providing for administrative citations because the issuance of an administrative citation provides for a quick resolution of uncontested violations, while continuing to give persons who have been issued citations a hearing before a neutral party. It also allows the city to recover costs associated with the enforcement process, which can only be done in very limited circumstances with a criminal citation. This makes code enforcement equitable since the community is not forced to fund correction of the impacts a code violation can cause to the community.

(c)    Pursuant to Article XI section 7, of the California Constitution, the city has the authority to make and enforce within its jurisdictional limits all laws for the public health, safety and welfare of the citizens of South Pasadena which are not in conflict with general state laws. In addition, California Government Code 36901 specifically provides that the city may impose civil fines, penalties and forfeitures, up to a maximum of one thousand dollars, for violations of city ordinances. Further, California Government Code 53069.4 expressly authorizes the city to establish an administrative citation program for violations of city ordinances. (Ord. No. 2098 § 1.)


1A.2 Applicability.

This chapter provides for administrative citations which are in addition to all other legal remedies, criminal or civil, which may be pursued by the city to address any violations of this code. Use of this chapter shall be at the sole discretion of the city.

(c)    “Hearing officer” means any person appointed by the city manager to preside over the administrative hearings provided for by this chapter.

(e)    The notice provided pursuant to subsection (b) of this section shall be sufficient notice for any violation of the same code section even if the violation occurs at a different location, date or time, and the enforcement officer may proceed directly to an administrative citation on any future violation of the same code section by the same responsible party. (Ord. No. 2098, § 1.)

2.63 Register of landmarks and historic districts.

(a)    Listing Landmarks and Historic Districts on the South Pasadena Register of Landmarks and Historic Districts. The commission shall have the responsibility to recommend to the city council the adoption of ordinances or resolutions designating improvements, sites or natural features as landmarks or historic districts and thereby encouraging their preservation, protection, enhancement, rehabilitation or perpetuation. The commission shall prepare and transmit a report of its recommendation to the council on the historical and architectural significance of the improvement, site or natural feature to be designated as follows:

(1)    The report’s statement of significance shall clearly state the reasons the property meets the city’s criteria with brief facts that explain the way in which the property was important to the local, state or national history during the period of significance. It would also include significant themes and historic contexts to which the property relates.

(2)    In addition to a statement of significance the report shall provide written findings stating the reasons the landmark or historic district qualifies for designation on the South Pasadena register of landmarks and historic districts. These findings shall include:

(A)    That the designation of landmark or historic district is consistent with one or more of the purposes set forth in SPMC 2.58B; and

(B)    That the landmark or historic district meets one or more of the criteria for designation listed in subsection (b) of this section; and

(C)    That the landmark or historic district possesses historic integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, or association.

(3)    When considering an application for a historic district or a landmark, the historic resource(s) shall be identified on a primary record or DPR 523 Series form(s) and included as part of the commission’s report. The application shall include a context statement supporting a finding establishing the relation between the physical environment of the landmark or historic district and its history. The context statement shall represent the history of the area by theme, place, and time. It shall define the various historic factors which shaped the development of the area. It shall define a period of significance for the historic district and relate historic features to that period of significance. It may include, but not be limited to, historical activities or events, associations with historic personages, architectural styles and movements, master architects, designers, building types, building materials, landscape design, or pattern of physical development that influenced the character of the landmark or historic district at a particular time in history. Using this information, the survey shall identify those buildings, structures, landscaping, or contributing resources.

(4)    In addition to the required findings in subsection (a)(2) of this section when recommending approval of a historic district, the commission shall also find that:

(A)    The proposed district boundaries are appropriate because a significant concentration, linkage, or continuity of sites, buildings, structures, or objects united historically or aesthetically by plan or physical development are present within the district. A district derives its importance from being a unified entity or a theme, even though it may be composed of a wide variety of resources (organized around a theme). Thematic districts are not required to have physical or contiguous boundaries.

(B)    The identity of the district results from the interrelationship of its resources which conveys a visual sense of the overall historic environment or is an arrangement of historically or functionally related properties.

(C)    The district contains a number of contributing resources that add to the historic architectural qualities or historic associations for which a district is significant because they existed during the period of significance and possess historic integrity reflecting the district’s character at that time.

(D)    With respect to the designation of a local district that is not listed on the California Register of Historical Resources, but was identified in a local survey, not less than 60 percent of all affected owners of the proposed historic district must consent to such designation. Each parcel or lot shall be entitled to only one vote per parcel. By way of example only, if the proposed historic district were composed of 20 parcels, then the owners of 12 parcels would be required to consent to the designation.

(E)    With respect to the designation of a historic district that is listed on the California Register of Historical Resources, not less than 50 percent plus one of all affected owners of the proposed historic district must consent to such designation. Each parcel or lot shall be entitled to only one vote per parcel. By way of example only, if the proposed historic district were composed of 20 parcels, then 11 property owners would be required to consent to the designation.

(5)    In recommending approval of a historic district, the cultural heritage commission may recommend conditions to be included in design guidelines, as appropriate to further the purpose of this section.

(b)    Designation Criteria for Landmarks and Historic Districts. Criteria and standards for the designation of landmarks and historic districts shall include any or all of the following, as applicable:

(1)    Its character, interest or value as a part of the heritage of the community;

(2)    Its location as a site of a significant historic event;

(3)    Its identification (such as the residence, ownership, or place of occupation, etc.) with a person, persons or groups who significantly contributed to the culture and development of the city, state or United States;

(4)    Its exemplification of a particular architectural style of an era of history of the city;

(5)    Its exemplification of the best remaining architectural type in a neighborhood;

(6)    Its identification as the work of a person or persons whose work has influenced the heritage of the city, the state or the United States;

(7)    Its embodiment of elements of outstanding attention to architectural design, engineering, detail design, detail, materials or craftsmanship;

(8)    It is either a part of or related to a square, park or other distinctive area which should be developed or preserved according to a plan based on a historic cultural or architectural motif;

(9)    Its unique location or singular physical characteristic representing an established and familiar visual feature of a neighborhood;

(10)    Its potential for yielding information of archaeological interest; or

(11)    In designating a historic district, its significance as a distinguishable neighborhood or area whose components may lack individual distinction.

(c)    Designation Procedure. Landmarks and historic districts shall be established by the city council in the following manner:

(1)    The commission, upon its own initiative or upon the written request of any person or city agency, may recommend the designation of any cultural resource in the city as a landmark or historic district.

(2)    The commission shall appoint a subcommittee of two members (the “landmark subcommittee”) to review all applications for consideration of an improvement, site or natural feature as a landmark or historic district. The landmark subcommittee shall review the application materials and make a preliminary written recommendation, based on such documentation as it may require, as to whether the commission shall consider the improvement, site or natural feature for appropriate designation. The landmark subcommittee, as soon as practicable and prior to the hearing on designation, shall:

(A)    With respect to the proposed designation of a landmark, exercise its best efforts to meet with the owner to obtain such owner’s written consent of the proposed designation; and

(B)    With respect to the proposed designation of a historic district, shall have obtained the consent of affected owners in accordance with subsection (a)(4)(D) or (E) of this section. The aforementioned consent shall be obtained by sending a ballot and an impartial opinion of the city attorney to every parcel owner in said district, as to the effect of the designation on the parcels located in the proposed district. The ballot shall provide the owner with the option to consent to or to oppose the proposed historic district designation.

(3)    If the landmark subcommittee determines that the improvement, site or natural feature, which is the subject of the application, merits consideration by the commission, it shall recommend that the commission place the application upon its agenda for its next regularly scheduled meeting for consideration of such designation.

(4)    The commission shall notify the director of the pendency of the consideration. No applications for design review shall be accepted by the planning and building department to construct, alter or demolish any property that is not on the South Pasadena inventory of historical resources within a proposed historic district, subsequent to the date of notice to the director by the commission, while proceedings are pending on such designation; provided, however, that after 180 days have elapsed from the date of the notice, if final action on such designation has not been completed, the applications for design review may be accepted by the planning and building department.

(5)    The commission shall send written notice by certified mail to each directly affected owner of a proposed designation as a landmark or historic district of the date, place, time and purpose of the hearing to consider such designation, at least 20 days prior to the date of the hearing, and shall publish notice of such hearing at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the city not less than 10 days prior to such hearing.

(6)    The commission shall provide an opportunity to be heard to each affected owner and other interested members of the public. The commission may, if necessary, continue the consideration of designation to its next regularly scheduled meeting.

(7)    The commission shall, within 15 days of its hearing regarding designation or of any continued hearing on the designation, recommend approval in whole or in part, or disapproval in whole or in part, of the application, in writing to the city council.

(8)    The affected owner(s) may object to the decision of the commission by filing with the city clerk a written statement setting forth their objection prior to the hearing before the city council.

(9)    The city council, upon receipt of the recommendation, shall set the matter for hearing within 30 days of the date of filing of the commission recommendation with the city clerk. The council shall cause written notice of the council hearing to be given by registered mail to each affected owner and shall provide a reasonable opportunity for the owner to be heard at the council hearing. The city council shall render its decision thereon within 30 days after the close of the hearing of the city council.

(10)    The city shall notify the affected owner in writing of the final action of the city council with respect to the proposed designation and shall give such owner written notice of any further action which it takes with respect to such designation.

(11)    Failure to send any notice by mail to any affected owner where the address of such owner is not a matter of public record shall not invalidate any proceedings in connection with the proposed designation. The commission and city council may also give such other notice as they may deem desirable and practicable.

(12)    Upon designation by the city council, the city clerk shall record the city council’s declaration in the office of the county recorder of the county. (Ord. No. 2315, § 2, 2017.)


2.64 Inventory of cultural resources.

(a)    The city shall establish and maintain an inventory of cultural resources as follows:

(1)    The Inventory. The city shall maintain an official list of properties known as the South Pasadena inventory of cultural resources (“inventory”) that it has determined, upon recommendation by the cultural heritage commission and approved by city council, to be historically significant through the systematic inventory and evaluation of buildings within its jurisdiction.

(A)    The inventory was first established with the passage of city council Resolution No. 6286 and has been subsequently revised upon any subsequent updates by the South Pasadena city council.

(B)    The inventory shall be reviewed every five years, and revised if necessary, to ensure that the document remains up to date according to current preservation planning practice.

(2)    Inclusions. The official list of properties located on the inventory is located in the City Hall and includes those properties that are located within the city of South Pasadena that are landmark and historic district properties, historic properties listed on the California Register, properties that are listed as being eligible for special consideration in local planning to assure continuity of the city’s historic character, scale, and small town atmosphere for all projects, and properties that the city determines to be historically significant based on the criteria for additions as outlined in subsection (a)(3) of this section.

(3)    Listing Property on the Inventory. A property owner may submit a written application for inclusion of his/her property on the inventory to the commission. The application shall provide photographic evidence, an evaluation by an architectural historian including the current Primary Record or DPR 523 Series form to record historic resources, and such further information as the commission may require. Written notice of such an application for addition and the time and place of a public hearing before the commission shall be provided to property owners within a 300-foot radius of the subject property not less than 10 days prior to the hearing.

(A)    If the commission finds that there is substantial evidence that the property reasonably meets national, state or local criteria for historical significance, and that it has been so evaluated by an architectural historian, it shall recommend to the city council that the property be included on the inventory of cultural resources. The city council shall consider the recommendation and may, at its discretion, request further information from the applicant and hold a public hearing. The city council may, by resolution, determine that the property be included on the inventory of cultural resources.

(4)    De-Listing Property from the Inventory. An owner of a property listed on the inventory of cultural resources may submit a written application to the commission requesting removal from the inventory. The application shall provide evidence and supporting documentation regarding the lack of historic significance of the cultural resource, including photographic evidence of its current condition, an evaluation by an architectural historian, and such further information as the commission may require. Written notice of such an application for de-listing and the time and place of a public hearing before the commission shall be provided to property owners within a 300-foot radius of the subject [property] not less than 10 days prior to the hearing. If the commission finds:

(A)    That the cultural resource lacks significance as defined under national, state, and local criteria for historical significance; or

(B)    That the cultural resource has lost its historic integrity due to irreversible alterations.

The commission shall make a recommendation to the city council that the cultural resource be de-listed from the inventory. The city council shall consider the recommendation and may, in its discretion, request further information from the applicant and hold an additional public hearing. The city council may, by resolution, determine that the cultural resource be de-listed from the inventory.

(5)    Initiation by Commission. Listing and de-listing properties from the inventory may also be initiated by a majority vote of the members of the commission. Should the commission initiate the addition of a cultural resource to the inventory, or de-listing of a cultural resource from the inventory, written notice of the time and place of a public hearing before the commission shall be given to the owner of said property or cultural resource, and to property owners within a 300-foot radius of said property or cultural resource, at least 10 days prior to the hearing.

(A)    Recommendations to the city council as to such addition or deletion shall be made by the commission upon making the applicable findings set forth in subsection (a)(3) or (4) of this section. The city council shall consider the recommendation and may, in its discretion, request further information and hold an additional public hearing. The council may, by resolution, determine that the property be listed to or de-listed from the inventory.

(6)    Deletion from Inventory. A cultural resource shall be deleted from the inventory upon complete destruction of that cultural resource pursuant to a duly issued certificate of appropriateness for such destruction by the city. (Ord. No. 2315, § 2, 2017.)


2.65 Certificate of appropriateness – Alteration and demolition.

(a)    Purpose. This section sets forth the process for obtaining a certificate of appropriateness (“certificate”) from the commission, for the purpose of authorizing proposed work that may affect cultural resources (as defined by this article), noncontributors within the boundaries of federal, state, and local historic districts within the city of South Pasadena.

No person shall proceed with demolition, alteration, or relocation of such resources, or new construction affecting such resources, without first obtaining a certificate. Approval of such work shall be required even if no other permits or entitlements are required by the city, and the commission’s approval or denial of the proposed work shall be deemed a discretionary action under CEQA (California Code of Regulations, Title 14, Section 15002(i)).

(b)    Intent. It is the intent of the city of South Pasadena that cultural resources will not be the subject of demolition, alteration or relocation unless an imminent threat, as determined by the building official pursuant to SPMC 2.66, exists. Review of all applications for a certificate of appropriateness shall comply with all applicable state and federal laws and regulations, including without limitation, the California Environmental Quality Act, the National Historic Preservation Act and the National Environmental Policy Act.

(c)    Actions Requiring a Certificate of Appropriateness. The following actions shall require a certificate of appropriateness from the commission. Performance of any work that falls within the provisions of this article without a certificate of appropriateness is prohibited:

(1)    Alteration, demolition, relocation of, or new construction affecting the South Pasadena register of landmarks and historic districts; the South Pasadena inventory of cultural resources; and any other cultural resources; and

(2)    Any other project referred to the commission by the city council, planning commission, or city staff.

(d)    Exemptions from Requirements for Certificate of Appropriateness. The following items of construction, work, or labor on an improvement or natural feature are deemed not to be an alteration for the purposes of this article and shall not require a certificate of appropriateness:

(1)    Painting of any residential or commercial building;

(2)    Ordinary maintenance and repair which does not require a building permit;

(3)    Landscaping, including sprinkler system work, that does not affect a character-defining feature;

(4)    Paving work that does not affect a character-defining feature;

(5)    All alterations which are entirely interior and do not affect the exterior of an improvement, except for designated interiors of a landmark property (including character-defining interior features not described in original landmark documentation, but subsequently discovered and documented);

(6)    All alterations affecting an existing or proposed accessory dwelling unit; and

(7)    Replacement of existing screens and awnings with the same or substantially consistent materials, form, and shape.

(e)    Procedures for a Certificate of Appropriateness.

(1)    Emergency Actions. The procedures in this section shall not apply to demolition, alteration, and relocation requests pertaining to improvements that need expedited evaluation due to an imminent threat in the interest of the public health or safety (see SPMC 2.66).

(2)    Application. The owner or authorized representative proposing a discretionary project that may affect: a cultural resource, a noncontributing resource within the boundaries of federal, state, and local historic districts, shall file an application for a certificate of appropriateness on forms provided by the city’s planning and building department for such purpose. The application must be accompanied by any fee required by the city.

(3)    Properties 45 Years or Older. A certificate of appropriateness may be required for demolition of a building or structure that is 45 years or older, and not identified as a cultural resource. The purpose of this subsection is to ensure that such buildings and structures are properly evaluated prior to their demolition or removal.

(A)    Applicability. Any proposed project submitted to the planning and building department that includes the demolition or removal of a building or structure that was constructed at least 45 years prior to the date of application for such project shall file a notice of intent to demolish in a form approved by the director. The determination as to whether a property is a cultural resource shall require a deposit by the applicant to cover city costs associated with hiring a historic consultant and/or an architectural historian; and/or a deposit to cover the costs associated with the preparation of an initial study, environmental impact report, mitigated negative declaration or negative declaration.

(B)    Procedure. The director or his/her designee shall review the project involving demolition and confirm that the following materials have been provided including: an intensive level historic resources evaluation (HRE) that follows the practices established by the California Office of Historic Preservation shall be prepared for the property; plans for the replacement development project consistent with the standards and requirements of the applicable zoning district; and photo verification that the property has been posted with a notice of intent to demolish. Upon receipt of the filing materials, the director or his/her designee will schedule the demolition application for the next available commission meeting.

(C)    Notice. Public notification shall be provided to the applicant, to all owners of real property as shown on the county’s latest equalized assessment roll, and to all legal occupants located within a 300-foot radius of the subject parcel upon which the intent to demolish is requested.

(D)    Determination by Commission. The commission will make a determination as to whether the property could potentially meet national, state, or local criteria for designation if the property is not already listed as a cultural resource.

(i)    If the commission determines, upon review of the filing materials and testimony, that the property is not eligible at the federal, state, or local level, the project involving demolition shall proceed through the city’s application process without any further restrictions under this chapter.

(ii)    If the commission determines that the property is potentially eligible at the federal, state, or local level, the property shall be added to the inventory and the provisions of this subsection (e), Procedures for a Certificate of Appropriateness, shall apply to the proposed demolition. If any such resources are potentially affected by a project, the city shall require preparation of the appropriate CEQA documentation.

(4)    Minor Project Review. A certificate of appropriateness may be obtained by going through a minor project review if it involves: demolition or relocation of non-character-defining features; noncontributing additions, garages, accessory structures or incompatible and previously replaced windows, doors or siding material; any undertaking that does not change exterior features such as re-roofing if the proposed roofing material is comparable in appearance, color and profile to the existing or original roofing material; replacement of windows and doors if the proposed replacements are of the same materials, form, color, and location as the existing or original windows and doors; an addition of less than 200 square feet proposed for the side or rear elevations (not visible from the public right-of-way) and does not materially alter the features or have an adverse effect on the historic integrity of a cultural resource; minor changes to a previously approved certificate; or any other undertaking determined by the director or his/her designee to not materially alter the features or have an adverse effect on the integrity of a cultural resource.

(A)    Requirements. The required application materials for minor project review shall include, without limitation: a written narrative of the proposed project, a vicinity map, a site plan, exterior elevations drawn to scale, a window and door schedule, and photographs of the structure and the neighborhood.

(B)    Review Process. After the certificate of appropriateness application for minor project review is deemed complete by the director or his/her designee, the commission’s chairperson (the “chair”), or his/her designee, shall evaluate the application to determine its eligibility for minor project review. If the proposed project meets the eligibility criteria for minor project review, the commission’s chairperson, or his/her designee, may elect to do one of the following:

(i)    Approve the Certificate of Appropriateness. If the proposed minor project is deemed consistent with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties and the city of South Pasadena’s adopted design guidelines, the commission’s chairperson or his/her designee may approve the proposed project;

(ii)    Consent Calendar. If the chair, or his/her designee, determines that the proposed minor project needs additional review by the commission, he or she may elect to place it on the commission’s next meeting agenda. Such project shall be noticed pursuant to subsection (e)(7) of this section, Public Notice Requirements, as a consent calendar item on that agenda; or

(iii)    Deny the Certificate of Appropriateness. If the proposed minor project is deemed to be inconsistent with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties and the city’s adopted design guidelines, the chair or his/her designee may elect to refer the proposed project to the entire commission through the certificate of appropriateness (major project review) procedure pursuant to subsection (e)(5) of this section.

(5)    Major Project Review. The certificate of appropriateness application must be accompanied by any fee as required by the city of South Pasadena and documentation as the commission shall require, including without limitation:

(i)    The purpose of this article as set forth in SPMC 2.58B.

(ii)    City of South Pasadena zoning code.

(iii)    City of South Pasadena residential and commercial design guidelines, particularly: the design guidelines for alterations and additions to historic residences; the design guidelines for new residential buildings in established neighborhoods that apply to noncontributors; and the design guidelines for enhancing existing nonhistoric residences.

(iv)    The historic and architectural value and significance of the improvement or natural feature and whether any affected improvement or natural feature is listed in or eligible for listing in the South Pasadena register of landmarks and historic districts; the California Register of Historical Resources; or the National Register of Historic Places, or is otherwise a cultural resource.

(v)    The qualities of the improvement or natural feature including their relation to the street or public way and to other improvements and natural features, the texture, material and color of the improvement in question or its appurtenant fixtures, and the relationship of such features to similar features of other cultural resources nearby.

(vii)    With respect to proposed relocations or demolitions, review of the replacement structure to be considered by the cultural heritage commission and planning commission concurrently with the relocation or demolition permit request. A building permit for the replacement structure must be obtained before a cultural resource is relocated or demolished.

(viii)    With respect to proposed demolitions, the commission shall consider whether the improvement or natural feature is of such unusual or uncommon design, texture or materials that it could not be reproduced or be reproduced only with great difficulty and expense or whether retention of such would substantially aid in preserving and protecting the cultural resource, or the historic district.

(ix)    Any applicable report from a historic architect or civil engineer regarding the feasibility of the proposed work, or feasibility of the commission’s suggestions for project revision, subject to peer review by a city consultant.

(x)    The certificate of appropriateness application and all written and oral testimony submitted, including any evaluations of the property and proposed project by an architectural historian.

(xi)    Whether the owner applied for a certificate of economic hardship in accordance with subsection (e)(14) of this section.

(i)    Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties and the associated guidelines.

(ii)    The National Park Service and its preservation briefs, tech notes, and bulletins.

(iii)    The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and its implementing guidelines and whether the project is consistent with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties, and is therefore exempt from CEQA under Class 31, which applies to “projects limited to maintenance, repair, stabilization, rehabilitation, restoration, preservation, conservation or reconstruction of cultural resources in a manner consistent with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties with Guidelines for Preserving, Rehabilitating, Restoring, and Reconstructing Historic Buildings (1995), Weeks and Grimmer.” (CEQA Guideline [Cal. Code Regs. Title 14] Section 15331.)

(iv)    The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and its implementing guidelines and whether the project would normally qualify for a categorical exemption from CEQA, but the project is subject to CEQA because the project “may cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource.” (CEQA Guideline Section 15300.2(f) [Exception for Historical Resources]; CEQA Guideline Section 15064.5(b) [Determining the Significance of Impacts on Historical and Unique Archaeological Resources; definition of “substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource”].)

(v)    State Historical Building Code (Title 24, Part 8 of California Code of Regulations).

(vi)    Density Bonuses. Pursuant to California Government Code Section 65915, a density bonus requested for a housing development shall not be granted if the city finds that, among other things, the “concession or incentive would have a specific adverse impact, as defined in paragraph (2) of subdivision (d) of Section 65589.5, upon public health and safety or the physical environment or on any real property that is listed in the California Register of Historical Resources and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact without rendering the development unaffordable to low- and moderate-income households.” The commission shall consider the provisions of Government Code Section 65915, as it may be amended from time to time, in its review of proposed projects, and in any recommendations made to the planning commission.

(iii)    The project is consistent with the applicable criteria identified in subsection (e)(8) of this section which the commission applies to alterations, demolitions, and relocation requests.

(B)    Project-Specific Findings. In order to approve a certificate of appropriateness, the commission shall make at least three of the project-specific findings listed below:

(i)    The project removes inappropriate alterations of the past;

(ii)    The project is appropriate to the size, massing, and design context of the historic neighborhood;

(iii)    In the case of an addition or enlargement, the project provides a clear distinction between the new and historic elements of the cultural resource or improvement;

(iv)    The project restores original historic features in accordance with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties;

(v)    The project adds substantial new living space (for example: a second story toward the rear of a residence) while preserving the single story [architectural style or building type] character of the streetscape;

(vi)    The project enhances the appearance of the [residence or building] without adversely affecting its original design, character, or heritage;

(vii)    The project will not adversely affect the character of the historic district in which the property is located;

(viii)    The project will be compatible with the appearance of existing improvements on the site and the new work will be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and character-defining features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment;

(ix)    The project is consistent with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties, and is therefore exempt from CEQA under Class 31, which applies to “projects limited to maintenance, repair, stabilization, rehabilitation, restoration, preservation, conservation or reconstruction of historical resources in a manner consistent with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties with Guidelines for Preserving, Rehabilitating, Restoring, and Reconstructing Historic Buildings (1995), Weeks and Grimmer” (CEQA Guideline [Cal. Code Regs. Title 14] Section 15331);

(x)    Relocation as an alternative to demolition of the cultural resource is appropriate because of the following: CEQA analysis has been conducted and the owner has provided substantial evidence, as defined in CEQA (Public Resources Code Section 21080(e)), demonstrating that no feasible alternative exists that would avoid a significant adverse impact on the resource; relocation is required to prevent destruction of the resource at its current location; the new location is compatible with the cultural resource’s original character and use; upon relocation, the resource retains its historic features and compatibility in orientation, setting, and general environment; if relocated within the city of South Pasadena, the receiving location is appropriately zoned; the relocation is part of a definitive series of actions that will assure preservation of the cultural resource;

(xi)    Demolition of the cultural resource is appropriate because of one or all of the following: (a) CEQA analysis has been conducted and the owner has provided substantial evidence, as defined in CEQA (Public Resources Code Section 21080(e)), demonstrating that no feasible alternative exists that would avoid a significant adverse impact on the resource; (b) the owner is approved for a certificate of economic hardship; (c) the size, massing and scale of the replacement structure is harmonious with other improvements and natural features that contribute to the historic district, or the neighborhood character; and (d) the replacement structure contributes to the integrity of the historic district or neighborhood; and/or

(xii)    In the case of a structure that poses an imminent threat and is unsafe to occupy, the commission shall make one or all of the following findings to approve a demolition of a cultural resource: (a) the building has experienced severe structural damage and there is substantial evidence to support this conclusion from at least two sources (e.g., structural engineer, civil engineer, or architect); or (b) no economically reasonable, practical, or viable measures could be taken to adaptively use, rehabilitate, or restore the building or structure on its existing site and there is substantial evidence to support this conclusion from at least two sources (e.g., structural engineer, civil engineer, or architect); or (c) a compelling public interest justifies demolition.

(11)    Expiration of Certificate of Appropriateness. A certificate of appropriateness shall lapse and become void 18 months (or shorter period if specified as a condition of approval) from the date of final approval, unless a building permit (if required) has been issued and the work authorized by the certificate has commenced prior to such expiration date and is diligently pursued to completion. Upon application by the property owner before the expiration of a certificate of appropriateness, the commission may extend the expiration date of the certificate for an additional period of up to 12 months. The commission may approve, approve with conditions, or deny any request for extension.

(B)    Noncompliance with any provisions of this article; or

(C)    A finding of fraud or misrepresentation used in the process of obtaining the certificate.

Proceedings to revoke or modify a certificate may be initiated by motion of the commission or city council. Once revocation proceedings have been initiated and written notice provided to the property owner, all work being done in reliance upon such certificate or associated permits shall be immediately suspended until a final determination is made regarding the revocation.

The decision to revoke or modify a certificate of appropriateness shall be made by the commission following a public hearing, with written notice provided to the property owner at least 10 days prior thereto. The commission’s decision may be appealed to the city council, as provided below.

(13)    Appeal of a Certificate of Appropriateness. Any person aggrieved by the commission’s approval or denial of a certificate of appropriateness may appeal the commission’s decision to the city council.

(A)    Within 15 calendar days from the effective date of the commission’s decision, the appellant shall file his/her written letter of appeal and shall pay a filing fee as required by the city of South Pasadena, as determined by resolution of the city council, with the city clerk.

(B)    Within the appeal period identified in subsection (e)(13)(A) of this section, a member of the council may request to review a decision of the commission. A request for review may be initiated by any two members of the council and shall be filed in writing to the office of the city clerk. The request shall not state that an error has been made or otherwise suggest that the two council members seeking review have predetermined the matter to be heard by the council.

(C)    The appeal shall set forth the grounds relied on by the appellant. Upon receipt of the written letter of appeal and payment of the applicable filing fee, the city clerk shall place the matter upon the city council agenda for a regularly scheduled meeting of the council in accordance with subsection (e)(7) of this section, Public Notice Requirements.

The city council may reverse or affirm wholly or partly, or may modify, the decision of the commission, and may impose such conditions as the facts warrant, and its decision shall be final. Any hearing may be continued from time to time.

(14)    Certificate of Economic Hardship. In considering the appropriateness of either demolition or alteration, the commission shall approve or conditionally approve a certificate of appropriateness if it finds that such cultural resource cannot be remodeled or rehabilitated in a manner which would allow a reasonable use of or reasonable return on investment from the property to the owner.

If the project is subject to CEQA, the certificate of economic hardship shall not be granted until all CEQA review has been conducted in accordance with law.

(A)    Documentation. The commission may solicit expert testimony or require that the owner submit any or all of the following information before the commission makes a determination on the application for a certificate of economic hardship:

(xiii)    Evidence that the owner has made serious efforts to sell or rent the property to no avail, and has taken advantage of all available financial and land use incentives. (Ord. No. 2315, § 2, 2017.)


2.66 Certificate of appropriateness not required – Conditions posing an imminent threat to life, limb, or property.

(a)    Intent. It is the intent of the city of South Pasadena to limit demolition of any cultural resources to the final course of action in an emergency, used only when other efforts are not feasible to abate an imminent threat.

(b)    Necessary Work in Connection with an Imminent Threat. Where the building official has determined that a structure regulated by the California Building Code may pose an imminent threat to life, limb, or property, the building official shall consider the following criteria and procedures prior to issuing an order to abate the imminent threat:

(1)    The extent to which the condition of the building(s) or structure(s) is immediately dangerous within the meaning of the South Pasadena Municipal Code;

(2)    The extent to which there are any feasible alternatives to demolition of a cultural resource that will adequately protect the health and safety of the public including, but not limited to, the following: securing the building, securing the property, bracing of the structure, shoring, or equivalent similar action.

Such actions may be ordered by the building official to abate an imminent threat and no certificate of appropriateness shall be required.

(3)    If the building official identifies the need to permit a demolition of a cultural resource, and after considering the first priority of protecting the public health and safety, the building official shall notify the director at the earliest feasible opportunity regarding the potential impact on a cultural resource and the necessary steps to abate any imminent threat to the public health or safety. Upon the director’s receipt of notice from the building official, the director shall notify the commission’s chairperson (the “chair”), or his/her designee, for the purpose of discussing the conditions and alternatives identified in subsection (b)(2) of this section.

(4)    If the director determines, following the consultation with the building official and the commission’s chair, that all or some portion of a demolition of a cultural resource is necessary to abate an imminent threat to the public health or safety, the director is authorized to approve the demolition upon factoring in any feasible alternative to demolition in whole or in part, as the least invasive corrective measure identified during the consultation.

(5)    As soon as feasible under the circumstances, the director, or his/her designee, shall present to the commission a summary of any actions taken pursuant to this subsection (b).

(6)    Where the building official has determined that the imminent threat has been abated and the structure has been determined by the building official to be in a state of disrepair as defined in the municipal code, then the substandard condition(s) shall be abated through the certificate of appropriateness process for alterations or demolitions pursuant to SPMC 2.65. (Ord. No. 2315, § 2, 2017.)


2.67 Enforcement and penalties.

(a)    Unpermitted Work without a Certificate. Demolition, relocation, alteration or removal of any improvement, site or natural feature subject to the provisions of this article without obtaining a certificate of appropriateness is a misdemeanor and is further hereby expressly declared to be a nuisance.

(b)    Obligations and Consequences upon Failure to Obtain a Certificate of Appropriateness. Unpermitted work, without the approval of a certificate of appropriateness pursuant to the requirements of this article, shall be addressed as follows:

(1)    The director or his/her designee shall give notice to the owner of record by certified or registered mail of the specific demolition or alteration work that was made without first obtaining a certificate of appropriateness. The owner or person in charge of the structure shall apply within 30 days for a certificate of appropriateness.

(2)    In reviewing the unpermitted alterations, demolition, relocation, or removal, the commission shall either:

(A)    Approve the certificate of appropriateness pursuant to the criteria specified in SPMC 2.65; or

(B)    Deny the certificate of appropriateness and require that the inappropriate alteration(s) or demolition be abated pursuant to subsection (c) of this section.

(3)    If the property owner fails to apply for a certificate of appropriateness or abatement of the public nuisance pursuant to subsection (c) of this section is not possible, the matter shall be referred to the city prosecutor for further action.

(c)    Abatement of Nuisance. Any work undertaken for which a certificate of appropriateness is required but was not obtained shall be deemed a nuisance. Such nuisance shall be abated by reconstructing or restoring the property to its original condition prior to the performance of work in violation of this article in the following manner:

(1)    Covenant to Reconstruct Within One Year. Within 30 days of the effective date of the commission’s denial of a certificate of appropriateness, the owner of the property shall execute and record a covenant in favor of the city to do such reconstruction or restoration within one year of the effective date of the commission’s decision to deny a certificate of appropriateness. The form of the covenant shall be subject to approval by the city attorney, and shall run with the land.

(2)    Time Extension on Covenant. Upon application to the commission, the time may be extended on a covenant to reconstruct if the owner shows the work cannot reasonably be performed within one year.

(3)    City Action. If the owner refuses to execute and record such covenant, then the city may cause such reconstruction or restoration to be done, and the owner shall reimburse the city for all costs incurred in doing the work. The cost of the work performed by the city shall constitute a lien against the property on which the work is performed. Restoration or reconstruction may only be required when plans or other evidence is available to effect the reconstruction or restoration to the satisfaction of the director.

(d)    Additional Penalty. With respect to a violation of this article on a landmark or an improvement within a historic district, or a on a building or structure listed on the inventory of cultural resources, no building or construction-related permits shall be issued for a period of five years following the date of demolition or complete reconstruction pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, whichever occurs last, for property on which demolition has been done in violation of this article. No permits or use of the property as a parking area shall be allowed during the five years if plans or other evidence for reconstruction or restoration of a demolished structure do not exist, or if the reconstruction or restoration is not completed for any reason. Permits which are necessary for public safety or welfare in the opinion of the director may be issued.

For purposes of this section, the date of demolition shall be presumed to have occurred on the date the city has actual knowledge of the demolition, and the owner shall have the burden of proving an earlier date, if entitlement to an earlier date is claimed. The date of complete reconstruction shall be the date that a certificate of occupancy is issued by the city.

(e)    Failure to Maintain. The owner, lessee, or other person in actual charge of a landmark, building, structure or improvement within a historic district, or structure listed on the inventory of cultural resources shall comply with all applicable codes, laws and regulations governing the maintenance of property. It is the intent of this subsection to preserve from deliberate or inadvertent neglect the exterior features of buildings, and the interior portions thereof when such maintenance is necessary to prevent deterioration and decay of the exterior.

(1)    Notice. The director shall cause notice of the applicability of this section to be made by certified mail to the person shown as the owner on the rolls of the tax assessor, and on any other person known to have an interest in the property, as soon as practicable after having knowledge that the provisions of this section are applicable to the property. The date the city first had actual knowledge of the deterioration shall be stated in the notice.

(2)    Consequences for a Failure to Maintain. All landmarks, buildings, structures or improvements within a historic district, or listed on the inventory of cultural resources, shall be preserved against decay and deterioration and shall be free from structural defects through prompt corrections of any of the following defects including, but not limited to:

(A)    Facades which may fall and injure members of the public or property;

(B)    Deteriorated or inadequate foundation, defective or deteriorated flooring or floor supports, deteriorated walls or other vertical structural supports;

(C)    Members of ceilings, roofs, ceiling and roof supports or other horizontal members which sag, split or buckle due to defective material or deterioration;

(D)    Deteriorated or ineffective waterproofing of exterior walls, roofs, foundations or floors, including broken windows or doors;

(E)    Defective or insufficient weather protection for exterior wall covering, including lack of paint or weathering due to lack of paint or other protective covering;

(F)    Any fault or defect in the building which renders it not properly watertight or structurally unsafe;

(G)    Electrical and plumbing systems; and

(H)    Prevention of infestation.

If the owner refuses upon 30 days’ written notice by city to correct or undertake the maintenance of a landmark, building, structure or improvement within a historic district, or a property listed on the inventory of cultural resources, then the city may cause such repair or work to be done, and the owner shall reimburse the city for all costs incurred in doing such work. The cost of the work performed by the city shall constitute a special assessment lien against the property on which the work is performed.

(f)    Appeal of Decision. The decision of the director that this section is applicable to property may be appealed by the affected owner to the cultural heritage commission which shall hold a hearing on such appeal within 60 days of its filing with the city clerk’s office, and which shall render a decision on the appeal within 30 days of the close of the hearing on the appeal. The decision of the commission may be appealed to the city council in accordance with the procedures for appeal in SPMC 2.65(e)(13).

(g)    Remedies Cumulative. The remedies available to the city are cumulative. The city’s exercise of civil remedies shall be in addition and not in lieu of any criminal prosecution and penalty. (Ord. No. 2315, § 2, 2017.)


2.68 Historic preservation incentives.

(a)    By enactment of this section, the city desires to foster preservation of South Pasadena’s cultural resources.

(b)    The following incentives shall be made available to qualifying properties that undergo maintenance or alteration work that is consistent with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties. This work includes rehabilitation for continual use of historic buildings and sites, preservation and maintenance of character-defining features, and restoration of historical resources that have been significantly altered over time.

(1)    Contracts. The city council authorizes the use of contracts pursuant to California Government Code Section 50280 et seq., known as “Mills Act contracts.” Such contracts may be entered into at the sole discretion of the city council based on the recommendations of the cultural heritage commission in a form to be approved by the city attorney. The intent of such contracts shall be the continued preservation of historical properties.

(A)    Purpose. The purpose of this section is to implement state law (Government Code Sections 50280 through 50290), allowing the approval of Mills Act contracts by establishing a uniform procedure for the owners of qualified historic properties within the city to enter into contracts with the city. The city council finds that the Mills Act contract will support the goals and objectives in the historic preservation element of the general plan with regards to incentivizing the maintenance and preservation of cultural resources. The council further finds that entering into a Mills Act contract is an effective incentive to further the city’s preservation goals to rehabilitate, preserve, restore, and maintain qualifying cultural resources.

(B)    Limitations on Eligibility. Mills Act contracts are limited to the following qualifying properties: landmarks; contributing properties of local historic districts; properties listed on the National Register; properties listed on the California Register; and properties that the commission, with concurrence of the city council, may identify as appropriate for a Mills Act contract. The granting of new Mills Act contracts shall be limited to a maximum of four properties each year. That limit does not apply to eligible properties that would benefit from the incentive to do seismic retrofit work to abate a potential threat to public safety.

(C)    Criteria. In considering the merits of a proposed Mills Act contract, the commission shall use the following criteria in making a recommendation to the city council:

(i)    Financial Investment. The estimated tax benefit is not expected to exceed the applicant’s proposed financial investment in the cultural resource over the first 10 years of the contract.

(ii)    Public Benefit. The proposed Mills Act contract features a work plan that will provide a benefit to the public by: rehabilitating the property for continued occupancy or adaptive reuse; improved viability through systems upgrades and structural reinforcement upgrades; preserving and maintaining the character-defining features of the property, and/or restoring character-defining features of the property that have been significantly altered or removed over time.

(iii)    Retroactive Limitations. The estimated tax benefit will not be used for any maintenance or alteration work that was previously completed or initiated before the contract is approved, unless it can be shown that the completed work was necessary in the interest of the public health or safety following involuntary damage or destruction caused by fire, act of nature, or any other casualty.

(iv)    Limitations on Maintenance. The estimated tax benefit will not be used for routine maintenance work except for exemplary or exceptional properties that have financially burdensome maintenance requirements.

(v)    Limitations on Interior Work. The estimated tax benefit will not be used for work within the interior of a cultural resource unless the commission determines the following exceptions should be made: the interior work is necessary to improve the structural integrity of the property; the interior work is necessary to preserve and maintain character-defining features within the cultural resource that are specifically identified as part of the official landmark nomination; and/or the interior work is necessary to preserve and maintain character-defining features of the property that were discovered subsequent to its landmark designation. The commission must first determine that those interior features are character-defining based on substantial evidence provided by the applicant.

(vi)    Limitations on Landscaping. The estimated tax benefit will not be used for landscaping work unless it will be used for specific landscape features that were identified as part of the official landmark nomination.

(D)    Required Provisions. The required provisions of a Mills Act contract shall be those required by state law, Government Code Sections 50281 and 50282, including the following specifications:

(i)    The term of a Mills Act contract shall be for a minimum period of 10 years, unless the property owner is issued a notice of nonrenewal as provided in subsection (b)(1)(E)(v) of this section.

(ii)    Each Mills Act contract shall provide that on the anniversary date of the contract or such other date as is specified in the contract, a year shall be added automatically to the initial term unless a notice of nonrenewal is issued.

(iii)    The property owner shall have the right (per Government Code Section 50282) to appeal a notice of nonrenewal to the city council.

(iv)    Conformance with National Standards. The contract agreement is to assist in the preservation of the qualifying property; therefore, restoration and rehabilitation of the property shall conform to the rules and regulations of the State of California Office of Historic Preservation (Department of Parks and Recreation) and the United States Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties.

(v)    Inspections. The owner shall agree to allow periodic examination of the interior and exterior of the premises by the county assessor, the Department of Parks and Recreation, the State Board of Equalization, and the city, as may be necessary to verify the owner’s compliance with the contract agreement, and to provide any information requested to ensure compliance with the contract agreement.

Each Mills Act contract shall also provide that after five years, and every five years thereafter, the city, county of Los Angeles (county), or city and county shall have the option to inspect the premises to determine the property owner’s compliance with the contract.

(vi)    Reports. The owner shall agree to submit evidence to the city in accordance with the reporting schedule specified in the Mills Act contract (and at a minimum every three years) to confirm that preservation tasks were completed in accordance with the time line stipulated in the Mills Act contract.

(vii)    Nonrenewal. If recommended by the commission and approved by the city council, a notice of nonrenewal may be issued six years into the duration of the contract. The procedure for notice of nonrenewal by the owner or the city shall be in accordance with Government Code Section 50282 as it may be amended from time to time.

(viii)    Binding Effect of Contract. The contract shall be binding on all successors-in-interest of the owner to the benefits and burdens of the contract. The contract shall stipulate escrow instructions that require a review and reevaluation of the property every three years.

(ix)    Cancellation. The Mills Act contract shall state that the city may cancel the contract after a duly noticed public hearing if it determines that the owner has breached any of the conditions of the contract or has allowed the property to deteriorate to the point that it no longer meets the significance criteria under which it was designated (Government Code Sections 50284 and 50285).

(x)    Cancellation Fee. The contract shall state that if the city cancels the contract as provided herein, the owner shall pay the state of California a cancellation fee of 12.5 percent of the full assessed value of the property at the time of cancellation, as determined by the county assessor without regard to any restriction on the property imposed by the Mills Act contract.

The contract shall also provide that in the event preservation, rehabilitation, or restoration becomes infeasible due to damage caused by natural disaster (e.g., earthquake, fire, flood, etc.), the city may cancel the contract without requiring the owner to pay the state of California the above-referenced cancellation fee as a penalty. However, in this event, a contract shall not be cancelled by the city unless the city determines, after consultation with the State of California Office of Historic Preservation, in compliance with Public Resources Code Section 5028, that preservation, rehabilitation, or restoration is infeasible.

(E)    Administration of Mills Act Contracts. The commission shall have the responsibility to recommend to the city council the approval of Mills Act contract proposals. The commission shall prepare and transmit a report of its recommendation to the council on the merits of each proposal.

(i)    Review Timing of New Mills Act Contracts. After January 1st of each year, or as soon as reasonably possible, but in no event later than March 31st of that year, the commission shall accept proposals for Mills Act contracts. After April 1st of each year, or as soon as reasonably possible, but in no event later than June 30th of that year, the commission shall review proposals for Mills Act contracts. After June 30th of each year, or as soon as reasonably possible, but in no event later than September 30th of that year, the commission shall make a recommendation to the city council of no more than four new Mills Act contract proposals.

(ii)    Notification to OHP. The city shall provide written notice of the contract to the State of California Office of Historic Preservation within 180 days of entering into the contract.

(iii)    Review Timing of Current Mills Act Contracts. After June 30th of each year, or as soon as reasonably possible, but in no event later than September 30th of that year, the commission shall review the progress made towards the completion of preservation work stipulated in the Mills Act contracts that are scheduled for review that year and Mills Act contracts that are 10 years or older.

(iv)    Review Criteria for Cancellation of Mills Act Contracts. In considering a recommendation to cancel a Mills Act contract, the commission shall determine whether the owner has breached any of the conditions of the contract or has allowed the property to deteriorate to the point that it no longer meets the significance criteria under which it was designated.

(v)    Review Criteria for Notice of Nonrenewal. In considering a recommendation to issue a notice of nonrenewal of a Mills Act contract, the commission shall use the following criteria in making a recommendation to the city council: (a) the owner has provided substantial evidence to the commission that, although progress has been made towards meeting certain obligations of the contract, the owner cannot fulfill the remaining requirements of the contract due to reasons beyond the owner’s control; or (b) the owner has not complied with the terms of the Mills Act contract, and/or has failed to document evidence of the ongoing preservation maintenance required by the contract, including any changes in the contracted work schedule necessitated by factors beyond the owner’s control, or (c) the commission has determined that the quality of the work is insufficient to achieve the long-term preservation objectives of the Mills Act contract agreement.

Upon receipt by the owner of a notice from the city of nonrenewal, the owner may make a written protest of the notice of nonrenewal (Government Code Section 50282). The city may, at any time prior to the renewal date, withdraw the notice of nonrenewal.

(vi)    Annual Report to City Council. The commission shall prepare and transmit a report of its review of current Mills Act contracts as part of its annual report to the city council.

(vii)    Identification of Properties. The commission may proactively survey the city and identify properties that may benefit from a Mills Act contract. The commission may, if it finds that it is in the best interest of the city, contact the property owner directly and recommend that a Mills Act contract be pursued. (Ord. No. 2315, § 2, 2017.)

(a)    The director of finance is designated as purchasing agent. The director of finance may delegate the routine administrative responsibilities as specified in this section, or in any other applicable purchasing regulations, to another staff person. The purchasing agent shall be the head, and have general supervision of the purchasing department. The duties of the purchasing agent may be combined with those of any other office or position.

(b)    The purchasing agent shall:

1.    Negotiate purchase and contract for equipment, supplies (other than library books and periodicals), nonprofessional services or services not involving peculiar ability required by any office or department of the city in accordance with purchasing procedures prescribed by this section, and such other rules or regulations as shall be prescribed by the city council;

(8)    Local Vendor Purchasing Preference. Local preference is the practice of procurement from South Pasadena vendors because they are also local taxpayers. Purchases from South Pasadena vendors are strongly encouraged where competitive prices and quality exist. With all specifications and conditions equal except price, a preference will be given to in-city vendors equal to two percent of the quoted price when general fund monies are used for the acquisition. The rationale for local preference is that one percent of the sales tax on most acquisitions returns to the city general fund as revenue, effectively reducing the cost of acquisition.

5.    Requisition Forms. Using departments shall submit standard purchase order requisition forms to the purchasing agent when requesting goods and services pursuant to this section.

Except as otherwise provided herein, purchases of supplies (other than library books and periodicals), equipment and services of a value greater than twenty-five thousand dollars shall be completed with the lowest responsible bidder, pursuant to the procedure prescribed in this section.

If the next lowest bidder is awarded the contract and he fails or refuses to execute the contract, he shall forfeit his entire bid security.

(c)    Bid Opening Procedure. Sealed bids shall be submitted to the purchasing agent, and shall be identified as bids on the envelope. Bids shall be opened in public at the time and place stated in the public notices. A tabulation of all bids received shall be open for public inspection during regular business hours for a period of not less than thirty calendar days after the bid opening.

If two or more bids received are for the same total amount or unit price, quality, service and delivery being equal, and if the public interest will not permit the delay of re-advertising for bids, the city council may accept the one it chooses, or accept the lowest bona fide offer by negotiation with the tie bidders at the time of the bid opening.

2.99-29A Purchase and sale of real property.

(a)    Prior to the purchase or sale of real property the city shall cause an appraisal of the property in question in order to establish a fair market value.

(b)    Any appraisal so prepared shall be prepared by a real estate appraiser whose sole business is to appraise real estate and by virtue of education and experience is qualified in real estate appraisal and is a member of any or all of the following:

1.    American Society of Appraisers;

In the event the city is selling property, it will be sold to the highest bidder utilizing the appraised price as a base. Where appraisals between the buyer and seller differ, the city council has the option to negotiate a price which is most advantageous to the city. (Ord. No. 1877, §§ 2—6; Ord. No. 2187, § 9, 2009.)

Preference shall be given to the bid with the highest monetary purchase price which most closely accomplishes the end use goals. As to all cases, the city and the purchaser shall enter into a purchase agreement approved by the city council.

4.    Unless otherwise specified in the notice to bidders, sale of surplus property shall be completed in an escrow of the city’s choice. All successful bids shall be incorporated into a sale and purchase agreement to be approved by the city council.

(a)    Listing Landmarks and Historic Districts on the South Pasadena Register of Landmarks and Historic Districts. The commission shall have the responsibility to recommend to the city council the adoption of ordinances or resolutions designating improvements, sites or natural features as landmarks or historic districts and thereby encouraging their preservation, protection, enhancement, rehabilitation or perpetuation. The commission shall prepare and transmit a report of its recommendation to the council on the historical and architectural significance of the improvement, site or natural feature to be designated as follows:

(1)    The report’s statement of significance shall clearly state the reasons the property meets the city’s criteria with brief facts that explain the way in which the property was important to the local, state or national history during the period of significance. It would also include significant themes and historic contexts to which the property relates.

(2)    In addition to a statement of significance the report shall provide written findings stating the reasons the landmark or historic district qualifies for designation on the South Pasadena register of landmarks and historic districts. These findings shall include:

(A)    That the designation of landmark or historic district is consistent with one or more of the purposes set forth in SPMC 2.58B; and

(B)    That the landmark or historic district meets one or more of the criteria for designation listed in subsection (b) of this section; and

(C)    That the landmark or historic district possesses historic integrity of location, design, setting, materials, workmanship, feeling, or association.

(3)    When considering an application for a historic district or a landmark, the historic resource(s) shall be identified on a primary record or DPR 523 Series form(s) and included as part of the commission’s report. The application shall include a context statement supporting a finding establishing the relation between the physical environment of the landmark or historic district and its history. The context statement shall represent the history of the area by theme, place, and time. It shall define the various historic factors which shaped the development of the area. It shall define a period of significance for the historic district and relate historic features to that period of significance. It may include, but not be limited to, historical activities or events, associations with historic personages, architectural styles and movements, master architects, designers, building types, building materials, landscape design, or pattern of physical development that influenced the character of the landmark or historic district at a particular time in history. Using this information, the survey shall identify those buildings, structures, landscaping, or contributing resources.

(4)    In addition to the required findings in subsection (a)(2) of this section when recommending approval of a historic district, the commission shall also find that:

(A)    The proposed district boundaries are appropriate because a significant concentration, linkage, or continuity of sites, buildings, structures, or objects united historically or aesthetically by plan or physical development are present within the district. A district derives its importance from being a unified entity or a theme, even though it may be composed of a wide variety of resources (organized around a theme). Thematic districts are not required to have physical or contiguous boundaries.

(B)    The identity of the district results from the interrelationship of its resources which conveys a visual sense of the overall historic environment or is an arrangement of historically or functionally related properties.

(C)    The district contains a number of contributing resources that add to the historic architectural qualities or historic associations for which a district is significant because they existed during the period of significance and possess historic integrity reflecting the district’s character at that time.

(D)    With respect to the designation of a local district that is not listed on the California Register of Historical Resources, but was identified in a local survey, not less than 60 percent of all affected owners of the proposed historic district must consent to such designation. Each parcel or lot shall be entitled to only one vote per parcel. By way of example only, if the proposed historic district were composed of 20 parcels, then the owners of 12 parcels would be required to consent to the designation.

(E)    With respect to the designation of a historic district that is listed on the California Register of Historical Resources, not less than 50 percent plus one of all affected owners of the proposed historic district must consent to such designation. Each parcel or lot shall be entitled to only one vote per parcel. By way of example only, if the proposed historic district were composed of 20 parcels, then 11 property owners would be required to consent to the designation.

(5)    In recommending approval of a historic district, the cultural heritage commission may recommend conditions to be included in design guidelines, as appropriate to further the purpose of this section.

(b)    Designation Criteria for Landmarks and Historic Districts. Criteria and standards for the designation of landmarks and historic districts shall include any or all of the following, as applicable:

(1)    Its character, interest or value as a part of the heritage of the community;

(2)    Its location as a site of a significant historic event;

(3)    Its identification (such as the residence, ownership, or place of occupation, etc.) with a person, persons or groups who significantly contributed to the culture and development of the city, state or United States;

(4)    Its exemplification of a particular architectural style of an era of history of the city;

(5)    Its exemplification of the best remaining architectural type in a neighborhood;

(6)    Its identification as the work of a person or persons whose work has influenced the heritage of the city, the state or the United States;

(7)    Its embodiment of elements of outstanding attention to architectural design, engineering, detail design, detail, materials or craftsmanship;

(8)    It is either a part of or related to a square, park or other distinctive area which should be developed or preserved according to a plan based on a historic cultural or architectural motif;

(9)    Its unique location or singular physical characteristic representing an established and familiar visual feature of a neighborhood;

(10)    Its potential for yielding information of archaeological interest; or

(11)    In designating a historic district, its significance as a distinguishable neighborhood or area whose components may lack individual distinction.

(c)    Designation Procedure. Landmarks and historic districts shall be established by the city council in the following manner:

(1)    The commission, upon its own initiative or upon the written request of any person or city agency, may recommend the designation of any cultural resource in the city as a landmark or historic district.

(2)    The commission shall appoint a subcommittee of two members (the “landmark subcommittee”) to review all applications for consideration of an improvement, site or natural feature as a landmark or historic district. The landmark subcommittee shall review the application materials and make a preliminary written recommendation, based on such documentation as it may require, as to whether the commission shall consider the improvement, site or natural feature for appropriate designation. The landmark subcommittee, as soon as practicable and prior to the hearing on designation, shall:

(A)    With respect to the proposed designation of a landmark, exercise its best efforts to meet with the owner to obtain such owner’s written consent of the proposed designation; and

(B)    With respect to the proposed designation of a historic district, shall have obtained the consent of affected owners in accordance with subsection (a)(4)(D) or (E) of this section. The aforementioned consent shall be obtained by sending a ballot and an impartial opinion of the city attorney to every parcel owner in said district, as to the effect of the designation on the parcels located in the proposed district. The ballot shall provide the owner with the option to consent to or to oppose the proposed historic district designation.

(3)    If the landmark subcommittee determines that the improvement, site or natural feature, which is the subject of the application, merits consideration by the commission, it shall recommend that the commission place the application upon its agenda for its next regularly scheduled meeting for consideration of such designation.

(4)    The commission shall notify the director of the pendency of the consideration. No applications for design review shall be accepted by the planning and building department to construct, alter or demolish any property that is not on the South Pasadena inventory of historical resources within a proposed historic district, subsequent to the date of notice to the director by the commission, while proceedings are pending on such designation; provided, however, that after 180 days have elapsed from the date of the notice, if final action on such designation has not been completed, the applications for design review may be accepted by the planning and building department.

(5)    The commission shall send written notice by certified mail to each directly affected owner of a proposed designation as a landmark or historic district of the date, place, time and purpose of the hearing to consider such designation, at least 20 days prior to the date of the hearing, and shall publish notice of such hearing at least once in a newspaper of general circulation in the city not less than 10 days prior to such hearing.

(6)    The commission shall provide an opportunity to be heard to each affected owner and other interested members of the public. The commission may, if necessary, continue the consideration of designation to its next regularly scheduled meeting.

(7)    The commission shall, within 15 days of its hearing regarding designation or of any continued hearing on the designation, recommend approval in whole or in part, or disapproval in whole or in part, of the application, in writing to the city council.

(8)    The affected owner(s) may object to the decision of the commission by filing with the city clerk a written statement setting forth their objection prior to the hearing before the city council.

(9)    The city council, upon receipt of the recommendation, shall set the matter for hearing within 30 days of the date of filing of the commission recommendation with the city clerk. The council shall cause written notice of the council hearing to be given by registered mail to each affected owner and shall provide a reasonable opportunity for the owner to be heard at the council hearing. The city council shall render its decision thereon within 30 days after the close of the hearing of the city council.

(10)    The city shall notify the affected owner in writing of the final action of the city council with respect to the proposed designation and shall give such owner written notice of any further action which it takes with respect to such designation.

(11)    Failure to send any notice by mail to any affected owner where the address of such owner is not a matter of public record shall not invalidate any proceedings in connection with the proposed designation. The commission and city council may also give such other notice as they may deem desirable and practicable.

(12)    Upon designation by the city council, the city clerk shall record the city council’s declaration in the office of the county recorder of the county. (Ord. No. 2315, § 2, 2017.)


2.64 Inventory of cultural resources.

(a)    The city shall establish and maintain an inventory of cultural resources as follows:

(1)    The Inventory. The city shall maintain an official list of properties known as the South Pasadena inventory of cultural resources (“inventory”) that it has determined, upon recommendation by the cultural heritage commission and approved by city council, to be historically significant through the systematic inventory and evaluation of buildings within its jurisdiction.

(A)    The inventory was first established with the passage of city council Resolution No. 6286 and has been subsequently revised upon any subsequent updates by the South Pasadena city council.

(B)    The inventory shall be reviewed every five years, and revised if necessary, to ensure that the document remains up to date according to current preservation planning practice.

(2)    Inclusions. The official list of properties located on the inventory is located in the City Hall and includes those properties that are located within the city of South Pasadena that are landmark and historic district properties, historic properties listed on the California Register, properties that are listed as being eligible for special consideration in local planning to assure continuity of the city’s historic character, scale, and small town atmosphere for all projects, and properties that the city determines to be historically significant based on the criteria for additions as outlined in subsection (a)(3) of this section.

(3)    Listing Property on the Inventory. A property owner may submit a written application for inclusion of his/her property on the inventory to the commission. The application shall provide photographic evidence, an evaluation by an architectural historian including the current Primary Record or DPR 523 Series form to record historic resources, and such further information as the commission may require. Written notice of such an application for addition and the time and place of a public hearing before the commission shall be provided to property owners within a 300-foot radius of the subject property not less than 10 days prior to the hearing.

(A)    If the commission finds that there is substantial evidence that the property reasonably meets national, state or local criteria for historical significance, and that it has been so evaluated by an architectural historian, it shall recommend to the city council that the property be included on the inventory of cultural resources. The city council shall consider the recommendation and may, at its discretion, request further information from the applicant and hold a public hearing. The city council may, by resolution, determine that the property be included on the inventory of cultural resources.

(4)    De-Listing Property from the Inventory. An owner of a property listed on the inventory of cultural resources may submit a written application to the commission requesting removal from the inventory. The application shall provide evidence and supporting documentation regarding the lack of historic significance of the cultural resource, including photographic evidence of its current condition, an evaluation by an architectural historian, and such further information as the commission may require. Written notice of such an application for de-listing and the time and place of a public hearing before the commission shall be provided to property owners within a 300-foot radius of the subject [property] not less than 10 days prior to the hearing. If the commission finds:

(A)    That the cultural resource lacks significance as defined under national, state, and local criteria for historical significance; or

(B)    That the cultural resource has lost its historic integrity due to irreversible alterations.

The commission shall make a recommendation to the city council that the cultural resource be de-listed from the inventory. The city council shall consider the recommendation and may, in its discretion, request further information from the applicant and hold an additional public hearing. The city council may, by resolution, determine that the cultural resource be de-listed from the inventory.

(5)    Initiation by Commission. Listing and de-listing properties from the inventory may also be initiated by a majority vote of the members of the commission. Should the commission initiate the addition of a cultural resource to the inventory, or de-listing of a cultural resource from the inventory, written notice of the time and place of a public hearing before the commission shall be given to the owner of said property or cultural resource, and to property owners within a 300-foot radius of said property or cultural resource, at least 10 days prior to the hearing.

(A)    Recommendations to the city council as to such addition or deletion shall be made by the commission upon making the applicable findings set forth in subsection (a)(3) or (4) of this section. The city council shall consider the recommendation and may, in its discretion, request further information and hold an additional public hearing. The council may, by resolution, determine that the property be listed to or de-listed from the inventory.

(6)    Deletion from Inventory. A cultural resource shall be deleted from the inventory upon complete destruction of that cultural resource pursuant to a duly issued certificate of appropriateness for such destruction by the city. (Ord. No. 2315, § 2, 2017.)


2.65 Certificate of appropriateness – Alteration and demolition.

(a)    Purpose. This section sets forth the process for obtaining a certificate of appropriateness (“certificate”) from the commission, for the purpose of authorizing proposed work that may affect cultural resources (as defined by this article), noncontributors within the boundaries of federal, state, and local historic districts within the city of South Pasadena.

No person shall proceed with demolition, alteration, or relocation of such resources, or new construction affecting such resources, without first obtaining a certificate. Approval of such work shall be required even if no other permits or entitlements are required by the city, and the commission’s approval or denial of the proposed work shall be deemed a discretionary action under CEQA (California Code of Regulations, Title 14, Section 15002(i)).

(b)    Intent. It is the intent of the city of South Pasadena that cultural resources will not be the subject of demolition, alteration or relocation unless an imminent threat, as determined by the building official pursuant to SPMC 2.66, exists. Review of all applications for a certificate of appropriateness shall comply with all applicable state and federal laws and regulations, including without limitation, the California Environmental Quality Act, the National Historic Preservation Act and the National Environmental Policy Act.

(c)    Actions Requiring a Certificate of Appropriateness. The following actions shall require a certificate of appropriateness from the commission. Performance of any work that falls within the provisions of this article without a certificate of appropriateness is prohibited:

(1)    Alteration, demolition, relocation of, or new construction affecting the South Pasadena register of landmarks and historic districts; the South Pasadena inventory of cultural resources; and any other cultural resources; and

(2)    Any other project referred to the commission by the city council, planning commission, or city staff.

(d)    Exemptions from Requirements for Certificate of Appropriateness. The following items of construction, work, or labor on an improvement or natural feature are deemed not to be an alteration for the purposes of this article and shall not require a certificate of appropriateness:

(1)    Painting of any residential or commercial building;

(2)    Ordinary maintenance and repair which does not require a building permit;

(3)    Landscaping, including sprinkler system work, that does not affect a character-defining feature;

(4)    Paving work that does not affect a character-defining feature;

(5)    All alterations which are entirely interior and do not affect the exterior of an improvement, except for designated interiors of a landmark property (including character-defining interior features not described in original landmark documentation, but subsequently discovered and documented);

(6)    All alterations affecting an existing or proposed accessory dwelling unit; and

(7)    Replacement of existing screens and awnings with the same or substantially consistent materials, form, and shape.

(e)    Procedures for a Certificate of Appropriateness.

(1)    Emergency Actions. The procedures in this section shall not apply to demolition, alteration, and relocation requests pertaining to improvements that need expedited evaluation due to an imminent threat in the interest of the public health or safety (see SPMC 2.66).

(2)    Application. The owner or authorized representative proposing a discretionary project that may affect: a cultural resource, a noncontributing resource within the boundaries of federal, state, and local historic districts, shall file an application for a certificate of appropriateness on forms provided by the city’s planning and building department for such purpose. The application must be accompanied by any fee required by the city.

(3)    Properties 45 Years or Older. A certificate of appropriateness may be required for demolition of a building or structure that is 45 years or older, and not identified as a cultural resource. The purpose of this subsection is to ensure that such buildings and structures are properly evaluated prior to their demolition or removal.

(A)    Applicability. Any proposed project submitted to the planning and building department that includes the demolition or removal of a building or structure that was constructed at least 45 years prior to the date of application for such project shall file a notice of intent to demolish in a form approved by the director. The determination as to whether a property is a cultural resource shall require a deposit by the applicant to cover city costs associated with hiring a historic consultant and/or an architectural historian; and/or a deposit to cover the costs associated with the preparation of an initial study, environmental impact report, mitigated negative declaration or negative declaration.

(B)    Procedure. The director or his/her designee shall review the project involving demolition and confirm that the following materials have been provided including: an intensive level historic resources evaluation (HRE) that follows the practices established by the California Office of Historic Preservation shall be prepared for the property; plans for the replacement development project consistent with the standards and requirements of the applicable zoning district; and photo verification that the property has been posted with a notice of intent to demolish. Upon receipt of the filing materials, the director or his/her designee will schedule the demolition application for the next available commission meeting.

(C)    Notice. Public notification shall be provided to the applicant, to all owners of real property as shown on the county’s latest equalized assessment roll, and to all legal occupants located within a 300-foot radius of the subject parcel upon which the intent to demolish is requested.

(D)    Determination by Commission. The commission will make a determination as to whether the property could potentially meet national, state, or local criteria for designation if the property is not already listed as a cultural resource.

(i)    If the commission determines, upon review of the filing materials and testimony, that the property is not eligible at the federal, state, or local level, the project involving demolition shall proceed through the city’s application process without any further restrictions under this chapter.

(ii)    If the commission determines that the property is potentially eligible at the federal, state, or local level, the property shall be added to the inventory and the provisions of this subsection (e), Procedures for a Certificate of Appropriateness, shall apply to the proposed demolition. If any such resources are potentially affected by a project, the city shall require preparation of the appropriate CEQA documentation.

(4)    Minor Project Review. A certificate of appropriateness may be obtained by going through a minor project review if it involves: demolition or relocation of non-character-defining features; noncontributing additions, garages, accessory structures or incompatible and previously replaced windows, doors or siding material; any undertaking that does not change exterior features such as re-roofing if the proposed roofing material is comparable in appearance, color and profile to the existing or original roofing material; replacement of windows and doors if the proposed replacements are of the same materials, form, color, and location as the existing or original windows and doors; an addition of less than 200 square feet proposed for the side or rear elevations (not visible from the public right-of-way) and does not materially alter the features or have an adverse effect on the historic integrity of a cultural resource; minor changes to a previously approved certificate; or any other undertaking determined by the director or his/her designee to not materially alter the features or have an adverse effect on the integrity of a cultural resource.

(A)    Requirements. The required application materials for minor project review shall include, without limitation: a written narrative of the proposed project, a vicinity map, a site plan, exterior elevations drawn to scale, a window and door schedule, and photographs of the structure and the neighborhood.

(B)    Review Process. After the certificate of appropriateness application for minor project review is deemed complete by the director or his/her designee, the commission’s chairperson (the “chair”), or his/her designee, shall evaluate the application to determine its eligibility for minor project review. If the proposed project meets the eligibility criteria for minor project review, the commission’s chairperson, or his/her designee, may elect to do one of the following:

(i)    Approve the Certificate of Appropriateness. If the proposed minor project is deemed consistent with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties and the city of South Pasadena’s adopted design guidelines, the commission’s chairperson or his/her designee may approve the proposed project;

(ii)    Consent Calendar. If the chair, or his/her designee, determines that the proposed minor project needs additional review by the commission, he or she may elect to place it on the commission’s next meeting agenda. Such project shall be noticed pursuant to subsection (e)(7) of this section, Public Notice Requirements, as a consent calendar item on that agenda; or

(iii)    Deny the Certificate of Appropriateness. If the proposed minor project is deemed to be inconsistent with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties and the city’s adopted design guidelines, the chair or his/her designee may elect to refer the proposed project to the entire commission through the certificate of appropriateness (major project review) procedure pursuant to subsection (e)(5) of this section.

Code Regs. Title 14] Section 15331.)

(iv)    The California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and its implementing guidelines and whether the project would normally qualify for a categorical exemption from CEQA, but the project is subject to CEQA because the project “may cause a substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource.” (CEQA Guideline Section 15300.2(f) [Exception for Historical Resources]; CEQA Guideline Section 15064.5(b) [Determining the Significance of Impacts on Historical and Unique Archaeological Resources; definition of “substantial adverse change in the significance of a historical resource”].)

(v)    State Historical Building Code (Title 24, Part 8 of California Code of Regulations).

Any hearing may be continued from time to time.

(14)    Certificate of Economic Hardship. In considering the appropriateness of either demolition or alteration, the commission shall approve or conditionally approve a certificate of appropriateness if it finds that such cultural resource cannot be remodeled or rehabilitated in a manner which would allow a reasonable use of or reasonable return on investment from the property to the owner.

If the project is subject to CEQA, the certificate of economic hardship shall not be granted until all CEQA review has been conducted in accordance with law.

2.66 Certificate of appropriateness not required – Conditions posing an imminent threat to life, limb, or property.

(a)    Intent. It is the intent of the city of South Pasadena to limit demolition of any cultural resources to the final course of action in an emergency, used only when other efforts are not feasible to abate an imminent threat.

(b)    Necessary Work in Connection with an Imminent Threat. Where the building official has determined that a structure regulated by the California Building Code may pose an imminent threat to life, limb, or property, the building official shall consider the following criteria and procedures prior to issuing an order to abate the imminent threat:

(1)    The extent to which the condition of the building(s) or structure(s) is immediately dangerous within the meaning of the South Pasadena Municipal Code;

(2)    The extent to which there are any feasible alternatives to demolition of a cultural resource that will adequately protect the health and safety of the public including, but not limited to, the following: securing the building, securing the property, bracing of the structure, shoring, or equivalent similar action.

Such actions may be ordered by the building official to abate an imminent threat and no certificate of appropriateness shall be required.

(3)    If the building official identifies the need to permit a demolition of a cultural resource, and after considering the first priority of protecting the public health and safety, the building official shall notify the director at the earliest feasible opportunity regarding the potential impact on a cultural resource and the necessary steps to abate any imminent threat to the public health or safety. Upon the director’s receipt of notice from the building official, the director shall notify the commission’s chairperson (the “chair”), or his/her designee, for the purpose of discussing the conditions and alternatives identified in subsection (b)(2) of this section.

(4)    If the director determines, following the consultation with the building official and the commission’s chair, that all or some portion of a demolition of a cultural resource is necessary to abate an imminent threat to the public health or safety, the director is authorized to approve the demolition upon factoring in any feasible alternative to demolition in whole or in part, as the least invasive corrective measure identified during the consultation.

(5)    As soon as feasible under the circumstances, the director, or his/her designee, shall present to the commission a summary of any actions taken pursuant to this subsection (b).

(6)    Where the building official has determined that the imminent threat has been abated and the structure has been determined by the building official to be in a state of disrepair as defined in the municipal code, then the substandard condition(s) shall be abated through the certificate of appropriateness process for alterations or demolitions pursuant to SPMC 2.65. (Ord. No. 2315, § 2, 2017.)


2.67 Enforcement and penalties.

(a)    Unpermitted Work without a Certificate. Demolition, relocation, alteration or removal of any improvement, site or natural feature subject to the provisions of this article without obtaining a certificate of appropriateness is a misdemeanor and is further hereby expressly declared to be a nuisance.

(b)    Obligations and Consequences upon Failure to Obtain a Certificate of Appropriateness. Unpermitted work, without the approval of a certificate of appropriateness pursuant to the requirements of this article, shall be addressed as follows:

(1)    The director or his/her designee shall give notice to the owner of record by certified or registered mail of the specific demolition or alteration work that was made without first obtaining a certificate of appropriateness. The owner or person in charge of the structure shall apply within 30 days for a certificate of appropriateness.

(2)    In reviewing the unpermitted alterations, demolition, relocation, or removal, the commission shall either:

(A)    Approve the certificate of appropriateness pursuant to the criteria specified in SPMC 2.65; or

(B)    Deny the certificate of appropriateness and require that the inappropriate alteration(s) or demolition be abated pursuant to subsection (c) of this section.

(3)    If the property owner fails to apply for a certificate of appropriateness or abatement of the public nuisance pursuant to subsection (c) of this section is not possible, the matter shall be referred to the city prosecutor for further action.

(c)    Abatement of Nuisance. Any work undertaken for which a certificate of appropriateness is required but was not obtained shall be deemed a nuisance. Such nuisance shall be abated by reconstructing or restoring the property to its original condition prior to the performance of work in violation of this article in the following manner:

(1)    Covenant to Reconstruct Within One Year. Within 30 days of the effective date of the commission’s denial of a certificate of appropriateness, the owner of the property shall execute and record a covenant in favor of the city to do such reconstruction or restoration within one year of the effective date of the commission’s decision to deny a certificate of appropriateness. The form of the covenant shall be subject to approval by the city attorney, and shall run with the land.

(2)    Time Extension on Covenant. Upon application to the commission, the time may be extended on a covenant to reconstruct if the owner shows the work cannot reasonably be performed within one year.

(3)    City Action. If the owner refuses to execute and record such covenant, then the city may cause such reconstruction or restoration to be done, and the owner shall reimburse the city for all costs incurred in doing the work. The cost of the work performed by the city shall constitute a lien against the property on which the work is performed. Restoration or reconstruction may only be required when plans or other evidence is available to effect the reconstruction or restoration to the satisfaction of the director.

(d)    Additional Penalty. With respect to a violation of this article on a landmark or an improvement within a historic district, or a on a building or structure listed on the inventory of cultural resources, no building or construction-related permits shall be issued for a period of five years following the date of demolition or complete reconstruction pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, whichever occurs last, for property on which demolition has been done in violation of this article. No permits or use of the property as a parking area shall be allowed during the five years if plans or other evidence for reconstruction or restoration of a demolished structure do not exist, or if the reconstruction or restoration is not completed for any reason. Permits which are necessary for public safety or welfare in the opinion of the director may be issued.

For purposes of this section, the date of demolition shall be presumed to have occurred on the date the city has actual knowledge of the demolition, and the owner shall have the burden of proving an earlier date, if entitlement to an earlier date is claimed. The date of complete reconstruction shall be the date that a certificate of occupancy is issued by the city.

(e)    Failure to Maintain. The owner, lessee, or other person in actual charge of a landmark, building, structure or improvement within a historic district, or structure listed on the inventory of cultural resources shall comply with all applicable codes, laws and regulations governing the maintenance of property. It is the intent of this subsection to preserve from deliberate or inadvertent neglect the exterior features of buildings, and the interior portions thereof when such maintenance is necessary to prevent deterioration and decay of the exterior.

(1)    Notice. The director shall cause notice of the applicability of this section to be made by certified mail to the person shown as the owner on the rolls of the tax assessor, and on any other person known to have an interest in the property, as soon as practicable after having knowledge that the provisions of this section are applicable to the property. The date the city first had actual knowledge of the deterioration shall be stated in the notice.

(2)    Consequences for a Failure to Maintain. All landmarks, buildings, structures or improvements within a historic district, or listed on the inventory of cultural resources, shall be preserved against decay and deterioration and shall be free from structural defects through prompt corrections of any of the following defects including, but not limited to:

(A)    Facades which may fall and injure members of the public or property;

(B)    Deteriorated or inadequate foundation, defective or deteriorated flooring or floor supports, deteriorated walls or other vertical structural supports;

(C)    Members of ceilings, roofs, ceiling and roof supports or other horizontal members which sag, split or buckle due to defective material or deterioration;

(D)    Deteriorated or ineffective waterproofing of exterior walls, roofs, foundations or floors, including broken windows or doors;

(E)    Defective or insufficient weather protection for exterior wall covering, including lack of paint or weathering due to lack of paint or other protective covering;

(F)    Any fault or defect in the building which renders it not properly watertight or structurally unsafe;

(G)    Electrical and plumbing systems; and

(H)    Prevention of infestation.

If the owner refuses upon 30 days’ written notice by city to correct or undertake the maintenance of a landmark, building, structure or improvement within a historic district, or a property listed on the inventory of cultural resources, then the city may cause such repair or work to be done, and the owner shall reimburse the city for all costs incurred in doing such work. The cost of the work performed by the city shall constitute a special assessment lien against the property on which the work is performed.

(f)    Appeal of Decision. The decision of the director that this section is applicable to property may be appealed by the affected owner to the cultural heritage commission which shall hold a hearing on such appeal within 60 days of its filing with the city clerk’s office, and which shall render a decision on the appeal within 30 days of the close of the hearing on the appeal. The decision of the commission may be appealed to the city council in accordance with the procedures for appeal in SPMC 2.65(e)(13).

(g)    Remedies Cumulative. The remedies available to the city are cumulative. The city’s exercise of civil remedies shall be in addition and not in lieu of any criminal prosecution and penalty. (Ord. No. 2315, § 2, 2017.)


2.68 Historic preservation incentives.

(a)    By enactment of this section, the city desires to foster preservation of South Pasadena’s cultural resources.

(b)    The following incentives shall be made available to qualifying properties that undergo maintenance or alteration work that is consistent with the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties. This work includes rehabilitation for continual use of historic buildings and sites, preservation and maintenance of character-defining features, and restoration of historical resources that have been significantly altered over time.

(1)    Contracts. The city council authorizes the use of contracts pursuant to California Government Code Section 50280 et seq., known as “Mills Act contracts.” Such contracts may be entered into at the sole discretion of the city council based on the recommendations of the cultural heritage commission in a form to be approved by the city attorney. The intent of such contracts shall be the continued preservation of historical properties.

(A)    Purpose. The purpose of this section is to implement state law (Government Code Sections 50280 through 50290), allowing the approval of Mills Act contracts by establishing a uniform procedure for the owners of qualified historic properties within the city to enter into contracts with the city. The city council finds that the Mills Act contract will support the goals and objectives in the historic preservation element of the general plan with regards to incentivizing the maintenance and preservation of cultural resources. The council further finds that entering into a Mills Act contract is an effective incentive to further the city’s preservation goals to rehabilitate, preserve, restore, and maintain qualifying cultural resources.

(B)    Limitations on Eligibility. Mills Act contracts are limited to the following qualifying properties: landmarks; contributing properties of local historic districts; properties listed on the National Register; properties listed on the California Register; and properties that the commission, with concurrence of the city council, may identify as appropriate for a Mills Act contract. The granting of new Mills Act contracts shall be limited to a maximum of four properties each year. That limit does not apply to eligible properties that would benefit from the incentive to do seismic retrofit work to abate a potential threat to public safety.

(C)    Criteria. In considering the merits of a proposed Mills Act contract, the commission shall use the following criteria in making a recommendation to the city council:

(i)    Financial Investment. The estimated tax benefit is not expected to exceed the applicant’s proposed financial investment in the cultural resource over the first 10 years of the contract.

(ii)    Public Benefit. The proposed Mills Act contract features a work plan that will provide a benefit to the public by: rehabilitating the property for continued occupancy or adaptive reuse; improved viability through systems upgrades and structural reinforcement upgrades; preserving and maintaining the character-defining features of the property, and/or restoring character-defining features of the property that have been significantly altered or removed over time.

(iii)    Retroactive Limitations. The estimated tax benefit will not be used for any maintenance or alteration work that was previously completed or initiated before the contract is approved, unless it can be shown that the completed work was necessary in the interest of the public health or safety following involuntary damage or destruction caused by fire, act of nature, or any other casualty.

(iv)    Limitations on Maintenance. The estimated tax benefit will not be used for routine maintenance work except for exemplary or exceptional properties that have financially burdensome maintenance requirements.

(v)    Limitations on Interior Work. The estimated tax benefit will not be used for work within the interior of a cultural resource unless the commission determines the following exceptions should be made: the interior work is necessary to improve the structural integrity of the property; the interior work is necessary to preserve and maintain character-defining features within the cultural resource that are specifically identified as part of the official landmark nomination; and/or the interior work is necessary to preserve and maintain character-defining features of the property that were discovered subsequent to its landmark designation. The commission must first determine that those interior features are character-defining based on substantial evidence provided by the applicant.

(vi)    Limitations on Landscaping. The estimated tax benefit will not be used for landscaping work unless it will be used for specific landscape features that were identified as part of the official landmark nomination.

(D)    Required Provisions. The required provisions of a Mills Act contract shall be those required by state law, Government Code Sections 50281 and 50282, including the following specifications:

(i)    The term of a Mills Act contract shall be for a minimum period of 10 years, unless the property owner is issued a notice of nonrenewal as provided in subsection (b)(1)(E)(v) of this section.

(ii)    Each Mills Act contract shall provide that on the anniversary date of the contract or such other date as is specified in the contract, a year shall be added automatically to the initial term unless a notice of nonrenewal is issued.

(iii)    The property owner shall have the right (per Government Code Section 50282) to appeal a notice of nonrenewal to the city council.

(iv)    Conformance with National Standards. The contract agreement is to assist in the preservation of the qualifying property; therefore, restoration and rehabilitation of the property shall conform to the rules and regulations of the State of California Office of Historic Preservation (Department of Parks and Recreation) and the United States Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for the Treatment of Historic Properties.

(v)    Inspections. The owner shall agree to allow periodic examination of the interior and exterior of the premises by the county assessor, the Department of Parks and Recreation, the State Board of Equalization, and the city, as may be necessary to verify the owner’s compliance with the contract agreement, and to provide any information requested to ensure compliance with the contract agreement.

Each Mills Act contract shall also provide that after five years, and every five years thereafter, the city, county of Los Angeles (county), or city and county shall have the option to inspect the premises to determine the property owner’s compliance with the contract.

(vi)    Reports. The owner shall agree to submit evidence to the city in accordance with the reporting schedule specified in the Mills Act contract (and at a minimum every three years) to confirm that preservation tasks were completed in accordance with the time line stipulated in the Mills Act contract.

(vii)    Nonrenewal. If recommended by the commission and approved by the city council, a notice of nonrenewal may be issued six years into the duration of the contract. The procedure for notice of nonrenewal by the owner or the city shall be in accordance with Government Code Section 50282 as it may be amended from time to time.

(viii)    Binding Effect of Contract. The contract shall be binding on all successors-in-interest of the owner to the benefits and burdens of the contract. The contract shall stipulate escrow instructions that require a review and reevaluation of the property every three years.

(ix)    Cancellation. The Mills Act contract shall state that the city may cancel the contract after a duly noticed public hearing if it determines that the owner has breached any of the conditions of the contract or has allowed the property to deteriorate to the point that it no longer meets the significance criteria under which it was designated (Government Code Sections 50284 and 50285).

(x)    Cancellation Fee. The contract shall state that if the city cancels the contract as provided herein, the owner shall pay the state of California a cancellation fee of 12.5 percent of the full assessed value of the property at the time of cancellation, as determined by the county assessor without regard to any restriction on the property imposed by the Mills Act contract.

The contract shall also provide that in the event preservation, rehabilitation, or restoration becomes infeasible due to damage caused by natural disaster (e.g., earthquake, fire, flood, etc.), the city may cancel the contract without requiring the owner to pay the state of California the above-referenced cancellation fee as a penalty. However, in this event, a contract shall not be cancelled by the city unless the city determines, after consultation with the State of California Office of Historic Preservation, in compliance with Public Resources Code Section 5028, that preservation, rehabilitation, or restoration is infeasible.

(E)    Administration of Mills Act Contracts. The commission shall have the responsibility to recommend to the city council the approval of Mills Act contract proposals. The commission shall prepare and transmit a report of its recommendation to the council on the merits of each proposal.

(i)    Review Timing of New Mills Act Contracts. After January 1st of each year, or as soon as reasonably possible, but in no event later than March 31st of that year, the commission shall accept proposals for Mills Act contracts. After April 1st of each year, or as soon as reasonably possible, but in no event later than June 30th of that year, the commission shall review proposals for Mills Act contracts. After June 30th of each year, or as soon as reasonably possible, but in no event later than September 30th of that year, the commission shall make a recommendation to the city council of no more than four new Mills Act contract proposals.

(ii)    Notification to OHP. The city shall provide written notice of the contract to the State of California Office of Historic Preservation within 180 days of entering into the contract.

(iii)    Review Timing of Current Mills Act Contracts. After June 30th of each year, or as soon as reasonably possible, but in no event later than September 30th of that year, the commission shall review the progress made towards the completion of preservation work stipulated in the Mills Act contracts that are scheduled for review that year and Mills Act contracts that are 10 years or older.

(iv)    Review Criteria for Cancellation of Mills Act Contracts. In considering a recommendation to cancel a Mills Act contract, the commission shall determine whether the owner has breached any of the conditions of the contract or has allowed the property to deteriorate to the point that it no longer meets the significance criteria under which it was designated.

(v)    Review Criteria for Notice of Nonrenewal. In considering a recommendation to issue a notice of nonrenewal of a Mills Act contract, the commission shall use the following criteria in making a recommendation to the city council: (a) the owner has provided substantial evidence to the commission that, although progress has been made towards meeting certain obligations of the contract, the owner cannot fulfill the remaining requirements of the contract due to reasons beyond the owner’s control; or (b) the owner has not complied with the terms of the Mills Act contract, and/or has failed to document evidence of the ongoing preservation maintenance required by the contract, including any changes in the contracted work schedule necessitated by factors beyond the owner’s control, or (c) the commission has determined that the quality of the work is insufficient to achieve the long-term preservation objectives of the Mills Act contract agreement.

Upon receipt by the owner of a notice from the city of nonrenewal, the owner may make a written protest of the notice of nonrenewal (Government Code Section 50282). The city may, at any time prior to the renewal date, withdraw the notice of nonrenewal.

(vi)    Annual Report to City Council. The commission shall prepare and transmit a report of its review of current Mills Act contracts as part of its annual report to the city council.

(vii)    Identification of Properties. The commission may proactively survey the city and identify properties that may benefit from a Mills Act contract. The commission may, if it finds that it is in the best interest of the city, contact the property owner directly and recommend that a Mills Act contract be pursued. (Ord. No. 2315, § 2, 2017.)

(4)    Purchasing Agent Designated—Powers and Duties.

(a)    The director of finance is designated as purchasing agent. The director of finance may delegate the routine administrative responsibilities as specified in this section, or in any other applicable purchasing regulations, to another staff person. The purchasing agent shall be the head, and have general supervision of the purchasing department. The duties of the purchasing agent may be combined with those of any other office or position.

(b)    The purchasing agent shall:

1.    Negotiate purchase and contract for equipment, supplies (other than library books and periodicals), nonprofessional services or services not involving peculiar ability required by any office or department of the city in accordance with purchasing procedures prescribed by this section, and such other rules or regulations as shall be prescribed by the city council;

2.    Act to procure for the city the needed quality in equipment, supplies, nonprofessional services or services not involving peculiar ability, at least expense to the city;

3.    Discourage uniform bidding, and endeavor to obtain as full and open competition as possible on all purchases;

4.    Prepare and recommend to the city manager and city council rules governing the purchase of supplies, services and equipment for the city;

(5)    Filing of Estimated Requirements. Each city department shall file detailed estimates of their requirements in supplies, services and equipment in such manner, at such time, and for such future periods as the purchasing agent shall prescribe.

(6)    Exemptions from Centralized Purchasing.

Public works projects shall be awarded according the procedures of Article XIII, Awarding Public Works Contracts.

(8)    Local Vendor Purchasing Preference. Local preference is the practice of procurement from South Pasadena vendors because they are also local taxpayers. Purchases from South Pasadena vendors are strongly encouraged where competitive prices and quality exist. With all specifications and conditions equal except price, a preference will be given to in-city vendors equal to two percent of the quoted price when general fund monies are used for the acquisition. The rationale for local preference is that one percent of the sales tax on most acquisitions returns to the city general fund as revenue, effectively reducing the cost of acquisition.

(9)    Purchases Under Ten Thousand Dollars.

(a)    Purchase of supplies, equipment, non-professional services or services not involving a unique ability and not exceeding an estimated value of ten thousand dollars may be made by the department head in the open market, pursuant to the procedure prescribed in this ordinance; provided, however, all quotation may be dispensed with in an emergency, or where said goods and/or services can be obtained from only one source.

5.    Requisition Forms. Using departments shall submit standard purchase order requisition forms to the purchasing agent when requesting goods and services pursuant to this section.

The using department, with the concurrence of the purchasing agent, shall have authority to sell all supplies and equipment which cannot be used by any department, or which have become unsuitable for city use, or to exchange the same for or trade the same in on new supplies and equipment. City manager approval is needed for sale of supplies and/or equipment when the total estimated value exceeds ten thousand dollars. The purchasing agent shall also have the authority to make transfers between departments of any usable surplus supplies or equipment.

2.99-29A Purchase and sale of real property.

(a)    Prior to the purchase or sale of real property the city shall cause an appraisal of the property in question in order to establish a fair market value.

(b)    Any appraisal so prepared shall be prepared by a real estate appraiser whose sole business is to appraise real estate and by virtue of education and experience is qualified in real estate appraisal and is a member of any or all of the following:

1.    American Society of Appraisers;

2.    American Right-of-Way Association;

If an insufficient number of properties exist within the city limits the appraiser may use property outside of the city limits when in his opinion it is necessary to establish a fair market value.

(d)    The term “fair market value” means the highest price estimated in terms of money which a property will bring if exposed for sale in the open market allowing a reasonable time to find a purchaser who buys with the knowledge of all the uses it is adapted and for which it is capable of being used.

In the event the city is selling property, it will be sold to the highest bidder utilizing the appraised price as a base. Where appraisals between the buyer and seller differ, the city council has the option to negotiate a price which is most advantageous to the city. (Ord. No. 1877, §§ 2—6; Ord. No. 2187, § 9, 2009.)

Preference shall be given to the bid with the highest monetary purchase price which most closely accomplishes the end use goals. As to all cases, the city and the purchaser shall enter into a purchase agreement approved by the city council.

4.    Unless otherwise specified in the notice to bidders, sale of surplus property shall be completed in an escrow of the city’s choice. All successful bids shall be incorporated into a sale and purchase agreement to be approved by the city council.

5.    The successful bidder shall close escrow as specified in the purchase agreement.

7.    No city official, officer or employee shall bid or be financially interested in any bid for surplus real property sold in accordance with these procedures.

ARTICLE II. MOBILE SOURCE AIR POLLUTION REDUCTION PROGRAM


4.14 Findings.

The city of South Pasadena finds and declares that:

(1)    The city is committed to improving the public health, safety and welfare, including air quality.

(2)    Mobile sources are a major contributor to air pollution in the South Coast Air Basin.

(3)    Air quality goals for the region established by state law cannot be met without reducing air pollution from mobile sources.

(4)    The South Coast Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP) calls upon cities and counties to reduce emissions from motor vehicles consistent with the requirements of the California Clean Air Act of 1988 by developing and implementing mobile source pollution reduction programs.

(5)    To the extent that such programs place demands upon the city’s funds, those programs should be financed by shifting the responsibility for financing from the general fund to the motor vehicles creating the demand, to the greatest extent possible.

(6)    Section 44223, added to the Health and Safety Code by action of the California Legislature on September 30, 1990, (Chapter 90-1705), authorizes the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) to impose an additional motor vehicle registration fee of two dollars, commencing on April 1, 1991, increasing to four dollars commencing on April 1, 1992, to finance the implementation of transportation measures embodied in the AQMP and provisions of the California Clean Air Act.

(7)    Forty cents of every dollar collected under Section 44223 of the Health and Safety Code shall be distributed to cities and counties located in the South Coast Air Quality Management District that comply with Section 4243 of the Code, based on the jurisdictions’ prorated share of population as defined by the State Department of Finance.

(8)    The city is located within the South Coast Air Quality Management District and is eligible to receive a portion of revenues from the motor vehicle registration fees upon adoption of the ordinance codified in this article.

(9)    The city, after careful consideration, finds and declares that the imposition of the motor vehicle registration fee by the SCAQMD to finance mobile source air pollution reduction programs, is in the best interest of the general welfare of the city and its residents.

ARTICLE I. IN GENERAL


5.1 Definition of “lot or parcel of land” and “improved lot.”

Unless it is apparent from the context that another meaning is intended, the following words or terms, when used in this article, shall have the meaning attached to them by this section:

“Improved lot” means any lot or parcel of land on which is located a dwelling house, occupied or unoccupied.

“Lot or parcel of land” means any area of land in the city under one ownership as shown on the last assessor’s roll of the county or the records of the city, whichever is the most recent, or any area of land under legal control of any person. (Ord. No. 875, § 1.)


5.2 Fowl and rabbits—Maximum number of pigeons or doves permitted to be kept; application and granting of variance by planning commission.

It is declared to be a nuisance and it is unlawful for any person to keep or maintain within the city more than twelve pigeons or doves; provided, however, when unnecessary hardships occur by reason of the strict enforcement of this limitation, the planning commission upon written application of any owner of pigeons or doves may annually grant a permit to keep more than twelve under such conditions as may be appropriate; and provided, further, that homing and racing pigeons shall be kept and liberated only as set forth in section 5.4-2. (Ord. No. 1301, § 1; Ord. No. 1435, § 1; Ord. No. 1983, § 18.)


5.3 Same—Conditions prerequisite to granting of variance; term, renewal, suspension or revocation of variance.

Before the variance may be granted, it shall be shown that special circumstances exist which do not apply generally to other persons or property in the city. It must also be shown that the granting of the variance will not result in material damage or prejudice to other persons or property in the vicinity of the owner’s premises nor detrimental to the public safety or welfare. A filing fee of five dollars shall be paid with each annual application for a variance.

Any variance issued pursuant hereto shall be good only for the remainder of the year in which it is issued and shall come up for renewal during January of each year thereafter. It may be revoked or suspended by the planning commission, as in its discretion may seem just and meet, for any violation of the conditions of the variance or of any laws or ordinances of the city. Such revocation or suspension shall be made only upon a hearing granted to the holder of the variance so revoked and suspended, which hearing shall be held before the planning commission after five days’ notice mailed to such variance holder. Said notice shall state the grounds of complaint against the variance holder and shall set the time and place where such hearing will be held. (Ord. No. 1301, § 1; Ord. No. 1983, § 18.)


5.4 Same—Restrictions on running at large and keeping near adjoining property and dwellings.

It is hereby declared to be a nuisance, and it shall be unlawful for any person to suffer or permit any chicks, chickens, geese, ducks, turkeys, pigeons, doves, squabs, or similar fowl, or any hare or hares or rabbit or rabbits owned or controlled by such person to run at large or to go upon the premises of any other person in the city, or to keep or maintain the same within fifteen feet of the property line of any adjacent improved lot or parcel of land or within fifty feet of any dwelling other than that occupied by such person.

It is hereby declared to be a nuisance and it shall be unlawful for any person to keep, maintain or liberate in the city homing or racing pigeons except as follows:

(2)    That no such permit shall be issued to liberate in excess of fifty such pigeons.

(3)    That no such permit shall be issued to keep or liberate such pigeons within fifty feet of any dwelling unit (other than the dwelling of the permittee).

(4)    That no such permit shall be issued to keep such pigeons for market or commercial purpose.

(5)    That no such permit shall be issued to keep or liberate such pigeons: (a) Under circumstances constituting a nuisance to neighboring properties; or (b) in violation of the zoning code or other ordinance of this city.

(b)    Every application for a permit to keep and liberate for exercise and racing of such carrier, homing and racing pigeons shall be made upon forms to be furnished for that purpose by the city council, signed by the applicant and filed with the city council. No such application shall be received for filing by the city council unless accompanied by a filing fee of twenty-five dollars.

(c)    Such permit shall be issued by the city council only upon compliance by applicant with the following conditions:

(1)    The lofts or pigeon houses for the keeping of such racing and homing pigeons shall be constructed in such manner as to preclude the attraction of rodents.

(2)    All feed for such pigeons shall be stored in containers which offer protection against rodents.

(3)    All pigeon droppings and food scraps shall be removed from the premises at least once a week and disposed of in a sanitary manner.

(4)    Lofts or pigeon houses shall be maintained in a sanitary condition. (Compliance with the health regulations promulgated by the state racing pigeon organization is declared to be a reasonable and prima facie standard for sanitary conditions);

(d)    Each permit issued pursuant to the provisions of this section shall be valid for a period of one year from and after the date of issuance and shall be renewable upon the payment to the city council of a renewal fee in the sum of ten dollars annually.

(e)    It shall be the duty of each such permittee, to scrape or clean such pigeon lofts and houses, wherein such carrier, racing and homing pigeons are kept at least three times each week, and the applicant shall permit the department of health to inspect each such loft and pigeon house at least once each month.

This Code shall not be construed to hold the City or any officer, employee or agent thereof responsible for any damage to persons or property by reason of any inspection authorized herein or by reason of the issuance or nonissuance of any permit authorized herein, and/or for any action or omission in connection with the application and/or enforcement of this Code. By adopting the provisions of this Code, the City does not intend to impose on itself, its employees or agents, any mandatory duties of care toward persons and property within its jurisdiction so as to provide a basis of civil liability for damages.

This section is declaratory of existing law and is not to be construed as suggesting that such was not the purpose and intent of previous Code adoptions.

101.3 Scope and Applicability.

102—UNSAFE BUILDINGS

102.1 Definition. All buildings or structures which are structurally unsound or not provided with adequate egress, or which constitute a fire hazard, or are otherwise dangerous to human life, or which in relation to existing use constitute a hazard to safety or health, or public welfare, by reason of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, obsolescence, fire hazard, disaster damage, lacking an approved water supply, hazardous electrical, unsafe gas piping or appliances or abandonment as specified in this Code or any other effective ordinance, are, for the purpose of this Chapter, unsafe buildings. Whenever the Building Official determines by inspection that a building or structure, whether structurally damaged or not, is dangerous to human life by reason of being located in an area which is unsafe due to hazard from landslide, settlement, or slippage or any other cause, such building shall, for the purpose of this Chapter, be considered an unsafe building.

No person shall own, use, occupy or maintain any unsafe building.

All unsafe buildings are hereby declared to be public nuisances. In addition to instituting any appropriate action to prevent, restrain or correct a violation of this section, the Building Official may abate an unsafe condition or order that the unsafe condition be secured, repaired, rehabilitated, demolished or removed as deemed necessary by the Building Official in accordance with the procedure specified in this Code.

As used in this Chapter “party concerned” means the person, if any, in real or apparent charge and control of the premises involved, the record owner, the holder of any mortgage, trust deed or other lien or encumbrance of record, the owner or holder of any lease of record, the record holder of any other estate or interest in or to the building or structure or the land upon which it is located.

102.2 Notice of Unsafe Building. The Building Official shall examine or cause to be examined every building or structure or portion thereof reported as dangerous or damaged and, if, in the Building Official’s opinion, such is found to be an unsafe building as defined in this Chapter, the Building Official shall give to the party concerned written notice stating the defects thereof. This notice may require the owner or person in charge of the building or premises to:

1.    Immediately remove, backfill, shore up or secure such unsafe condition, and/or

2.    Within 48 hours, apply for required permit(s) and commence either the required repairs or improvements or demolition and removal of the building or structure or portions thereof.

All such work shall be completed within 90 days from date of notice, unless otherwise stipulated by the Building Official. If necessary, such notice shall also require the building, structure, or portion thereof to be vacated forthwith and not reoccupied until the required repairs and improvements are completed, inspected and approved by the Building Official.

Proper service of such notice shall be by personal service or by registered or certified mail upon every party concerned. In the event the Building Official, after reasonable effort, is unable to serve the notice as specified above, proper service shall be by posting on the structure a copy of the notice.

The designated period within which the owner or person in charge is required to comply with such notice shall begin as of the date the owner or person in charge receives such notice by personal service or registered or certified mail. If such notice is by posting, the designated period shall begin ten days following the date of posting.

The failure of any owner or other person to receive such notice shall not affect in any manner the validity of any proceedings taken hereunder.

A person notified to vacate an unsafe building by the Building Official shall vacate within the time specified in the order.

The Building Official may record a notice of violation with the County Recorder’s Office that the building or structure described has been inspected and found to be an unsafe building, as defined in this Chapter, and that the owner thereof has been so notified. After all required work has been completed, upon request and payment of required fee(s) the Building Official shall record a notice rescinding the prior notice of violation with the County Recorder’s Office.

102.3 Posting of Signs. The Building Official shall cause to be posted on buildings required to be vacated or remain unoccupied a notice to read substantially as follows: “Restricted Use” or “Unsafe—Do Not Enter or Occupy” as described in Section 102.6. All placards shall read “Planning and Building Department, City of South Pasadena.”

Such notice shall be posted at the main entrance and shall be visible to persons approaching the building or structure from a street. Such notice shall remain posted until the required repairs, demolition or removal are completed. Such notice shall not be removed without written permission of the Building Official and no person shall enter the building except for the purpose of making the required repairs or of demolishing the building.

102.4 Unsafe Buildings: Hearing.

102.4.1 Right of hearing. The party concerned or the Building Official may request a hearing regarding the unsafe condition of the building or structure. The request by the interested party shall be made in writing to the Building Official within 30 days of the date of the notice of the unsafe condition. A hearing shall be requested by the Building Official prior to demolition or repair of an unsafe building by the City except when such demolition or repair is done under the emergency procedure set forth in this Chapter.

All interested parties who desire to be heard may appear before the Building Board of Appeals to show cause why the building or structure should not be ordered repaired, vacated and repaired, or demolished.

102.4.2 Notice of hearing. Not less than ten days prior to the hearing, the Building Official shall serve or cause to be served either in the manner required by law for the service of summons or by first class mail, postage prepaid, a copy of the notice of hearing upon every party concerned.

102.4.3 Form and contents of notice. The notice of hearing shall state:

1.    The street address and a legal description sufficient for identification of the premises upon which the building or structure is located.

2.    The conditions because of which the Building Official believed that the building or structure is an unsafe building.

3.    The date, hour and place of the hearing.

102.4.4 Posting of notice. The Building Official shall post one copy of the notice of hearing in a conspicuous place on the unsafe building involved, not less than ten days prior to the hearing.

The Building Board of Appeals shall make written findings of fact as to whether or not the building or structure is an unsafe building as defined in this Chapter.

When determined by the Building Official, the Building Rehabilitation Appeals Board shall hold the hearing in lieu of the Building Board of Appeals.

102.4.6 Order. If the Building Board of Appeals finds that the building or structure is an unsafe building, it shall make an order based on its finding that:

1.    The building or structure is an unsafe building and directing that repairs be made and specifying such repairs, or

2.    The building or structure is an unsafe building and directing that it be vacated and that specified repairs be made, or

3.    The building or structure is an unsafe building and directing that it shall be vacated and demolished.

The order shall state the time within which the work required must be commenced, which shall not be less than 10 nor later than 30 days after the service of the order. The order shall state a reasonable time within which the work shall be completed. The Building Board of Appeals for good cause may extend the time for completion in writing.

The order shall be served upon the same parties and in the same manner as required by Section 102.4.2 for the notice of hearing. It shall also be conspicuously posted on or about the building or structure.

102.5 Unsafe Buildings: Demolition or Repair.

102.5.1 Work by City. If the repairs or demolition necessary to remove the unsafe condition as set forth in the Notice of Unsafe Building is not made within the designated period and a hearing has not been requested by any party concerned, the Building Official shall request that a hearing be held regarding the unsafe condition. If the finding by the Building Board of Appeals is not complied with within the period designated by the Board, the Building Official may then secure or demolish such portions of the structure, or may cause such work to be done, to the extent necessary to eliminate the hazard determined to exist by the Building Board of Appeals.

102.5.2 Emergency procedure. Whenever any portion of a structure constitutes an immediate hazard to life or property, and in the opinion of the Building Official, the conditions are such that repairs, or demolition must be undertaken within less than the designated period, the Building Official may take necessary action, such as performing alterations, repairs, and/or demolition of the structures, to protect life or property, or both, after giving such notice to the parties concerned as the circumstances will permit or without any notice whatever when, in the Building Official’s opinion, immediate action is necessary.

102.5.3 Costs. The costs incurred by actions taken pursuant to Sections 102.5.1 and 102.5.2 including the entire cost of the services rendered by the County, shall be a special assessment against the property upon which the structure stood. The Building Official shall notify, in writing, all parties concerned of the amount of such assessment resulting from such work. Within five days of the receipt of such notice, any such party concerned may file with the Building Official a written request for a hearing on the correctness or reasonableness, or both, of such assessment. Any party concerned who did not receive a notice pursuant to Section 102.2 and who has not had a hearing on the necessity of the demolition or repairs in such request for hearing also may ask that such necessity be reviewed. The Building Board of Appeals thereupon shall set the matter for hearing; give such party concerned notice thereof as provided in Section 102.4.2; hold such hearing and determine the reasonableness or correctness of the assessment, or both; and if requested, determine the necessity of the demolition or repairs. The Building Board of Appeals, in writing, shall notify such party concerned of its decision. If the total assessment determined as provided for in this section is not paid in full within 10 days after receipt of such notice from the Building Official or the Building Board of Appeals, as the case may be, the Building Official shall record in the office of the Department of Registrar-Recorder a statement of the total balance still due and a legal description of the property. From the date of such recording, such balance due shall be a special assessment against the parcel.

The assessment shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary City taxes are collected and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary City taxes. All the laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of City taxes shall be applicable to such special assessment.

102.5.4 Interference Prohibited. A person shall not obstruct, impede, or interfere with the Building Official or any representative of the Building Official, or with any person who owns or holds any estate or interest in any unsafe building which has been ordered by the Building Board of Appeals to be repaired, vacated and repaired, or vacated and demolished or removed, whenever the Building Official or such owner is engaged in repairing, vacating and repairing, or demolishing any such unsafe building pursuant to this Chapter, or is performing any necessary act preliminary to or incidental to such work, or authorized or directed pursuant hereto.

102.5.5 Prosecution. In case the owner shall fail, neglect or refuse to comply with the notice to repair, rehabilitate, or to demolish and remove said building or structure or portion thereof, the Building Official shall cause the owner of the building to be prosecuted as a violator of this Code.

102.6 Posting of signs for damage assessment. The building official shall cause placard(s) to be posted on buildings upon completion of a safety assessment.

All placards shall read “Planning and Building Department, City of South Pasadena.” The placards shall also indicate the condition of the structure for continued occupancy, and shall read substantially as follows:

1.    “INSPECTED—Lawful Occupancy Permitted” (green placard) shall be posted on any building or structure wherein no apparent structural hazard has been found. This placard is not intended to mean that there is no damage to the building or structure.

2.    “RESTRICTED USE” (yellow placard) shall be posted on each building or structure that has been damaged wherein the damage has resulted in some form of restriction to the continued occupancy. This placard will note in general terms the type of damage encountered and will clearly and concisely note the restrictions on continued occupancy.

3.    “UNSAFE—Do Not Enter or Occupy” (red placard) shall be posted on each building or structure that has been damaged such that the continued occupancy poses a threat to life safety. Buildings or structures posted with this placard shall not be entered under any circumstance except as authorized in writing by the Building Official, or his or her authorized representative. This placard is not to be used or considered as a demolition order. This placard will note in general terms the type of damage encountered.

Such notice shall be posted at the main entrance(s) and shall be visible to persons approaching the building or structure from a street. Such notice shall remain posted until the required repairs, demolition or removal are completed. Such notice shall not be removed without written permission of the Building Official and no person shall enter the building except for the purpose of making the required repairs or of demolishing the building.

SECTION 106 BUILDING PLAN REQUIREMENTS

106.1 General. When required by the building official to verify compliance with any Code, relevant laws, ordinances, rules and regulations, plans, and when deemed necessary by the building official, calculations, geological or engineering reports and other required data shall be submitted for plan review. The building official may require plans and calculations to be prepared by an engineer or architect licensed or registered by the State to practice as such. Only after the plans have been approved may the applicant apply for a building permit for such work. The building official may also require such plans be reviewed by other departments and/or divisions of the City to verify compliance with the laws and ordinances under their jurisdiction.

When authorized by the building official, complete plans and calculations need not be submitted for the following work when information sufficient to clearly define the nature and scope of the work are submitted for review:

1.    One-story buildings of conventional light-frame construction with a gross floor area not exceeding 600 square feet;

2.    Work deemed by the building official as minor, small and/or unimportant work.

Where deemed necessary by the building official, submittals shall include special inspection requirements as defined in Section 117.5 and structural observation requirements as defined in Section 117.6.

Plans, calculations, reports or documents for work regulated by any Code, relevant laws, ordinances, rules and regulations shall bear the seal, signature and number of a civil engineer, structural engineer, mechanical engineer, electrical engineer, soils engineer or architect registered or certified to practice in the State of California when required by the California Business and Professions Code. A seal and number shall not be required for work authorized by the said article to be performed by a person not registered or certified as an engineer or architect.

For buildings exceeding 160 feet (48.77 m) in height, the structural calculations and each sheet of structural plans shall be prepared under the supervision of and shall bear the signature or approved stamp of a person authorized by the State of California to use the title structural engineer. In addition, all architectural sheets shall bear the signature or approved stamp of an architect licensed by the State of California.

All structures and devices installed for the protection of pedestrians, regardless of location, are subject to the plan review requirements of this section.

For additional provisions applicable to grading, see Appendix J.

106.2 Architect or Engineer of Record. When it is required that documents be prepared by an architect or engineer, the building official may require the owner to designate on the permit application an architect or engineer who shall act as the architect or engineer of record. If the circumstances require, the owner may designate a substitute architect or engineer of record who shall perform all of the duties required of the original architect or engineer of record. The building official shall be notified in writing by the owner if the architect or engineer of record is changed or is unable to continue to perform the duties.

The architect or engineer of record shall be responsible for reviewing and coordinating all submittal documents prepared by others, including deferred submittal items, for compatibility with the design of the building.

106.3 Information Required on Building Plans. Plans shall be drawn to scale upon substantial paper or other material suitable to the building official shall be of sufficient clarity to indicate the nature and scope of the work proposed, and shall show in detail that the proposed construction will conform to the provisions of any Code and all relevant laws, ordinances, rules and regulations.

The first sheet of each set of plans shall give the street address of the proposed work and the name, address and telephone number of the owner(s) and all persons who were involved in the design and preparation of the plans.

Plans shall include a plot plan showing the location of the proposed building and of every existing building on the premises. In lieu of specific details, the building official may approve references on the plans to a specific section or part of any Code, relevant laws, ordinances, rules and/or regulations.

Computations, stress diagrams and other data sufficient to show the correctness of the plans shall be submitted when required by the Building Official.

When deemed necessary by the building official, the first sheet of each set of plans shall indicate the following information:

1.    The building Type of Construction;

2.    Whether fire sprinklers are installed in all or any portion of the building;

3.    Existing building areas and areas of all additions;

4.    The number of stories of the building;

5.    The use of all new and existing rooms and/or areas;

6.    The Occupancy Classifications of each occupancy;

7.    The Code in effect on the date of plan check submittal.

The plans shall show all mitigation measures required under the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit issued to the County of Los Angeles. For the application of NPDES permit requirements as they apply to grading plans and permits, see Appendix J of this code.

106.4 Drainage Review Requirement. Where proposed construction will affect site drainage, existing and proposed drainage patterns shall be shown on the plot plan.

A site inspection may be required prior to plan check of building plans for lots or parcels in areas having slopes of five horizontal to one vertical (5:1) or steeper when the building official finds that a visual inspection of the site is necessary to establish drainage requirements for the protection of property, existing buildings or the proposed construction. The fee for such inspection shall be as set forth by ordinance or resolution. Such a preinspection shall not be required for a building pad graded under the provisions of Appendix J.

For additional provisions applicable to grading, see Appendix J.

106.5 Deferred submittals. For the purposes of this section, deferred submittals are defined as those portions of the design that are not submitted at the time of the application and that are to be submitted to the building official within a specified period.

Deferral of any submittal items shall have prior approval of the building official. The architect or engineer of record shall list the deferred submittals on the plans and shall submit the deferred submittal documents for review by the building official.

Submittal documents for deferred submittal items shall be submitted to the architect or engineer of record who shall review them and forward them to the building official with a notation indicating that the deferred submittal documents have been reviewed and that they have been found to be in general conformance with the design of the building. The deferred submittal items shall not be installed until their design and submittal documents have been approved by the building official.

106.6 Standard Plans. The building official may approve a set of plans for a building or structure as a “standard plan,” provided that the applicant has made proper application and submitted complete sets of plans as required by this section.

Plans shall reflect laws and ordinances in effect at the time a permit is issued except as provided in this section. Nothing in this section shall prohibit modifying the permit set of plans to reflect changes in laws and ordinances that have become effective since the approval of the standard plan. The standard plans shall become null and void where the work required by such changes exceeds five percent of the value of the building or structure.

Standard plans shall be valid for a period of one year from the date of approval. This period may be extended by the building official when there is evidence that the plans may be used again and the plans show compliance with all Codes, relevant laws, ordinances, rules and regulations.

106.7 Expiration of Plan Check Applications. Plan check applications for which no permit is issued within one year following the date of application shall expire by limitation and become null and void. Plans and calculations previously submitted may thereafter be returned to the applicant or destroyed by the building official.

When requested in writing by the applicant prior to the effective date of a more current code, the building official may grant extension(s) not exceeding 1 year provided:

1.    Circumstances beyond the control of the applicant have prevented action from being taken;

2.    An extension fee is paid as determined by the Building Official, not to exceed 25 percent of the plan check fee.

Once an application and any extension thereof has expired, the applicant shall resubmit plans and calculations and pay a new application fee.

106.8 Retention of Plans. One set of approved plans, calculations and reports shall be retained by the building official. Except as required by Section 19850 of the Health and Safety Code, the building official shall retain such set of the approved plans, calculations and reports for a period of not less than 90 days from date of completion of the work covered therein.

The approval of the plans shall not be held to permit or to be an approval of any violation of any Federal, State, County or City laws or ordinances. The issuance of a permit shall not be deemed to certify that the site of the described work is safe.

One set of approved plans and reports shall be returned to the applicant to be kept on such building or work site at all times while the authorized work is in progress.

The building official may issue a permit for the construction of part of a building or structure before the entire plans and calculations for the whole building or structure have been submitted or approved, provided adequate information and detailed statements have been filed complying with all pertinent requirements of all Codes. The holder of such permit shall proceed at his or her own risk without assurance that the permit for the entire building or structure will be granted.

107.5 Permit Validity. The issuance or granting of a permit or approval of plans and calculations shall not be construed to be a permit for, or an approval of, any violation of any of the provisions of any Code, relevant laws, ordinances, rules and regulations. No permit presuming to give authority to violate or cancel the provisions of any Code, relevant laws, ordinances, rules and regulations shall be valid, except insofar as the work or use which it authorizes is lawful.

The issuance of a permit based on plans and calculations shall not prevent the building official from thereafter requiring the correction of errors in said plans and calculations or from preventing building operations being carried on thereunder when in violation of any Code, relevant laws, ordinances, rules and regulations.

107.6 Expiration of Permit. Every permit issued by the building official under the provisions of any Code having jurisdiction over any portion of the work shall expire automatically by limitation and become null and void one year after the date of the last required building inspection approval by the building official, or if work authorized by such permit is not commenced within one year from the issuance date of such permit. Before such work can be commenced or recommenced, a new permit shall be first obtained.

For the purposes of this paragraph, “required building inspection” shall mean those inspections listed in Section 117.4.2, and those inspections specifically identified on the Job Record issued with the building permit. No partial inspection shall meet the definition of “required building inspection.”

Supplementary permits for electrical, grading, mechanical, plumbing, and reroof shall not expire so long as the associated building permit remains active. No electrical, grading, mechanical, plumbing or reroof inspection shall satisfy the requirement to have a required building inspection as defined in this Section.

Where a new building permit is issued to complete work previously started under an expired permit, a permit fee shall be collected in the amount determined by the Building Official, not to exceed 25 percent of the permit fee provided:

1.    A written request to renew the permit is received by the Building Division prior to the effective date of a more current code;

2.    that the duration of time from the date of expiration has not exceeded one year; and

3.    that no changes have been made or will be made in the original plans and calculations for such work.

Applicable plan review and permit fees, in addition to issuance fees, for the remaining work shall be collected for all permits that do not meet the preceding criteria.

All work to be performed under the new permit must be done in accordance with the Building Code in effect on the date of issuance of the new permit.

107.7 Permit Suspension or Revocation. The building official may, in writing, suspend or revoke a permit issued under the provisions of any Code having jurisdiction over any portion of the work, relevant laws, ordinances, rules and regulations whenever the permit was issued in error or on the basis of incorrect information supplied, or in violation of any other laws, ordinances or regulations or any of the provisions of any Code.

The building official may also, in writing, withhold inspections, suspend or revoke a permit where work is being done in violation of any Code, where work is being done in violation of the approved plans, where work is being concealed without approval from the building official, or where work is not in accordance with the direction of the building official.

107.8 Cancellation of Permit by Applicant. If no portion of the work or construction covered by a permit issued by the building official under the provisions of any Code, relevant laws, ordinances, rules and regulations has been commenced, the person to whom such permit has been issued may deliver such permit to the building official with a request that such permit be cancelled. Only the person to whom such permit was issued may request cancellation of the permit. The building official shall thereupon stamp or write on the face of such permit the words, “Cancelled at the request of the applicant.” Thereupon such permit shall be null and void and of no effect. All fees except for issuance fees shall be returned to the applicant.

107.9 Transfer of Permit by Applicant.

107.9.1 No Inspection Performed. When requested in writing by the person to whom the permit was issued, a permit may be transferred from the person to whom the permit was issued to a new individual. Fee credit shall be given where deemed appropriate by the building official and new fees shall be paid as required by ordinance or resolution.

107.9.2 One or More Inspection Performed. Permits may be transferred to any individual upon completion of a new application. Fee credit shall be given where deemed appropriate by the building official and new fees shall be paid as required by ordinance or resolution.

SECTION 109 USE AND OCCUPANCY

109.1 General. No building, structure or premises, or portion thereof, shall be used or occupied, and no change in the existing occupancy classification of a building, structure or premises, or portion thereof, shall be made until the building official has approved the building, structure or premises or portion thereof for such use or occupancy and until all permits have been approved or a temporary certificate of completed construction has been issued.

Upon final of a building permit and at the request of the applicant, a certificate of completed construction shall be issued by the building official for any structure that is ready to occupy.

Approval of a building, structure or premises, or portion thereof, for use or occupancy (including, but not limited to, final inspection approval and/or issuance of a certificate of completed construction or issuance of a temporary certificate of completed construction) shall not be construed as approval of a violation of the provisions of any Code, relevant laws, ordinances, rules and/or regulations. Approvals presuming to give authority to violate or cancel the provisions of any Code, relevant laws, ordinances, rules and/or regulations are not valid.

The building official may, in writing, suspend or revoke any such approvals or certificates whenever the building official determines that the approval or certificate was issued in error, or on the basis of incorrect information supplied, or when it is determined that the building, structure or premises, or portion thereof, is in violation of any provision of any Code, relevant laws, ordinances, rules and/or regulations. Any certificate of completed construction or temporary certificate of completed construction so issued shall be surrendered upon request of the building official.

109.2 Unpermitted Structures. No person shall own, use, occupy or maintain any unpermitted structure.

109.3 Change in Use. Changes in the character or use of a building shall not be made except as specified in Existing Building Code.

109.4 Issuance of a Certificate of Completed Construction. When the building, structure or premises, or portion thereof, has passed final inspection, and when the building, structure or premises complies with all Codes having jurisdiction over any portion of the work, relevant laws, ordinances, rules and regulations, and the required fees have been paid, the building official, upon request of the applicant, shall issue a certificate of completed construction, which shall contain the following:

1.    The building permit number.

2.    The address of the building or structure.

3.    A description of that portion of the building for which the certificate is issued.

4.    A statement that the described portion of the building was inspected and found to comply with the requirements of all Codes having jurisdiction over any portion of the work, relevant laws, ordinances, rules and regulations for the group and division of occupancy and the use for which the proposed occupancy is classified.

5.    The date the permit was approved.

6.    Any other information deemed necessary by the building official.

For additional provisions applicable to grading, see Appendix J.

109.5 Issuance of a Temporary Certificate of Completed Construction. If the building official finds that no substantial hazard will result from occupancy of any building or portion thereof before the same is completed, the building official may issue a temporary certificate of completed construction for the use of a portion or portions of a building, structure or premises, prior to the completion of the entire building, structure or premises, or portion thereof.

Such temporary certificate of completed construction shall be valid for a period of time to be specified by the building official. Upon request of the owner or permittee, the building official may, in writing, extend the temporary certificate of completed construction when it is determined that the circumstances so warrant. After the expiration of a temporary certificate of completed construction and any extension(s) thereof, the building, structure or premises, or portion thereof, shall not be used or occupied until the building official has approved the building for such use or occupancy.

109.6 Live Load Posted. In new construction, a durable sign that indicates the “live load” shall be required in commercial or industrial buildings where the floor or roof or portion thereof is or has been designed with a live load that exceeds 50 psf. The live load sign shall be posted on that part of each story or roof to which it applies, in a conspicuous place. The live load sign shall be posted as a condition precedent to the issuance of a certificate of completed construction certificate. It shall be unlawful to remove or deface any such sign.

109.7 Continued Use of Unpermitted and/or Noncomplying Conditions. When deemed appropriate by the building official, a certificate of continued use of unpermitted and/or noncomplying condition(s) may be issued. The certificate shall not be issued until documentation, satisfactory to the building official, has been provided indicating that 1) the unpermitted and/or noncomplying condition(s) were not created by the current owner, and 2) that the current owner had no knowledge that the conditions were unpermitted and/or noncomplying at the time of purchase.

An application shall be completed that states 1) that the continued use of the existing unpermitted construction and/or noncomplying conditions is permitted by the City only with the owner’s understanding that the City in no way assumes responsibility for the method of construction or the materials used; and 2) that it is further understood that this application for continued use is not to be construed as being equivalent in any way to a building permit.

An inspection shall then be made by the building official. Where necessary, permits shall be issued to correct any conditions deemed to pose a potential threat to life, limb or property. Once the inspection(s) have been made; all necessary permits have been obtained, inspected and approved; and all obvious potential threats to life, limb or property have been corrected, the building official may approve the application for unpermitted construction and or noncomplying condition(s). When approved by the building official, conditions deemed not to pose a potential threat to life, limb or property may be permitted to remain.

110—PROHIBITED USES OF BUILDING SITES

110.1 Flood Hazard.

Buildings are not permitted in an area determined by the Building Official to be subject to flood hazard by reason of inundation, overflow or erosion.

The placement of the building and other structures (including walls and fences) on the building site shall be such that water or mud flow will not be a hazard to the building or adjacent property. This prohibition shall not apply when provision is made to eliminate such hazard to the satisfaction of the Building Official by providing adequate drainage facilities by protective walls, suitable fill, raising the floor level of the building, a combination of these methods, or by other means. The Building Official, in the application of this Section for buildings, structures, and grading located in whole or in part in flood hazard areas, shall enforce, as a minimum, the current Federal Flood Plain Management Regulations defined in Title 44, Code of Federal Regulations, Section 60.3, and may require the applicant or property owner to provide the following information and/or comply with the following provisions:

1.    Delineation of flood hazard areas, floodway boundaries and flood zones, and the design flood elevation, as appropriate;

2.    The elevation of the proposed lowest floor, including basement, in flood hazard areas (A Zones), and the height of the proposed lowest floor, including basement, above the highest adjacent grade;

3.    The elevation of the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member in coastal high hazard areas (V Zone);

4.    If the design flood elevations are not included on the community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), then the applicant shall obtain and reasonably utilize any design flood elevation and floodway data available from other sources, as approved by the Building Official; and

5.    During construction, upon placement of the lowest floor, including basement, and prior to further vertical construction, the permittee shall provide to the Building Official documentation, prepared and sealed by a registered design professional, certifying the elevation of the lowest floor, including basement.

110.2 GEOTECHNICAL HAZARDS.

110.2.1. No building or grading permit shall be issued under the provisions of this section when the Building Official finds that property outside the site of the proposed work could be damaged by activation or acceleration of a geotechnically hazardous condition and such activation or acceleration could be attributed to the proposed work on, or change in use of, the site for which the permit is requested. For the purpose of this section, a geotechnically hazardous condition does not include surface displacement due to earthquake faults.

110.2.2. Except as provided in Section 110.2.3, work requiring a building or grading permit is not permitted in an area determined by the Building Official to be subject to hazard from landslide, settlement, or slippage.

110.2.3. Subject to the conditions of Subsection 110.2.1, permits may be issued in the following cases.

110.2.3.1. When the applicant has submitted an engineering geology and/or soils engineering report or reports complying with the provisions of Section 111 such that said reports show to the satisfaction of the Building Official that the hazard will be eliminated prior to the use or occupancy of the land or structures.

110.2.3.2. When the applicant has submitted an engineering geology and/or soils engineering report or reports that comply with the provisions of Section 111, and that demonstrate, to the satisfaction of the Building Official, that the site is safe for the intended use.

110.2.3.3. When the proposed work involves the alteration or minor repair of existing structures and the cost of such alteration or repair does not exceed 25 percent of the current valuation of the existing structure, such value to be based on assumed continuation of the established legal use. Before a permit may be issued pursuant to this section, the owner shall do all of the following:

1.    If required by the Building Official, submit an engineering geology and/or soils engineering report or reports that contain(s), at a minimum, a qualitative and/or conditional finding that the proposed work complies with the provisions of Section 110.2.1 of this Chapter.

2.    Record in the office of the Department of Registrar-Recorder, a statement that the owner is aware that the records of the Building Official indicate that the property is potentially subject to hazard from landslide, settlement, or slippage.

3.    Record in the office of the Department of Registrar-Recorder, an agreement relieving the City and all officers and employees thereof of any liability for any damage or loss which may result from issuance of such a permit. This agreement shall provide that it is binding on all successors in interest of the owner and shall continue in effect until the Building Official records in the office of the Department of Registrar-Recorder a statement that the Building Official has determined that such hazard from landslide, settlement or slippage no longer exists. The repair work shall consist of restoring the original construction. The Building Official may require that provisions be made in anticipation of future settlement. For the purposes of this Section 110.2.3.3, “alteration” does not include an addition or additions.

110.2.3.4. When the proposed work involves an addition or additions to an existing structure but is not a change in use or occupancy and such work does not increase the gross floor area of the structure by more than 25 percent of the area of the structure as it existed on July 6, 1968, and the Building Official determines that the proposed work will not impact a historically active landslide. Before a permit may be issued pursuant to this Section, the owner shall do all of the following:

Earthquake fault zone maps within the City prepared under Sections 2622 and 2623 of the California Resources Code which show traces of earthquake faults are hereby declared to be, on the date of official issue, a part of this Code, and may be referred to elsewhere in this Code. Earthquake fault zone maps revised under the above sections of the California Resources Code shall, on the date of their official issue, supersede previously issued maps which they replace.

SECTION 113—EARTHQUAKE FAULTS

113.1 General.

The construction of a building or structure near a known active earthquake fault and regulated by this Code shall be permitted as set forth in this Section.

113.2 Scope.

The provisions of this Section shall apply only to permits for buildings or structures on individual lots or parcels and are not intended to be supplementary to geologic investigations required to qualify divisions of land as set forth in the SPMC.

113.3 Definition.

For the purpose of this Section, a geologist shall be a professional geologist, licensed by the California State Board for Geologists and Geophysicists to practice geology in California.

113.4 Known Active Earthquake Faults.

For the purpose of this Section, known active earthquake faults are those faults which have had displacement within Holocene time (approximately the last 11,000 years) as defined in the most current issue of Special Publication 42 of the California Geological Survey.

113.5 Construction Limitations.

No building or structure shall be constructed over or upon the trace of a known active earthquake fault which is shown on maps maintained by the Building Official. These maps include, but are not limited to, earthquake fault zone maps prepared under Sections 2622 and 2623 of the California Public Resources Code.

The absence of a known active earthquake fault trace at the proposed building location shall be determined by a professional geologist licensed in the State of California in the following cases:

1.    When the proposed building is within (50) feet (15.24 m) of that line designated by the Building Official as the assumed location of a known active earthquake fault on the aforementioned maps.

2.    When the proposed building is within 50 feet (15.24 m) of the most probable ground location of the trace of a known active earthquake fault shown on the aforementioned maps.

In these cases, the Building Official may require the excavation of a trench, for the purpose of determining the existence of an active earthquake fault. Such a trench will be required if a lack of distinguishable fault features in the vicinity prevents the Building Official from determining by a site examination, review of available aerial photographs, or by other means that the fault trace does not underlie the proposed building. The trench shall be approximately perpendicular to the most probable direction of the fault trace, at least 1-1/2 feet (0.15 m) wide, and at least five feet in depth measured from natural grade, or to a depth satisfactory to the Building Official.

The trench must be accessible for mapping and inspection by the Building Official, when requested, and meet the requirements of Title 8 of the California Code of Regulations, Construction Safety Orders. The trench need not extend further than the full width of the proposed structure plus 5 feet (1.52 m) beyond the traversed exterior walls. A known active earthquake fault shall be presumed nonexistent if an exposure is not found by the professional geologist in the walls or floor of the trench.

The Building Official may require a more extensive investigation by a professional geologist as evidence to the absence of a known active earthquake fault prior to the issuance of a permit for Groups A, E, I, H and R, Division 1 Occupancies and B, F, M and S Occupancies over one story in height.

The results of the investigation, conclusions and recommendations shall be presented in a geology report prepared by a professional geologist as defined by Section 113.3. The report shall comply with the guidelines presented in Note 49 prepared by the California Department of Conservation, Geological Survey.

This article encourages the use of solar energy systems by removing unreasonable barriers, minimizing costs to property owners and the city of South Pasadena (city), and expanding the ability of property owners to install small residential rooftop solar energy systems. This article allows the city to achieve these goals while protecting the public health and safety. (Ord. No. 2285, § 1, 2015.)


9.21 Applicability.

(a)    This article applies to the permitting of all small residential rooftop solar energy systems in the city.

(b)    Small residential rooftop solar energy systems legally established or permitted prior to the effective date of this article are not subject to the requirements of this chapter unless physical modifications or alterations are undertaken that materially change the size, type, or components of the small rooftop energy system in such a way as to require new permitting. Routine operation and maintenance shall not require a permit. (Ord. No. 2285, § 1, 2015.)


9.22 Definitions.

The following words and phrases as used in this article are defined as follows:

(a)    “Small residential rooftop solar energy system” means all of the following:

For purposes of this article the term “main building” shall mean a building in which is conducted the principal use of the lot or building site on which it is located.

For purposes of this article the term “commercial building” shall mean a building in which is conducted a commercial use, excluding home occupational uses. (Ord. No. 1668.)

9.47 Waiver, modification or delay.

It is the intention that all the utility facilities of developments described in Section 9.45 be placed underground. If it is determined that practical difficulties, or unreasonable hardships inconsistent with the purpose of this chapter and unique to a particular parcel of property would result from the literal application of this section, the zoning board may waive, modify or delay the application of any undergrounding requirement imposed pursuant to this section upon written application of any affected property owner. The zoning board shall notify the applicant of their decision in writing by mail. If the zoning board determines to delay the installation of required underground utilities, they may require a recorded agreement guaranteeing the future performance of the work together with adequate performance security enforceable by the city in the form of a cash deposit, bond, letter of credit, or other instrument satisfactory to the city attorney. (Ord. No. 1668.)


9.48 Right of appeal.

Any person dissatisfied by any decision of the planning commission board may file an appeal with the city council within fifteen days after the decision of the zoning board is deposited in the mail.

SECTION 101—TITLE, PURPOSE, INTENT AND SCOPE

101.1 Title. Sections 9.1, 9.1.1 and 9.1.2 of Article 1 of Chapter 9 of the SPMC shall collectively be known as the Building Code of the City of South Pasadena, may be cited as such, and will be referred to herein as “these Building Regulations” or “these Building Standards” or “this Building Code.”

101.2 Purpose and Intent. The purpose of this Code is to establish the minimum requirements to safeguard the public health, safety and general welfare through structural strength, means of egress facilities, stability, sanitation, adequate light and ventilation, energy conservation, and safety to life and property from fire and other hazards attributed to the built environment and to provide safety to firefighters and emergency responders during emergency operations. Consistent with this purpose, the provisions of this Code are intended and always have been intended to confer a benefit on the community as a whole and are not intended to establish a duty of care toward any particular person.

This Code shall not be construed to hold the City or any officer, employee or agent thereof responsible for any damage to persons or property by reason of any inspection authorized herein or by reason of the issuance or nonissuance of any permit authorized herein, and/or for any action or omission in connection with the application and/or enforcement of this Code. By adopting the provisions of this Code, the City does not intend to impose on itself, its employees or agents, any mandatory duties of care toward persons and property within its jurisdiction so as to provide a basis of civil liability for damages.

This section is declaratory of existing law and is not to be construed as suggesting that such was not the purpose and intent of previous Code adoptions.

101.3 Scope and Applicability. The provisions of this Chapter shall apply to the erection, construction, enlargement, alteration, installation, reconstruction, repair, movement, improvement, connection, conversion, demolition, use and occupancy of any building, structure or premises, or portion thereof, and grading within the City.

The provisions of this Chapter shall not apply to work located primarily in a public right-of-way other than pedestrian protection structures within the jurisdiction of the Building Code; public utility towers and poles; equipment not within the scope of this Chapter; hydraulic flood control structures; work exempted by Section 107.2 of this Chapter; or minor work of negligible hazard to life specifically exempted by the building official.

Additions, alterations, repairs and changes of use or occupancy in all buildings and structures shall comply with the provisions for new buildings and structures except as otherwise provided in Section 109 of this Code and the Existing Building Code as amended and adopted by the City.

Detached one-and two-family dwellings and multiple single-family dwellings (townhouses) not more than three stories above grade plane in height with a separate means of egress and their accessory structures shall comply with the Residential Code as amended and adopted by the City.

Where, in any specific case, different sections of this Code specify different materials, methods of construction or other requirements, the most restrictive shall govern.

The codes and standards referenced in this Code shall be considered part of the requirements of this Code to the prescribed extent of each such reference. Where differences occur between provisions of this Code and referenced codes and standards, the provisions of this Code shall apply.

The provisions of this Code shall not be deemed to nullify any provisions of local, state or federal law.

In the event any differences in requirements exist between the accessibility requirements of this Code and the accessibility requirements of the California Code of Regulations, Title 24 (also referred to as the California Building Standards Code), then the California Code of Regulations shall govern.

102—UNSAFE BUILDINGS

102.1 Definition. All buildings or structures which are structurally unsound or not provided with adequate egress, or which constitute a fire hazard, or are otherwise dangerous to human life, or which in relation to existing use constitute a hazard to safety or health, or public welfare, by reason of inadequate maintenance, dilapidation, obsolescence, fire hazard, disaster damage, lacking an approved water supply, hazardous electrical, unsafe gas piping or appliances or abandonment as specified in this Code or any other effective ordinance, are, for the purpose of this Chapter, unsafe buildings. Whenever the Building Official determines by inspection that a building or structure, whether structurally damaged or not, is dangerous to human life by reason of being located in an area which is unsafe due to hazard from landslide, settlement, or slippage or any other cause, such building shall, for the purpose of this Chapter, be considered an unsafe building.

No person shall own, use, occupy or maintain any unsafe building.

All unsafe buildings are hereby declared to be public nuisances. In addition to instituting any appropriate action to prevent, restrain or correct a violation of this section, the Building Official may abate an unsafe condition or order that the unsafe condition be secured, repaired, rehabilitated, demolished or removed as deemed necessary by the Building Official in accordance with the procedure specified in this Code.

As used in this Chapter “party concerned” means the person, if any, in real or apparent charge and control of the premises involved, the record owner, the holder of any mortgage, trust deed or other lien or encumbrance of record, the owner or holder of any lease of record, the record holder of any other estate or interest in or to the building or structure or the land upon which it is located.

102.2 Notice of Unsafe Building. The Building Official shall examine or cause to be examined every building or structure or portion thereof reported as dangerous or damaged and, if, in the Building Official’s opinion, such is found to be an unsafe building as defined in this Chapter, the Building Official shall give to the party concerned written notice stating the defects thereof. This notice may require the owner or person in charge of the building or premises to:

1.    Immediately remove, backfill, shore up or secure such unsafe condition, and/or

2.    Within 48 hours, apply for required permit(s) and commence either the required repairs or improvements or demolition and removal of the building or structure or portions thereof.

All such work shall be completed within 90 days from date of notice, unless otherwise stipulated by the Building Official. If necessary, such notice shall also require the building, structure, or portion thereof to be vacated forthwith and not reoccupied until the required repairs and improvements are completed, inspected and approved by the Building Official.

Proper service of such notice shall be by personal service or by registered or certified mail upon every party concerned. In the event the Building Official, after reasonable effort, is unable to serve the notice as specified above, proper service shall be by posting on the structure a copy of the notice.

The designated period within which the owner or person in charge is required to comply with such notice shall begin as of the date the owner or person in charge receives such notice by personal service or registered or certified mail. If such notice is by posting, the designated period shall begin ten days following the date of posting.

The failure of any owner or other person to receive such notice shall not affect in any manner the validity of any proceedings taken hereunder.

A person notified to vacate an unsafe building by the Building Official shall vacate within the time specified in the order.

The Building Official may record a notice of violation with the County Recorder’s Office that the building or structure described has been inspected and found to be an unsafe building, as defined in this Chapter, and that the owner thereof has been so notified. After all required work has been completed, upon request and payment of required fee(s) the Building Official shall record a notice rescinding the prior notice of violation with the County Recorder’s Office.

102.3 Posting of Signs. The Building Official shall cause to be posted on buildings required to be vacated or remain unoccupied a notice to read substantially as follows: “Restricted Use” or “Unsafe—Do Not Enter or Occupy” as described in Section 102.6. All placards shall read “Planning and Building Department, City of South Pasadena.”

Such notice shall be posted at the main entrance and shall be visible to persons approaching the building or structure from a street. Such notice shall remain posted until the required repairs, demolition or removal are completed. Such notice shall not be removed without written permission of the Building Official and no person shall enter the building except for the purpose of making the required repairs or of demolishing the building.

102.4 Unsafe Buildings: Hearing.

102.4.1 Right of hearing. The party concerned or the Building Official may request a hearing regarding the unsafe condition of the building or structure. The request by the interested party shall be made in writing to the Building Official within 30 days of the date of the notice of the unsafe condition. A hearing shall be requested by the Building Official prior to demolition or repair of an unsafe building by the City except when such demolition or repair is done under the emergency procedure set forth in this Chapter.

All interested parties who desire to be heard may appear before the Building Board of Appeals to show cause why the building or structure should not be ordered repaired, vacated and repaired, or demolished.

102.4.2 Notice of hearing. Not less than ten days prior to the hearing, the Building Official shall serve or cause to be served either in the manner required by law for the service of summons or by first class mail, postage prepaid, a copy of the notice of hearing upon every party concerned.

102.4.3 Form and contents of notice. The notice of hearing shall state:

1.    The street address and a legal description sufficient for identification of the premises upon which the building or structure is located.

2.    The conditions because of which the Building Official believed that the building or structure is an unsafe building.

3.    The date, hour and place of the hearing.

102.4.4 Posting of notice. The Building Official shall post one copy of the notice of hearing in a conspicuous place on the unsafe building involved, not less than ten days prior to the hearing.

102.4.5 Hearing by Building Board of Appeals. The Building Board of Appeals shall hold a hearing and consider all competent evidence offered by any person pertaining to the matters set forth in the report of the Building Official.

The Building Board of Appeals shall make written findings of fact as to whether or not the building or structure is an unsafe building as defined in this Chapter.

When determined by the Building Official, the Building Rehabilitation Appeals Board shall hold the hearing in lieu of the Building Board of Appeals.

102.4.6 Order. If the Building Board of Appeals finds that the building or structure is an unsafe building, it shall make an order based on its finding that:

1.    The building or structure is an unsafe building and directing that repairs be made and specifying such repairs, or

2.    The building or structure is an unsafe building and directing that it be vacated and that specified repairs be made, or

3.    The building or structure is an unsafe building and directing that it shall be vacated and demolished.

The order shall state the time within which the work required must be commenced, which shall not be less than 10 nor later than 30 days after the service of the order. The order shall state a reasonable time within which the work shall be completed. The Building Board of Appeals for good cause may extend the time for completion in writing.

The order shall be served upon the same parties and in the same manner as required by Section 102.4.2 for the notice of hearing. It shall also be conspicuously posted on or about the building or structure.

102.5 Unsafe Buildings: Demolition or Repair.

102.5.1 Work by City. If the repairs or demolition necessary to remove the unsafe condition as set forth in the Notice of Unsafe Building is not made within the designated period and a hearing has not been requested by any party concerned, the Building Official shall request that a hearing be held regarding the unsafe condition. If the finding by the Building Board of Appeals is not complied with within the period designated by the Board, the Building Official may then secure or demolish such portions of the structure, or may cause such work to be done, to the extent necessary to eliminate the hazard determined to exist by the Building Board of Appeals.

102.5.2 Emergency procedure. Whenever any portion of a structure constitutes an immediate hazard to life or property, and in the opinion of the Building Official, the conditions are such that repairs, or demolition must be undertaken within less than the designated period, the Building Official may take necessary action, such as performing alterations, repairs, and/or demolition of the structures, to protect life or property, or both, after giving such notice to the parties concerned as the circumstances will permit or without any notice whatever when, in the Building Official’s opinion, immediate action is necessary.

102.5.3 Costs. The costs incurred by actions taken pursuant to Sections 102.5.1 and 102.5.2 including the entire cost of the services rendered by the County, shall be a special assessment against the property upon which the structure stood. The Building Official shall notify, in writing, all parties concerned of the amount of such assessment resulting from such work. Within five days of the receipt of such notice, any such party concerned may file with the Building Official a written request for a hearing on the correctness or reasonableness, or both, of such assessment. Any party concerned who did not receive a notice pursuant to Section 102.2 and who has not had a hearing on the necessity of the demolition or repairs in such request for hearing also may ask that such necessity be reviewed. The Building Board of Appeals thereupon shall set the matter for hearing; give such party concerned notice thereof as provided in Section 102.4.2; hold such hearing and determine the reasonableness or correctness of the assessment, or both; and if requested, determine the necessity of the demolition or repairs. The Building Board of Appeals, in writing, shall notify such party concerned of its decision. If the total assessment determined as provided for in this section is not paid in full within 10 days after receipt of such notice from the Building Official or the Building Board of Appeals, as the case may be, the Building Official shall record in the office of the Department of Registrar-Recorder a statement of the total balance still due and a legal description of the property. From the date of such recording, such balance due shall be a special assessment against the parcel.

The assessment shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary City taxes are collected and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary City taxes. All the laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of City taxes shall be applicable to such special assessment.

102.5.4 Interference Prohibited. A person shall not obstruct, impede, or interfere with the Building Official or any representative of the Building Official, or with any person who owns or holds any estate or interest in any unsafe building which has been ordered by the Building Board of Appeals to be repaired, vacated and repaired, or vacated and demolished or removed, whenever the Building Official or such owner is engaged in repairing, vacating and repairing, or demolishing any such unsafe building pursuant to this Chapter, or is performing any necessary act preliminary to or incidental to such work, or authorized or directed pursuant hereto.

102.5.5 Prosecution. In case the owner shall fail, neglect or refuse to comply with the notice to repair, rehabilitate, or to demolish and remove said building or structure or portion thereof, the Building Official shall cause the owner of the building to be prosecuted as a violator of this Code.

102.6 Posting of signs for damage assessment. The building official shall cause placard(s) to be posted on buildings upon completion of a safety assessment.

All placards shall read “Planning and Building Department, City of South Pasadena.” The placards shall also indicate the condition of the structure for continued occupancy, and shall read substantially as follows:

1.    “INSPECTED—Lawful Occupancy Permitted” (green placard) shall be posted on any building or structure wherein no apparent structural hazard has been found. This placard is not intended to mean that there is no damage to the building or structure.

2.    “RESTRICTED USE” (yellow placard) shall be posted on each building or structure that has been damaged wherein the damage has resulted in some form of restriction to the continued occupancy. This placard will note in general terms the type of damage encountered and will clearly and concisely note the restrictions on continued occupancy.

3.    “UNSAFE—Do Not Enter or Occupy” (red placard) shall be posted on each building or structure that has been damaged such that the continued occupancy poses a threat to life safety. Buildings or structures posted with this placard shall not be entered under any circumstance except as authorized in writing by the Building Official, or his or her authorized representative. This placard is not to be used or considered as a demolition order. This placard will note in general terms the type of damage encountered.

Such notice shall be posted at the main entrance(s) and shall be visible to persons approaching the building or structure from a street. Such notice shall remain posted until the required repairs, demolition or removal are completed. Such notice shall not be removed without written permission of the Building Official and no person shall enter the building except for the purpose of making the required repairs or of demolishing the building.

104.2.3.2 Notwithstanding the foregoing, if the Building Official or an authorized representative has reasonable cause to believe that the building or grading or premises is so hazardous, unsafe, or dangerous as to require immediate inspection to safeguard the public health or safety, the Building Official shall have the right to immediately enter and inspect such property, and may use any reasonable means required to effect such entry and make such inspection, whether such property is occupied or unoccupied and whether or not permission to inspect has been obtained.

SECTION 106 BUILDING PLAN REQUIREMENTS

106.1 General. When required by the building official to verify compliance with any Code, relevant laws, ordinances, rules and regulations, plans, and when deemed necessary by the building official, calculations, geological or engineering reports and other required data shall be submitted for plan review. The building official may require plans and calculations to be prepared by an engineer or architect licensed or registered by the State to practice as such. Only after the plans have been approved may the applicant apply for a building permit for such work. The building official may also require such plans be reviewed by other departments and/or divisions of the City to verify compliance with the laws and ordinances under their jurisdiction.

When authorized by the building official, complete plans and calculations need not be submitted for the following work when information sufficient to clearly define the nature and scope of the work are submitted for review:

1.    One-story buildings of conventional light-frame construction with a gross floor area not exceeding 600 square feet;

2.    Work deemed by the building official as minor, small and/or unimportant work.

Where deemed necessary by the building official, submittals shall include special inspection requirements as defined in Section 117.5 and structural observation requirements as defined in Section 117.6.

Plans, calculations, reports or documents for work regulated by any Code, relevant laws, ordinances, rules and regulations shall bear the seal, signature and number of a civil engineer, structural engineer, mechanical engineer, electrical engineer, soils engineer or architect registered or certified to practice in the State of California when required by the California Business and Professions Code. A seal and number shall not be required for work authorized by the said article to be performed by a person not registered or certified as an engineer or architect.

For buildings exceeding 160 feet (48.77 m) in height, the structural calculations and each sheet of structural plans shall be prepared under the supervision of and shall bear the signature or approved stamp of a person authorized by the State of California to use the title structural engineer. In addition, all architectural sheets shall bear the signature or approved stamp of an architect licensed by the State of California.

All structures and devices installed for the protection of pedestrians, regardless of location, are subject to the plan review requirements of this section.

For additional provisions applicable to grading, see Appendix J.

106.2 Architect or Engineer of Record. When it is required that documents be prepared by an architect or engineer, the building official may require the owner to designate on the permit application an architect or engineer who shall act as the architect or engineer of record. If the circumstances require, the owner may designate a substitute architect or engineer of record who shall perform all of the duties required of the original architect or engineer of record. The building official shall be notified in writing by the owner if the architect or engineer of record is changed or is unable to continue to perform the duties.

The architect or engineer of record shall be responsible for reviewing and coordinating all submittal documents prepared by others, including deferred submittal items, for compatibility with the design of the building.

106.3 Information Required on Building Plans. Plans shall be drawn to scale upon substantial paper or other material suitable to the building official shall be of sufficient clarity to indicate the nature and scope of the work proposed, and shall show in detail that the proposed construction will conform to the provisions of any Code and all relevant laws, ordinances, rules and regulations.

The first sheet of each set of plans shall give the street address of the proposed work and the name, address and telephone number of the owner(s) and all persons who were involved in the design and preparation of the plans.

Plans shall include a plot plan showing the location of the proposed building and of every existing building on the premises. In lieu of specific details, the building official may approve references on the plans to a specific section or part of any Code, relevant laws, ordinances, rules and/or regulations.

Computations, stress diagrams and other data sufficient to show the correctness of the plans shall be submitted when required by the Building Official.

When deemed necessary by the building official, the first sheet of each set of plans shall indicate the following information:

1.    The building Type of Construction;

2.    Whether fire sprinklers are installed in all or any portion of the building;

3.    Existing building areas and areas of all additions;

4.    The number of stories of the building;

5.    The use of all new and existing rooms and/or areas;

6.    The Occupancy Classifications of each occupancy;

7.    The Code in effect on the date of plan check submittal.

The plans shall show all mitigation measures required under the National Pollution Discharge Elimination System (NPDES) permit issued to the County of Los Angeles. For the application of NPDES permit requirements as they apply to grading plans and permits, see Appendix J of this code.

106.4 Drainage Review Requirement. Where proposed construction will affect site drainage, existing and proposed drainage patterns shall be shown on the plot plan.

A site inspection may be required prior to plan check of building plans for lots or parcels in areas having slopes of five horizontal to one vertical (5:1) or steeper when the building official finds that a visual inspection of the site is necessary to establish drainage requirements for the protection of property, existing buildings or the proposed construction. The fee for such inspection shall be as set forth by ordinance or resolution. Such a preinspection shall not be required for a building pad graded under the provisions of Appendix J.

For additional provisions applicable to grading, see Appendix J.

106.5 Deferred submittals. For the purposes of this section, deferred submittals are defined as those portions of the design that are not submitted at the time of the application and that are to be submitted to the building official within a specified period.

Deferral of any submittal items shall have prior approval of the building official. The architect or engineer of record shall list the deferred submittals on the plans and shall submit the deferred submittal documents for review by the building official.

Submittal documents for deferred submittal items shall be submitted to the architect or engineer of record who shall review them and forward them to the building official with a notation indicating that the deferred submittal documents have been reviewed and that they have been found to be in general conformance with the design of the building. The deferred submittal items shall not be installed until their design and submittal documents have been approved by the building official.

106.6 Standard Plans. The building official may approve a set of plans for a building or structure as a “standard plan,” provided that the applicant has made proper application and submitted complete sets of plans as required by this section.

Plans shall reflect laws and ordinances in effect at the time a permit is issued except as provided in this section. Nothing in this section shall prohibit modifying the permit set of plans to reflect changes in laws and ordinances that have become effective since the approval of the standard plan. The standard plans shall become null and void where the work required by such changes exceeds five percent of the value of the building or structure.

Standard plans shall be valid for a period of one year from the date of approval. This period may be extended by the building official when there is evidence that the plans may be used again and the plans show compliance with all Codes, relevant laws, ordinances, rules and regulations.

106.7 Expiration of Plan Check Applications. Plan check applications for which no permit is issued within one year following the date of application shall expire by limitation and become null and void. Plans and calculations previously submitted may thereafter be returned to the applicant or destroyed by the building official.

When requested in writing by the applicant prior to the effective date of a more current code, the building official may grant extension(s) not exceeding 1 year provided:

1.    Circumstances beyond the control of the applicant have prevented action from being taken;

2.    An extension fee is paid as determined by the Building Official, not to exceed 25 percent of the plan check fee.

Once an application and any extension thereof has expired, the applicant shall resubmit plans and calculations and pay a new application fee.

106.8 Retention of Plans. One set of approved plans, calculations and reports shall be retained by the building official. Except as required by Section 19850 of the Health and Safety Code, the building official shall retain such set of the approved plans, calculations and reports for a period of not less than 90 days from date of completion of the work covered therein.

SECTION 107 BUILDING PERMIT REQUIREMENTS

107.1 Building Permit Required. No person shall erect, construct, enlarge, alter, repair, move, improve, remove, connect, convert, demolish, or equip any building, structure, or portion thereof, perform any grading, or cause the same to be done, without first obtaining a separate permit for each such building, structure or grading from the building official.

The issuance of a permit without first requiring a plan review shall not prevent the building official from requesting plans deemed necessary to verify that the work performed under said permit complies with any Code and all relevant laws, ordinances, rules and regulations.

The approval of the plans shall not be held to permit or to be an approval of any violation of any Federal, State, County or City laws or ordinances. The issuance of a permit shall not be deemed to certify that the site of the described work is safe.

One set of approved plans and reports shall be returned to the applicant to be kept on such building or work site at all times while the authorized work is in progress.

The building official may issue a permit for the construction of part of a building or structure before the entire plans and calculations for the whole building or structure have been submitted or approved, provided adequate information and detailed statements have been filed complying with all pertinent requirements of all Codes. The holder of such permit shall proceed at his or her own risk without assurance that the permit for the entire building or structure will be granted.

107.5 Permit Validity. The issuance or granting of a permit or approval of plans and calculations shall not be construed to be a permit for, or an approval of, any violation of any of the provisions of any Code, relevant laws, ordinances, rules and regulations. No permit presuming to give authority to violate or cancel the provisions of any Code, relevant laws, ordinances, rules and regulations shall be valid, except insofar as the work or use which it authorizes is lawful.

The issuance of a permit based on plans and calculations shall not prevent the building official from thereafter requiring the correction of errors in said plans and calculations or from preventing building operations being carried on thereunder when in violation of any Code, relevant laws, ordinances, rules and regulations.

107.6 Expiration of Permit. Every permit issued by the building official under the provisions of any Code having jurisdiction over any portion of the work shall expire automatically by limitation and become null and void one year after the date of the last required building inspection approval by the building official, or if work authorized by such permit is not commenced within one year from the issuance date of such permit. Before such work can be commenced or recommenced, a new permit shall be first obtained.

For the purposes of this paragraph, “required building inspection” shall mean those inspections listed in Section 117.4.2, and those inspections specifically identified on the Job Record issued with the building permit. No partial inspection shall meet the definition of “required building inspection.”

Supplementary permits for electrical, grading, mechanical, plumbing, and reroof shall not expire so long as the associated building permit remains active. No electrical, grading, mechanical, plumbing or reroof inspection shall satisfy the requirement to have a required building inspection as defined in this Section.

Where a new building permit is issued to complete work previously started under an expired permit, a permit fee shall be collected in the amount determined by the Building Official, not to exceed 25 percent of the permit fee provided:

1.    A written request to renew the permit is received by the Building Division prior to the effective date of a more current code;

2.    that the duration of time from the date of expiration has not exceeded one year; and

3.    that no changes have been made or will be made in the original plans and calculations for such work.

Applicable plan review and permit fees, in addition to issuance fees, for the remaining work shall be collected for all permits that do not meet the preceding criteria.

All work to be performed under the new permit must be done in accordance with the Building Code in effect on the date of issuance of the new permit.

107.7 Permit Suspension or Revocation. The building official may, in writing, suspend or revoke a permit issued under the provisions of any Code having jurisdiction over any portion of the work, relevant laws, ordinances, rules and regulations whenever the permit was issued in error or on the basis of incorrect information supplied, or in violation of any other laws, ordinances or regulations or any of the provisions of any Code.

The building official may also, in writing, withhold inspections, suspend or revoke a permit where work is being done in violation of any Code, where work is being done in violation of the approved plans, where work is being concealed without approval from the building official, or where work is not in accordance with the direction of the building official.

107.8 Cancellation of Permit by Applicant. If no portion of the work or construction covered by a permit issued by the building official under the provisions of any Code, relevant laws, ordinances, rules and regulations has been commenced, the person to whom such permit has been issued may deliver such permit to the building official with a request that such permit be cancelled. Only the person to whom such permit was issued may request cancellation of the permit. The building official shall thereupon stamp or write on the face of such permit the words, “Cancelled at the request of the applicant.” Thereupon such permit shall be null and void and of no effect. All fees except for issuance fees shall be returned to the applicant.

107.9 Transfer of Permit by Applicant.

107.9.1 No Inspection Performed. When requested in writing by the person to whom the permit was issued, a permit may be transferred from the person to whom the permit was issued to a new individual. Fee credit shall be given where deemed appropriate by the building official and new fees shall be paid as required by ordinance or resolution.

107.9.2 One or More Inspection Performed. Permits may be transferred to any individual upon completion of a new application. Fee credit shall be given where deemed appropriate by the building official and new fees shall be paid as required by ordinance or resolution.

SECTION 109 USE AND OCCUPANCY

109.1 General. No building, structure or premises, or portion thereof, shall be used or occupied, and no change in the existing occupancy classification of a building, structure or premises, or portion thereof, shall be made until the building official has approved the building, structure or premises or portion thereof for such use or occupancy and until all permits have been approved or a temporary certificate of completed construction has been issued.

Upon final of a building permit and at the request of the applicant, a certificate of completed construction shall be issued by the building official for any structure that is ready to occupy.

Approval of a building, structure or premises, or portion thereof, for use or occupancy (including, but not limited to, final inspection approval and/or issuance of a certificate of completed construction or issuance of a temporary certificate of completed construction) shall not be construed as approval of a violation of the provisions of any Code, relevant laws, ordinances, rules and/or regulations. Approvals presuming to give authority to violate or cancel the provisions of any Code, relevant laws, ordinances, rules and/or regulations are not valid.

The building official may, in writing, suspend or revoke any such approvals or certificates whenever the building official determines that the approval or certificate was issued in error, or on the basis of incorrect information supplied, or when it is determined that the building, structure or premises, or portion thereof, is in violation of any provision of any Code, relevant laws, ordinances, rules and/or regulations. Any certificate of completed construction or temporary certificate of completed construction so issued shall be surrendered upon request of the building official.

109.2 Unpermitted Structures. No person shall own, use, occupy or maintain any unpermitted structure.

109.3 Change in Use. Changes in the character or use of a building shall not be made except as specified in Existing Building Code.

109.4 Issuance of a Certificate of Completed Construction. When the building, structure or premises, or portion thereof, has passed final inspection, and when the building, structure or premises complies with all Codes having jurisdiction over any portion of the work, relevant laws, ordinances, rules and regulations, and the required fees have been paid, the building official, upon request of the applicant, shall issue a certificate of completed construction, which shall contain the following:

1.    The building permit number.

2.    The address of the building or structure.

3.    A description of that portion of the building for which the certificate is issued.

4.    A statement that the described portion of the building was inspected and found to comply with the requirements of all Codes having jurisdiction over any portion of the work, relevant laws, ordinances, rules and regulations for the group and division of occupancy and the use for which the proposed occupancy is classified.

5.    The date the permit was approved.

6.    Any other information deemed necessary by the building official.

For additional provisions applicable to grading, see Appendix J.

109.5 Issuance of a Temporary Certificate of Completed Construction. If the building official finds that no substantial hazard will result from occupancy of any building or portion thereof before the same is completed, the building official may issue a temporary certificate of completed construction for the use of a portion or portions of a building, structure or premises, prior to the completion of the entire building, structure or premises, or portion thereof.

Such temporary certificate of completed construction shall be valid for a period of time to be specified by the building official. Upon request of the owner or permittee, the building official may, in writing, extend the temporary certificate of completed construction when it is determined that the circumstances so warrant. After the expiration of a temporary certificate of completed construction and any extension(s) thereof, the building, structure or premises, or portion thereof, shall not be used or occupied until the building official has approved the building for such use or occupancy.

109.6 Live Load Posted. In new construction, a durable sign that indicates the “live load” shall be required in commercial or industrial buildings where the floor or roof or portion thereof is or has been designed with a live load that exceeds 50 psf. The live load sign shall be posted on that part of each story or roof to which it applies, in a conspicuous place. The live load sign shall be posted as a condition precedent to the issuance of a certificate of completed construction certificate. It shall be unlawful to remove or deface any such sign.

109.7 Continued Use of Unpermitted and/or Noncomplying Conditions. When deemed appropriate by the building official, a certificate of continued use of unpermitted and/or noncomplying condition(s) may be issued. The certificate shall not be issued until documentation, satisfactory to the building official, has been provided indicating that 1) the unpermitted and/or noncomplying condition(s) were not created by the current owner, and 2) that the current owner had no knowledge that the conditions were unpermitted and/or noncomplying at the time of purchase.

An application shall be completed that states 1) that the continued use of the existing unpermitted construction and/or noncomplying conditions is permitted by the City only with the owner’s understanding that the City in no way assumes responsibility for the method of construction or the materials used; and 2) that it is further understood that this application for continued use is not to be construed as being equivalent in any way to a building permit.

An inspection shall then be made by the building official. Where necessary, permits shall be issued to correct any conditions deemed to pose a potential threat to life, limb or property. Once the inspection(s) have been made; all necessary permits have been obtained, inspected and approved; and all obvious potential threats to life, limb or property have been corrected, the building official may approve the application for unpermitted construction and or noncomplying condition(s). When approved by the building official, conditions deemed not to pose a potential threat to life, limb or property may be permitted to remain.

110—PROHIBITED USES OF BUILDING SITES

110.1 Flood Hazard.

Buildings are not permitted in an area determined by the Building Official to be subject to flood hazard by reason of inundation, overflow or erosion.

The placement of the building and other structures (including walls and fences) on the building site shall be such that water or mud flow will not be a hazard to the building or adjacent property. This prohibition shall not apply when provision is made to eliminate such hazard to the satisfaction of the Building Official by providing adequate drainage facilities by protective walls, suitable fill, raising the floor level of the building, a combination of these methods, or by other means. The Building Official, in the application of this Section for buildings, structures, and grading located in whole or in part in flood hazard areas, shall enforce, as a minimum, the current Federal Flood Plain Management Regulations defined in Title 44, Code of Federal Regulations, Section 60.3, and may require the applicant or property owner to provide the following information and/or comply with the following provisions:

1.    Delineation of flood hazard areas, floodway boundaries and flood zones, and the design flood elevation, as appropriate;

2.    The elevation of the proposed lowest floor, including basement, in flood hazard areas (A Zones), and the height of the proposed lowest floor, including basement, above the highest adjacent grade;

3.    The elevation of the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member in coastal high hazard areas (V Zone);

4.    If the design flood elevations are not included on the community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM), then the applicant shall obtain and reasonably utilize any design flood elevation and floodway data available from other sources, as approved by the Building Official; and

5.    During construction, upon placement of the lowest floor, including basement, and prior to further vertical construction, the permittee shall provide to the Building Official documentation, prepared and sealed by a registered design professional, certifying the elevation of the lowest floor, including basement.

110.2 GEOTECHNICAL HAZARDS.

110.2.1. No building or grading permit shall be issued under the provisions of this section when the Building Official finds that property outside the site of the proposed work could be damaged by activation or acceleration of a geotechnically hazardous condition and such activation or acceleration could be attributed to the proposed work on, or change in use of, the site for which the permit is requested. For the purpose of this section, a geotechnically hazardous condition does not include surface displacement due to earthquake faults.

110.2.2. Except as provided in Section 110.2.3, work requiring a building or grading permit is not permitted in an area determined by the Building Official to be subject to hazard from landslide, settlement, or slippage.

Earthquake fault zone maps within the City prepared under Sections 2622 and 2623 of the California Resources Code which show traces of earthquake faults are hereby declared to be, on the date of official issue, a part of this Code, and may be referred to elsewhere in this Code. Earthquake fault zone maps revised under the above sections of the California Resources Code shall, on the date of their official issue, supersede previously issued maps which they replace.

SECTION 113—EARTHQUAKE FAULTS

113.1 General.

The construction of a building or structure near a known active earthquake fault and regulated by this Code shall be permitted as set forth in this Section.

113.2 Scope.

The provisions of this Section shall apply only to permits for buildings or structures on individual lots or parcels and are not intended to be supplementary to geologic investigations required to qualify divisions of land as set forth in the SPMC.

113.3 Definition.

For the purpose of this Section, a geologist shall be a professional geologist, licensed by the California State Board for Geologists and Geophysicists to practice geology in California.

113.4 Known Active Earthquake Faults.

For the purpose of this Section, known active earthquake faults are those faults which have had displacement within Holocene time (approximately the last 11,000 years) as defined in the most current issue of Special Publication 42 of the California Geological Survey.

113.5 Construction Limitations.

No building or structure shall be constructed over or upon the trace of a known active earthquake fault which is shown on maps maintained by the Building Official. These maps include, but are not limited to, earthquake fault zone maps prepared under Sections 2622 and 2623 of the California Public Resources Code.

The absence of a known active earthquake fault trace at the proposed building location shall be determined by a professional geologist licensed in the State of California in the following cases:

1.    When the proposed building is within (50) feet (15.24 m) of that line designated by the Building Official as the assumed location of a known active earthquake fault on the aforementioned maps.

2.    When the proposed building is within 50 feet (15.24 m) of the most probable ground location of the trace of a known active earthquake fault shown on the aforementioned maps.

In these cases, the Building Official may require the excavation of a trench, for the purpose of determining the existence of an active earthquake fault. Such a trench will be required if a lack of distinguishable fault features in the vicinity prevents the Building Official from determining by a site examination, review of available aerial photographs, or by other means that the fault trace does not underlie the proposed building. The trench shall be approximately perpendicular to the most probable direction of the fault trace, at least 1-1/2 feet (0.15 m) wide, and at least five feet in depth measured from natural grade, or to a depth satisfactory to the Building Official.

The trench must be accessible for mapping and inspection by the Building Official, when requested, and meet the requirements of Title 8 of the California Code of Regulations, Construction Safety Orders. The trench need not extend further than the full width of the proposed structure plus 5 feet (1.52 m) beyond the traversed exterior walls. A known active earthquake fault shall be presumed nonexistent if an exposure is not found by the professional geologist in the walls or floor of the trench.

The Building Official may require a more extensive investigation by a professional geologist as evidence to the absence of a known active earthquake fault prior to the issuance of a permit for Groups A, E, I, H and R, Division 1 Occupancies and B, F, M and S Occupancies over one story in height.

The results of the investigation, conclusions and recommendations shall be presented in a geology report prepared by a professional geologist as defined by Section 113.3. The report shall comply with the guidelines presented in Note 49 prepared by the California Department of Conservation, Geological Survey.

This article encourages the use of solar energy systems by removing unreasonable barriers, minimizing costs to property owners and the city of South Pasadena (city), and expanding the ability of property owners to install small residential rooftop solar energy systems. This article allows the city to achieve these goals while protecting the public health and safety. (Ord. No. 2285, § 1, 2015.)


9.21 Applicability.

(a)    This article applies to the permitting of all small residential rooftop solar energy systems in the city.

(b)    Small residential rooftop solar energy systems legally established or permitted prior to the effective date of this article are not subject to the requirements of this chapter unless physical modifications or alterations are undertaken that materially change the size, type, or components of the small rooftop energy system in such a way as to require new permitting. Routine operation and maintenance shall not require a permit. (Ord. No. 2285, § 1, 2015.)


9.22 Definitions.

The following words and phrases as used in this article are defined as follows:

(a)    “Small residential rooftop solar energy system” means all of the following:

It is the intention that all the utility facilities of developments described in Section 9.45 be placed underground. If it is determined that practical difficulties, or unreasonable hardships inconsistent with the purpose of this chapter and unique to a particular parcel of property would result from the literal application of this section, the zoning board may waive, modify or delay the application of any undergrounding requirement imposed pursuant to this section upon written application of any affected property owner. The zoning board shall notify the applicant of their decision in writing by mail. If the zoning board determines to delay the installation of required underground utilities, they may require a recorded agreement guaranteeing the future performance of the work together with adequate performance security enforceable by the city in the form of a cash deposit, bond, letter of credit, or other instrument satisfactory to the city attorney. (Ord. No. 1668.)


9.48 Right of appeal.

CHAPTER 16A GROWTH REQUIREMENT CAPITAL FEE

Sections:

16A.1    Purpose.

16A.2    Definitions.

16A.3    Findings.

16A.4    Commercial and industrial development—Fees.

16A.5    Residential development—Fees.

16A.6    Fee use and type of development—Relationship.

16A.7    Fee payment.

16A.8    Exemptions.

16A.9    Fund accounting.

16A.10    Annual findings.


16A.1 Purpose.

The purpose of this growth requirement capital fee is to mitigate unfavorable impacts attributed to new development. This fee is to be applied toward the costs of certain public facilities. It is based on a formula designed to insure that individual developers pay their fair share for public facilities needed to serve the city’s growing population. The public improvements are identified by category in the city’s capital improvement program (CIP) which is updated annually. While public improvements may be added or deleted from the CIP, use of the growth requirement capital fee is limited to those public improvements which fall into one of the following categories: (1) government and public safety facilities, (2) essential infrastructure and related facilities, and (3) cultural and recreational facilities. (Ord. No. 1985, § 1.)


16A.2 Definitions.

As used in this chapter:

(a)    “Capital improvements” are any public facilities or equipment funded through the city’s capital improvement budget.

(b)    “Costs of capital improvements” include all costs related to acquisition, construction, repair and financing, but do not include costs of routine maintenance.

(c)    “Cultural and recreational facilities” are capital improvements related to library, auditorium, concert hall, and similar facilities.

(d)    “Essential infrastructure” are capital improvements related to streets (including, but not limited to, curbs, sidewalks and related structures), bridges, traffic control, water supply and appurtenances, drainage and similar facilities which serve public transportation, access and drainage needs, which are otherwise not specifically identified for funding as a part of other city development fees.

(e)    “Fees” collected under the requirement of this chapter mean those as defined in Section 66000 of the Government Code, but shall not include costs incurred by any developer as a result of any conditions imposed for the approval of the project.

(f)    “Gross floor area” means the total horizontal area of all the floors of a structure included within the surrounding exterior walls, including garages, and accessory structures, but excluding patios.

(g)    “New development” means any residential, commercial or industrial construction project except as specifically exempted in this chapter.

(h)    “Government facilities” are capital improvements related to City Hall, city garage and equipment yard, city offices, parking and similar facilities in or through which general city government operations are conducted.

(i)    “Park facilities” are parkland, adjacent street improvements, capital park improvements including but not limited to landscaping, irrigation, play structures, benches, pathways, fences and parking as well as special use facilities and structures such as restrooms, sports complexes and buildings, and financing costs associated with any of the aforementioned.

(j)    “Public safety facilities” are capital improvements related to police and fire operations.

(k)    “Related facilities” are capital improvements of general community benefit such as major landscaping, fountains, monuments, signs and similar facilities. (Ord. No. 1985, § 2; Ord. No. 2171 § 2, 2008.)


16A.3 Findings.

The city council finds that there is a reasonable relationship between the need for the public facilities discussed in section 16A.1 and the type of development project for which the fee is imposed for the reasons stated in this section.

The city is committed to maintaining the same level of public services and the same public facilities-to-population relationship which presently exists. Thus, to the extent growth occurs in the future, there will be a need for added public services and facilities.

The growth requirement capital fee is based on the premise that to the extent new development necessitates public facilities, it should be required to pay its fair share. (Ord. No. 1985, § 2.)


16A.4 Commercial and industrial development—Fees.

Commercial and industrial development fosters the need for additional public services, which in turn contribute to the need for the following categories of public facilities: government and public safety facilities and essential infrastructure and related facilities.

Based on the level of services and the facilities-to-population relationship which presently exists and the extent to which commercial/industrial development contribute to growth, the city has determined that commercial and industrial development should be assessed at the following rates as their fair share of contribution for these needed public facilities.

Each new commercial and/or industrial development shall pay a fee as set and adjusted by resolution of the city council. (Ord. No. 1985 § 2(1); Ord. No. 2005.)


16A.5 Residential development—Fees.

Residential development results directly or indirectly in significant increases in city population, and accordingly, such development adversely affects the public facilities-to-population relationship which presently exists. Because residential development results in significant increases in population, it contributes to the need for the following categories of public facilities: government and public safety facilities, essential infrastructure and related facilities and cultural and recreational facilities.

Each new residential development shall pay an amount as set and adjusted by resolution of the city council.

Residential development also contributes to the need for park facilities.

Therefore, each new residential development shall also pay a fee to be known asthe “park facilities impact fee” in an amount as set and adjusted by resolution of the city council in addition to the herein aforementioned residential development fee.

The rates upon which the fees set forth in this chapter are based shall be adjusted as of July 1st of each year to reflect changes in building costs as determined by the Construction Cost Index for Los Angeles from January of the previous year to January of the current year based on the Engineering News Record. (Ord. No. 1985, § 3(2); Ord. No. 2005,; Ord. No. 2171 § 2, 2008.)


16A.6 Fee use and type of development—Relationship.

The city council finds that there is a reasonable relationship between the need for the public facilities discussed in section 16A.1 and the type of development project on which the fee is imposed for the reasons stated in this section.

It is reasonable to use growth requirement capital fees generated from residential development for all capital improvements because growth in the residential population places a demand on government and public safety facilities, essential infrastructure and other related facilities, and cultural and recreational facilities, as defined in this chapter. Because commercial and industrial development also place a demand on government and public safety facilities and essential infrastructure and other related facilities, it is reasonable to use fees assessed from this development sector for all capital improvements which fall within the definition of these categories. However, it is not reasonable to use fees assessed from the commercial/industrial sector in support of cultural and recreational facilities, since the city has determined that there is not substantial demand placed on these facilities as a result of a commercial or industrial growth. (Ord. No. 1985, § 4.)


16A.7 Fee payment.

Any applicant for a building permit for new development shall pay the growth requirement capital fee in conjunction with payment of the building permit. (Ord. No. 1985 § 5.)


16A.8 Exemptions.

Any proposed development which meets the following criteria shall be exempt from paying the growth requirement capital fee:

(a)    Alterations which do not increase the floor area of a structure; or

(b)    Additions to single-family residential dwellings which does not constitute habitable space as defined by the Uniform Building Code. (Ord. No. 1985, § 6.)


16A.9 Fund accounting.

(a)    All fees collected pursuant to this chapter shall be placed in a separate fund and further separated into two special accounts, one for fees generated from residential development and the other for fees generated from commercial and industrial development pursuant to Government Code section 53077. The fees in these accounts, along with any interest earnings on the accounts, may only be utilized for certain capital improvements, as defined previously in this chapter.

(c)    If the city cannot make such findings, then the city will need to refund the fees as appropriate. (Ord. No. 1985, § 7.)


16A.10 Annual findings.

Each year, with the adoption of the capital improvement program, the council will make the following findings:

(a)    The city council will identify the purpose to which the growth requirement capital fee is to be put; and

(b)    The city council will determine whether there is a reasonable relationship between the fee and the purpose for with it was charged. If it is determined that there is a reasonable relationship, then it shall so demonstrate. (Ord. No. 1985, § 8.)


16A.1 Purpose.

The purpose of this growth requirement capital fee is to mitigate unfavorable impacts attributed to new development. This fee is to be applied toward the costs of certain public facilities. It is based on a formula designed to insure that individual developers pay their fair share for public facilities needed to serve the city’s growing population. The public improvements are identified by category in the city’s capital improvement program (CIP) which is updated annually. While public improvements may be added or deleted from the CIP, use of the growth requirement capital fee is limited to those public improvements which fall into one of the following categories: (1) government and public safety facilities, (2) essential infrastructure and related facilities, and (3) cultural and recreational facilities. (Ord. No. 1985, § 1.)


16A.2 Definitions.

As used in this chapter:

(a)    “Capital improvements” are any public facilities or equipment funded through the city’s capital improvement budget.

(b)    “Costs of capital improvements” include all costs related to acquisition, construction, repair and financing, but do not include costs of routine maintenance.

(c)    “Cultural and recreational facilities” are capital improvements related to library, auditorium, concert hall, and similar facilities.

(d)    “Essential infrastructure” are capital improvements related to streets (including, but not limited to, curbs, sidewalks and related structures), bridges, traffic control, water supply and appurtenances, drainage and similar facilities which serve public transportation, access and drainage needs, which are otherwise not specifically identified for funding as a part of other city development fees.

(e)    “Fees” collected under the requirement of this chapter mean those as defined in Section 66000 of the Government Code, but shall not include costs incurred by any developer as a result of any conditions imposed for the approval of the project.

(f)    “Gross floor area” means the total horizontal area of all the floors of a structure included within the surrounding exterior walls, including garages, and accessory structures, but excluding patios.

(g)    “New development” means any residential, commercial or industrial construction project except as specifically exempted in this chapter.

(h)    “Government facilities” are capital improvements related to City Hall, city garage and equipment yard, city offices, parking and similar facilities in or through which general city government operations are conducted.

(i)    “Park facilities” are parkland, adjacent street improvements, capital park improvements including but not limited to landscaping, irrigation, play structures, benches, pathways, fences and parking as well as special use facilities and structures such as restrooms, sports complexes and buildings, and financing costs associated with any of the aforementioned.

(j)    “Public safety facilities” are capital improvements related to police and fire operations.

(k)    “Related facilities” are capital improvements of general community benefit such as major landscaping, fountains, monuments, signs and similar facilities. (Ord. No. 1985, § 2; Ord. No. 2171 § 2, 2008.)


16A.3 Findings.

The city council finds that there is a reasonable relationship between the need for the public facilities discussed in section 16A.1 and the type of development project for which the fee is imposed for the reasons stated in this section.

The city is committed to maintaining the same level of public services and the same public facilities-to-population relationship which presently exists. Thus, to the extent growth occurs in the future, there will be a need for added public services and facilities.

The growth requirement capital fee is based on the premise that to the extent new development necessitates public facilities, it should be required to pay its fair share. (Ord. No. 1985, § 2.)


16A.4 Commercial and industrial development—Fees.

Commercial and industrial development fosters the need for additional public services, which in turn contribute to the need for the following categories of public facilities: government and public safety facilities and essential infrastructure and related facilities.

Based on the level of services and the facilities-to-population relationship which presently exists and the extent to which commercial/industrial development contribute to growth, the city has determined that commercial and industrial development should be assessed at the following rates as their fair share of contribution for these needed public facilities.

Each new commercial and/or industrial development shall pay a fee as set and adjusted by resolution of the city council. (Ord. No. 1985 § 2(1); Ord. No. 2005.)


16A.5 Residential development—Fees.

Residential development results directly or indirectly in significant increases in city population, and accordingly, such development adversely affects the public facilities-to-population relationship which presently exists. Because residential development results in significant increases in population, it contributes to the need for the following categories of public facilities: government and public safety facilities, essential infrastructure and related facilities and cultural and recreational facilities.

Each new residential development shall pay an amount as set and adjusted by resolution of the city council.

Residential development also contributes to the need for park facilities.

Therefore, each new residential development shall also pay a fee to be known asthe “park facilities impact fee” in an amount as set and adjusted by resolution of the city council in addition to the herein aforementioned residential development fee.

The rates upon which the fees set forth in this chapter are based shall be adjusted as of July 1st of each year to reflect changes in building costs as determined by the Construction Cost Index for Los Angeles from January of the previous year to January of the current year based on the Engineering News Record. (Ord. No. 1985, § 3(2); Ord. No. 2005,; Ord. No. 2171 § 2, 2008.)


16A.6 Fee use and type of development—Relationship.

The city council finds that there is a reasonable relationship between the need for the public facilities discussed in section 16A.1 and the type of development project on which the fee is imposed for the reasons stated in this section.

It is reasonable to use growth requirement capital fees generated from residential development for all capital improvements because growth in the residential population places a demand on government and public safety facilities, essential infrastructure and other related facilities, and cultural and recreational facilities, as defined in this chapter. Because commercial and industrial development also place a demand on government and public safety facilities and essential infrastructure and other related facilities, it is reasonable to use fees assessed from this development sector for all capital improvements which fall within the definition of these categories. However, it is not reasonable to use fees assessed from the commercial/industrial sector in support of cultural and recreational facilities, since the city has determined that there is not substantial demand placed on these facilities as a result of a commercial or industrial growth. (Ord. No. 1985, § 4.)


16A.7 Fee payment.

Any applicant for a building permit for new development shall pay the growth requirement capital fee in conjunction with payment of the building permit. (Ord. No. 1985 § 5.)


16A.8 Exemptions.

Any proposed development which meets the following criteria shall be exempt from paying the growth requirement capital fee:

(a)    Alterations which do not increase the floor area of a structure; or

(b)    Additions to single-family residential dwellings which does not constitute habitable space as defined by the Uniform Building Code. (Ord. No. 1985, § 6.)


16A.9 Fund accounting.

(a)    All fees collected pursuant to this chapter shall be placed in a separate fund and further separated into two special accounts, one for fees generated from residential development and the other for fees generated from commercial and industrial development pursuant to Government Code section 53077. The fees in these accounts, along with any interest earnings on the accounts, may only be utilized for certain capital improvements, as defined previously in this chapter.

(b)    If the city has had possession of a developer fee for five or more years, and has not committed that money to a project, then the city must make findings describing the continuing need for that money each fiscal year after the five years has expired.

(c)    If the city cannot make such findings, then the city will need to refund the fees as appropriate. (Ord. No. 1985, § 7.)


16A.10 Annual findings.

Each year, with the adoption of the capital improvement program, the council will make the following findings:

(a)    The city council will identify the purpose to which the growth requirement capital fee is to be put; and

(b)    The city council will determine whether there is a reasonable relationship between the fee and the purpose for with it was charged. If it is determined that there is a reasonable relationship, then it shall so demonstrate. (Ord. No. 1985, § 8.)

ARTICLE II. MASSAGE ESTABLISHMENTS


17.13 Findings and purpose.

The city council finds and declares as follows:

(a)    The permit requirements and restrictions imposed by this article are reasonably necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city.

(b)    The city is authorized, by virtue of the Constitution of the state of California, and Cal. Gov’t Code § 51031, to regulate massage establishments by imposing reasonable standards for, and conditions on, the operation of massage establishments.

(c)    There is opportunity for acts of prostitution and other unlawful sexual activity to occur in massage establishments. Courts have long recognized massage as a pervasively regulated activity and that massage establishments have been known to be brothels in disguise and even engage in human trafficking. The establishment of reasonable standards for issuance of permits and restrictions on operations would serve to reduce the risk of illegal activity, including human trafficking.

(d)    The restrictions and requirements contained in this article are intended to reduce the burden of massage establishment regulation on the police department.

(e)    The regulations and restrictions contained in this article are intended to discourage massage establishments from degenerating into houses of prostitution and the means utilized in this article bear a reasonable and rational relationship to the goals sought to be achieved.

(1)    To protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the public by preventing unlawful, unsanitary, and dangerous conditions or practices within the city of South Pasadena;

(3)    To provide opportunities for deemed approved massage establishments to operate in mutually beneficial relationship to each other and to other commercial and civic services;

(4)    To regulate those businesses that provide massage services to the public in order to provide a standard of safety, lawfulness, and quality commonly expected of the industry;

(5)    To provide that deemed approved massage establishments are not the source of undue public nuisances or visual blight in the community;

17.41 Definitions.

As used in this article:

“Legal nonconforming massage establishment” means any massage establishment which would otherwise be considered a nonconforming use under Article II of Chapter 17 SPMC. Such an establishment or use shall be considered a deemed approved massage establishment, and shall no longer be considered a legal nonconforming use, except such activity shall be subject to those zoning regulations relating to nonconforming uses as specified in SPMC 36.360.010 et seq., as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this article.

“Performance standards” means regulations prescribed in the deemed approved performance standards set forth in SPMC 17.42. (Ord. No. 2292, § 2, 2016.)

(a)    “Deemed approved massage establishment” means any massage establishment (as defined in SPMC 17.14) that is legal nonconforming and in existence immediately following the effective date of any amendment to Article II of Chapter 17 SPMC regulating massage establishments and the practice of massage. Said business shall be considered a deemed approved massage establishment as long as it complies with the deemed approved massage establishment performance standards as set forth in this section. Said business shall no longer be considered a legal nonconforming activity or use.

(b)    A massage establishment shall retain its deemed approved status only if it conforms with the provisions of Article II of Chapter 17 SPMC, commencing with SPMC 17.20 and any other applicable provisions of this code. (Ord. No. 2292, § 2, 2016.)


17.43 Deemed approved status procedure.

(a)    Automatic Deemed Approved Status. All massage establishments that would otherwise be considered legal nonconforming uses under this code and the provisions of Article II of Chapter 17 SPMC shall automatically become deemed approved massage establishments as of the effective date of this article and shall no longer be considered legal nonconforming uses. Each such deemed approved massage establishment shall retain its deemed approved status as long as it complies with the deemed approved performance standards in SPMC 17.42.

(b)    Notification of Owners of Deemed Approved Massage Establishment. The city shall notify the owner of each deemed approved massage establishment, and also the property owner if not the same, of the establishment’s deemed approved status. Such notice shall be sent via certified return receipt mail; shall include a copy of the performance standards of SPMC 17.42 and Article II of this chapter; notification that the establishment is required to comply with all these same performance standards; and that the establishment is required to comply with all other aspects of this article. Should the notice be returned, then the notice shall be sent via regular U.S. mail. (Ord. No. 2292, § 2, 2016.)


17.44 Procedure for consideration of violations to performance standards.

(a)    As a result of an inspection or upon receiving a complaint from the public, police department, or any other interested party that a deemed approved massage establishment is in violation of the performance standards at SPMC 17.42, and once it is determined by the city that violations appear to be occurring, then the deemed approved status of the deemed approved massage establishment in question shall be reviewed by the hearing officer at a public hearing. Notification of the public hearing shall be in accordance with subsection (d) of this section.

(1)    At the public hearing the hearing officer shall receive testimony and other evidence on whether the operating methods of the deemed approved massage establishment are in violation of the performance standards at SPMC 17.42, are causing undue negative impacts in the surrounding area, and whether the property is being maintained in a manner in violation of any provision of this code.

(2)    While the hearing is open, any interested party may present to the hearing officer for his or her consideration any relevant testimony or evidence; failure to do so will preclude the party from raising such issues during any appeal hearing and in court.

(3)    Within 15 days following the public hearing, the hearing officer shall issue a written determination whether the deemed approved massage establishment conforms to the deemed approved performance standards set forth in SPMC 17.42 and to any other applicable criteria, and may:

(A)    Continue the deemed approved status for the establishment in question;

(B)    Continue the deemed approved status for the establishment, subject to reasonable conditions of correction as are in the judgment of the hearing officer necessary to ensure conformity with said criteria and such conditions shall be based on the evidence before the officer; or

(C)    Revoke the deemed approved status if the officer finds that the violations pose a threat to the health and safety of the public.

(4)    The decision of the hearing officer shall be based upon information compiled by staff and testimony from the business owner and all other interested parties. The determination of the hearing officer shall become final 15 calendar days after the date of the written decision unless appealed to the city council in accordance with subsection (c) of this section. Any party seeking to appeal the determination will be limited to issues or evidence presented to the hearing officer prior to the close of the hearing officer’s public hearing on the matter.

(b)    Procedure for Consideration of Violations of Conditions of Corrections. In the event of a failure to comply with any prescribed condition of correction, the hearing officer may hold a public hearing. Notification of the public hearing shall be in accordance with subsection (d) of this section. The same procedures shall apply as described under subsection (a) of this section.

(c)    Appeal to City Council. Within 15 calendar days after imposition of conditions of approval pursuant to the hearing officer’s written determination on a deemed approved massage establishment or the revocation of deemed approved status, an appeal may be taken to the city council by the deemed approved massage establishment owner or any other interested party.

(1)    In the event the last date of appeal falls on a weekend or a holiday when city offices are closed, the next date such offices are open for business shall be the last date of appeal.

(2)    Such appeal shall be made on a form prescribed by the city. The appeal shall state specifically wherein it is claimed there was an error or abuse of discretion by the officer or wherein its decision is not supported by the evidence in the record. The appeal itself must raise each and every issue that is contested, along with all the arguments and evidence in the record, previously presented to the hearing officer prior to the close of the public hearing on the item, which supports the basis of the appeal; failure to do so will preclude the appellant from raising such issues during the appeal or in court.

(3)    Upon receipt of the appeal and the appeal fee in accordance with subsection (e) of this section a date shall be set for consideration thereof. Not less than 17 days prior thereto, written notice shall be given to: the owner of the deemed approved massage establishment; the property owner; the appellant in those cases where the appellant is not the owner; the adverse party or parties, or to the attorney, spokesperson, or representative of such party or parties; other interested groups and neighborhood associations who have requested notification; and to similar groups and individuals as appropriate, of the date and place of the hearing on the appeal.

(4)    During the hearing on the appeal, the appellant will be limited to issues and evidence presented to the hearing officer prior to the close of the public hearing on the item and raised in the appeal itself. The appellant shall not be permitted to present any other evidence (written, oral, or otherwise) during the appeal process. In considering the appeal, the city council shall determine whether the deemed approved massage establishment conforms to the applicable deemed approved performance standards and conditions of correction (if applicable), and may continue or revoke a deemed approved status; or require such changes in the existing use or impose such reasonable conditions of approval as are, in its judgment, necessary to ensure conformity to said performance standards.

(5)    The decision of the city council on the appeal shall be final.

(d)    Notification of Public Hearing before Hearing Officer. The hearing officer shall notify the owner of each deemed approved activity, and also the property owner if not the same, of the time and place of the public hearing.

(1)    Such notice shall be sent via certified return receipt mail, and shall include notification that the deemed approved status of the deemed approved massage establishment will be considered by the hearing officer.

(2)    The public hearing shall also be noticed by posting notice on the premises of the subject property. The notice shall be placed in the window of the establishment (if a window facing the street is not present, then the notice will be required to be posted onto the exterior of the building). All notices shall advertise the time, date, purpose and location of the public hearing for each particular site. All notices shall be given not less than 10 days prior to the date set for the hearing.

(3)    Notice shall also be given by mail or delivery to all persons shown on the last available equalized assessment roll as owning real property in the city within 300 feet of the subject property; provided, however, that failure to send notice to any such owner where his or her address is not shown in said records shall not invalidate the affected proceedings.

(4)    Such notices shall be given not less than 10 days prior to the date set for the hearing, if such is to be held. Notice by mail is deemed given on the date the notice is placed into the U.S. mail system. Fees for notification shall be in accordance with subsection (e) of this section and paid for by the deemed approved massage establishment in question.

(e)    Fee Schedule. Fees, and regulations pertaining to fees, including the appeal, and reinspection of deemed approved massage establishments shall be in accordance with the city master fee schedule.

(f)    A massage establishment which has had its deemed approved status revoked must immediately cease and desist all massage services and related business operations. No massage establishment which has had its deemed approved status revoked may apply for a new operator’s permit pursuant to SPMC 17.17 through 17.19 for 24 months from the date of revocation. (Ord. No. 2292, § 2, 2016.)

In addition, the U.S. Surgeon General and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency have concluded that secondhand smoke causes lung cancer and heart disease in healthy nonsmokers. In order to promote public health, safety and welfare, the declared purposes of this chapter are to prohibit the smoking of tobacco, or any weed or plant, in public places and places of employment, to protect the public health by restricting public exposure to secondhand smoke, and to restrict youth access to tobacco products, as stated and required in this chapter. (Ord. No. 2161, § 2, 2007.)


17.51 Authority.

This chapter is enacted pursuant to the provisions of Section 118910 of the California Health and Safety Code for the purpose of prohibiting smoking in public places and in places of work in order to eliminate the hazards and nuisance which smoking causes to those who are involuntarily exposed.

ARTICLE II. MASSAGE ESTABLISHMENTS


17.13 Findings and purpose.

The city council finds and declares as follows:

(a)    The permit requirements and restrictions imposed by this article are reasonably necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city.

(b)    The city is authorized, by virtue of the Constitution of the state of California, and Cal. Gov’t Code § 51031, to regulate massage establishments by imposing reasonable standards for, and conditions on, the operation of massage establishments.

(c)    There is opportunity for acts of prostitution and other unlawful sexual activity to occur in massage establishments. Courts have long recognized massage as a pervasively regulated activity and that massage establishments have been known to be brothels in disguise and even engage in human trafficking. The establishment of reasonable standards for issuance of permits and restrictions on operations would serve to reduce the risk of illegal activity, including human trafficking.

(d)    The restrictions and requirements contained in this article are intended to reduce the burden of massage establishment regulation on the police department.

(e)    The regulations and restrictions contained in this article are intended to discourage massage establishments from degenerating into houses of prostitution and the means utilized in this article bear a reasonable and rational relationship to the goals sought to be achieved.

(1)    To protect the health, safety, and general welfare of the public by preventing unlawful, unsanitary, and dangerous conditions or practices within the city of South Pasadena;

(2)    To protect residential, commercial, industrial and civic areas and minimize the adverse impacts of nonconforming and incompatible uses;

(3)    To provide opportunities for deemed approved massage establishments to operate in mutually beneficial relationship to each other and to other commercial and civic services;

(4)    To regulate those businesses that provide massage services to the public in order to provide a standard of safety, lawfulness, and quality commonly expected of the industry;

(5)    To provide that deemed approved massage establishments are not the source of undue public nuisances or visual blight in the community;

Whenever any provisions of this article and any other provision of law, whether set forth in this code, or in any other law, ordinance, or resolution of any kind, imposes overlapping or contradictory regulations, or contains restrictions covering any same subject matter, that provision which is more restrictive or imposes higher standards shall control, except as otherwise expressly provided in this article.

17.41 Definitions.

As used in this article:

“Condition of correction” means a requirement which must be carried out by the establishment in order to retain its deemed approved status.

“Legal nonconforming massage establishment” means any massage establishment which would otherwise be considered a nonconforming use under Article II of Chapter 17 SPMC. Such an establishment or use shall be considered a deemed approved massage establishment, and shall no longer be considered a legal nonconforming use, except such activity shall be subject to those zoning regulations relating to nonconforming uses as specified in SPMC 36.360.010 et seq., as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this article.

“Performance standards” means regulations prescribed in the deemed approved performance standards set forth in SPMC 17.42. (Ord. No. 2292, § 2, 2016.)

(a)    “Deemed approved massage establishment” means any massage establishment (as defined in SPMC 17.14) that is legal nonconforming and in existence immediately following the effective date of any amendment to Article II of Chapter 17 SPMC regulating massage establishments and the practice of massage. Said business shall be considered a deemed approved massage establishment as long as it complies with the deemed approved massage establishment performance standards as set forth in this section. Said business shall no longer be considered a legal nonconforming activity or use.

(b)    A massage establishment shall retain its deemed approved status only if it conforms with the provisions of Article II of Chapter 17 SPMC, commencing with SPMC 17.20 and any other applicable provisions of this code. (Ord. No. 2292, § 2, 2016.)


17.43 Deemed approved status procedure.

(a)    Automatic Deemed Approved Status. All massage establishments that would otherwise be considered legal nonconforming uses under this code and the provisions of Article II of Chapter 17 SPMC shall automatically become deemed approved massage establishments as of the effective date of this article and shall no longer be considered legal nonconforming uses. Each such deemed approved massage establishment shall retain its deemed approved status as long as it complies with the deemed approved performance standards in SPMC 17.42.

(b)    Notification of Owners of Deemed Approved Massage Establishment. The city shall notify the owner of each deemed approved massage establishment, and also the property owner if not the same, of the establishment’s deemed approved status. Such notice shall be sent via certified return receipt mail; shall include a copy of the performance standards of SPMC 17.42 and Article II of this chapter; notification that the establishment is required to comply with all these same performance standards; and that the establishment is required to comply with all other aspects of this article. Should the notice be returned, then the notice shall be sent via regular U.S. mail. (Ord. No. 2292, § 2, 2016.)


17.44 Procedure for consideration of violations to performance standards.

(a)    As a result of an inspection or upon receiving a complaint from the public, police department, or any other interested party that a deemed approved massage establishment is in violation of the performance standards at SPMC 17.42, and once it is determined by the city that violations appear to be occurring, then the deemed approved status of the deemed approved massage establishment in question shall be reviewed by the hearing officer at a public hearing. Notification of the public hearing shall be in accordance with subsection (d) of this section.

(1)    At the public hearing the hearing officer shall receive testimony and other evidence on whether the operating methods of the deemed approved massage establishment are in violation of the performance standards at SPMC 17.42, are causing undue negative impacts in the surrounding area, and whether the property is being maintained in a manner in violation of any provision of this code.

(2)    While the hearing is open, any interested party may present to the hearing officer for his or her consideration any relevant testimony or evidence; failure to do so will preclude the party from raising such issues during any appeal hearing and in court.

(3)    Within 15 days following the public hearing, the hearing officer shall issue a written determination whether the deemed approved massage establishment conforms to the deemed approved performance standards set forth in SPMC 17.42 and to any other applicable criteria, and may:

(A)    Continue the deemed approved status for the establishment in question;

(B)    Continue the deemed approved status for the establishment, subject to reasonable conditions of correction as are in the judgment of the hearing officer necessary to ensure conformity with said criteria and such conditions shall be based on the evidence before the officer; or

(C)    Revoke the deemed approved status if the officer finds that the violations pose a threat to the health and safety of the public.

(4)    The decision of the hearing officer shall be based upon information compiled by staff and testimony from the business owner and all other interested parties. The determination of the hearing officer shall become final 15 calendar days after the date of the written decision unless appealed to the city council in accordance with subsection (c) of this section. Any party seeking to appeal the determination will be limited to issues or evidence presented to the hearing officer prior to the close of the hearing officer’s public hearing on the matter.

(b)    Procedure for Consideration of Violations of Conditions of Corrections. In the event of a failure to comply with any prescribed condition of correction, the hearing officer may hold a public hearing. Notification of the public hearing shall be in accordance with subsection (d) of this section. The same procedures shall apply as described under subsection (a) of this section.

(c)    Appeal to City Council. Within 15 calendar days after imposition of conditions of approval pursuant to the hearing officer’s written determination on a deemed approved massage establishment or the revocation of deemed approved status, an appeal may be taken to the city council by the deemed approved massage establishment owner or any other interested party.

(1)    In the event the last date of appeal falls on a weekend or a holiday when city offices are closed, the next date such offices are open for business shall be the last date of appeal.

(2)    Such appeal shall be made on a form prescribed by the city. The appeal shall state specifically wherein it is claimed there was an error or abuse of discretion by the officer or wherein its decision is not supported by the evidence in the record. The appeal itself must raise each and every issue that is contested, along with all the arguments and evidence in the record, previously presented to the hearing officer prior to the close of the public hearing on the item, which supports the basis of the appeal; failure to do so will preclude the appellant from raising such issues during the appeal or in court.

(3)    Upon receipt of the appeal and the appeal fee in accordance with subsection (e) of this section a date shall be set for consideration thereof. Not less than 17 days prior thereto, written notice shall be given to: the owner of the deemed approved massage establishment; the property owner; the appellant in those cases where the appellant is not the owner; the adverse party or parties, or to the attorney, spokesperson, or representative of such party or parties; other interested groups and neighborhood associations who have requested notification; and to similar groups and individuals as appropriate, of the date and place of the hearing on the appeal.

(4)    During the hearing on the appeal, the appellant will be limited to issues and evidence presented to the hearing officer prior to the close of the public hearing on the item and raised in the appeal itself. The appellant shall not be permitted to present any other evidence (written, oral, or otherwise) during the appeal process. In considering the appeal, the city council shall determine whether the deemed approved massage establishment conforms to the applicable deemed approved performance standards and conditions of correction (if applicable), and may continue or revoke a deemed approved status; or require such changes in the existing use or impose such reasonable conditions of approval as are, in its judgment, necessary to ensure conformity to said performance standards.

(5)    The decision of the city council on the appeal shall be final.

(d)    Notification of Public Hearing before Hearing Officer. The hearing officer shall notify the owner of each deemed approved activity, and also the property owner if not the same, of the time and place of the public hearing.

(1)    Such notice shall be sent via certified return receipt mail, and shall include notification that the deemed approved status of the deemed approved massage establishment will be considered by the hearing officer.

(2)    The public hearing shall also be noticed by posting notice on the premises of the subject property. The notice shall be placed in the window of the establishment (if a window facing the street is not present, then the notice will be required to be posted onto the exterior of the building). All notices shall advertise the time, date, purpose and location of the public hearing for each particular site. All notices shall be given not less than 10 days prior to the date set for the hearing.

(3)    Notice shall also be given by mail or delivery to all persons shown on the last available equalized assessment roll as owning real property in the city within 300 feet of the subject property; provided, however, that failure to send notice to any such owner where his or her address is not shown in said records shall not invalidate the affected proceedings.

(4)    Such notices shall be given not less than 10 days prior to the date set for the hearing, if such is to be held. Notice by mail is deemed given on the date the notice is placed into the U.S. mail system. Fees for notification shall be in accordance with subsection (e) of this section and paid for by the deemed approved massage establishment in question.

(e)    Fee Schedule. Fees, and regulations pertaining to fees, including the appeal, and reinspection of deemed approved massage establishments shall be in accordance with the city master fee schedule.

(f)    A massage establishment which has had its deemed approved status revoked must immediately cease and desist all massage services and related business operations. No massage establishment which has had its deemed approved status revoked may apply for a new operator’s permit pursuant to SPMC 17.17 through 17.19 for 24 months from the date of revocation. (Ord. No. 2292, § 2, 2016.)

ARTICLE IV. SWIMMING POOL FENCES


17.48—17.49 Repealed by Ordinance No. 1983.

ARTICLE V. SMOKING—PROHIBITED


17.50 Findings and purpose.

The city council finds that the smoking of tobacco, or any other weed or plant, is a positive danger to health and a material annoyance, inconvenience, discomfort and a health hazard to those who are present in confined and open spaces, and that smoking rates are on the increase among the youth population of Los Angeles County.

In addition, the U.S. Surgeon General and the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency have concluded that secondhand smoke causes lung cancer and heart disease in healthy nonsmokers. In order to promote public health, safety and welfare, the declared purposes of this chapter are to prohibit the smoking of tobacco, or any weed or plant, in public places and places of employment, to protect the public health by restricting public exposure to secondhand smoke, and to restrict youth access to tobacco products, as stated and required in this chapter.

17.94 Private enforcement.

(a)    Any person, including a legal entity or organization or a government agency, acting for the interests of itself, its members, or the general public may bring a civil action to enforce this article. Upon proof of a violation, a court shall award the following:

Notwithstanding any other provision of this article no person suing on behalf of the general public shall recover statutory damages based upon a violation of this article if a previous claim brought on behalf of the general public by another person for statutory damages and based upon the same violation has been adjudicated, whether or not the person bringing the subsequent claim was a party to the prior adjudication.

(2)    Exemplary damages, where it is proven by clear and convincing evidence that the defendant is guilty of oppression, fraud, malice, retaliation, or a conscious disregard for the public health.

(d)    Nothing in this article prohibits a person from bringing a civil action in small claims court to enforce this article, so long as the amount in demand and the type of relief sought are within the jurisdictional requirements of that court. (Ord. No. 2205, § 1, 2010.)

Any business activity listed in Articles I through III hereof, for which a permit is required, shall be construed as enacted for both revenue and regulatory purposes. (Ord. No. 1595, § 1.)

(Ord. No. 1595, § 1; Ord. No. 2258, § 7, 2013.)


18.11 Both criminal and civil action authorized for failure to pay license tax.

The conviction and fine or imprisonment of any person for engaging in any business without first obtaining a license to conduct such business, shall not relieve such person from paying the license tax to conduct such business, nor shall the payment of any license tax prevent a criminal prosecution for the violation of any of the provisions of this chapter. All remedies prescribed hereunder shall be cumulative and the use of one or more remedies by the city shall not bar the use of any other remedy for the purpose of enforcing the provisions hereof. (Ord. No. 1595, § 1.)

18.29 Affidavit for license.

(c)    To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which imposes a tax and provides a measure therefor that can be administered and collected by the State Board of Equalization in a manner that adopts itself as fully as practicable to, and requires the least possible deviation from the existing statutory and administrative procedures followed by the State Board of Equalization in administering and collecting the California State sales and use taxes;

(d)    To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which can be administered in a manner that will, to the degree possible consistent with the provisions of Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting city sales and use taxes and at the same time minimize the burden of record keeping upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this article. (Ord. No. 1641, § 4; Ord. No. 1983, § 68.)


18.67 Contract with state.

Prior to the operative date this city shall contract with the State Board of Equalization to perform all functions incident to the administration and operation of this sales and use tax chapter; provided, that if this city shall not have contracted with the State Board of Equalization prior to the operative date, it shall nevertheless so contract and in such a case the operative date shall be the first day of the first calendar quarter following the execution of such a contract rather than the first day of the first calendar quarter following the adoption of this article (October 3, 1973).

The decision shall articulate the conclusion of the hearing officer, his or her findings of fact and findings of law.

ARTICLE VI. TOBACCO RETAILER PERMIT


18.101 Definitions.

The following words and phrases, whenever used in this article, shall have the meanings defined in this section unless the context clearly requires otherwise:

(a)    “Arm’s length transaction” means a sale in good faith and for valuable consideration that reflects the fair market value in the open market between two informed and willing parties, neither of which is under any compulsion to participate in the transaction. A sale between relatives, related companies or partners, or a sale for which a significant purpose is avoiding the effect of the violations of this article is not an arm’s length transaction.

(b)    “Department” means the finance department and any agency or person designated by the department to enforce or administer the provisions of this article.

(c)    “Person” means any natural person, partnership, cooperative association, corporation, personal representative, receiver, trustee, assignee, or any other legal entity.

(d)    “Proprietor” means a person with an ownership or managerial interest in a business. An ownership interest shall be deemed to exist when a person has a ten percent or greater interest in the stock, assets, or income of a business other than the sole interest of security for debt. A managerial interest shall be deemed to exist when a person can or does have or share ultimate control over the day-to-day operations of a business.

(e)    “Self-service display” means the open display or storage of tobacco products or tobacco paraphernalia in a manner that is physically accessible in any way to the general public without the assistance of the retailer and a direct person-to-person transfer between the purchaser and the retailer. A vending machine is a form of self-service display.

(f)    “Smoking” means possessing a lighted tobacco product, lighted tobacco paraphernalia, or any other lighted weed or plant (including a lighted pipe, cigar, hookah pipe, or cigarette of any kind), and means the lighting of a tobacco product, tobacco paraphernalia, or any other weed or plant (including a pipe, cigar, hookah pipe, or cigarette of any kind).

(g)    “Tobacco product” means any substance containing tobacco leaf, including, but not limited to, cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, hookah tobacco, snuff, chewing tobacco, dipping tobacco, snus, bidis, or any other preparation of tobacco; and any product or formulation of matter containing biologically active amounts of nicotine that is manufactured, sold, offered for sale, or otherwise distributed with the expectation that the product or matter will be introduced into the human body, but does not include any cessation product specifically approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for use in treating nicotine or tobacco dependence.

(h)    “Tobacco retailer” means any person who sells, offers for sale, or does or offers to exchange for any form of consideration, tobacco, tobacco products or tobacco paraphernalia. “Tobacco retailing” means the doing of any of these things. This definition is without regard to the quantity of tobacco, tobacco products, or tobacco paraphernalia sold, offered for sale, exchanged, or offered for exchange. A tobacco retailer can be a primary or accessory land use (as defined in SPMC 36.700.020 or its successor). (Ord. No. 2258, § 23, 2013.)


18.102 Requirements and prohibitions.

(a)    Tobacco Retailer Permit Required. It is unlawful for any person to act as a tobacco retailer in the city without first obtaining and maintaining a valid tobacco retailer permit (“permit”) pursuant to this article for each location at which that activity is to occur. Tobacco retailing without a valid tobacco retailer permit is a nuisance as a matter of law.

(b)    Lawful Business Operation. In the course of tobacco retailing or in the operation of the business or maintenance of the location for which a permit issued, it shall be a violation of this article for a permittee, or any of the permittee’s agents or employees, to violate any local, state, or federal law applicable to tobacco products or tobacco retailing.

(c)    Display of Permit. Each tobacco retailer permit shall be prominently displayed in a publicly visible location at the permitted location.

(d)    Positive Identification Required. No person engaged in tobacco retailing shall sell or transfer a tobacco product to another person who appears to be under the age of twenty-seven years without first examining the identification of the recipient to confirm that the recipient is at least the minimum age under state law to purchase and possess the tobacco product.

(e)    Minimum Age for Persons Selling Tobacco. No person who is younger than the minimum age established by state law for the purchase or possession of tobacco products shall engage in tobacco retailing.

(f)    Self-Service Displays Prohibited. Tobacco retailing by means of a self-service display is prohibited.

(g)    False and Misleading Advertising Prohibited. A tobacco retailer or proprietor without a valid tobacco retailer permit, including, for example, a person whose permit has been suspended or revoked:

(1)    Shall keep all tobacco products out of public view. The public display of tobacco products or tobacco paraphernalia in violation of this provision shall constitute tobacco retailing without a permit under Section 18.112; and

(2)    Shall not display any advertisement relating to tobacco products or tobacco paraphernalia that promotes the sale or distribution of such products from the tobacco retailer’s location or that could lead a reasonable consumer to believe that such products can be obtained at that location. (Ord. No. 2184, § 2, 2009.)


18.103 Limits on eligibility for a tobacco retailer permit.

(a)    No permit may issue to authorize tobacco retailing at other than a fixed location. For example, tobacco retailing by persons on foot or from vehicles is prohibited.

(b)    No tobacco retailer may be located within five hundred feet of any public school as measured from the closest point on the property line of the parcels containing the retailer’s establishment and the school. Such measurement shall be in a straight line without regard to intervening structures. No existing business within five hundred feet of a public school may begin operation as a tobacco retailer after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section. (Ord. No. 2258, § 23, 2013.)


18.104 Application procedure.

(a)    Application for a tobacco retailer permit shall be submitted in the name of each proprietor proposing to conduct retail tobacco sales and shall be signed by each proprietor or an authorized agent thereof.

(b)    It is the responsibility of each proprietor to be informed regarding all laws applicable to tobacco retailing, including those laws affecting the issuance of a tobacco retailer permit. No proprietor may rely on the issuance of a permit as a determination by the city that the proprietor has complied with all state and federal laws applicable to tobacco retailing. A permit issued contrary to this article, contrary to any other law, or on the basis of false or misleading information supplied by a proprietor shall be revoked pursuant to Section 18.111(d) of this article. Nothing in this article shall be construed to vest in any person obtaining and maintaining a tobacco retailer permit any status or right to act as a tobacco retailer in contravention of any provision of law.

(c)    All applications shall be submitted on a form supplied by the department and shall contain the following information:

(1)    The name, address, and telephone number of each proprietor of the business seeking a permit;

(2)    The business name, address, and telephone number of the single fixed location for which a permit is sought;

(3)    A single name and mailing address authorized by each proprietor to receive all communications and notices (the “authorized address”) required by, authorized by, or convenient to the enforcement of this article. If an authorized address is not supplied, each proprietor shall be understood to consent to the provision of notice at the business address specified in subsection (c)(2);

(4)    Proof that the location for which a tobacco retailer permit is sought has been issued a valid state tobacco retailer permit by the California Board of Equalization;

(5)    Whether or not any proprietor or any agent of the proprietor has admitted violating, or has been found to have violated, this article and, if so, the dates and locations of all such violations within the previous five years;

(6)    A nonrefundable application fee, as set and as may be amended from time to time by city council resolution;

(7)    Such other information as the department deems necessary for the administration or enforcement of this article as specified on the application form required by this section.

(d)    A permitted tobacco retailer shall inform the department in writing of any change in the information submitted on an application for a tobacco retailer permit within ten business days of a change.

(e)    All information specified in an application pursuant to this section shall be subject to disclosure under the California Public Records Act (California Government Code Section 6250 et seq.) or any other applicable law, subject to the laws’ exemptions. (Ord. No. 2258, § 24, 2013.)


18.105 Issuance of permit.

Upon the receipt of a complete application for a tobacco retailer permit and the permit fee required by this article, the department shall issue a permit unless substantial evidence demonstrates that one or more of the following bases for denial exists:

(a)    The information presented in the application is inaccurate or false. Intentionally supplying inaccurate or false information shall be a violation of this article;

(b)    The application seeks authorization for tobacco retailing at a location for which this article prohibits issuance of tobacco retailer permits. However, this subsection shall not constitute a basis for denial of a permit if the applicant provides the city with documentation demonstrating by clear and convincing evidence that the applicant has acquired or is acquiring the location or business in an arm’s length transaction;

(c)    The application seeks authorization for tobacco retailing for a proprietor to whom this article prohibits a permit to be issued;

(d)    The application seeks authorization for tobacco retailing that is prohibited pursuant to this article (e.g., mobile vending), that is unlawful pursuant to this Code including, without limitation the zoning code, building code, and business license tax code, or that is unlawful pursuant to any other law. (Ord. No. 2184, § 2, 2009.)


18.106 Permit renewal and expiration.

(a)    Renewal of Permit. A tobacco retailer permit is invalid if the appropriate fee has not been timely paid in full or if the term of the permit has expired. The term of a tobacco retailer permit is one year. Each tobacco retailer shall apply for the renewal of his or her tobacco retailer permit and submit the permit fee no later than thirty days prior to expiration of the term.

(b)    Expiration of Permit. A tobacco retailer permit that is not timely renewed shall expire at the end of its term. To renew a permit not timely renewed pursuant to subsection (a), the proprietor must:

(1)    Submit the permit fee and application renewal form; and

(2)    Submit a signed affidavit affirming that the proprietor:

(A)    Has not sold and will not sell any tobacco product or tobacco paraphernalia after the permit expiration date and before the permit is renewed, or

(B)    Has waited the appropriate ineligibility period established for tobacco retailing without a permit, as set forth in Section 18.112(a) of this article, before seeking renewal of the permit. (Ord. No. 2258, § 24, 2013.)


18.107 Permits nontransferable.

(a)    A tobacco retailer permit may not be transferred from one person to another or from one location to another. A new tobacco retailer permit is required whenever a tobacco retailing location has a change in proprietorship.

(b)    Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, prior violations at a location shall continue to be counted against a location and permit ineligibility periods shall continue to apply to a location unless:

(1)    The location has been or is being fully transferred to a new proprietor in an arm’s length transaction; and

(2)    The new proprietor provides the city with clear and convincing evidence that the new proprietor has acquired or is acquiring the location in an arm’s length transaction. (Ord. No. 2258, § 24, 2013.)


18.108 Permit conveys a limited, conditional privilege.

Nothing in this article shall be construed to grant any person obtaining and maintaining a tobacco retailer permit any status or right other than the limited conditional privilege to act as a tobacco retailer at the location identified on the face of the permit. For example, nothing in this article shall be construed to render inapplicable, supersede, or apply in lieu of, any other provision of applicable law, including, but not limited to, any provision of this Code including without limitation the zoning code, building codes, and business license tax code, or any condition or limitation on smoking in an enclosed place of employment pursuant to California Labor Code Section 6404.5. For example, obtaining a tobacco retailer permit does not make the retailer a “retail or wholesale tobacco shop” for the purposes of California Labor Code Section 6404.5. (Ord. No. 2258, § 24, 2013.)


18.109 Fee for permit.

The initial fee to issue or to renew a tobacco retailer permit is hereby established at one hundred twenty dollars or as set and amended from time to time by city council resolution. The fee shall be calculated so as to recover the cost of administration and enforcement of this article, including, for example, issuing a permit, administering the permit program, retailer education, retailer inspection and compliance checks, documentation of violations, and prosecution of violators, but shall not exceed the cost of the regulatory program authorized by this article. All fees and interest upon proceeds of fees shall be used exclusively to fund the program. Fees are nonrefundable except as may be required by law. (Ord. No. 2258, § 24, 2013.)


18.110 Compliance monitoring.

(a)    Compliance with this article shall be monitored by the finance department. In addition, any peace officer may enforce the penal provisions of this article. The city may designate any number of additional persons to monitor compliance with this article.

(b)    The department or other person designated to enforce the provisions of this article shall check the compliance of each tobacco retailer at least one time per twelve-month period. The department may check the compliance of new permit and tobacco retailers previously found in violation of the licensing law more frequently. Nothing in this subsection shall create a right of action in any permittee or other person against the city or its agents.

(c)    Compliance checks shall be conducted so as to allow the department to determine, at a minimum, if the tobacco retailer is conducting business in a manner that complies with laws regulating youth access to tobacco. When the department deems appropriate, the compliance checks shall determine compliance with other laws applicable to tobacco retailing.

(d)    The city shall not enforce any law establishing a minimum age for tobacco purchases or possession against a person who otherwise might be in violation of such law because of the person’s age (hereinafter “youth decoy”) if the potential violation occurs when:

(1)    The youth decoy is participating in a compliance check supervised by a peace officer or a code enforcement official of the city of South Pasadena;

(2)    The youth decoy is acting as an agent of a person designated by the city to monitor compliance with this article;

(3)    The youth decoy is participating in a compliance check funded in part, either directly or indirectly through subcontracting, by the Los Angeles County department of health and/or Pasadena health department; or

(4)    The youth decoy has an immunity letter from the district attorney’s office. (Ord. No. 2258, § 25, 2013.)


18.111 Suspension/revocation of permit.

(a)    Suspension of Permit for Violation. In addition to any other penalty authorized by law, a tobacco retailer permit shall be suspended or revoked if any court of competent jurisdiction determines, or the department finds based on a preponderance of the evidence, after the permittee is afforded notice and an opportunity to be heard, that the permit, or any of the permittee’s agents or employees, has violated any of the requirements, conditions, or prohibitions of this article or has pleaded guilty, “no contest” or its equivalent, or admitted to a violation of any law designated in Section 18.102 of this article. A tobacco retailer or proprietor whose permit has been suspended is deemed not to have a valid tobacco retailer permit during the suspension period for purposes of this article.

(b)    Tobacco Retailer Permit Suspension/Revocation.

(1)    After suspension for a first violation of this article at a location within any twelve-month period, no person may engage in tobacco retailing at the location until fifteen days have passed from the date of suspension.

(2)    After suspension for a second violation of this article at a location within any twenty-four-month period, no person may engage in tobacco retailing at the location until thirty days have passed from the date of suspension.

(3)    After suspension for a third violation of this article at a location within any thirty-six-month period, no person may engage in tobacco retailing at the location until ninety days have passed from the date of suspension.

(4)    After revocation for four or more violations of this article at a location within any forty-eight-month period, no new permit may issue for the location until one year has passed from the date of revocation.

(c)    Appeal of Suspension/Revocation. A decision of the department to suspend or revoke a permit is appealable to the city manager and must be filed with the city clerk within ten days of mailing of the department’s decision. If such an appeal is made, it shall stay enforcement of the appealed action. An appeal to the city manager is not available for a suspension or revocation made pursuant to subsection (d) of this section.

(d)    Revocation of Permit Wrongly Issued. A tobacco retailer permit shall be revoked if the department finds, after the permittee is afforded notice and an opportunity to be heard, that one or more of the bases for denial of a permit under Section 18.105 existed at the time application was made or at any time before the permit issued. The decision by the department shall be the final decision of the city. Such a revocation shall be without prejudice to the filing of a new permit application.

(e)    Notice of City Manager Decision. The decision of the city manager (or of the department in the event of revocation pursuant to Section 18.111(d)) shall be mailed to the permittee within five working days of the hearing and shall be final. The decision shall make reference to the time limitation to file a writ to challenge the decision in Sections 1094.5 and 1094.6 of the Code of Civil Procedure. (Ord. No. 2258, § 25, 2013.)


18.112 Tobacco retailing without a permit.

(a)    In addition to any other penalty authorized by law, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines, or the department finds based on a preponderance of evidence, after notice and an opportunity to be heard, that any person has engaged in tobacco retailing at a location without a valid tobacco retailer permit, either directly or through the person’s agents or employees, the person shall be ineligible to apply for, or to be issued, a tobacco retailing permit as follows:

(1)    After a first violation of this section at a location within any sixty-month period, no new permit may issue for the person or the location (unless ownership of the business at the location has been transferred in an arm’s length transaction), until thirty days have passed from the date of the violation.

(2)    After a second violation of this section at a location within any sixty-month period, no new permit may issue for the person or the location (unless ownership of the business at the location has been transferred in an arm’s length transaction), until ninety days have passed from the date of the violation.

(3)    After a third or subsequent violation of this section at a location within any sixty-month period, no new permit may issue for the person or the location (unless ownership of the business at the location has been transferred in an arm’s length transaction), until five years have passed from the date of the violation.

(b)    Tobacco products and tobacco paraphernalia offered for sale or exchange in violation of this section are subject to seizure by the department or any peace officer and shall be forfeited after the permittee and any other owner of the tobacco products and tobacco paraphernalia seized are given reasonable notice and an opportunity to demonstrate that the tobacco products and tobacco paraphernalia were not offered for sale or exchange in violation of this article. The decision by the department may be appealed pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 18.111(c). Forfeited tobacco products and tobacco paraphernalia shall be destroyed after all internal appeals have been exhausted and the time in which to seek judicial review pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.6 or other applicable law has expired without the filing of a writ or, if such a writ is filed, after judgment in that writ becomes final.

(c)    For the purposes of the civil remedies provided in this article, the following shall constitute a separate violation of this article:

(1)    Each day on which any tobacco product or tobacco paraphernalia is offered for sale in violation of this article; or

(2)    Each individual retail tobacco product and each individual retail item of tobacco paraphernalia that is distributed, sold, or offered for sale in violation of this article. (Ord. No. 2258, § 25, 2013.)

In determining the number of owners, officers, and employees engaged in the conduct of the business during the preceding six months, the number of owners, officers and employees in excess of one at the beginning of such period shall be added to those engaged in the business at the end of such period and the sum divided by two.

If the application is for a new, previously unlicensed business, such application or written statement shall estimate the number of individuals proposed to be engaged, employed or used in the conduct of the business, which estimate shall be reconciled in accordance with the facts when the succeeding annual renewal of the license certificate is applied for at which time the license fee shall be adjusted accordingly.

(b)    Such statements or estimates shall not be conclusive upon the city or upon any officer thereof as to the matters set forth therein, and the same shall not prejudice the rights of the city to recover any amount that might be ascertained to be due from such person, in addition to the amount shown by such statement to be due in case such statements are found to be incorrect. The correctness of all such statements shall be subject to the verification by the license collector of the city or properly authorized deputies who are hereby authorized and empowered to inspect and audit the books and records of any and all persons licensed to carry on any trade, business, occupation or calling in this chapter specified; except utilities operating under the jurisdiction of the Public Utilities commission of the state of California.

(c)    If any person fails to file any required statement within the prescribed time, the license collector shall assess the maximum license rate prescribed for the profession, trade, calling or occupation carried on by such person as hereinabove provided by giving written notice of the amount assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in a United States post office, postage prepaid, addressed to the person so assessed, at his or her last known address. Such person may, within ten days after mailing or serving of such notice, make application in writing to the license collector for a hearing, on the amount of the license tax. If such application is not made within the time prescribed, the assessment shall become final.

(d)    The license collector shall not issue to any such person another license for the same or any other business until such person shall have furnished to him or her the written statements and/or paid the license tax as herein required. (Ord. No. 1595, § 1.)

(c)    To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which imposes a tax and provides a measure therefor that can be administered and collected by the State Board of Equalization in a manner that adopts itself as fully as practicable to, and requires the least possible deviation from the existing statutory and administrative procedures followed by the State Board of Equalization in administering and collecting the California State sales and use taxes;

(d)    To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which can be administered in a manner that will, to the degree possible consistent with the provisions of Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting city sales and use taxes and at the same time minimize the burden of record keeping upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this article. (Ord. No. 1641, § 4; Ord. No. 1983, § 68.)


18.67 Contract with state.

Prior to the operative date this city shall contract with the State Board of Equalization to perform all functions incident to the administration and operation of this sales and use tax chapter; provided, that if this city shall not have contracted with the State Board of Equalization prior to the operative date, it shall nevertheless so contract and in such a case the operative date shall be the first day of the first calendar quarter following the execution of such a contract rather than the first day of the first calendar quarter following the adoption of this article (October 3, 1973).

ARTICLE VI. TOBACCO RETAILER PERMIT


18.101 Definitions.

The following words and phrases, whenever used in this article, shall have the meanings defined in this section unless the context clearly requires otherwise:

(a)    “Arm’s length transaction” means a sale in good faith and for valuable consideration that reflects the fair market value in the open market between two informed and willing parties, neither of which is under any compulsion to participate in the transaction. A sale between relatives, related companies or partners, or a sale for which a significant purpose is avoiding the effect of the violations of this article is not an arm’s length transaction.

(b)    “Department” means the finance department and any agency or person designated by the department to enforce or administer the provisions of this article.

(c)    “Person” means any natural person, partnership, cooperative association, corporation, personal representative, receiver, trustee, assignee, or any other legal entity.

(d)    “Proprietor” means a person with an ownership or managerial interest in a business. An ownership interest shall be deemed to exist when a person has a ten percent or greater interest in the stock, assets, or income of a business other than the sole interest of security for debt. A managerial interest shall be deemed to exist when a person can or does have or share ultimate control over the day-to-day operations of a business.

(e)    “Self-service display” means the open display or storage of tobacco products or tobacco paraphernalia in a manner that is physically accessible in any way to the general public without the assistance of the retailer and a direct person-to-person transfer between the purchaser and the retailer. A vending machine is a form of self-service display.

(f)    “Smoking” means possessing a lighted tobacco product, lighted tobacco paraphernalia, or any other lighted weed or plant (including a lighted pipe, cigar, hookah pipe, or cigarette of any kind), and means the lighting of a tobacco product, tobacco paraphernalia, or any other weed or plant (including a pipe, cigar, hookah pipe, or cigarette of any kind).

(g)    “Tobacco product” means any substance containing tobacco leaf, including, but not limited to, cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, hookah tobacco, snuff, chewing tobacco, dipping tobacco, snus, bidis, or any other preparation of tobacco; and any product or formulation of matter containing biologically active amounts of nicotine that is manufactured, sold, offered for sale, or otherwise distributed with the expectation that the product or matter will be introduced into the human body, but does not include any cessation product specifically approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration for use in treating nicotine or tobacco dependence.

(h)    “Tobacco retailer” means any person who sells, offers for sale, or does or offers to exchange for any form of consideration, tobacco, tobacco products or tobacco paraphernalia. “Tobacco retailing” means the doing of any of these things. This definition is without regard to the quantity of tobacco, tobacco products, or tobacco paraphernalia sold, offered for sale, exchanged, or offered for exchange. A tobacco retailer can be a primary or accessory land use (as defined in SPMC 36.700.020 or its successor). (Ord. No. 2258, § 23, 2013.)


18.102 Requirements and prohibitions.

(a)    Tobacco Retailer Permit Required. It is unlawful for any person to act as a tobacco retailer in the city without first obtaining and maintaining a valid tobacco retailer permit (“permit”) pursuant to this article for each location at which that activity is to occur. Tobacco retailing without a valid tobacco retailer permit is a nuisance as a matter of law.

(b)    Lawful Business Operation. In the course of tobacco retailing or in the operation of the business or maintenance of the location for which a permit issued, it shall be a violation of this article for a permittee, or any of the permittee’s agents or employees, to violate any local, state, or federal law applicable to tobacco products or tobacco retailing.

(c)    Display of Permit. Each tobacco retailer permit shall be prominently displayed in a publicly visible location at the permitted location.

(d)    Positive Identification Required. No person engaged in tobacco retailing shall sell or transfer a tobacco product to another person who appears to be under the age of twenty-seven years without first examining the identification of the recipient to confirm that the recipient is at least the minimum age under state law to purchase and possess the tobacco product.

(e)    Minimum Age for Persons Selling Tobacco. No person who is younger than the minimum age established by state law for the purchase or possession of tobacco products shall engage in tobacco retailing.

(f)    Self-Service Displays Prohibited. Tobacco retailing by means of a self-service display is prohibited.

(g)    False and Misleading Advertising Prohibited. A tobacco retailer or proprietor without a valid tobacco retailer permit, including, for example, a person whose permit has been suspended or revoked:

(1)    Shall keep all tobacco products out of public view. The public display of tobacco products or tobacco paraphernalia in violation of this provision shall constitute tobacco retailing without a permit under Section 18.112; and

(2)    Shall not display any advertisement relating to tobacco products or tobacco paraphernalia that promotes the sale or distribution of such products from the tobacco retailer’s location or that could lead a reasonable consumer to believe that such products can be obtained at that location. (Ord. No. 2184, § 2, 2009.)


18.103 Limits on eligibility for a tobacco retailer permit.

(a)    No permit may issue to authorize tobacco retailing at other than a fixed location. For example, tobacco retailing by persons on foot or from vehicles is prohibited.

(b)    No tobacco retailer may be located within five hundred feet of any public school as measured from the closest point on the property line of the parcels containing the retailer’s establishment and the school. Such measurement shall be in a straight line without regard to intervening structures. No existing business within five hundred feet of a public school may begin operation as a tobacco retailer after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section. (Ord. No. 2258, § 23, 2013.)


18.104 Application procedure.

(a)    Application for a tobacco retailer permit shall be submitted in the name of each proprietor proposing to conduct retail tobacco sales and shall be signed by each proprietor or an authorized agent thereof.

(b)    It is the responsibility of each proprietor to be informed regarding all laws applicable to tobacco retailing, including those laws affecting the issuance of a tobacco retailer permit. No proprietor may rely on the issuance of a permit as a determination by the city that the proprietor has complied with all state and federal laws applicable to tobacco retailing. A permit issued contrary to this article, contrary to any other law, or on the basis of false or misleading information supplied by a proprietor shall be revoked pursuant to Section 18.111(d) of this article. Nothing in this article shall be construed to vest in any person obtaining and maintaining a tobacco retailer permit any status or right to act as a tobacco retailer in contravention of any provision of law.

(c)    All applications shall be submitted on a form supplied by the department and shall contain the following information:

(1)    The name, address, and telephone number of each proprietor of the business seeking a permit;

(2)    The business name, address, and telephone number of the single fixed location for which a permit is sought;

(3)    A single name and mailing address authorized by each proprietor to receive all communications and notices (the “authorized address”) required by, authorized by, or convenient to the enforcement of this article. If an authorized address is not supplied, each proprietor shall be understood to consent to the provision of notice at the business address specified in subsection (c)(2);

(4)    Proof that the location for which a tobacco retailer permit is sought has been issued a valid state tobacco retailer permit by the California Board of Equalization;

(5)    Whether or not any proprietor or any agent of the proprietor has admitted violating, or has been found to have violated, this article and, if so, the dates and locations of all such violations within the previous five years;

(6)    A nonrefundable application fee, as set and as may be amended from time to time by city council resolution;

(7)    Such other information as the department deems necessary for the administration or enforcement of this article as specified on the application form required by this section.

(d)    A permitted tobacco retailer shall inform the department in writing of any change in the information submitted on an application for a tobacco retailer permit within ten business days of a change.

(e)    All information specified in an application pursuant to this section shall be subject to disclosure under the California Public Records Act (California Government Code Section 6250 et seq.) or any other applicable law, subject to the laws’ exemptions. (Ord. No. 2258, § 24, 2013.)


18.105 Issuance of permit.

Upon the receipt of a complete application for a tobacco retailer permit and the permit fee required by this article, the department shall issue a permit unless substantial evidence demonstrates that one or more of the following bases for denial exists:

(a)    The information presented in the application is inaccurate or false. Intentionally supplying inaccurate or false information shall be a violation of this article;

(b)    The application seeks authorization for tobacco retailing at a location for which this article prohibits issuance of tobacco retailer permits. However, this subsection shall not constitute a basis for denial of a permit if the applicant provides the city with documentation demonstrating by clear and convincing evidence that the applicant has acquired or is acquiring the location or business in an arm’s length transaction;

(c)    The application seeks authorization for tobacco retailing for a proprietor to whom this article prohibits a permit to be issued;

(d)    The application seeks authorization for tobacco retailing that is prohibited pursuant to this article (e.g., mobile vending), that is unlawful pursuant to this Code including, without limitation the zoning code, building code, and business license tax code, or that is unlawful pursuant to any other law. (Ord. No. 2184, § 2, 2009.)


18.106 Permit renewal and expiration.

(a)    Renewal of Permit. A tobacco retailer permit is invalid if the appropriate fee has not been timely paid in full or if the term of the permit has expired. The term of a tobacco retailer permit is one year. Each tobacco retailer shall apply for the renewal of his or her tobacco retailer permit and submit the permit fee no later than thirty days prior to expiration of the term.

(b)    Expiration of Permit. A tobacco retailer permit that is not timely renewed shall expire at the end of its term. To renew a permit not timely renewed pursuant to subsection (a), the proprietor must:

(1)    Submit the permit fee and application renewal form; and

(2)    Submit a signed affidavit affirming that the proprietor:

(A)    Has not sold and will not sell any tobacco product or tobacco paraphernalia after the permit expiration date and before the permit is renewed, or

(B)    Has waited the appropriate ineligibility period established for tobacco retailing without a permit, as set forth in Section 18.112(a) of this article, before seeking renewal of the permit. (Ord. No. 2258, § 24, 2013.)


18.107 Permits nontransferable.

(a)    A tobacco retailer permit may not be transferred from one person to another or from one location to another. A new tobacco retailer permit is required whenever a tobacco retailing location has a change in proprietorship.

(b)    Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, prior violations at a location shall continue to be counted against a location and permit ineligibility periods shall continue to apply to a location unless:

(1)    The location has been or is being fully transferred to a new proprietor in an arm’s length transaction; and

(2)    The new proprietor provides the city with clear and convincing evidence that the new proprietor has acquired or is acquiring the location in an arm’s length transaction. (Ord. No. 2258, § 24, 2013.)


18.108 Permit conveys a limited, conditional privilege.

Nothing in this article shall be construed to grant any person obtaining and maintaining a tobacco retailer permit any status or right other than the limited conditional privilege to act as a tobacco retailer at the location identified on the face of the permit. For example, nothing in this article shall be construed to render inapplicable, supersede, or apply in lieu of, any other provision of applicable law, including, but not limited to, any provision of this Code including without limitation the zoning code, building codes, and business license tax code, or any condition or limitation on smoking in an enclosed place of employment pursuant to California Labor Code Section 6404.5. For example, obtaining a tobacco retailer permit does not make the retailer a “retail or wholesale tobacco shop” for the purposes of California Labor Code Section 6404.5. (Ord. No. 2258, § 24, 2013.)


18.109 Fee for permit.

The initial fee to issue or to renew a tobacco retailer permit is hereby established at one hundred twenty dollars or as set and amended from time to time by city council resolution. The fee shall be calculated so as to recover the cost of administration and enforcement of this article, including, for example, issuing a permit, administering the permit program, retailer education, retailer inspection and compliance checks, documentation of violations, and prosecution of violators, but shall not exceed the cost of the regulatory program authorized by this article. All fees and interest upon proceeds of fees shall be used exclusively to fund the program. Fees are nonrefundable except as may be required by law. (Ord. No. 2258, § 24, 2013.)


18.110 Compliance monitoring.

(a)    Compliance with this article shall be monitored by the finance department. In addition, any peace officer may enforce the penal provisions of this article. The city may designate any number of additional persons to monitor compliance with this article.

(b)    The department or other person designated to enforce the provisions of this article shall check the compliance of each tobacco retailer at least one time per twelve-month period. The department may check the compliance of new permit and tobacco retailers previously found in violation of the licensing law more frequently. Nothing in this subsection shall create a right of action in any permittee or other person against the city or its agents.

(c)    Compliance checks shall be conducted so as to allow the department to determine, at a minimum, if the tobacco retailer is conducting business in a manner that complies with laws regulating youth access to tobacco. When the department deems appropriate, the compliance checks shall determine compliance with other laws applicable to tobacco retailing.

(d)    The city shall not enforce any law establishing a minimum age for tobacco purchases or possession against a person who otherwise might be in violation of such law because of the person’s age (hereinafter “youth decoy”) if the potential violation occurs when:

(1)    The youth decoy is participating in a compliance check supervised by a peace officer or a code enforcement official of the city of South Pasadena;

(2)    The youth decoy is acting as an agent of a person designated by the city to monitor compliance with this article;

(3)    The youth decoy is participating in a compliance check funded in part, either directly or indirectly through subcontracting, by the Los Angeles County department of health and/or Pasadena health department; or

(4)    The youth decoy has an immunity letter from the district attorney’s office. (Ord. No. 2258, § 25, 2013.)


18.111 Suspension/revocation of permit.

(a)    Suspension of Permit for Violation. In addition to any other penalty authorized by law, a tobacco retailer permit shall be suspended or revoked if any court of competent jurisdiction determines, or the department finds based on a preponderance of the evidence, after the permittee is afforded notice and an opportunity to be heard, that the permit, or any of the permittee’s agents or employees, has violated any of the requirements, conditions, or prohibitions of this article or has pleaded guilty, “no contest” or its equivalent, or admitted to a violation of any law designated in Section 18.102 of this article. A tobacco retailer or proprietor whose permit has been suspended is deemed not to have a valid tobacco retailer permit during the suspension period for purposes of this article.

(b)    Tobacco Retailer Permit Suspension/Revocation.

(1)    After suspension for a first violation of this article at a location within any twelve-month period, no person may engage in tobacco retailing at the location until fifteen days have passed from the date of suspension.

(2)    After suspension for a second violation of this article at a location within any twenty-four-month period, no person may engage in tobacco retailing at the location until thirty days have passed from the date of suspension.

(3)    After suspension for a third violation of this article at a location within any thirty-six-month period, no person may engage in tobacco retailing at the location until ninety days have passed from the date of suspension.

(4)    After revocation for four or more violations of this article at a location within any forty-eight-month period, no new permit may issue for the location until one year has passed from the date of revocation.

(c)    Appeal of Suspension/Revocation. A decision of the department to suspend or revoke a permit is appealable to the city manager and must be filed with the city clerk within ten days of mailing of the department’s decision. If such an appeal is made, it shall stay enforcement of the appealed action. An appeal to the city manager is not available for a suspension or revocation made pursuant to subsection (d) of this section.

(d)    Revocation of Permit Wrongly Issued. A tobacco retailer permit shall be revoked if the department finds, after the permittee is afforded notice and an opportunity to be heard, that one or more of the bases for denial of a permit under Section 18.105 existed at the time application was made or at any time before the permit issued. The decision by the department shall be the final decision of the city. Such a revocation shall be without prejudice to the filing of a new permit application.

(e)    Notice of City Manager Decision. The decision of the city manager (or of the department in the event of revocation pursuant to Section 18.111(d)) shall be mailed to the permittee within five working days of the hearing and shall be final. The decision shall make reference to the time limitation to file a writ to challenge the decision in Sections 1094.5 and 1094.6 of the Code of Civil Procedure. (Ord. No. 2258, § 25, 2013.)


18.112 Tobacco retailing without a permit.

(a)    In addition to any other penalty authorized by law, if a court of competent jurisdiction determines, or the department finds based on a preponderance of evidence, after notice and an opportunity to be heard, that any person has engaged in tobacco retailing at a location without a valid tobacco retailer permit, either directly or through the person’s agents or employees, the person shall be ineligible to apply for, or to be issued, a tobacco retailing permit as follows:

(1)    After a first violation of this section at a location within any sixty-month period, no new permit may issue for the person or the location (unless ownership of the business at the location has been transferred in an arm’s length transaction), until thirty days have passed from the date of the violation.

(2)    After a second violation of this section at a location within any sixty-month period, no new permit may issue for the person or the location (unless ownership of the business at the location has been transferred in an arm’s length transaction), until ninety days have passed from the date of the violation.

(3)    After a third or subsequent violation of this section at a location within any sixty-month period, no new permit may issue for the person or the location (unless ownership of the business at the location has been transferred in an arm’s length transaction), until five years have passed from the date of the violation.

(b)    Tobacco products and tobacco paraphernalia offered for sale or exchange in violation of this section are subject to seizure by the department or any peace officer and shall be forfeited after the permittee and any other owner of the tobacco products and tobacco paraphernalia seized are given reasonable notice and an opportunity to demonstrate that the tobacco products and tobacco paraphernalia were not offered for sale or exchange in violation of this article. The decision by the department may be appealed pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 18.111(c). Forfeited tobacco products and tobacco paraphernalia shall be destroyed after all internal appeals have been exhausted and the time in which to seek judicial review pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.6 or other applicable law has expired without the filing of a writ or, if such a writ is filed, after judgment in that writ becomes final.

(c)    For the purposes of the civil remedies provided in this article, the following shall constitute a separate violation of this article:

(1)    Each day on which any tobacco product or tobacco paraphernalia is offered for sale in violation of this article; or

(2)    Each individual retail tobacco product and each individual retail item of tobacco paraphernalia that is distributed, sold, or offered for sale in violation of this article. (Ord. No. 2258, § 25, 2013.)

ARTICLE 6. GENERAL NOISE REGULATIONS


19A.22 Findings.

In enacting the following Code section, the city council finds and determines that as explicit a demarcation as possible should be drawn between unnecessary and disturbing noises on the one hand and customary and to be tolerated noises on the other; that the dividing line between these two must of necessity be somewhat amorphous depending upon facts and circumstances, and in a sense may involve a balancing of community benefits and burdens; that as urban life increases and congestion occurs, the populace must of necessity endure increased levels of noise, but by the same token, no one should have to endure either denial of reasonable repose and quiet or unnecessary depreciation of property values because of unreasonable noises, and the final test is perhaps not susceptible of rigid definition, but instead may only be circumscribed by applicable circumstances, this in turn, involving a balancing of individual convenience as opposed to community rights. (Ord. No. 1582.)


19A.23 Noise, prohibition of.

(a)    It is unlawful for any person within the city to make, continue or cause to be made or continued, or suffer or permit to be made, or continued, any noise of such loud, unusual, unnecessary, penetrating, raucous or boisterous nature or intensity as to unreasonably disturb, annoy, injure, interfere with, or endanger, the comfort, repose, health, peace, safety or welfare, of a person of normal sensitivity residing in the area.

(b)    The standards which shall be considered and objectively applied in determining whether a violation of this section has occurred or is occurring shall include:

(1)    The volume of the noise;

(2)    The pitch of the noise;

(3)    The intensity of the noise;

(4)    The duration of the noise;

(5)    The frequency of the noise;

(6)    The wave length or octave band of the noise;

(7)    Whether the noise is typical or atypical of the area;

(8)    Whether the origin of the noise is natural or unnatural; controllable or uncontrollable;

(9)    The relation of the intensity of the noise to the background or ambient volume;

(10)    The proximity of the source of the noise to other persons or properties;

(11)    The proximity of the source of the noise to residential facilities;

(12)    The nature and zoning of the area within which the noise emanates and to which it projects;

(13)    The density of the habitation of the area of the noise;

(14)    The time of day or night during which the noise occurs;

(15)    Whether the noise is recurrent, intermittent or constant;

(16)    Whether the noise is produced by commercial or noncommercial activities;

(17)    Whether the noise is artificially or electronically amplified;

(18)    Whether the source of the noise could easily be relocated, muffled or modified without expense or loss of convenience or effect, so as to reduce its intensity with regard to adjoining properties;

(19)    Whether the noise depreciates the values of other properties in the area; and

(20)    Whether the noise is a mere convenience to the person responsible therefor without apparent social value, as opposed to a noise relating to a reasonable use of his property or the exercise of constitutional rights. (Ord. No. 1582.)

In response to a complaint, if a police officer determines at the scene that there is a threat to the public peace, health, safety or general welfare, the officer shall notify the person in charge of the premises and/or the person responsible for the event, or, if either of those persons is a minor, then the parents or guardians of that minor, that if a police officer is called to respond a second time to a disturbance complaint at the premises, the person or persons shall be jointly and severally liable for the cost of providing police personnel on special enforcement over and above the services normally provided by the department. Such costs many include minor damages to city property or injuries to city personnel. The fee assessed against the person or persons for such costs shall be set by resolution. The city reserves its legal options to elect any other legal remedies when the costs exceed limits set by resolution.

The chief of police of the city police department shall prepare regulations for the implementation of this section.

The director of finance shall thereupon bill the person, firm or corporation employing same personnel for the amount paid to each plus the cost of workmen’s compensation charges and other administrative costs. Any failure of the person to make payment shall constitute a debt due solely to the city.

(c)    Administrative Rules and Regulations. The chief of police may adopt administrative rules and regulations for the purpose of implementing the provisions of this section. (Ord. No. 2006, § 1.)


19A.1 Declaration of policy.

19A.16 Purpose.

The council enacts this legislation for the sole purpose of securing and promoting the public health, comfort, safety and welfare for its citizenry.

19A.17 Registration: Required.

It is unlawful for any person, other than personnel of law enforcement or governmental agencies, to install, use or operate within the city a loudspeaker or sound amplifying equipment in a fixed or movable position or mounted upon any sound truck for the purposes of giving instructions, directions, talks, addresses, lectures, or transmitting music to any persons or assemblages of persons in or upon any street, alley, sidewalk, park, place, or public property without first filing a registration statement and obtaining approval thereof as set forth in this article.

ARTICLE 6. GENERAL NOISE REGULATIONS


19A.22 Findings.

In enacting the following Code section, the city council finds and determines that as explicit a demarcation as possible should be drawn between unnecessary and disturbing noises on the one hand and customary and to be tolerated noises on the other; that the dividing line between these two must of necessity be somewhat amorphous depending upon facts and circumstances, and in a sense may involve a balancing of community benefits and burdens; that as urban life increases and congestion occurs, the populace must of necessity endure increased levels of noise, but by the same token, no one should have to endure either denial of reasonable repose and quiet or unnecessary depreciation of property values because of unreasonable noises, and the final test is perhaps not susceptible of rigid definition, but instead may only be circumscribed by applicable circumstances, this in turn, involving a balancing of individual convenience as opposed to community rights. (Ord. No. 1582.)


19A.23 Noise, prohibition of.

(a)    It is unlawful for any person within the city to make, continue or cause to be made or continued, or suffer or permit to be made, or continued, any noise of such loud, unusual, unnecessary, penetrating, raucous or boisterous nature or intensity as to unreasonably disturb, annoy, injure, interfere with, or endanger, the comfort, repose, health, peace, safety or welfare, of a person of normal sensitivity residing in the area.

(b)    The standards which shall be considered and objectively applied in determining whether a violation of this section has occurred or is occurring shall include:

(1)    The volume of the noise;

(2)    The pitch of the noise;

(3)    The intensity of the noise;

(4)    The duration of the noise;

(5)    The frequency of the noise;

(6)    The wave length or octave band of the noise;

(7)    Whether the noise is typical or atypical of the area;

(8)    Whether the origin of the noise is natural or unnatural; controllable or uncontrollable;

(9)    The relation of the intensity of the noise to the background or ambient volume;

(10)    The proximity of the source of the noise to other persons or properties;

(11)    The proximity of the source of the noise to residential facilities;

(12)    The nature and zoning of the area within which the noise emanates and to which it projects;

(13)    The density of the habitation of the area of the noise;

(14)    The time of day or night during which the noise occurs;

(15)    Whether the noise is recurrent, intermittent or constant;

(16)    Whether the noise is produced by commercial or noncommercial activities;

(17)    Whether the noise is artificially or electronically amplified;

(18)    Whether the source of the noise could easily be relocated, muffled or modified without expense or loss of convenience or effect, so as to reduce its intensity with regard to adjoining properties;

(19)    Whether the noise depreciates the values of other properties in the area; and

(20)    Whether the noise is a mere convenience to the person responsible therefor without apparent social value, as opposed to a noise relating to a reasonable use of his property or the exercise of constitutional rights. (Ord. No. 1582.)


19A.24 Railroad crossings.

On or after December 1, 1976, it is unlawful and a public nuisance for any railroad to operate a train through or across a public street unless protected by flashing lights and automatic safety gates, or separated by over or underpass. (Ord. No. 1713, § 2; Ord. No. 2121, § 2; Ord. No. 2134, § 1.)


19A.25 Repealed by Ordinance No. 2134.


19A.25B Repealed by Ordinance No. 2134.


19A.26 Loud party.

It is unlawful for any person or persons to make or continue or cause to be made or continued any unnecessary, loud or unusual noise which injures the peace, quiet, comfort or repose or endangers the health and safety of any reasonable person of normal sensitivity residing in the area due to a party or gathering at a premises.

(a)    Disturbance Violation Service Fee. In response to a complaint, if a police officer determines at the scene that there is a threat to the public peace, health, safety or general welfare, the officer shall notify the person in charge of the premises and/or the person responsible for the event, or, if either of those persons is a minor, then the parents or guardians of that minor, that if a police officer is called to respond a second time to a disturbance complaint at the premises, the person or persons shall be jointly and severally liable for the cost of providing police personnel on special enforcement over and above the services normally provided by the department. Such costs many include minor damages to city property or injuries to city personnel. The fee assessed against the person or persons for such costs shall be set by resolution. The city reserves its legal options to elect any other legal remedies when the costs exceed limits set by resolution.

The chief of police of the city police department shall prepare regulations for the implementation of this section.

(b)    Accounting and Billing. When the person(s) responsible for the event are in fact served with a notice that they will be billed for the police service on the second response, a copy of the report and copies of the first and second notice forms shall be forwarded to the chief of police or other division head, as may be the case, for review. The chief of police, or other division head, will ensure that appropriate billing occurs.

Any and all personnel who may be deployed by the city pursuant to this section shall be deemed to be on special enforcement assignment as employees of the city, except that the rate of pay for such special security assignment shall be set forth herein. The pay for each employee thus deployed shall be at the rate of one and one-half times the base salary of the employee. The chief of police, or other division head, as the case may be, shall report to the director of finance the name of the person, firm, organization or corporation requiring such personnel, the names of the employees so employed and the number of hours of employment. The director of finance shall thereupon bill the person, firm or corporation employing same personnel for the amount paid to each plus the cost of workmen’s compensation charges and other administrative costs. Any failure of the person to make payment shall constitute a debt due solely to the city.

(c)    Administrative Rules and Regulations. The chief of police may adopt administrative rules and regulations for the purpose of implementing the provisions of this section. (Ord. No. 2006, § 1.)

23.2 Statutory authority.

The provisions of this chapter are adopted pursuant to the Federal Water Pollution Control Act, also known as the Clean Water Act, as amended, 33 U.S.C. Section 1251 et seq. (Ord. No. 2107, § 1; Ord. No. 2256, § 1, 2013.)


23.3 Purpose and intent.

The purpose of this chapter is to protect and improve water quality of receiving waters by:

(a)    Reducing illicit discharges to the municipal storm water system to the maximum extent practicable.

(b)    Eliminating illicit connections to the municipal storm water system.

(c)    Eliminating spillage, dumping, and disposal of pollutant materials into the municipal storm water system.

(d)    Reducing pollutant loads in storm water and urban runoff from land uses and activities identified in the municipal NPDES permit.

(e)    Reducing the contribution of pollutants from the MS4 through interagency coordination.

The intent of this chapter is to enhance and protect the water quality of the receiving waters of the United States in a manner that is consistent with the Clean Water Act and acts amendatory thereof or supplementary thereto; applicable implementing regulations, the municipal NPDES permit and any amendment, revision, or reissuance thereof. (Ord. No. 2107, § 1; Ord. No. 2256, § 1, 2013.)


23.4 Definitions.

For the purpose of the provisions of this chapter concerning water quality hereinafter set forth, the following words and phrases shall be construed to have the meanings set forth unless it is apparent from the context that a different meaning is intended.

(a)    “Automotive service facility” means a facility that is categorized in any one of the following Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes. For inspection purposes, permittees need not inspect facilities with SIC codes 5013, 5014, 5541, 5511, provided that these facilities have no outside activities or materials that may be exposed to stormwater (Source: Order No. R4-2012-0175).

(b)    “Basin plan” means the Water Quality Control Plan, Los Angeles Region, Basin Plan for the Coastal Watersheds of Los Angeles and Ventura Counties, adopted by the Regional Water Board on June 13, 1994 and subsequent amendments (Source: Order No. R4-2012-0175).

(c)    “Best management practice” or “BMP” means practices or physical devices or systems designed to prevent or reduce pollutant loading from stormwater or non-stormwater discharges to receiving waters, or designed to reduce the volume of stormwater or non-stormwater discharged to the receiving water (Source: Order No. R4-2012-0175).

(d)    “Biofiltration” means a LID BMP that reduces stormwater pollutant discharges by intercepting rainfall on vegetative canopy, and through incidental infiltration and/or evapotranspiration, and filtration. Incidental infiltration is an important factor in achieving the required pollutant load reduction. Therefore, the term “biofiltration” as used in this chapter is defined to include only systems designed to facilitate incidental infiltration or achieve the equivalent pollutant reduction as biofiltration BMPs with an underdrain (subject to approval by the Regional Board’s Executive Officer). Biofiltration BMPs include bioretention systems with an underdrain and bioswales (Modified from: Order No. R4-2012-0175).

(e)    “Bioretention” means a LID BMP that reduces stormwater runoff by intercepting rainfall on vegetative canopy, and through evapotranspiration and infiltration. The bioretention system typically includes a minimum two-foot top layer of a specified soil and compost mixture underlain by a gravel-filled temporary storage pit dug into the in-situ soil. As defined in the municipal NPDES permit, a bioretention BMP may be designed with an overflow drain, but may not include an underdrain. When a bioretention BMP is designed or constructed with an underdrain it is regulated by the municipal NPDES permit as biofiltration (Modified from: Order No. R4-2012-0175).

(f)    “Bioswale” means a LID BMP consisting of a shallow channel lined with grass or other dense, low-growing vegetation. Bioswales are designed to collect stormwater runoff and to achieve a uniform sheet flow through the dense vegetation for a period of several minutes (Source: Order No. R4-2012-0175).

(g)    “City” means the city of South Pasadena.

(h)    “Clean Water Act” or “CWA” means the Federal Water Pollution Control Act enacted in 1972, by Public Law 92-500, and amended by the Water Quality Act of 1987. The Clean Water Act prohibits the discharge of pollutants to waters of the United States unless the discharge is in accordance with an NPDES permit.

(i)    “Commercial malls” means any development on private land comprised of one or more buildings forming a complex of stores which sells various merchandise, with interconnecting walkways enabling visitors to easily walk from store to store, along with parking area(s). A commercial mall includes, but is not limited to: mini-malls, strip malls, other retail complexes, and enclosed shopping malls or shopping centers (Source: Order No. R4-2012-0175).

(j)    “Construction activity” means any construction or demolition activity, clearing, grading, grubbing, or excavation or any other activity that result in land disturbance. Construction does not include emergency construction activities required to immediately protect public health and safety or routine maintenance activities required to maintain the integrity of structures by performing minor repair and restoration work, maintain the original line and grade, hydraulic capacity, or original purposes of the facility. See “Routine maintenance” definition for further explanation. Where clearing, grading or excavating of underlying soil takes place during a repaving operation, State General Construction Permit coverage by the state of California General Permit for Storm Water Discharges Associated with Industrial Activities or for Stormwater Discharges Associated with Construction Activities is required if more than one acre is disturbed or the activities are part of a larger plan (Source: Order No. R4-2012-0175).

(k)    “Control” means to minimize, reduce or eliminate by technological, legal, contractual, or other means, the discharge of pollutants from an activity or activities (Source: Order No. R4-2012-0175).

(l)    “Development” means construction, rehabilitation, redevelopment or reconstruction of any public or private residential project (whether single-family, multi-unit or planned unit development); industrial, commercial, retail, and other non-residential projects, including public agency projects; or mass grading for future construction. It does not include routine maintenance to maintain original line and grade, hydraulic capacity, or original purpose of facility, nor does it include emergency construction activities required to immediately protect public health and safety (Source: Order No. R4-2012-0175).

(m)    “Directly adjacent” means situated within two hundred feet of the contiguous zone required for the continued maintenance, function, and structural stability of the environmentally sensitive area (Source: Order No. R4-2012-0175).

(n)    “Discharge” means any release, spill, leak, pump, flow, escape, dumping, or disposal of any liquid, semi-solid, or solid substance.

(o)    “Disturbed area” means an area that is altered as a result of clearing, grading, and/or excavation (Source: Order No. R4-2012-0175).

(p)    “Flow-through BMPs” means modular, vault type “high flow biotreatment” devices contained within an impervious vault with an underdrain or designed with an impervious liner and an underdrain (Modified from: Order No. R4-2012-0175).

(q)    “General Construction Activities Storm Water Permit” or “GCASP” means the general NPDES permit adopted by the State Board which authorizes the discharge of stormwater from construction activities under certain conditions.

(r)    “General Industrial Activities Storm Water Permit” or “GIASP” means the general NPDES permit adopted by the State Board which authorizes the discharge of stormwater from certain industrial activities under certain conditions.

23.14 Stormwater pollution control measures for development planning and planning and construction activities.

(a)    Objective. The provisions of this section contain requirements for construction activities and facility operations of development and redevelopment projects to comply with the current “municipal NPDES permit,” lessen the water quality impacts of development by using smart growth practices, and integrate LID design principles to mimic predevelopment hydrology through infiltration, evapotranspiration and rainfall harvest and use. LID shall be inclusive of SUSMP requirements.

(b)    Scope. This section contains requirements for stormwater pollution control measures in development and redevelopment projects and authorizes the city of South Pasadena to further define and adopt stormwater pollution control measures, develop LID principles and requirements, including, but not limited to, the objectives and specifications for integration of LID strategies, and collect funds for projects. Except as otherwise provided herein, the city of South Pasadena shall administer, implement and enforce the provisions of this section.

(c)    Applicability. The following development and redevelopment projects, termed “stormwater mitigation required projects,” shall comply with the requirements of this section.

(1)    All development projects equal to one acre or greater of disturbed area that adds more than ten thousand square feet of impervious surface area.

(2)    Industrial parks ten thousand square feet or more of surface area.

(3)    Commercial malls ten thousand square feet or more of surface area.

(9)    Projects located in or directly adjacent to, or discharging directly to an environmentally sensitive area (ESA), where the development will:

(A)    Discharge stormwater runoff that is likely to impact a sensitive biological species or habitat; and

(B)    Create two thousand five hundred square feet or more of impervious surface area.

(10)    Single-family hillside homes.

(11)    Development of any project of two thousand five hundred square feet or more in disturbed area where any portion of the disturbed area includes either or both an existing earth (native or otherwise) surface or a man-made surface (whether impervious or not) with an existing slope that is equal to or greater than twenty-five percent when calculated in accordance with the methods prescribed by the current Zoning Code.

(12)    Redevelopment projects involving any of the following:

(A)    Land disturbing activities that result in the creation or addition or replacement of five thousand square feet or more of impervious surface area on an already developed site that is within the scope of paragraph (C) of Section III C.

(B)    Alteration of more than fifty percent of the total impervious surface of a previously existing development, where the existing development was not subject to the post-construction stormwater quality control requirements of the current city building code.

(C)    Where redevelopment results in an alteration of less than fifty percent of the impervious surfaces of a previously existing development, and the existing development was not subject to post-construction stormwater quality control requirements of the current city building code, then only the alteration must be mitigated, and not the entire development, except that such mitigation specifically includes all drainage flow paths that lead from the disturbed area to the permitted stormwater disposal location where such location is off-site of the specific project.

ii.    The volume of runoff produced from a three-fourths-inch, twenty-four-hour rain event, whichever is greater.

(B)    Minimize hydromodification impacts to natural drainage systems as defined in the municipal NPDES permit.

(C)    When, as determined by the planning and building department, one hundred percent on-site retention of the SWQDv is technically infeasible, the infeasibility shall be demonstrated in the submitted LID plan. The technical infeasibility may result from conditions that may include, but are not limited to:

i.    The infiltration rate of saturated in-situ soils is less than three tenths of an inch per hour and it is not technically feasible to amend the in-situ soils to attain an infiltration rate necessary to achieve reliable performance of infiltration or bioretention BMPs in retaining the SWQDv on-site;

ii.    Locations where seasonal high groundwater is within five to ten feet of surface grade;

iii.    Locations within one hundred feet of a groundwater well used for drinking water;

iv.    Brownfield development sites or other locations where pollutant mobilization is a documented concern;

v.    Locations with potential geotechnical hazards;

vi.    Smart growth and infill or redevelopment locations where the density and/or nature of the project would create significant difficulty for compliance with the on-site volume retention requirement.

(D)    If partial or complete on-site retention is technically infeasible, the project site may biofiltrate one and one-half times the portion of the remaining SWQDv that is not reliably retained on-site. Biofiltration BMPs must adhere to the design specifications provided in the municipal NPDES permit.

i.    Additional alternative compliance options such as off-site infiltration may be available to the project site. The project site should contact the planning and building department to determine eligibility.

(E)    The remaining SWQDv that cannot be retained or biofiltered on-site must be treated on-site to reduce pollutant loading. BMPs must be selected and designed to meet pollutant-specific benchmarks as required per the municipal NPDES permit. Flow-through BMPs may be used to treat the remaining SWQDv and must be sized based on a rainfall intensity of:

i.    Two-tenths of an inch per hour; or

ii.    The one-year, one-hour rainfall intensity as determined from the most recent Los Angeles County isohyetal map, whichever is greater.

(F)    A multi-phased project may comply with the standards and requirements of this section for all of its phases by: (a) designing a system acceptable to the city of South Pasadena to satisfy these standards and requirements for the entire site during the first phase; and (b) implementing these standards and requirements for each phase of development or redevelopment of the site during the first phase or prior to commencement of construction of a later phase, to the extent necessary to treat the stormwater from such later phase. For purposes of this section, “multi-phased project” shall mean any stormwater mitigation required project implemented over more than one phase and the site of a multi-phased project shall include any land and water area designed and used to store, treat or manage stormwater runoff in connection with the development or redevelopment, including any tracts, lots, or parcels of real property, whether developed or not, associated with, functionally connected to, or under common ownership or control with such development or redevelopment.

(e)    Other Agencies of the City of South Pasadena. All city of South Pasadena departments, offices, entities and agencies, shall establish administrative procedures necessary to implement the provisions of this chapter on their development and redevelopment projects and report their activities annually to the public works department.

(f)    Validity. If any provision of this section is found to be unconstitutional or otherwise invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity shall not affect remaining provisions of this section are declared to be severable. (Ord. No. 2107, § 2; Ord. No. 2256, § 2, 2013; Ord. No. 2283, § 4, 2015.)

23.4 Definitions.

For the purpose of the provisions of this chapter concerning water quality hereinafter set forth, the following words and phrases shall be construed to have the meanings set forth unless it is apparent from the context that a different meaning is intended.

(a)    “Automotive service facility” means a facility that is categorized in any one of the following Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) and North American Industry Classification System (NAICS) codes. For inspection purposes, permittees need not inspect facilities with SIC codes 5013, 5014, 5541, 5511, provided that these facilities have no outside activities or materials that may be exposed to stormwater (Source: Order No. R4-2012-0175).

(b)    “Basin plan” means the Water Quality Control Plan, Los Angeles Region, Basin Plan for the Coastal Watersheds of Los Angeles and Ventura Counties, adopted by the Regional Water Board on June 13, 1994 and subsequent amendments (Source: Order No. R4-2012-0175).

(c)    “Best management practice” or “BMP” means practices or physical devices or systems designed to prevent or reduce pollutant loading from stormwater or non-stormwater discharges to receiving waters, or designed to reduce the volume of stormwater or non-stormwater discharged to the receiving water (Source: Order No. R4-2012-0175).

(d)    “Biofiltration” means a LID BMP that reduces stormwater pollutant discharges by intercepting rainfall on vegetative canopy, and through incidental infiltration and/or evapotranspiration, and filtration. Incidental infiltration is an important factor in achieving the required pollutant load reduction. Therefore, the term “biofiltration” as used in this chapter is defined to include only systems designed to facilitate incidental infiltration or achieve the equivalent pollutant reduction as biofiltration BMPs with an underdrain (subject to approval by the Regional Board’s Executive Officer). Biofiltration BMPs include bioretention systems with an underdrain and bioswales (Modified from: Order No. R4-2012-0175).

(e)    “Bioretention” means a LID BMP that reduces stormwater runoff by intercepting rainfall on vegetative canopy, and through evapotranspiration and infiltration. The bioretention system typically includes a minimum two-foot top layer of a specified soil and compost mixture underlain by a gravel-filled temporary storage pit dug into the in-situ soil. As defined in the municipal NPDES permit, a bioretention BMP may be designed with an overflow drain, but may not include an underdrain. When a bioretention BMP is designed or constructed with an underdrain it is regulated by the municipal NPDES permit as biofiltration (Modified from: Order No. R4-2012-0175).

(f)    “Bioswale” means a LID BMP consisting of a shallow channel lined with grass or other dense, low-growing vegetation. Bioswales are designed to collect stormwater runoff and to achieve a uniform sheet flow through the dense vegetation for a period of several minutes (Source: Order No. R4-2012-0175).

(g)    “City” means the city of South Pasadena.

(h)    “Clean Water Act” or “CWA” means the Federal Water Pollution Control Act enacted in 1972, by Public Law 92-500, and amended by the Water Quality Act of 1987.

(a)    Objective. The provisions of this section contain requirements for construction activities and facility operations of development and redevelopment projects to comply with the current “municipal NPDES permit,” lessen the water quality impacts of development by using smart growth practices, and integrate LID design principles to mimic predevelopment hydrology through infiltration, evapotranspiration and rainfall harvest and use. LID shall be inclusive of SUSMP requirements.

(b)    Scope. This section contains requirements for stormwater pollution control measures in development and redevelopment projects and authorizes the city of South Pasadena to further define and adopt stormwater pollution control measures, develop LID principles and requirements, including, but not limited to, the objectives and specifications for integration of LID strategies, and collect funds for projects. Except as otherwise provided herein, the city of South Pasadena shall administer, implement and enforce the provisions of this section.

(c)    Applicability. The following development and redevelopment projects, termed “stormwater mitigation required projects,” shall comply with the requirements of this section.

(1)    All development projects equal to one acre or greater of disturbed area that adds more than ten thousand square feet of impervious surface area.

(2)    Industrial parks ten thousand square feet or more of surface area.

(3)    Commercial malls ten thousand square feet or more of surface area.

(4)    Retail gasoline outlets with five thousand square feet or more of surface area.

(5)    Restaurants (Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) of 5812) with five thousand square feet or more of surface area.

(9)    Projects located in or directly adjacent to, or discharging directly to an environmentally sensitive area (ESA), where the development will:

(A)    Discharge stormwater runoff that is likely to impact a sensitive biological species or habitat; and

(B)    Create two thousand five hundred square feet or more of impervious surface area.

(10)    Single-family hillside homes.

(11)    Development of any project of two thousand five hundred square feet or more in disturbed area where any portion of the disturbed area includes either or both an existing earth (native or otherwise) surface or a man-made surface (whether impervious or not) with an existing slope that is equal to or greater than twenty-five percent when calculated in accordance with the methods prescribed by the current Zoning Code.

(12)    Redevelopment projects involving any of the following:

(A)    Land disturbing activities that result in the creation or addition or replacement of five thousand square feet or more of impervious surface area on an already developed site that is within the scope of paragraph (C) of Section III C.

(B)    Alteration of more than fifty percent of the total impervious surface of a previously existing development, where the existing development was not subject to the post-construction stormwater quality control requirements of the current city building code.

(C)    Where redevelopment results in an alteration of less than fifty percent of the impervious surfaces of a previously existing development, and the existing development was not subject to post-construction stormwater quality control requirements of the current city building code, then only the alteration must be mitigated, and not the entire development, except that such mitigation specifically includes all drainage flow paths that lead from the disturbed area to the permitted stormwater disposal location where such location is off-site of the specific project.

The site for every stormwater mitigation required project shall be designed to control pollutants, pollutant loads, and runoff volume to the maximum extent feasible by minimizing impervious surface area and controlling runoff from impervious surfaces through infiltration, evapotranspiration, bioretention and/or rainfall harvest and use.

(1)    All stormwater mitigation required projects shall include mitigation measures to:

(A)    Conserve natural areas;

(B)    Protect slopes and channels;

(C)    Provide storm drain system stenciling and signage;

(D)    Divert roof runoff to vegetated areas before discharge unless the diversion would result in slope instability; and

(E)    Direct surface flow to vegetated areas before discharge, unless the diversion would result in slope instability.

(2)    Street and road construction of ten thousand square feet or more of impervious surface meeting the criteria of the city’s Green Streets Policy shall follow USEPA guidance regarding Managing Wet Weather with Green Infrastructure: Green Streets (December 2008 EPA-833-F-08-009) to the maximum extent practicable.

(3)    The remainder of stormwater mitigation required projects shall prepare a LID plan to comply with the following:

(A)    Retain stormwater runoff on-site for the stormwater quality design volume (SWQDv) defined as the runoff from:

i.    The 85th percentile twenty-four-hour runoff event as determined from the Los Angeles County 85th percentile precipitation isohyetal map; or

ii.    The volume of runoff produced from a three-fourths-inch, twenty-four-hour rain event, whichever is greater.

(B)    Minimize hydromodification impacts to natural drainage systems as defined in the municipal NPDES permit.

(C)    When, as determined by the planning and building department, one hundred percent on-site retention of the SWQDv is technically infeasible, the infeasibility shall be demonstrated in the submitted LID plan. The technical infeasibility may result from conditions that may include, but are not limited to:

i.    The infiltration rate of saturated in-situ soils is less than three tenths of an inch per hour and it is not technically feasible to amend the in-situ soils to attain an infiltration rate necessary to achieve reliable performance of infiltration or bioretention BMPs in retaining the SWQDv on-site;

ii.    Locations where seasonal high groundwater is within five to ten feet of surface grade;

iii.    Locations within one hundred feet of a groundwater well used for drinking water;

iv.    Brownfield development sites or other locations where pollutant mobilization is a documented concern;

v.    Locations with potential geotechnical hazards;

vi.    Smart growth and infill or redevelopment locations where the density and/or nature of the project would create significant difficulty for compliance with the on-site volume retention requirement.

(D)    If partial or complete on-site retention is technically infeasible, the project site may biofiltrate one and one-half times the portion of the remaining SWQDv that is not reliably retained on-site. Biofiltration BMPs must adhere to the design specifications provided in the municipal NPDES permit.

i.    Additional alternative compliance options such as off-site infiltration may be available to the project site. The project site should contact the planning and building department to determine eligibility.

(E)    The remaining SWQDv that cannot be retained or biofiltered on-site must be treated on-site to reduce pollutant loading. BMPs must be selected and designed to meet pollutant-specific benchmarks as required per the municipal NPDES permit. Flow-through BMPs may be used to treat the remaining SWQDv and must be sized based on a rainfall intensity of:

i.    Two-tenths of an inch per hour; or

ii.    The one-year, one-hour rainfall intensity as determined from the most recent Los Angeles County isohyetal map, whichever is greater.

(F)    A multi-phased project may comply with the standards and requirements of this section for all of its phases by: (a) designing a system acceptable to the city of South Pasadena to satisfy these standards and requirements for the entire site during the first phase; and (b) implementing these standards and requirements for each phase of development or redevelopment of the site during the first phase or prior to commencement of construction of a later phase, to the extent necessary to treat the stormwater from such later phase. For purposes of this section, “multi-phased project” shall mean any stormwater mitigation required project implemented over more than one phase and the site of a multi-phased project shall include any land and water area designed and used to store, treat or manage stormwater runoff in connection with the development or redevelopment, including any tracts, lots, or parcels of real property, whether developed or not, associated with, functionally connected to, or under common ownership or control with such development or redevelopment.

(e)    Other Agencies of the City of South Pasadena. All city of South Pasadena departments, offices, entities and agencies, shall establish administrative procedures necessary to implement the provisions of this chapter on their development and redevelopment projects and report their activities annually to the public works department.

(f)    Validity. If any provision of this section is found to be unconstitutional or otherwise invalid by any court of competent jurisdiction, such invalidity shall not affect remaining provisions of this section are declared to be severable. (Ord. No. 2107, § 2; Ord. No. 2256, § 2, 2013; Ord. No. 2283, § 4, 2015.)

ARTICLE III. INSPECTION AND ENFORCEMENT


23.15 Authority to inspect.

The public works director, and representatives and designees thereof, are hereby authorized and directed to enforce all provisions of this chapter. (Ord. No. 2032, § 1.)


23.16 Right of entry.

Whenever necessary to make an inspection to enforce any of the provisions of this chapter, or whenever an authorized enforcement officer has reasonable cause to believe that there exists in any building or upon any premises any condition which constitutes a violation of the provision of this chapter, the officer may enter such building or premises at all reasonable times to inspect the same or perform any duty imposed upon the officer by this chapter, provided that:

(1)    If such building or premises be occupied, he or she shall first present proper credentials and request entry; and

(2)    If such building or premises be unoccupied, he or she shall first make reasonable effort to locate the owner or other persons having charge or control of the building or premises and request entry.

(3)    Any such request for entry shall state that the property owner or occupant has the right to refuse entry and that in the event such entry is refused, inspection may be made only upon issuance of an inspection warrant.

In the event the owner and/or occupant refuses entry after such request has been made, the officer is hereby empowered to seek assistance from any court of competent jurisdiction in obtaining such entry. (Ord. No. 2032, § 1.)


23.17 Authority to conduct samplings and establishing sampling devices.

With the consent of the owner or occupant or pursuant to an inspection warrant, any authorized enforcement officer may establish on any property such devices as necessary to conduct sampling and monitoring activities necessary to determining the concentrations of pollutants in stormwater and/or non-stormwater runoff. During all inspections as provided herein, the authorized enforcement officer may take any samples deemed necessary. (Ord. No. 2032, § 1.)


23.18 Requirement to sample or monitor.

(a)    Any authorized enforcement officer may order that any person engaged in any activity and/or owning or operating any facility which may cause or contribute to stormwater pollution or contamination, illicit discharges, and/or discharge of non-stormwater to the municipal stormwater system, undertake such monitoring activities and/or analyses and furnish such reports as the officer may specify.

(b)    All costs incurred for such activity shall be borne by the party ordered to do the sampling. In the event the owner or operator of a facility subject to a monitoring and/or analyses order fails to conduct required monitoring and/or analyses and furnish the required reports in the form required, the authorized enforcement officer may cause such monitoring and/or analyses and the cost, therefore, including the reasonable additional administrative costs incurred by the city shall be borne by the owner of the property and the cost thereof shall be invoiced to the owner of the property.

(c)    If the invoice is not paid within sixty days of the issuance thereof, the costs shall be a lien upon and against the property and continue in existence until the same shall be paid. If the lien is not satisfied by the owner of the property within three months after the completion by an authorized enforcement officer of the required monitoring and/or analyses and reports, the property may be sold in satisfaction thereof in a like manner as other real property is sold under execution. (Ord. No. 2032, § 1.)


23.19 Facility inspections.

Every restaurant, gas station, automobile repair facility, nursery, lumber yard, car wash, warehouse, grocery store, repair shop, dry cleaning facility, and laundromat for which a license or permit has been issued by the city shall be subject to periodic inspection by a representative or designee of the public works director. Inspections shall be conducted as often as necessary to insure compliance with this chapter as the public works director deems appropriate. (Ord. No. 2032, § 1.)

(Ord. No. 2273, § 2, 2014; Ord. No. 2312, § 2, 2017.)


24.03 Abatement by demolition, rehabilitation, repair, removal or closure.

All or any part of a premises found, as provided herein, to constitute a public nuisance shall be abated by demolition, rehabilitation, repair, or closure, in compliance with the procedures identified in this chapter. The identified procedures shall not, in any manner, limit or restrict the city from enforcing city ordinances or abating public nuisances in any other manner provided by law. (Ord. No. 2273, § 3, 2014.)


24.04 Declaration of nuisance.

(a)    Determination of Public Nuisance. Whenever a city enforcement officer, building official, health officer or such other city official as may be designated by the city manager determines that any premises within the city may be maintained contrary to one or more of the provisions of SPMC 24.02 (Nuisances and property maintenance), the officer shall give a written notice declaring such property a public nuisance and order to abate the nuisance to the owner of record as shown on the last equalized assessment roll and also any other owner or responsible person known to the officer.

(b)    Contents of Notice of Abatement. The written notice to abate shall describe the premises involved by street address, referring to the street by the name under which it is officially or commonly known, shall further describe the property by giving the block, lot, and tract number, shall give a brief description of the conditions contrary to the provision of SPMC 24.02 (Nuisances and property maintenance), and a brief statement of the required method of abatement, specifying a reasonable period within which this must be accomplished; describe the process to contest the officer’s determination by requesting a hearing; notify the responsible persons that failure to request a hearing will constitute a waiver of the right to a hearing and an admission that the public nuisance does exist and that the abatement order is reasonable and justified; and notify the responsible persons that, in the event of the owner’s failure to correct the nuisance within the time prescribed, the city may cause the nuisance to be abated and the cost incurred on behalf of the city to become a lien on the property, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. The notice and order to abate may be served as a part of or in conjunction with an administrative citation. (Ord. No. 2115, § 1; Ord. No. 2331, § 1 (part), 2019.)


24.05 Service of notice of abatement.

The notice and order to abate shall be served in the manner described in SPMC 1A.16 for service of administrative citations and conspicuously posted on the property containing a nuisance. (Ord. No. 2273, § 4, 2014; Ord. No. 2331, § 1 (part), 2019.)


24.06 Request for hearing.

Any interested person may contest the officer’s determination that a public nuisance exists or the reasonableness of the abatement order by filing a request for an administrative hearing on a city-approved form with the Office of the City Clerk, 14114 Mission Street, South Pasadena, CA 91030, within 15 calendar days from the issuance date of the notice and order to abate. Any responsible person who does not file a request for a hearing in the office of the city clerk within the required period will have waived the right to a hearing and admitted that the public nuisance described in the notice and order to abate does exist and that the abatement order is reasonable and justified. In that event the order to abate issued by the enforcement officer is final. (Ord No. 2115, § 1; Ord. No. 2331, §1 (part), 2019.)


24.07 Request for hearing form.

A request for a hearing shall state the date and number of the notice and order to abate, the address or location of the property, the name, address, telephone and any facsimile numbers, where the person requesting the hearing may be contacted, a statement explaining why the notice and order to abate is being contested and the date and signature of the person requesting the hearing. (Ord. No. 2115, § 1; Ord. No. 2331, §1 (part), 2019.)


24.08 Hearing.

The hearing will be conducted within 60 days of the date a timely and complete request is received by the office of the city clerk. The city will notify the persons requesting the hearing in writing by first class mail of the date, time and place set for the hearing at least 10 calendar days prior to the date of the hearing. Service of this notice is deemed complete at time of mailing. The failure to receive a properly addressed notice of hearing shall not invalidate any hearing, city action or proceeding conducted pursuant to this chapter. (Ord. No. 2273, § 5, 2014; Ord. No. 2331, §1 (part), 2019.)


24.09 Exchange of information.

At least three calendar days prior to the date set for hearing, the officer and the persons requesting the hearing shall mail a copy of all reports, statements or pictures to be provided to the hearing officer, to the other (by the officer to each person requesting the hearing and by each person requesting the hearing to the city clerk), by first class mail. Failure to receive such documents shall not invalidate any hearing, city action or proceeding conducted pursuant to this chapter. (Ord. No. 2273, § 6, 2014; Ord. No. 2331, §1 (part), 2019.)


24.10 Administrative hearing—Procedures.

(b)    The person requesting a hearing may appear at the hearing in person or by written declaration executed under penalty of perjury. Said declaration and any documents in support thereof shall be tendered to and received by the office of the city clerk at least three city business days prior to the hearing. If such person fails to attend the scheduled hearing, and does not submit a written declaration in a timely manner, he or she shall be deemed to have waived the right to a hearing. In such an instance, the hearing officer shall issue an abatement order and judgment in favor of the city.

(c)    At the hearing, the hearing officer shall accept reliable evidence from any person if such evidence bears on the issue of whether a public nuisance exists on the subject property. The hearing officer is authorized to take testimony and is authorized to administer oaths or affirmations pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure Section 2093(a).

(d)    Administrative hearings are informal and formal rules of evidence and discovery do not apply. The city bears the burden of proof to establish, by competent evidence, the existence of a public nuisance and responsibility therefor, by a preponderance of evidence. The person requesting the hearing and officer shall have an opportunity to present evidence and witnesses and to cross-examine witnesses. A person requesting the hearing may bring an interpreter to the hearing, provided there is no expense to the city therefor. The hearing officer may question any person who presents evidence or who testifies at any hearing.

(e)    Hearings may be continued once at the request of a person requesting the hearing or the officer who issued the citation. The hearing officer may also continue the hearing for cause. (Ord. No. 2273, § 7, 2014; Ord. No. 2331, §1 (part), 2019.)


24.11 Hearing decision.

Based upon the evidence regarding the alleged nuisance, the hearing officer shall determine whether or not a public nuisance exists on the subject property. As soon as is practicable following the close of such hearing, the hearing officer shall render a written decision on the matter. If a public nuisance is found to exist, the hearing officer shall issue an order requiring the abatement of the public nuisance in a reasonable time and manner as set forth in the order and shall also notify the owner(s) that, in the event the responsible person(s) fail to correct the nuisance within the time prescribed, the city will cause the nuisance to be abated and the cost of such abatement will be recorded as a lien on the property, in accordance with the provisions of this code. The hearing officer shall promptly give written notice to the person requesting the hearing and to the owner(s) and any other interested person who requests, in writing, notice of such decision, including a copy of the order. The order issued by the hearing officer shall be deemed a final order and may be judicially reviewed pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.6. There is no right to an appeal to the city council. (Ord. No. 2273, § 8, 2014; Ord. No. 2331, §1 (part), 2019.)


24.12 Abatement by city—Summary abatement.

(a)    If the nuisance is not completely abated by the owner as directed within the thirty-day abatement period, the city council may direct the city manager to cause the same to be abated by city forces or by private contract. No entry upon private property may be made for the purposes of abatement without a judicial warrant issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, or as otherwise provided by law.

(b)    Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, whenever the city manager determines that a property, a building, structure or activity is structurally unsafe, or constitutes a fire hazard, or is otherwise dangerous to human life, and such condition constitutes an immediate hazard or danger, he or she may, without observing the provisions of this chapter with reference to abatement procedures, immediately and forthwith abate the existing public nuisance. Any abatement pursuant to this subdivision shall be limited to the actions necessary to neutralize the immediate danger only. A post-abatement hearing shall be provided and all other procedures set forth in Sections 24.13 through 24.15 shall apply for the recovery of abatement costs. (Ord. No. 2273, § 9, 2014.)

Before the report is submitted to the city council, a copy shall be posted for at least five days upon the premises, together with a notice of the time when the report shall be heard by the city council for confirmation.

(b)    Service of Report and Notice. Additionally, a copy of the report and notice shall be served upon the owners of the property, in compliance with Section 24.07 (Form of proper service of notice), at least five days before submitting the report to the council.

(c)    Council’s Decision is Final. The decision of the council on all protests and objections that may be made shall be final and conclusive. (Ord. No. 2115, § 1.)


24.15 Assessment of costs against the property—Joint and several liability.

(a)    The total cost for abating the nuisance, as confirmed by the city council, shall constitute a special assessment against the respective parcel of land to which it relates.

(1)    Recordation of Notice. A notice of the special assessment, as made and confirmed, shall be recorded in the office of the county recorder.

(2)    Manner of Collection. After confirmation and recordation, the special assessment may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes are collected, and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary municipal taxes. All laws applicable to the levy, collection, and enforcement of municipal taxes shall be applicable to the special assessment. However, if any real property to which the cost of abatement relates has been transferred or conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for value, or if a lien of a bona fide encumbrancer for value has been created and attaches thereon, before the date on which the first installment of the taxes would become delinquent, the cost of abatement shall not result in a lien against the real property, but instead shall be transferred to the unsecured roll for collection.

(3)    Form of Notice. The notice of special assessment shall be in a form substantially as follows:

(b)    The person requesting a hearing may appear at the hearing in person or by written declaration executed under penalty of perjury. Said declaration and any documents in support thereof shall be tendered to and received by the office of the city clerk at least three city business days prior to the hearing.

No entry upon private property may be made for the purposes of abatement without a judicial warrant issued by a court of competent jurisdiction, or as otherwise provided by law.

(b)    Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter, whenever the city manager determines that a property, a building, structure or activity is structurally unsafe, or constitutes a fire hazard, or is otherwise dangerous to human life, and such condition constitutes an immediate hazard or danger, he or she may, without observing the provisions of this chapter with reference to abatement procedures, immediately and forthwith abate the existing public nuisance. Any abatement pursuant to this subdivision shall be limited to the actions necessary to neutralize the immediate danger only. A post-abatement hearing shall be provided and all other procedures set forth in Sections 24.13 through 24.15 shall apply for the recovery of abatement costs. (Ord. No. 2273, § 9, 2014.)

Before the report is submitted to the city council, a copy shall be posted for at least five days upon the premises, together with a notice of the time when the report shall be heard by the city council for confirmation.

(c)    Council’s Decision is Final. The decision of the council on all protests and objections that may be made shall be final and conclusive. (Ord. No. 2115, § 1.)


24.15 Assessment of costs against the property—Joint and several liability.

(a)    The total cost for abating the nuisance, as confirmed by the city council, shall constitute a special assessment against the respective parcel of land to which it relates.

(1)    Recordation of Notice. A notice of the special assessment, as made and confirmed, shall be recorded in the office of the county recorder.

(2)    Manner of Collection. After confirmation and recordation, the special assessment may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes are collected, and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary municipal taxes. All laws applicable to the levy, collection, and enforcement of municipal taxes shall be applicable to the special assessment. However, if any real property to which the cost of abatement relates has been transferred or conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for value, or if a lien of a bona fide encumbrancer for value has been created and attaches thereon, before the date on which the first installment of the taxes would become delinquent, the cost of abatement shall not result in a lien against the real property, but instead shall be transferred to the unsecured roll for collection.

(3)    Form of Notice. The notice of special assessment shall be in a form substantially as follows:

(b)    “Director” means the director of the department of public works.

(c)    “Discharger” means any person who discharges or causes a discharge of wastewater directly or indirectly to a public sewer.

(d)    “Fats, oils, and grease (“FOG”)” mean any substance, such as a vegetable or animal product that is used in, or is a byproduct of, the cooking or food preparation process, and that turns or may turn viscous or solidifies with a change in temperature or other conditions.

A limited food preparation establishment is not considered a FSE when engaged only in reheating, hot holding or assembly of ready to eat food products and as a result, there is no wastewater discharge containing a significant amount of FOG. A limited food preparation establishment does not include any operation that changes the form, flavor, or consistency of food.

(h)    “Grease control device” means any grease interceptor, grease trap or other mechanism, device, or process, which attaches to, or is applied to, wastewater plumbing fixtures and lines, the purpose of which is to trap or collect or treat FOG prior to it being discharged into the sewer system.

(j)    “Grease interceptor” means a multi-compartment device that is constructed in different sizes and is generally required to be located, according to the California Plumbing Code, underground between a FSE and the connection to the sewer system. These devices primarily use gravity to separate FOG from the wastewater as it moves from one compartment to the next.

(u)    “Significant remodel” means an FSE that conducts any remodeling to a FSE which involves construction valued at ten thousand dollars or more requiring a construction permit.

(v)    “Sludge” means any solid, semi-solid or liquid decant, subnate or supernate from a manufacturing process, utility service, or pretreatment facility.

(w)    “Waste” means sewage and any and all other waste substances, liquid, solid, gaseous or radioactive, associated with human habitation or of human or animal nature, including such wastes placed within containers of whatever nature prior to and for the purpose of disposal.

(x)    “Wastewater” means the liquid and water-carried wastes of the community and all constituents thereof, whether treated or untreated, discharged into or permitted to enter a public sewer. (Ord. No. 2186, § 2, 2009.)

Any excessive sewer or sewerage maintenance expenses or any other expenses attributable thereto shall be paid by the responsible entity or person.

(c)    It is unlawful for any person to discharge to the wastewater system any wastewater, waste, rainwater or other unpolluted water that is prohibited by CSDLA’s wastewater ordinance or causes a violation of stormwater regulations or any requirements of the Regional Water Quality Control Board, Los Angeles Region.

When required by the CSDLA, this permit shall be obtained prior to commencement of any construction of new or modified facilities which will discharge industrial wastewater to the sewer.

A violation of these prohibitions shall occur irrespective of the intent of the violator to construct, maintain, operate or utilize an illicit connection or to cause, allow or facilitate any prohibited discharge. (Ord. No. 2186, § 2, 2009.)


30.3 Jurisdiction of building inspector and city engineer.

30.8 Sewer connection fees.

Whenever the city engineer finds that a sewer connection permit has been requested by, or on behalf of, the owner of any real property within the city, which property has not borne its just share of the original cost of the installation and construction of the public sewer to which the sewer hook-up is desired, either by means of an assessment district proceeding contract, voluntary contribution, or otherwise, a fee shall be charged for such permit. Such fee shall be established by resolution. (Ord. No. 2186, § 2, 2009.)


30.9 Appeal.

Any person aggrieved by the decision of the city engineer relative to the amount of connection fee assessed to a particular property may appeal such determination to the city council by filing a written notice of appeal with the city clerk. At the time set for the hearing, the city council shall determine whether the proposed fee is just and reasonable under all of the circumstances applicable to the case. The decision of the city council shall be final and conclusive. (Ord. No. 2186, § 2, 2009.)


30.10 Sewer fund.

The moneys obtained from sewer connection fees shall be placed in a special fund known as the “sewer fund.” Money from the sewer fund shall be appropriated only for the planning, acquisition, construction, reconstruction, maintenance and operation of sewerage facilities, to repay principal and interest on general obligation bonds issued for the construction or reconstruction of such sewerage facilities, and to pay federal or state loans or advances made for the construction or reconstruction of sewerage facilities; provided, however, that such revenue shall not be used for the acquisition or construction of new local street sewers or laterals, as distinguished from main trunk, interceptor and outfall sewers. (Ord. No. 2186, § 2, 2009.)


30.11 Sewer service charges.

Exceptions to the installation of a grease and oil interceptor shall be determined on a case-by-case basis by the director. (Ord. No. 2186, § 2, 2009.)


30.32 FOG pretreatment required for new construction of food service establishments.

All new construction of food service establishments and those undergoing a significant remodel shall install a grease interceptor prior to commencing discharge of wastewater to sewer system. (Ord. No. 2186, § 2, 2009.)


30.33 Variance and waiver of grease interceptor requirement.

(a)    Variance from Grease Interceptor Requirements. A variance or a conditional waiver from the grease interceptor requirements on such terms and conditions as may be established by the director, consistent with the requirements of the sewer WDRs, the city’s FOG control program, and best construction, engineering, environmental and health and safety practices, to: (1) allow alternative pretreatment technology that is, at least, equally effective in controlling the FOG discharge in lieu of a grease interceptor, may be granted by the director to FSEs demonstrating to the director’s satisfaction that it is impossible to install, operate or maintain a grease interceptor; or (2) where the FSE demonstrates to the director’s satisfaction that any FOG discharge from the FSE is negligible and will have an insignificant impact to the sewer system.

(b)    Waiver from Grease Interceptor Installation with a Grease Disposal Mitigation Fee. For FSEs where the installation of grease interceptor is not feasible and no equivalent alternative pretreatment can be installed, a waiver from the grease interceptor requirement may be granted with the imposition of a grease disposal mitigation fee as described in section 30.34. The director’s determination to grant the waiver with a grease disposal mitigation fee will be based upon such considerations that the director determines to be appropriate and consistent with the sewer WDRs, the city’s FOG control program, and best construction, engineering, environmental and health and safety practices. Provided, however, that a grease interceptor will be installed when the FSE undergoes a significant remodel. No discretionary permit, including but not limited to a conditional use permit, shall be issued to a FSE unless the applicant can demonstrate that a grease interceptor has been or will be installed at the FSE.

(c)    Application for Waiver or Variance of Requirement for Grease Interceptor. A FSE may submit an application for waiver or variance from the grease interceptor requirement to the director. Terms and conditions for issuance of a variance to a FSE shall be set forth in the permit. A waiver or variance may be revoked at any time when any of the terms and conditions for its issuance is not satisfied or if the conditions upon which the waiver was based change so that the justification for the waiver no longer exists. (Ord. No. 2186, § 2, 2009.)


30.34 Grease disposal mitigation fee.

(a)    FSEs that operate without a grease control interceptor may be required to pay an annual grease disposal mitigation fee to equitably cover the costs of increased maintenance and administration of the sewer system as a result of the FSEs’ inability to adequately remove FOG from its wastewater discharge. This section shall not be interpreted to allow a new FSE, or existing FSEs undergoing remodeling or change in operations, to operate without an approved grease interceptor unless the director has determined that it is impossible to install or operate a grease control interceptor for the FSE under the provisions of this chapter.

(b)    The grease disposal mitigation fee shall be established by resolution of the city council, and shall be based on the estimated annual increased cost of maintaining the sewer system for inspection and removal of FOG and other viscous or solidifying agents attributable to the FSE resulting from the lack of a grease interceptor or grease control device and such other costs that the city council considers appropriate.

(c)    The grease disposal mitigation fee may not be waived or reduced when the FSE does not comply with the minimum requirements of this chapter. (Ord. No. 2186, § 2, 2009.)


30.35 Grease interceptor maintenance requirements.

(a)    Grease interceptors shall be maintained in efficient operating condition by periodic removal of the full content of the interceptor which includes wastewater, accumulated FOG, floating materials, sludge and solids.

(b)    Wastewater, accumulated FOG, floating material, sludge/solids, and other materials removed from the grease interceptor shall be disposed off site properly by waste haulers in accordance with federal, state and/or local laws.

(c)    Grease interceptors shall be fully pumped out and cleaned on a quarterly basis. The agency may change the maintenance frequency at any time to reflect changes in actual operating conditions in accordance with the FOG control program. Based on the actual generation of FOG from the food service establishment, the maintenance frequency may increase or decrease.

(d)    The permittee shall be required to keep all documents identified by the director relating to its compliance with this chapter, including manifests, receipts and invoices of all cleaning, maintenance, grease removal of/from the grease control device, disposal carrier and disposal site location for no less than two years. The permittee shall, upon request, make the manifests, receipts and invoices available to any city representative, or inspector.

(e)    If the grease interceptor, at any time, contains excess FOG and solids accumulation the FSE shall be required to have the grease interceptor serviced immediately such that all fats, oils, grease, sludge, and other materials are completely removed from the grease interceptor. If deemed necessary, the director may also increase the maintenance frequency of the grease interceptor from the current frequency. (Ord. No. 2186, § 2, 2009.)


30.36 FOG inspections.

The director, or representative, shall be authorized at any reasonable time to enter the premises of any discharger to determine compliance with the provisions of this chapter; such inspection may include but not be limited to: inspection, sampling, monitoring, review, photograph, videotape and copy of any records, reports, test results or other data, wastes, chemicals, storage areas, storage containers, waste generating processes, treatment facilities and discharge locations. (Ord. No. 2186, § 2, 2009.)


30.37 FOG inspections fees.

The amount of FOG inspections fee shall be established by resolution of the city council as amended from time to time in accordance with provisions of this chapter. (Ord. No. 2186, § 2, 2009.)

The city engineer shall have jurisdiction within the public right-of-way or easement. (Ord. No. 2186, § 2, 2009.)


30.4 Connection permits generally.

It is unlawful for any person to connect any drain or pipe with any city sewer, or discharge any drainage therein, without a permit to do so being first obtained from the city engineer, who shall charge and collect for each such permit the sum as set and adjusted by resolution of the city council. Each permit shall indicate the place at which the connection is to be made and the property to be connected, and it shall be unlawful to make any such connection with any public sewer at any other place than that designated in the permit.

Every connection made with any public sewer of the city shall be made in accordance with the engineering and public works department’s standard plans and specifications.

No sewer connection shall be covered or concealed in any way until it has been inspected and approved by the director or authorized representative.

The applicant shall have the required sewer installation performed by a contractor licensed by the state to perform this type of work. Complete engineering shall be by a registered civil engineer licensed in the state, and shall include the submission of a full set of detailed improvement plans of a scale acceptable to the director, along with appropriate plan check and inspection fees. The director reserves the right to require the contractor to televise the mains at the applicant’s expense to determine acceptability. Any changes in installation shall have prior approval of the director, and the applicant shall furnish the director a complete set of as-built plans at the completion and acceptance of the installation.

The property owner shall be responsible for the construction, maintenance and repairs of all private property sewer connections to the public sewer. (Ord. No. 2186, § 2, 2009.)


30.5 Pipe with which connections are made.

Pipe with which a sewer connection is made must be at least four feet below the established grade of the street at the property line. In all cases, the line of the pipe must be straight from the property line to the wye connection at the sewer main unless otherwise approved by the city engineer. Where a wye connection cannot be found, saddling may be permitted upon approval of the city engineer. (Ord. No. 2186, § 2, 2009.)

It is unlawful for any person, except a properly authorized official or employee of the city, to remove any covering to any manhole or flush tank connected with any sewer in the city. (Ord. No. 2186, § 2, 2009.)


30.8 Sewer connection fees.

Whenever the city engineer finds that a sewer connection permit has been requested by, or on behalf of, the owner of any real property within the city, which property has not borne its just share of the original cost of the installation and construction of the public sewer to which the sewer hook-up is desired, either by means of an assessment district proceeding contract, voluntary contribution, or otherwise, a fee shall be charged for such permit. Such fee shall be established by resolution. (Ord. No. 2186, § 2, 2009.)


30.9 Appeal.

Any person aggrieved by the decision of the city engineer relative to the amount of connection fee assessed to a particular property may appeal such determination to the city council by filing a written notice of appeal with the city clerk. At the time set for the hearing, the city council shall determine whether the proposed fee is just and reasonable under all of the circumstances applicable to the case. The decision of the city council shall be final and conclusive. (Ord. No. 2186, § 2, 2009.)


30.10 Sewer fund.

The moneys obtained from sewer connection fees shall be placed in a special fund known as the “sewer fund.” Money from the sewer fund shall be appropriated only for the planning, acquisition, construction, reconstruction, maintenance and operation of sewerage facilities, to repay principal and interest on general obligation bonds issued for the construction or reconstruction of such sewerage facilities, and to pay federal or state loans or advances made for the construction or reconstruction of sewerage facilities; provided, however, that such revenue shall not be used for the acquisition or construction of new local street sewers or laterals, as distinguished from main trunk, interceptor and outfall sewers. (Ord. No. 2186, § 2, 2009.)


30.11 Sewer service charges.

(a)    Charges collected, as established by the ordinance codified in this section, will be used to reimburse the city for costs of regulating the construction of sewers, the interception of sewage and wastes, and to control wastewater to provide the maximum public benefit of the sewage disposal facilities of the city.

(b)    Service charges and fees shall be fixed from time to time by resolution of the city council.

(c)    Bills for sewer services are due and payable upon presentation with the water bill and shall become delinquent in the same manner and at the same time.

(1)    How to “dry wipe” pots, pans, dishware, and work area before washing to remove grease;

(2)    How to properly dispose of food waste and solids in enclosed plastic bags prior to disposal in trash bins or containers to prevent leaking and odors;

(3)    The location and use of absorption products to clean under fryer baskets and other locations where grease may be spilled or dripped;

(4)    How to properly dispose of grease or oils from cooking equipment into a grease receptacle such as a barrel or drum without spilling.

Training shall be documented and employee signatures retained indicating each employee’s attendance and understanding of the practices reviewed. Training records shall be available for review at any reasonable time by or other authorized inspector. (Ord. No. 2186, § 2, 2009.)


30.31 FSEs FOG pretreatment required.

FSEs shall install an approved grease control device and regularly maintain it so as to prevent excessive discharges of grease and oil into the public sewer. Exceptions to the installation of a grease and oil interceptor shall be determined on a case-by-case basis by the director. (Ord. No. 2186, § 2, 2009.)


30.32 FOG pretreatment required for new construction of food service establishments.

All new construction of food service establishments and those undergoing a significant remodel shall install a grease interceptor prior to commencing discharge of wastewater to sewer system. (Ord. No. 2186, § 2, 2009.)


30.33 Variance and waiver of grease interceptor requirement.

(a)    Variance from Grease Interceptor Requirements. A variance or a conditional waiver from the grease interceptor requirements on such terms and conditions as may be established by the director, consistent with the requirements of the sewer WDRs, the city’s FOG control program, and best construction, engineering, environmental and health and safety practices, to: (1) allow alternative pretreatment technology that is, at least, equally effective in controlling the FOG discharge in lieu of a grease interceptor, may be granted by the director to FSEs demonstrating to the director’s satisfaction that it is impossible to install, operate or maintain a grease interceptor; or (2) where the FSE demonstrates to the director’s satisfaction that any FOG discharge from the FSE is negligible and will have an insignificant impact to the sewer system.

(b)    Waiver from Grease Interceptor Installation with a Grease Disposal Mitigation Fee. For FSEs where the installation of grease interceptor is not feasible and no equivalent alternative pretreatment can be installed, a waiver from the grease interceptor requirement may be granted with the imposition of a grease disposal mitigation fee as described in section 30.34. The director’s determination to grant the waiver with a grease disposal mitigation fee will be based upon such considerations that the director determines to be appropriate and consistent with the sewer WDRs, the city’s FOG control program, and best construction, engineering, environmental and health and safety practices. Provided, however, that a grease interceptor will be installed when the FSE undergoes a significant remodel. No discretionary permit, including but not limited to a conditional use permit, shall be issued to a FSE unless the applicant can demonstrate that a grease interceptor has been or will be installed at the FSE.

(c)    Application for Waiver or Variance of Requirement for Grease Interceptor. A FSE may submit an application for waiver or variance from the grease interceptor requirement to the director. Terms and conditions for issuance of a variance to a FSE shall be set forth in the permit. A waiver or variance may be revoked at any time when any of the terms and conditions for its issuance is not satisfied or if the conditions upon which the waiver was based change so that the justification for the waiver no longer exists. (Ord. No. 2186, § 2, 2009.)


30.34 Grease disposal mitigation fee.

(a)    FSEs that operate without a grease control interceptor may be required to pay an annual grease disposal mitigation fee to equitably cover the costs of increased maintenance and administration of the sewer system as a result of the FSEs’ inability to adequately remove FOG from its wastewater discharge. This section shall not be interpreted to allow a new FSE, or existing FSEs undergoing remodeling or change in operations, to operate without an approved grease interceptor unless the director has determined that it is impossible to install or operate a grease control interceptor for the FSE under the provisions of this chapter.

(b)    The grease disposal mitigation fee shall be established by resolution of the city council, and shall be based on the estimated annual increased cost of maintaining the sewer system for inspection and removal of FOG and other viscous or solidifying agents attributable to the FSE resulting from the lack of a grease interceptor or grease control device and such other costs that the city council considers appropriate.

(c)    The grease disposal mitigation fee may not be waived or reduced when the FSE does not comply with the minimum requirements of this chapter. (Ord. No. 2186, § 2, 2009.)


30.35 Grease interceptor maintenance requirements.

(a)    Grease interceptors shall be maintained in efficient operating condition by periodic removal of the full content of the interceptor which includes wastewater, accumulated FOG, floating materials, sludge and solids.

(b)    Wastewater, accumulated FOG, floating material, sludge/solids, and other materials removed from the grease interceptor shall be disposed off site properly by waste haulers in accordance with federal, state and/or local laws.

(c)    Grease interceptors shall be fully pumped out and cleaned on a quarterly basis. The agency may change the maintenance frequency at any time to reflect changes in actual operating conditions in accordance with the FOG control program. Based on the actual generation of FOG from the food service establishment, the maintenance frequency may increase or decrease.

(d)    The permittee shall be required to keep all documents identified by the director relating to its compliance with this chapter, including manifests, receipts and invoices of all cleaning, maintenance, grease removal of/from the grease control device, disposal carrier and disposal site location for no less than two years. The permittee shall, upon request, make the manifests, receipts and invoices available to any city representative, or inspector.

(e)    If the grease interceptor, at any time, contains excess FOG and solids accumulation the FSE shall be required to have the grease interceptor serviced immediately such that all fats, oils, grease, sludge, and other materials are completely removed from the grease interceptor. If deemed necessary, the director may also increase the maintenance frequency of the grease interceptor from the current frequency. (Ord. No. 2186, § 2, 2009.)


30.36 FOG inspections.

The director, or representative, shall be authorized at any reasonable time to enter the premises of any discharger to determine compliance with the provisions of this chapter; such inspection may include but not be limited to: inspection, sampling, monitoring, review, photograph, videotape and copy of any records, reports, test results or other data, wastes, chemicals, storage areas, storage containers, waste generating processes, treatment facilities and discharge locations. (Ord. No. 2186, § 2, 2009.)


30.37 FOG inspections fees.

The amount of FOG inspections fee shall be established by resolution of the city council as amended from time to time in accordance with provisions of this chapter. (Ord. No. 2186, § 2, 2009.)

ARTICLE III. ENFORCEMENT

(1)    The owner or occupant of any private property requiring abatement of conditions on the property that cause or may cause discharges in violation of this chapter;

(2)    The permittee subject to the requirements of any permit issued pursuant to this chapter to ensure compliance with the terms, conditions and requirements of the permit.

(b)    The administrative compliance order may include the installation of approved grease control devices. (Ord. No. 2186, § 2, 2009.)


30.52 Recovery of cost.

The director may issue to the owner or occupant of any private property, any permittee or any responsible party, who becomes subject to a notice of noncompliance or administrative order, an invoice for costs, which shall be immediately due and payable to the city for the actual costs incurred by the city in issuing and enforcing any notice or order.

If any owner or occupant, permittee or responsible party, fails to pay the invoice for costs within thirty days of the authorized inspector’s deposit of the invoice for costs in the regular mail, postage prepaid, the enforcing attorney may institute collection proceedings or elect to place a lien on the property in the amount of the invoice of costs. (Ord. No. 2186, § 2, 2009.)


30.53 Compliance schedule.

Upon determination that a discharger is in noncompliance with any provisions of this chapter, the director may require the discharger to submit for review and approval a compliance schedule. If, following the compliance schedule expiration date, the discharger fails to comply with the terms, conditions, or limitations specified in the compliance schedule, the discharger’s permit, or with any provisions of this chapter, then the discharger may be subject to noncompliance fees, a probation order, a cease and desist order, and/or legal actions. (Ord. No. 2186, § 2, 2009.)


30.54 Cease and desist order.

(a)    The director may order the owner or occupant of any private property, permittee or any responsible party to: (1) immediately discontinue any process water, wastewater or pollutant discharge to the wastewater system or the stormwater drainage system; (2) immediately block or divert any flow of water from the property, where the flow is occurring in violation of any provision of this chapter; and (3) immediately discontinue any other violation of this chapter. The cease and desist order may contain terms and conditions including, but not limited to, limits on rate and time of discharge, or other provisions to ensure compliance with this chapter.

(b)    Notice/Hearing. When the director has reason to believe that grounds exist to issue a cease and desist order, he or she shall give written notice thereof either by personal delivery or by certified mail to the discharger setting forth the grounds for such an order, together with the time and place where the charges shall be heard.

(c)    After the conclusion of the hearing, the director shall make a determination and issue a decision and order within thirty calendar days of the hearing. The written decision and order of the director shall be sent by personal delivery or by certified mail to the discharger. The order of the director shall be final in all aspects fourteen days after it is mailed to the discharger unless a request for hearing is filed with the city council.

Failure of the discharger to comply with the conditions of the cease and desist order may result in permit suspension, permit revocation, termination of service and/or legal actions. (Ord. No. 2186, § 2, 2009.)

It is a nuisance and it is unlawful for any person to erect or maintain any building, fence, porch, steps, posts, poles, tracks, wires, pipes, conduits, racks, boxes, stands, structures or other obstruction, in whole or in part, upon or in any public street, curb, parking, sidewalk or alley in the city without the written permission so to do from the city manager. The city manager shall not issue such a permit if such obstruction would interfere with the free flow of foot traffic at the location in question or be in danger of the public health, welfare or safety. Neither this section nor Section 31.2 shall apply to a “newsrack” as defined in Section 31.2-1. (Ord. No. 875, § 19; Ord. No. 1367, § 1; Ord. No. 1630, § 1.)


31.2 Display, etc., of goods on streets and sidewalks.

It is unlawful for any person to use or occupy any public sidewalk in the city for the display of goods, wares or merchandise or to use the exterior walls of any building abutting upon any public sidewalk, street, alley or passageway for the display of goods, wares, newspapers or merchandise or to leave any goods, wares, merchandise, boxes, barrels, racks or stands or other articles upon any street, public sidewalk or portion thereof in the city, except under the conditions specified in Section 31.1. This section shall not apply to outdoor displays of goods permitted by Chapter 36 of this Code. (Ord. No. 1106, § 13.02; Ord. No. 1367, § 2; Ord. No. 2077, § 1.)


31.2-1 Newsracks—Short title.

Sections 31.2-1 through 31.2-6A shall be known as the “newsrack ordinance.” (Ord. No. 2138 § 1.)


31.2-1A Newsracks—Intent and purpose.

The city council of the city of South Pasadena hereby finds and declares:

(a)    The city of South Pasadena has significant interests in:

(1)    Promoting vehicular traffic and pedestrian safety and convenience including but not limited to the event of motor vehicle parking and pedestrian standing related to the use of newsracks;

(2)    Preventing damage to public sidewalks, structures, and landscaping;

(3)    Preventing visual clutter; and

(4)    Protecting the aesthetic, natural, and historical character of South Pasadena.

(b)    The city of South Pasadena has a substantial interest in promoting the public health, safety, welfare and convenience of its citizens, businesses and visitors by ensuring that public streets, sidewalks and rights-of-way in the city are not unreasonably obstructed by newsracks and that newsracks are properly maintained.

(c)    In recent years, the proliferation of newsracks on the streets and sidewalks of the city, in particular excessive, poorly maintained or abandoned newsracks, have contributed to the congestion of the city sidewalks, impeded the flow of pedestrian traffic, interfered with the use of streets, sidewalks and public rights-of-way, presented hazards to persons and property and resulted in substantial visual blight.

(d)    The city of South Pasadena has a substantial interest in preserving and protecting the unique visual, historic, natural, and aesthetic qualities of the city. To that end, and consistent with the city’s general plan the city desires to take steps to reduce the visual blight, pedestrian inconvenience and hazards associated with an unlimited number and design of newsracks, poorly maintained newsracks and the unrestricted placement of newsracks on streets, sidewalks and rights-of-way in the city.

(e)    After extended inquiry by the city council and city staff, it has become clear that the most effective way to reduce the visual clutter and hazards associated with excessive numbers of newsracks and unregulated design or appearance of such newsracks is to prohibit the unlimited placement of private newsracks in the city and instead, institute a program to provide city-approved fixed newsracks of a consistent design, placement and color. Such clutter and hazards would be reduced by requiring that visually occurring groupings of newsracks occur at regular and predictable intervals to give the city’s streets a sense of aesthetic continuity.

(f)    Thus, the purpose of Sections 31.2-1 through 31.2-6A is to promote the public health, safety and welfare and the aesthetic qualities of the city by controlling the size, shape, construction and appearance of newsracks in the city as a reasonable time, manner and place regulation, so as to:

(1)    Provide for pedestrian and driving safety and convenience;

(2)    Ensure that there is no unreasonable interference with the flow of vehicular and pedestrian traffic, including ingress and egress from any city residence, place of business or public facility, or any legally parked or stopped vehicles;

(3)    Ensure compliance with Americans with Disabilities Act and improve passage for persons with disabilities by reducing impediments to passage caused by poorly-located newsracks;

(4)    Provide reasonable access for the safe and efficient use and maintenance of sidewalks, poles, posts, traffic signs or signals, hydrants, mailboxes, delivery areas, loading zones, transit shelters, curb and handicapped ramps and other street improvements;

(5)    Reduce visual blight and clutter and litter problems associated with poorly maintained or improperly located or abandoned newsracks and unnecessarily large groupings of newsracks;

(6)    Advance the economic interests of the city merchants and other information providers, including those involved in the publication and distribution of newspapers and periodicals through newsracks;

(7)    Protect the unique architectural, historical, natural, and aesthetic attributes of the city;

(8)    Reduce exposure of the city to personal injury or property damage claims and litigation;

(9)    Provide for public and property safety during emergency conditions;

(10)    Maintain and protect the values of surrounding properties;

(11)    Provide for and maintain the freedom of speech for newspapers or news periodicals using newsracks for distribution;

(12)    Discourage the stopping of motor vehicles within twenty feet of a crosswalk along a safe route to schools (a twenty foot distance is approximately the length of an average motor vehicle), because such stopping may cause the illegal blocking of crosswalks;

(13)    Prevent pedestrian students and their escorts from being forced off of a sidewalk along a “safe routes to schools” into arterial street traffic.

(g)    In adopting the ordinance codified in Sections 31.2-1 through 31.2-6A, the city council is mindful that newsrack regulations implicate rights protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 2 of the California Constitution. To that end, the city council hereby adopts these regulations and directs that their enforcement be conducted in a manner consistent with the constitutional rights of citizens and regulated parties.

(h)    Given the limited space available within the city’s rights-of-way, the city of South Pasadena has a substantial interest in devising a systematic approach to newsrack removal and placement in the city to ensure a fair and equitable distribution of newspapers and periodicals. The city council declares that this objective and the other aforementioned objectives are best achieved by adopting the ordinance codified in Sections 31.2-1 through 31.2-6A and creating regulations to allow fixed newsracks of a consistent design, placement and color and also by enhancing the aesthetic character of public areas through uniformity in the appearance thereof.

(i)    The city council further declares that allowing only newsracks of a consistent design, placement and color in the city directly promotes the city’s interests in promoting public safety, reducing visual blight and clutter, protecting the unique aesthetic and historical attributes of the city and advancing the economic interests of the city merchants and other information providers.

(j)    The city council finds that this project (newsrack ordinance) is exempt from the provisions of the Environmental Quality Act (“CEQA”) pursuant to Section 15061 (b)(3) of the CEQA Guidelines, because it can be seen with certainty that there is no possibility that this project will have a significant effect on the environment. The ordinance establishes regulations that will be followed in the issuance of ministerial permits and in code enforcement activities. The following are decisions that are not specifically decided in this newsrack ordinance: decisions as to the specific locations of newsrack zones as set forth in Section 31.2-1B(g); or, decisions besides those relating to use or safety regarding the number of allowed newsracks on a specific block or newsrack zone as set forth in Section 31.2-4(r). (Ord. No. 2138 § 1.)


31.2-1B Newsracks—Definitions.

For the purpose of Sections 31.2-1 through 31.2-6A, certain words and phrases shall be construed as set forth in this section, unless it is apparent from the context that a different meaning is intended:

(a)    As used herein “block” means one side of a street between two consecutive intersecting public streets. Where a block is between a public street and an alley or a private street or between alleys or private streets, the length of the block shall be determined by the location of any alleys or private streets that provide access to traffic.

(b)    “Business day” means Monday through Friday, inclusive, of every week excepting holidays for which the City of South Pasadena is closed to official business.

(c)    “Hardship waiver” means the waiver described in Section 31.2-3B(g).

(f)    “Newsrack zone” means an area of a block as indicated by a painted outline thereon wherein up to six newsracks may be permitted. Each newsrack zone shall be located and demarcated by the public works director based on the findings supporting the goals and purposes set forth in Section 31.2-1A(f) and as approved by the planning commission at a public hearing by resolution. The planning commission shall request and consider the input of any directly affected holders of newsrack permits in the creation of newsrack zones. The planning commission may allow for more than six newsracks per newsrack zone if doing so will not create visual clutter or physical hazards.

(g)    “Roadway” means that portion of a street improved, designed or ordinarily used for vehicular travel.

(h)    “Parkway” means that area between the sidewalks and the curb of any street, and where there is no sidewalk, that area between the edge of the roadway and the property line adjacent thereto. Parkway also includes any area within a roadway which is not open to vehicular travel.

31.2-2 Newsracks—Prohibition of newsracks on roadways.

No person shall install, use or maintain any newsrack or other structure which projects into, onto or over any part of any roadway of any public street, or which rests wholly or in part upon, along, over or within eighteen inches of any portion of the roadway of any public street. (Ord. No. 2138 § 1.)


31.2-3 Newsracks—Dangerous condition or obstruction.

No person shall install, use or maintain any newsrack which in whole or in part rests upon, in or over any public sidewalk or parkway:

(a)    When such installation, use or maintenance endangers the safety of persons or property, or which site or location is used for public utility purposes, public transportation purposes or other governmental use; or

(b)    When such newsrack unreasonably interferes with or impedes the flow of pedestrian or vehicular traffic, including any legally marked or stopped vehicle, the ingress into or egress from any residence or place of business, or the use of poles, posts, traffic signs or signals, hydrants, mailboxes or other objects permitted at or near the location; or

(c)    When such newsracks are so insufficiently illuminated at night as to cause a potential hazard to pedestrians; or

(d)    When there are any unpermitted newsracks on a block that is part of the city’s safe routes to schools. (Ord. No. 2138 § 1.)


31.2-3A Newsracks—Permit required.

(a)    No person shall install or maintain any newsrack which in whole or in part is upon, in, or over any public sidewalk or parkway without first obtaining an annual newsrack permit from the public works director.

(b)    Applications for permits for newsrack shall be made to the public works director or his/her duly authorized representative. The application shall be accompanied by the following:

(1)    The name, address and telephone number of the applicant;

(2)    The name, address and telephone number of a responsible person whom the city may notify or contact at any time concerning the applicant’s newsrack; and

(3)    The number of newsracks and exact proposed location of each newsrack by either listing the newsrack zone by its block’s defining streets, or where a block does not have a newsrack zone, by the block’s defining streets, specific closest street address (county assessor’s parcel number, if no such address exists), and a scaled map (with distances shown) that clearly identifies the precise location of the proposed newsrack, including all improvements, structures and items that are necessary to determine site distances as set forth in this chapter;

(4)    A color photograph and model number of the type of newsrack being used;

(5)    The name of the publication to be contained in each newsrack;

(6)    A hold harmless agreement pursuant to Section 31.2-3B(d);

(7)    Agreement to conform to the requirements of Sections 31.2-1 through 21.2-6A; and

(8)    Proof of insurance as is required in Section 31.2-3B(c).

(c)    There shall be an annual city-wide permit application and renewal fee per publication, and an annual processing and inspection fee per newsrack in such amounts as set by resolution of the city council.

(d)    Permits are not assignable to any other publication. (Ord. No. 2138 § 1.)


31.2-3B Newsracks—Permit issuance and renewal.

(a)    A permit may be issued for the installation of a newsrack only after inspection of the location by the public works director, or his/her duly authorized representative. No permit shall be issued unless the public works director or his/her duly authorized representative determines the location complies with the standards and criteria set forth in Section 31.2-4. A permit shall condition the installation, use and maintenance of a newsrack on compliance with the provisions of the newsrack ordinance and other laws including, but not limited to, the federal law known as the Americans with Disabilities Act.

(b)    Such permits shall be valid for one year and shall be renewable annually. If the public works director determines that a newsrack is otherwise in compliance with the code, then no additional information shall be required of the permittee upon renewal. However, the public works director may decide not to renew a permit per Sections 31.2-4(o), (p) and (q).

(c)    A condition for issuance of a permit pursuant to Sections 32.2-1 through 32.2-6A is that every permittee agrees to maintain a policy of public liability insurance, naming the city, its officials, officers, agents and employees as an additional insured, in an amount not less than fifty thousand dollars combined single limit for any injury to persons and/or damage to property by reason of installation, use and maintenance of such newsrack on public property. The policy shall provide that the insurance coverage shall not be cancelled or reduced by the insurance carrier without the city having been given thirty business days prior written notice thereof by such carrier. The permittee shall provide and keep in force that policy of public liability insurance during such time as it continues to operate any newsrack under the terms of the Sections 32.2-1 through 32.2-6A. If the insurance is canceled at any time during the term of the permit, it shall be grounds for revocation of the permit. The application for a permit and all renewal applications shall require an endorsement signed by an authorized officer of such insurer as applicant’s proof of such a policy of public liability insurance.

(d)    A condition for issuance of a permit pursuant to Sections 32.2-1 through 32.2-6A is that every permittee agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the city, its officials, officers, agents and employees, from any loss or liability or damage, including expenses and costs, for bodily or personal injury, and for property damage sustained by any person as a result of the installation, use or maintenance of the applicant’s newsrack within the city, and the permit application shall include an indemnification provision consistent with this section and approved by the city attorney.

(e)    The issuance or granting of a newsrack permit shall not be construed to be a permit for, or an approval of, any violation of any of the provisions of this Code or of any ordinance of the city. Permits presuming to give authority to violate or cancel the provisions of this Code or other ordinances of the city shall not be valid.

(f)    The issuance of a permit based on plans and other data shall not prevent the public works director from thereafter requiring the correction of errors in such plans or data or from preventing operations being carried on when in violation of any ordinance of the city.

(g)    Any applicant for a newsrack permit may request the city’s waiver of the requirements set forth in Sections 32.2-1 through 32.2-6A for financial reasons. A statement of financial hardship, without need for evidentiary support, due to the application of Sections 32.2-1 through 32.2-6A shall result in the issuance of a hardship waiver for a period of six months by the public works director. A further waiver would be approved if a reasonable time-line is provided in which the newsracks will be made compliant. Such a “reasonable” time-line would balance the length of the conformance time-line with any evidence provided regarding the relative cost-burden on the applicant. The public works director may defer the decision of whether to grant such a further hardship waiver to the planning commission.

(h)    Any newsrack permit issued on the basis of incorrect information or a fraudulent representation shall be void.

(i)    The issuance or denial of a newsrack permit shall occur within thirty days of the public works director’s receipt of the permit application. The issuance or denial of a newsrack permit may be appealed to the planning commission by any party within three business days of the issuance or denial thereof. A hearing must be held within thirty days of the receipt of the notice of appeal. The appellant shall be given notice of the hearing on the appeal at least ten days before the hearing. The decision of the planning commission may be appealed to the city council within three business days of the issuance of the decision of the planning commission. A hearing must be held within thirty days of the receipt of the notice of appeal. The appellant shall be given notice of the hearing on the appeal at least ten days before the hearing. (Ord. No. 2138 § 1.)


31.2-4 Newsracks—Standards for maintenance and installation.

Any newsrack which in whole or in part rests upon, in or over any public sidewalk or parkway shall comply with the following standards:

(a)    Newsracks shall be made of metal, shall have a metal framed transparent door, and shall sit on one or four legs equal in height to the height of the case holding the newspaper(s) or other publication(s). Each newsrack must be dark green in color to match a dark-green color commonly used in the newsrack industry and as is available from the public works director for review. No newsrack shall exceed fifty-two inches in height, thirty inches in width, or twenty-four inches in depth or be less than ten percent of those dimensions. The fifty-two inches in height is measured from the sidewalk surface upon which the newsrack is fixed to the top of the newsrack, including coin collection and activation devices. Newspapers may request from the public works director an exception from the green color requirement if that newsrack has a trademark color combination that is used on its newsracks generally. The public works director’s determination of whether a trademark color exists will be based on evidence of prior and current consistent usage of that trademark color. Such determinations may be appealed as set forth in Section 31.2-3B(i). However, no color exceptions would be allowed in historic districts, or on sidewalks within ten feet of a historic landmark assuming an exception set forth in subsection (e) of this section is made.

(b)    The name, address and telephone number of a responsible person who may be contacted at any time concerning the newsrack shall be displayed on the door of the newsrack in such manner as to be readily visible and readable to a prospective customer thereof.

(c)    Newsracks shall not be attached to any permanently fixed public object or public utility object besides the actual sidewalk surface by way of bolts as further set forth herein.

(d)    Each newsrack shall be bolted to the sidewalk in accordance with the standards on file in the office of the public works director. Newsracks may not be chained or otherwise attached to one another in groups. No newsrack shall be stacked vertically, i.e., two separate dispensers using the same four legs for support, but more then one paper may be dispensed from the same dispenser.

(e)    No newsracks shall obscure or block the view of or access to cultural and historic sites, natural features, landmarks, or structures as listed in the city’s register of approved landmarks. It shall be assumed that a newsrack placed on a sidewalk within ten feet of such a registered location obscures or blocks the view thereof. Exceptions from this requirement may be based on the consideration of the location including a review of whether pedestrian access and views are obscured by the newsrack and whether there are nearby locations (beyond ten feet from the location and visually perceivable from the location) for the placement of a newsrack(s).

(f)    Subject to and as limited by the provisions of Section 31.2-3, no newsrack or newsrack zone shall be placed, installed, used or maintained in a public place:

(1)    Within five feet of any marked crosswalk;

(2)    Within fifteen feet of the curb return of any unmarked crosswalk;

(3)    Within five feet of any fire hydrant, fire call box, police call box or other emergency facility;

(4)    Within five feet of any driveway;

(5)    Within five feet ahead of or twenty-five feet to the rear of any sign marked a designated bus stop;

(6)    Within five feet of any bus bench;

(7)    At any location whereby the clear space for the passageway of pedestrians is reduced to less than five feet;

(8)    Within three feet of any area improved with lawn, flowers, shrubs or trees, or within three feet of any display window of any building abutting the sidewalk or parkway, or in such manner as to impede or interfere with the reasonable use of such window for display purposes; or

(9)    On a block on the “vehicle passenger’s” side of an arterial street, no newsrack shall be closer than thirty feet from an approaching crosswalk (i.e., the crosswalk before an intersection where a vehicle would stop at a red traffic-light or stop-sign) of that street, whether that arterial street intersects with a non-arterial or another arterial street.

(h)    No newsrack shall be used for advertising signs or publicity purposes other than that dealing with the display, sale or purchase of the newspaper or news periodical sold therein.

(i)    Each newsrack shall be maintained in a clean, operational, neat and attractive condition and in good repair at all times. Broken, missing or discolored glass or other transparent panel shall be promptly replaced. A newsrack shall be cleaned within forty-eight hours to remove graffiti, dirt, oils, and other foreign matter upon notice thereof.

(j)    No newsrack shall be permitted to remain in other than its vertical, working position for more than twenty-four hours.

(k)    No newsrack may remain empty in excess of thirty-two consecutive days.

(l)    Material offered for sale must be the current edition of the publication so offered.

(m)    Newsracks must be grouped (i.e., side-by-side) and placed as follows:

(1)    No more than six newsracks shall be allowed per group of newsracks;

(2)    Newsracks sharing the same two hundred foot length of a block shall be placed side by side or within a newsrack zone where marked;

(3)    There shall be no more than six newsracks per every two hundred feet of a block wherein each two hundred feet of a block are measured from the nearest location to an intersection on the block where a newsrack may be placed;

(4)    Where a grouping of six cannot be accommodated due to hardscape features, there may be up to two lesser groupings subject to the limit of six newsracks per two hundred feet of a block;

(5)    When newsrack groups cannot be separated by two hundred feet of block length, newsrack groups shall be placed at regularly distances on a block to create visually re-occurring groupings to the extent possible;

(6)    To accommodate the safe travel of students along safe routes to schools that are on arterial streets, a newsrack, newsracks or newsrack zones along safe routes to schools shall be further limited in placement and/or number to allow a clear space for the passageway of pedestrians of not less than seven feet on a sidewalk on an arterial street, and shall be placed no closer than twenty feet from an intersection on an arterial street; and

(7)    When a newsrack zone exists, newsracks on a block or two hundred feet of block length must be placed in that newsrack zone.

(n)    The public works director may conduct a study based on use and safety to determine if more or less newsracks may be allowed in a group than is allowed in this subsection; the director’s determination will result in the increase or decrease of newsracks as is set forth in that study; in making the determination at the hearing, the public works director shall make findings that such a number of newsracks does not conflict with the purposes and goals set forth in Section 31.2-1A (f); the director’s determination may be appealed as a party may appeal the issuance or denial of a newsrack permit in Section 31.2-3B(i) when that issuance or denial is related to limits based on said determination;

(o)    When applications for permits for newsracks on a given block or location outnumber the spots available for newsracks on a block, then the public works director shall be guided solely by the following criteria in determining which newsracks shall be permitted:

(1)    First priority shall be given to permit-holders with the longest continuous tenure in a specific two hundred foot length of a block.

(2)    Second priority shall be given to newsracks used for the distribution of daily publications (those published on five or more days in a calendar week).

(3)    Third priority shall be given to newsracks used for the distribution of weekly publications (those published on at least one but less than five days in the calendar week).

(4)    Further priority shall be based on frequency of publication, with the higher priority given to publications for which new editions or issues were published most frequently in the full calendar month preceding the date of application.

(5)    Within groups of applicants with the same priority, permits shall be granted to the maximum allowable in a block by the drawing of lots as follows: the public works director shall assign the location at random by placing the name of all applicants for the remaining locations into a container from which the names shall be drawn, one at a time, by the director, until the remaining number of locations is filled.

(p)    All permitted newsracks in place at the time of the amendment of the newsrack ordinance that become in violation of the newsrack ordinance shall be considered legal nonconforming for the remainder of the time for which such newsracks are permitted or ninety days, whichever is less. At the expiration of that legal nonconforming status, and barring the issuance of a hardship waiver, such newsracks shall be brought into compliance with the newsrack ordinance before a permit may be issued. Newsracks in violation of Section 31.2-3 shall not be legal nonconforming and must be removed or otherwise brought into compliance therewith within fourteen days of the enactment or amendment of the newsrack ordinance unless a hardship waiver has been issued. Any previously paid permit fees will be credited towards a future permit or refunded pro rata if the removal of a newsrack or a renewal of a newsrack permit occurs prior to the expiration of a newsrack permit that was issued prior to an amendment making said newsrack in violation of the newsrack ordinance.

(q)    Parties that are denied permits per subsections (o) and (p) of this section, or because a block or a newsrack zone is already full of newsracks, may request notice of the expiration of a permit with equivalent or lesser priority for the location described in the denied permit application one month prior to the expiration thereof. Such noticed parties may then re-submit their application prior to the expiration of the permit with equivalent or lesser priority and such resubmitted-application and such application renewal shall be considered per subsections (o) and (p) of this section by the public works director.

(r)    Any party may petition for the review of any two hundred foot block length or safe route to school or newsrack zone thereon to determine if more or less newsracks may be allowed on that block length, route, or zone.

(1)    If the determination of the number of newsracks in the petition is to be based on the safety and use of the public area, then the petition shall be to the public works director and considered per subsection (n) of this section. The public works director shall then hold a hearing to determine whether a change in the number of newsracks is so allowable. That hearing shall be scheduled within ten business days after the receipt of the petition and shall be held by the public works director or his/her representative. Notice of the hearing shall be mailed, return receipt requested, or delivered five business days prior to such a hearing. Such person shall have three business days after the date of the hearing to appeal the ruling to the planning commission. The procedure for that appeal shall be as is set forth for the appeal of the issuance or denial of a newsrack permit in Section 31.2-3B(i).

(2)    If the determination of the number of newsracks in the petition is to be based on anything additional to or instead of the safety and use of the public area, including but not limited to blight or aesthetics, then the petition shall be considered by the planning commission. The planning commission shall consider the findings set forth in Section 31.2-1A in making its decision. The planning commission’s decision may be appealed to the city council within thirty days of the issuance of the decision of the planning commission in the form of a resolution. A hearing of the city council must be held within thirty days of the receipt of the notice of appeal. The appellant shall be given notice of the hearing on the appeal at least ten days before the hearing. (Ord. No. 2138 § 1.)


31.2-6 Newsracks—Removal—Hearing.

(a)    Any permitted newsrack installed, used or maintained in violation of the provisions of this chapter, or that must be removed for a public purpose, may be subject to removal and storage by the public works director or his/her duly authorized representative. At least ten business days prior to removal, the public works director or his/her representative shall transmit a written notice of the violation or the public purpose requiring such removal to the person whose name was provided in conformance with Section 31.2-3A(b)(2) via U.S. mail return receipt requested or by delivery. At any time within the ten-day notice period, an administrative hearing to challenge the existence of a violation or, alternatively the public purpose requiring removal, may be requested by such person. Such request may contain, or future correspondence to the director may contain, statements of evidence that an alleged violation has been corrected upon which the director may use to determine that the violation has been corrected without need for a hearing. Alternatively, the director may determine independently that a violation has been corrected without need for a hearing. If no such determination is made, and no request for a hearing has been made, then such failure to cure the problem or request a hearing therefor shall result in the removal and storage of the newsrack by the public works director or his/her representative at any time after the expiration of the ten-day period. The noticed party shall be informed in the notice of the party’s right to request the hearing.

(b)    If such person requests a hearing as provided in subsection (a) of this section, the hearing shall be scheduled within ten business days after the request and shall be held by the public works director or his/her representative. Notice of the hearing shall be mailed, return receipt requested, or delivered five business days prior to such a hearing. Such person shall have three business days after the date of any ruling which may result from the hearing to comply with the ruling, as directed, thereby. If, after three business days from the date of decision, such person has failed to comply with the provisions of the ruling, then the subject newsrack shall be removed and stored by the public works director or his/her representative.

(c)    The decision of the public works director may be appealed as is set forth for the appeal of the issuance or denial of a newsrack permit in Section 31.2-3B(i). An appeal will not stay the removal of a newsrack as set forth herein.

(d)    The cost of removal and storage by the city of any newsrack subject to the newsrack ordinance shall be chargeable as a civil debt in the amount of three hundred fifty dollars to the owner thereof and may be collected by the city in the same manner as it collects any other civil debt or obligation. In addition, a stored newsrack not reclaimed by the owner thereof within twenty-four hours after its removal will be charged a storage fee of twenty-five dollars per day. After thirty days, it shall be deemed to be unclaimed property and may be disposed of accordingly. (Ord. No. 2138 § 1.)


31.2-6A Newsracks—Summary removal.

(a)    In the event the public works director determines that the condition or placement of a newsrack constitutes a dangerous condition or obstruction, as defined in Section 31.2-3, or if the director determines that a newsrack has been placed on a public sidewalk or parkway without permit, or with an expired permit, or has been placed in any part of the roadway in violation of Section 31.2-2, the director may cause the newsrack to be removed and stored summarily and without a pre-removal hearing.

On a paved, constructed, or reconstructed street, the pavement surface shall not be cut or opened for a period of five years after completion or from the recordation of a notice of completion. On a slurry sealed street, the pavement surface shall not be cut or opened for a period of two years.

The city engineer may grant exemptions to the moratorium for emergencies which endanger life or property or interrupt essential utility service, for work that is mandated by city, state or federal legislation, for where no other reasonable means of providing service exists to a building, or for other situations deemed by the city engineer to be in the best interest of the city. When granting exceptions to this regulation, the city engineer may impose conditions determined appropriate to insure the rapid and complete restoration of the street and street paving. Repaving may include street grinding, base and sub-base repairs, restoration of pavement markings, and other related work as determined by the city engineer, and may include up to full-width street paving of the roadway.

Any person who is required to repave a street shall obtain a street improvement permit and shall be responsible for the full cost of plan preparation, plan review, construction inspection, material testing, bonding, and all other expenses related to the work.

Repaving will include a minimum width of five feet on all four sides of the trench limit or to the edge of the gutter, and grinding the pavement to a minimum depth of one and one-half inches with one and one-half inches of cap paving. For concrete streets, repaving shall be from joint to joint of Portland cement concrete pavement.

Pavement improvements shall be completed within ninety days of the completion of the work or project that required the pavement cut.

31.41 System generally.

Meridian Avenue shall be the base line for numbering all east and west streets, avenues, lanes, places and drives and El Centro Street shall form the base line for numbering all north and south streets, avenues, lanes, places and drives. All streets, avenues, lanes, places and drives not opened through to the base line shall be numbered in the same manner as if extended. For the purpose of numbering, the building shall be counted from the base line and each block allowed one hundred numbers, and each block shall carry a new hundred. Meridian Avenue shall be considered Tenth Street for numbering east and west streets, avenues, lanes, places and drives and El Centro Street shall be considered Tenth Street for numbering north and south streets, avenues, lanes, places and drives. Thus, the first blocks east of Meridian Avenue shall carry numbers between 1000 and 1100 and the first blocks west of Meridian Avenue shall carry numbers between 1000 and 900, numbers on east and west streets, avenues, lanes, places and drives to read up going east and down going west from Meridian Avenue. The first blocks north of El Centro Street shall carry numbers between 1000 and 900 and the first blocks south of El Centro Street shall carry numbers between 1000 and 1100, numbers on streets, avenues, lanes, places and drives running north and south shall read down going north and up going south from El Centro Street.

Odd numbers shall be assigned to the west and south sides of all streets, avenues, lanes, places and drives and even numbers shall be assigned to the east and north sides of all streets, avenues, lanes, places and drives.

31.2-1 Newsracks—Short title.

Sections 31.2-1 through 31.2-6A shall be known as the “newsrack ordinance.” (Ord. No. 2138 § 1.)


31.2-1A Newsracks—Intent and purpose.

The city council of the city of South Pasadena hereby finds and declares:

(a)    The city of South Pasadena has significant interests in:

(1)    Promoting vehicular traffic and pedestrian safety and convenience including but not limited to the event of motor vehicle parking and pedestrian standing related to the use of newsracks;

(2)    Preventing damage to public sidewalks, structures, and landscaping;

(3)    Preventing visual clutter; and

(4)    Protecting the aesthetic, natural, and historical character of South Pasadena.

(b)    The city of South Pasadena has a substantial interest in promoting the public health, safety, welfare and convenience of its citizens, businesses and visitors by ensuring that public streets, sidewalks and rights-of-way in the city are not unreasonably obstructed by newsracks and that newsracks are properly maintained.

(c)    In recent years, the proliferation of newsracks on the streets and sidewalks of the city, in particular excessive, poorly maintained or abandoned newsracks, have contributed to the congestion of the city sidewalks, impeded the flow of pedestrian traffic, interfered with the use of streets, sidewalks and public rights-of-way, presented hazards to persons and property and resulted in substantial visual blight.

(d)    The city of South Pasadena has a substantial interest in preserving and protecting the unique visual, historic, natural, and aesthetic qualities of the city. To that end, and consistent with the city’s general plan the city desires to take steps to reduce the visual blight, pedestrian inconvenience and hazards associated with an unlimited number and design of newsracks, poorly maintained newsracks and the unrestricted placement of newsracks on streets, sidewalks and rights-of-way in the city.

(e)    After extended inquiry by the city council and city staff, it has become clear that the most effective way to reduce the visual clutter and hazards associated with excessive numbers of newsracks and unregulated design or appearance of such newsracks is to prohibit the unlimited placement of private newsracks in the city and instead, institute a program to provide city-approved fixed newsracks of a consistent design, placement and color. Such clutter and hazards would be reduced by requiring that visually occurring groupings of newsracks occur at regular and predictable intervals to give the city’s streets a sense of aesthetic continuity.

(f)    Thus, the purpose of Sections 31.2-1 through 31.2-6A is to promote the public health, safety and welfare and the aesthetic qualities of the city by controlling the size, shape, construction and appearance of newsracks in the city as a reasonable time, manner and place regulation, so as to:

(1)    Provide for pedestrian and driving safety and convenience;

(2)    Ensure that there is no unreasonable interference with the flow of vehicular and pedestrian traffic, including ingress and egress from any city residence, place of business or public facility, or any legally parked or stopped vehicles;

(3)    Ensure compliance with Americans with Disabilities Act and improve passage for persons with disabilities by reducing impediments to passage caused by poorly-located newsracks;

(4)    Provide reasonable access for the safe and efficient use and maintenance of sidewalks, poles, posts, traffic signs or signals, hydrants, mailboxes, delivery areas, loading zones, transit shelters, curb and handicapped ramps and other street improvements;

(5)    Reduce visual blight and clutter and litter problems associated with poorly maintained or improperly located or abandoned newsracks and unnecessarily large groupings of newsracks;

(6)    Advance the economic interests of the city merchants and other information providers, including those involved in the publication and distribution of newspapers and periodicals through newsracks;

(7)    Protect the unique architectural, historical, natural, and aesthetic attributes of the city;

(8)    Reduce exposure of the city to personal injury or property damage claims and litigation;

(9)    Provide for public and property safety during emergency conditions;

(10)    Maintain and protect the values of surrounding properties;

(11)    Provide for and maintain the freedom of speech for newspapers or news periodicals using newsracks for distribution;

(12)    Discourage the stopping of motor vehicles within twenty feet of a crosswalk along a safe route to schools (a twenty foot distance is approximately the length of an average motor vehicle), because such stopping may cause the illegal blocking of crosswalks;

(13)    Prevent pedestrian students and their escorts from being forced off of a sidewalk along a “safe routes to schools” into arterial street traffic.

(g)    In adopting the ordinance codified in Sections 31.2-1 through 31.2-6A, the city council is mindful that newsrack regulations implicate rights protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution and Article I, Section 2 of the California Constitution. To that end, the city council hereby adopts these regulations and directs that their enforcement be conducted in a manner consistent with the constitutional rights of citizens and regulated parties.

(h)    Given the limited space available within the city’s rights-of-way, the city of South Pasadena has a substantial interest in devising a systematic approach to newsrack removal and placement in the city to ensure a fair and equitable distribution of newspapers and periodicals. The city council declares that this objective and the other aforementioned objectives are best achieved by adopting the ordinance codified in Sections 31.2-1 through 31.2-6A and creating regulations to allow fixed newsracks of a consistent design, placement and color and also by enhancing the aesthetic character of public areas through uniformity in the appearance thereof.

(i)    The city council further declares that allowing only newsracks of a consistent design, placement and color in the city directly promotes the city’s interests in promoting public safety, reducing visual blight and clutter, protecting the unique aesthetic and historical attributes of the city and advancing the economic interests of the city merchants and other information providers.

(j)    The city council finds that this project (newsrack ordinance) is exempt from the provisions of the Environmental Quality Act (“CEQA”) pursuant to Section 15061 (b)(3) of the CEQA Guidelines, because it can be seen with certainty that there is no possibility that this project will have a significant effect on the environment. The ordinance establishes regulations that will be followed in the issuance of ministerial permits and in code enforcement activities. The following are decisions that are not specifically decided in this newsrack ordinance: decisions as to the specific locations of newsrack zones as set forth in Section 31.2-1B(g); or, decisions besides those relating to use or safety regarding the number of allowed newsracks on a specific block or newsrack zone as set forth in Section 31.2-4(r). (Ord. No. 2138 § 1.)

No permit shall be issued unless the public works director or his/her duly authorized representative determines the location complies with the standards and criteria set forth in Section 31.2-4. A permit shall condition the installation, use and maintenance of a newsrack on compliance with the provisions of the newsrack ordinance and other laws including, but not limited to, the federal law known as the Americans with Disabilities Act.

(b)    Such permits shall be valid for one year and shall be renewable annually. If the public works director determines that a newsrack is otherwise in compliance with the code, then no additional information shall be required of the permittee upon renewal. However, the public works director may decide not to renew a permit per Sections 31.2-4(o), (p) and (q).

(c)    A condition for issuance of a permit pursuant to Sections 32.2-1 through 32.2-6A is that every permittee agrees to maintain a policy of public liability insurance, naming the city, its officials, officers, agents and employees as an additional insured, in an amount not less than fifty thousand dollars combined single limit for any injury to persons and/or damage to property by reason of installation, use and maintenance of such newsrack on public property. The policy shall provide that the insurance coverage shall not be cancelled or reduced by the insurance carrier without the city having been given thirty business days prior written notice thereof by such carrier. The permittee shall provide and keep in force that policy of public liability insurance during such time as it continues to operate any newsrack under the terms of the Sections 32.2-1 through 32.2-6A. If the insurance is canceled at any time during the term of the permit, it shall be grounds for revocation of the permit. The application for a permit and all renewal applications shall require an endorsement signed by an authorized officer of such insurer as applicant’s proof of such a policy of public liability insurance.

(d)    A condition for issuance of a permit pursuant to Sections 32.2-1 through 32.2-6A is that every permittee agrees to defend, indemnify and hold harmless the city, its officials, officers, agents and employees, from any loss or liability or damage, including expenses and costs, for bodily or personal injury, and for property damage sustained by any person as a result of the installation, use or maintenance of the applicant’s newsrack within the city, and the permit application shall include an indemnification provision consistent with this section and approved by the city attorney.

(e)    The issuance or granting of a newsrack permit shall not be construed to be a permit for, or an approval of, any violation of any of the provisions of this Code or of any ordinance of the city. Permits presuming to give authority to violate or cancel the provisions of this Code or other ordinances of the city shall not be valid.

(f)    The issuance of a permit based on plans and other data shall not prevent the public works director from thereafter requiring the correction of errors in such plans or data or from preventing operations being carried on when in violation of any ordinance of the city.

(g)    Any applicant for a newsrack permit may request the city’s waiver of the requirements set forth in Sections 32.2-1 through 32.2-6A for financial reasons. A statement of financial hardship, without need for evidentiary support, due to the application of Sections 32.2-1 through 32.2-6A shall result in the issuance of a hardship waiver for a period of six months by the public works director. A further waiver would be approved if a reasonable time-line is provided in which the newsracks will be made compliant. Such a “reasonable” time-line would balance the length of the conformance time-line with any evidence provided regarding the relative cost-burden on the applicant. The public works director may defer the decision of whether to grant such a further hardship waiver to the planning commission.

(h)    Any newsrack permit issued on the basis of incorrect information or a fraudulent representation shall be void.

(i)    The issuance or denial of a newsrack permit shall occur within thirty days of the public works director’s receipt of the permit application. The issuance or denial of a newsrack permit may be appealed to the planning commission by any party within three business days of the issuance or denial thereof. A hearing must be held within thirty days of the receipt of the notice of appeal. The appellant shall be given notice of the hearing on the appeal at least ten days before the hearing. The decision of the planning commission may be appealed to the city council within three business days of the issuance of the decision of the planning commission. A hearing must be held within thirty days of the receipt of the notice of appeal. The appellant shall be given notice of the hearing on the appeal at least ten days before the hearing. (Ord. No. 2138 § 1.)


31.2-4 Newsracks—Standards for maintenance and installation.

Any newsrack which in whole or in part rests upon, in or over any public sidewalk or parkway shall comply with the following standards:

(a)    Newsracks shall be made of metal, shall have a metal framed transparent door, and shall sit on one or four legs equal in height to the height of the case holding the newspaper(s) or other publication(s). Each newsrack must be dark green in color to match a dark-green color commonly used in the newsrack industry and as is available from the public works director for review. No newsrack shall exceed fifty-two inches in height, thirty inches in width, or twenty-four inches in depth or be less than ten percent of those dimensions. The fifty-two inches in height is measured from the sidewalk surface upon which the newsrack is fixed to the top of the newsrack, including coin collection and activation devices. Newspapers may request from the public works director an exception from the green color requirement if that newsrack has a trademark color combination that is used on its newsracks generally. The public works director’s determination of whether a trademark color exists will be based on evidence of prior and current consistent usage of that trademark color. Such determinations may be appealed as set forth in Section 31.2-3B(i). However, no color exceptions would be allowed in historic districts, or on sidewalks within ten feet of a historic landmark assuming an exception set forth in subsection (e) of this section is made.

(b)    The name, address and telephone number of a responsible person who may be contacted at any time concerning the newsrack shall be displayed on the door of the newsrack in such manner as to be readily visible and readable to a prospective customer thereof.

(c)    Newsracks shall not be attached to any permanently fixed public object or public utility object besides the actual sidewalk surface by way of bolts as further set forth herein.

(d)    Each newsrack shall be bolted to the sidewalk in accordance with the standards on file in the office of the public works director. Newsracks may not be chained or otherwise attached to one another in groups. No newsrack shall be stacked vertically, i.e., two separate dispensers using the same four legs for support, but more then one paper may be dispensed from the same dispenser.

(e)    No newsracks shall obscure or block the view of or access to cultural and historic sites, natural features, landmarks, or structures as listed in the city’s register of approved landmarks. It shall be assumed that a newsrack placed on a sidewalk within ten feet of such a registered location obscures or blocks the view thereof. Exceptions from this requirement may be based on the consideration of the location including a review of whether pedestrian access and views are obscured by the newsrack and whether there are nearby locations (beyond ten feet from the location and visually perceivable from the location) for the placement of a newsrack(s).

(f)    Subject to and as limited by the provisions of Section 31.2-3, no newsrack or newsrack zone shall be placed, installed, used or maintained in a public place:

(1)    Within five feet of any marked crosswalk;

(2)    Within fifteen feet of the curb return of any unmarked crosswalk;

(3)    Within five feet of any fire hydrant, fire call box, police call box or other emergency facility;

(4)    Within five feet of any driveway;

(5)    Within five feet ahead of or twenty-five feet to the rear of any sign marked a designated bus stop;

(6)    Within five feet of any bus bench;

(7)    At any location whereby the clear space for the passageway of pedestrians is reduced to less than five feet;

(8)    Within three feet of any area improved with lawn, flowers, shrubs or trees, or within three feet of any display window of any building abutting the sidewalk or parkway, or in such manner as to impede or interfere with the reasonable use of such window for display purposes; or

(9)    On a block on the “vehicle passenger’s” side of an arterial street, no newsrack shall be closer than thirty feet from an approaching crosswalk (i.e., the crosswalk before an intersection where a vehicle would stop at a red traffic-light or stop-sign) of that street, whether that arterial street intersects with a non-arterial or another arterial street.

(h)    No newsrack shall be used for advertising signs or publicity purposes other than that dealing with the display, sale or purchase of the newspaper or news periodical sold therein.

(i)    Each newsrack shall be maintained in a clean, operational, neat and attractive condition and in good repair at all times. Broken, missing or discolored glass or other transparent panel shall be promptly replaced. A newsrack shall be cleaned within forty-eight hours to remove graffiti, dirt, oils, and other foreign matter upon notice thereof.

(j)    No newsrack shall be permitted to remain in other than its vertical, working position for more than twenty-four hours.

(k)    No newsrack may remain empty in excess of thirty-two consecutive days.

(l)    Material offered for sale must be the current edition of the publication so offered.

(m)    Newsracks must be grouped (i.e., side-by-side) and placed as follows:

(1)    No more than six newsracks shall be allowed per group of newsracks;

(2)    Newsracks sharing the same two hundred foot length of a block shall be placed side by side or within a newsrack zone where marked;

(3)    There shall be no more than six newsracks per every two hundred feet of a block wherein each two hundred feet of a block are measured from the nearest location to an intersection on the block where a newsrack may be placed;

(4)    Where a grouping of six cannot be accommodated due to hardscape features, there may be up to two lesser groupings subject to the limit of six newsracks per two hundred feet of a block;

(5)    When newsrack groups cannot be separated by two hundred feet of block length, newsrack groups shall be placed at regularly distances on a block to create visually re-occurring groupings to the extent possible;

(6)    To accommodate the safe travel of students along safe routes to schools that are on arterial streets, a newsrack, newsracks or newsrack zones along safe routes to schools shall be further limited in placement and/or number to allow a clear space for the passageway of pedestrians of not less than seven feet on a sidewalk on an arterial street, and shall be placed no closer than twenty feet from an intersection on an arterial street; and

(7)    When a newsrack zone exists, newsracks on a block or two hundred feet of block length must be placed in that newsrack zone.

(n)    The public works director may conduct a study based on use and safety to determine if more or less newsracks may be allowed in a group than is allowed in this subsection; the director’s determination will result in the increase or decrease of newsracks as is set forth in that study; in making the determination at the hearing, the public works director shall make findings that such a number of newsracks does not conflict with the purposes and goals set forth in Section 31.2-1A (f); the director’s determination may be appealed as a party may appeal the issuance or denial of a newsrack permit in Section 31.2-3B(i) when that issuance or denial is related to limits based on said determination;

(o)    When applications for permits for newsracks on a given block or location outnumber the spots available for newsracks on a block, then the public works director shall be guided solely by the following criteria in determining which newsracks shall be permitted:

(1)    First priority shall be given to permit-holders with the longest continuous tenure in a specific two hundred foot length of a block.

(2)    Second priority shall be given to newsracks used for the distribution of daily publications (those published on five or more days in a calendar week).

(3)    Third priority shall be given to newsracks used for the distribution of weekly publications (those published on at least one but less than five days in the calendar week).

(4)    Further priority shall be based on frequency of publication, with the higher priority given to publications for which new editions or issues were published most frequently in the full calendar month preceding the date of application.

(5)    Within groups of applicants with the same priority, permits shall be granted to the maximum allowable in a block by the drawing of lots as follows: the public works director shall assign the location at random by placing the name of all applicants for the remaining locations into a container from which the names shall be drawn, one at a time, by the director, until the remaining number of locations is filled.

(p)    All permitted newsracks in place at the time of the amendment of the newsrack ordinance that become in violation of the newsrack ordinance shall be considered legal nonconforming for the remainder of the time for which such newsracks are permitted or ninety days, whichever is less. At the expiration of that legal nonconforming status, and barring the issuance of a hardship waiver, such newsracks shall be brought into compliance with the newsrack ordinance before a permit may be issued. Newsracks in violation of Section 31.2-3 shall not be legal nonconforming and must be removed or otherwise brought into compliance therewith within fourteen days of the enactment or amendment of the newsrack ordinance unless a hardship waiver has been issued. Any previously paid permit fees will be credited towards a future permit or refunded pro rata if the removal of a newsrack or a renewal of a newsrack permit occurs prior to the expiration of a newsrack permit that was issued prior to an amendment making said newsrack in violation of the newsrack ordinance.

(q)    Parties that are denied permits per subsections (o) and (p) of this section, or because a block or a newsrack zone is already full of newsracks, may request notice of the expiration of a permit with equivalent or lesser priority for the location described in the denied permit application one month prior to the expiration thereof. Such noticed parties may then re-submit their application prior to the expiration of the permit with equivalent or lesser priority and such resubmitted-application and such application renewal shall be considered per subsections (o) and (p) of this section by the public works director.

(r)    Any party may petition for the review of any two hundred foot block length or safe route to school or newsrack zone thereon to determine if more or less newsracks may be allowed on that block length, route, or zone.

(1)    If the determination of the number of newsracks in the petition is to be based on the safety and use of the public area, then the petition shall be to the public works director and considered per subsection (n) of this section. The public works director shall then hold a hearing to determine whether a change in the number of newsracks is so allowable. That hearing shall be scheduled within ten business days after the receipt of the petition and shall be held by the public works director or his/her representative. Notice of the hearing shall be mailed, return receipt requested, or delivered five business days prior to such a hearing. Such person shall have three business days after the date of the hearing to appeal the ruling to the planning commission. The procedure for that appeal shall be as is set forth for the appeal of the issuance or denial of a newsrack permit in Section 31.2-3B(i).

(2)    If the determination of the number of newsracks in the petition is to be based on anything additional to or instead of the safety and use of the public area, including but not limited to blight or aesthetics, then the petition shall be considered by the planning commission. The planning commission shall consider the findings set forth in Section 31.2-1A in making its decision. The planning commission’s decision may be appealed to the city council within thirty days of the issuance of the decision of the planning commission in the form of a resolution. A hearing of the city council must be held within thirty days of the receipt of the notice of appeal. The appellant shall be given notice of the hearing on the appeal at least ten days before the hearing. (Ord. No. 2138 § 1.)


31.2-6 Newsracks—Removal—Hearing.

(a)    Any permitted newsrack installed, used or maintained in violation of the provisions of this chapter, or that must be removed for a public purpose, may be subject to removal and storage by the public works director or his/her duly authorized representative. At least ten business days prior to removal, the public works director or his/her representative shall transmit a written notice of the violation or the public purpose requiring such removal to the person whose name was provided in conformance with Section 31.2-3A(b)(2) via U.S. mail return receipt requested or by delivery. At any time within the ten-day notice period, an administrative hearing to challenge the existence of a violation or, alternatively the public purpose requiring removal, may be requested by such person. Such request may contain, or future correspondence to the director may contain, statements of evidence that an alleged violation has been corrected upon which the director may use to determine that the violation has been corrected without need for a hearing. Alternatively, the director may determine independently that a violation has been corrected without need for a hearing. If no such determination is made, and no request for a hearing has been made, then such failure to cure the problem or request a hearing therefor shall result in the removal and storage of the newsrack by the public works director or his/her representative at any time after the expiration of the ten-day period. The noticed party shall be informed in the notice of the party’s right to request the hearing.

(b)    If such person requests a hearing as provided in subsection (a) of this section, the hearing shall be scheduled within ten business days after the request and shall be held by the public works director or his/her representative. Notice of the hearing shall be mailed, return receipt requested, or delivered five business days prior to such a hearing. Such person shall have three business days after the date of any ruling which may result from the hearing to comply with the ruling, as directed, thereby. If, after three business days from the date of decision, such person has failed to comply with the provisions of the ruling, then the subject newsrack shall be removed and stored by the public works director or his/her representative.

(c)    The decision of the public works director may be appealed as is set forth for the appeal of the issuance or denial of a newsrack permit in Section 31.2-3B(i). An appeal will not stay the removal of a newsrack as set forth herein.

(d)    The cost of removal and storage by the city of any newsrack subject to the newsrack ordinance shall be chargeable as a civil debt in the amount of three hundred fifty dollars to the owner thereof and may be collected by the city in the same manner as it collects any other civil debt or obligation. In addition, a stored newsrack not reclaimed by the owner thereof within twenty-four hours after its removal will be charged a storage fee of twenty-five dollars per day. After thirty days, it shall be deemed to be unclaimed property and may be disposed of accordingly. (Ord. No. 2138 § 1.)


31.2-6A Newsracks—Summary removal.

(a)    In the event the public works director determines that the condition or placement of a newsrack constitutes a dangerous condition or obstruction, as defined in Section 31.2-3, or if the director determines that a newsrack has been placed on a public sidewalk or parkway without permit, or with an expired permit, or has been placed in any part of the roadway in violation of Section 31.2-2, the director may cause the newsrack to be removed and stored summarily and without a pre-removal hearing.

(b)    The director shall provide the person identified on the newsrack, or if there is no such person identifiable then to such person as may reasonably be identified as the newsrack owner, or the publisher of the newspaper or publisher if any such newspaper or publication is located within the newsrack, with the opportunity for a post-storage hearing to determine the validity of the storage.

(4)    A statement that, in order to receive their post-storage hearing, the person identified in subsection (b) of this section must request the hearing in person, writing, or by telephone within five business days of the date appearing on the notice from the public works director.

(d)    The post-storage hearing must be held by the public works director within ten business days of the receipt of the request for the hearing. The requesting party shall be given notice of the hearing at least five business days before the hearing. The decision of the public works director may be appealed as is set forth for the appeal of the issuance or denial of a newsrack permit in Section 31.2-3B(i).

(e)    Failure of either the person identified in subsection (b) of this section to request or to attend a scheduled hearing shall satisfy the post-storage hearing requirement.

(f)    The city shall be responsible for the costs incurred for removal and storage of a summarily removed newsrack if it is determined in the post-storage hearing that reasonable grounds for the removal or storage, as applicable, are not established.

(g)    The person identified in subsection (b) of this section shall be responsible for the costs incurred for the removal and storage of a summarily removed newsrack if it is determined in the post-storage hearing that reasonable grounds existed for the removal or storage, as applicable, of the newsrack, or if that person fails to request a hearing in accordance with this section. Such costs for storage and removal and the related procedures for the disposal thereof shall be as further set forth in Section 31.2-6(d). (Ord. No. 2138, § 1.)


31.2-7 Signs in the public right-of-way

After any excavation is commenced under a permit issued under this article, the work of making and refilling the same shall be prosecuted diligently and so as not to obstruct the street or travel thereon more than is actually necessary. If work is not so prosecuted, or if the work of refilling does not, in the judgment of the city engineer, comply with the terms of this article, he shall notify the person named in the permit and doing or causing the work to be done, that the work is not being prosecuted with due diligence, or that the refilling is not being properly done, and shall require such person, within five days after the service of such notice, to proceed with the diligent prosecution of the work, or to properly fill the same as the case may be. If such notice is not complied with, the city engineer will do such work as may be necessary to refill such excavation and to restore the street to as good condition as the same was in before the excavation was made. (Ord. No. 413, § 8; Ord. No. 1983, § 75.)


31.19 Location of works.

It shall be unlawful for any person to install or cause to be installed any works, except poles, tracks, manholes, culverts, catch basins and similar appliances, and works which, from their nature, must be on the surface of the street, in any street at a distance less than two feet, six inches below the established grade of the center line of such street. Where not already occupied, the location in the center of any street for a width of five feet is reserved for the construction and maintenance of public sewers, except in the case of streets having two roadways. (Ord. No. 413, § 17)


31.20 Guarantee against defects in workmanship or materials.

The person by whom any excavation shall be made in any street shall be deemed and held to guarantee the work of refilling and repairing thereof, for the period of one year, against all defects in workmanship or materials. Upon completion of the work of refilling, written notice thereof shall be given to the city engineer, who shall make note of the day when given upon the statement covering and describing the work, and such period of one year shall be deemed to run from the day of giving such notice of completion. Whenever, prior to the expiration of such period of one year, any part of the surface of such street becomes in need of repairs by reason of any defective workmanship or materials, or in the work or refilling or repairing, the city engineer shall serve upon the person by whom the excavation was made, as appears from the statement filed covering the work, a written notice stating the repairs necessary and requiring such repairs to be made within five days after the service of such notice. If the same is not complied with, the city engineer shall, at once, make such repairs. (Ord. No. 413, § 9; Ord. No. 1983, § 76.)


31.21 Work by city generally.

Whenever the city council shall, by motion or resolution, determine that the public interest will be subserved by the city doing the work of resurfacing the portion of the street where excavations or any particular class thereof are made, then the city engineer may deduct from the special or general deposits made thereunder, the cost to the city of doing the work. Every deposit, whether general or special, shall be deemed to have been made in contemplation of the provisions of this article, and in particular in the contemplation of the exercise by the city of the power to do the work of resurfacing as herein provided, and deducting the costs thereof from such deposit.

31.27-1 Street cut moratorium on newly paved streets.

On a paved, constructed, or reconstructed street, the pavement surface shall not be cut or opened for a period of five years after completion or from the recordation of a notice of completion. On a slurry sealed street, the pavement surface shall not be cut or opened for a period of two years.

The city engineer may grant exemptions to the moratorium for emergencies which endanger life or property or interrupt essential utility service, for work that is mandated by city, state or federal legislation, for where no other reasonable means of providing service exists to a building, or for other situations deemed by the city engineer to be in the best interest of the city. When granting exceptions to this regulation, the city engineer may impose conditions determined appropriate to insure the rapid and complete restoration of the street and street paving. Repaving may include street grinding, base and sub-base repairs, restoration of pavement markings, and other related work as determined by the city engineer, and may include up to full-width street paving of the roadway.

Any person who is required to repave a street shall obtain a street improvement permit and shall be responsible for the full cost of plan preparation, plan review, construction inspection, material testing, bonding, and all other expenses related to the work.

Repaving will include a minimum width of five feet on all four sides of the trench limit or to the edge of the gutter, and grinding the pavement to a minimum depth of one and one-half inches with one and one-half inches of cap paving. For concrete streets, repaving shall be from joint to joint of Portland cement concrete pavement.

Pavement improvements shall be completed within ninety days of the completion of the work or project that required the pavement cut. If the city engineer determines that restoration of the street is not appropriate at a particular time for reasons relating to weather or other short term factors, the city engineer may order a postponement until proper conditions allow for restoration work.

34.11 Criteria for approving tree removal permit applications.

(a)    Subject to the imposition of conditions pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, a tree removal permit may be issued in any one of the following instances:

(1)    Where the tree poses a reasonable risk of injury or harm to persons or property or is substantially interfering with the structural integrity or the use of an existing structure (including, but not limited to, a fence or wall), swimming pool, or building and there is no feasible and reasonable alternative to mitigate the interference.

(2)    Where, upon taking into account the size, shape, topography and existing trees upon the lot, the denial of the permit would create an unreasonable hardship on the property owner. Redesign of any proposed development as an alternative to removal of an existing protected tree does not create an unreasonable hardship.

(3)    Where a written determination has been made by a certified arborist, after a visual inspection or scientific evaluation, that the tree is so diseased or damaged that it is no longer viable or is a threat to persons or property, including to other trees. The director or commission may waive the requirement for a certified arborist’s written statement when the tree can reasonably be determined to be dead by a layperson’s visual inspection or when, after conducting an inspection of the tree, the director determines that the tree poses an obvious and imminent threat to life or property.

(4)    For the removal of a significant or mature tree, where the proposed replacement tree(s) are of greater value or provide greater benefits than the tree proposed for removal.

(b)    A tree removal permit may be conditioned upon the replacement or transplanting of the tree either on or off site. Such replacement or transplanting shall be subject to the following provisions:

(1)    Designation by the director or the commission of the number, size, species, and location of replacement tree(s) proposed for removal, the significance of the tree(s) on the lot as viewed from a public right-of-way, the size of the lot, and the number of existing trees on the lot.

(2)    Because of its size and/or significance, a single tree proposed to be removed may be required to be replaced with multiple trees. If the subject property cannot accommodate multiple trees, alternative locations within the city (public right-of-way, park, etc.) may be designated.

(3)    If a replacement tree is required, the property owner must agree to accept the conditions of replacement by his or her signature on the permit application and make the replacement tree deposit (per SPMC 34.10(a)(5) or (b)(3)) before issuance of the permit.

(4)    When the work designated in the permit is completed, the applicant shall contact the public works department for an inspection of the work. Any tree removal will require complete removal and grinding of the stump and backfilling of the hole.

(5)    Should a designated replacement or transplanted tree not survive for a period of two years, the applicant shall be required to replace it with another tree or pay to the city the full cost of replacing the tree at a location to be determined by the city.

(6)    Where the permit allows or requires the replacement or transplanting of tree(s), the director or commission may, in their discretion, as an alternative to subsection (b)(5) of this section, require the applicant to post a bond or surety for a five-year period against the survival of the tree(s). The amount of the bond or surety shall be in accordance with the “Guide for Plant Appraisal” (ISA publication, most recent edition).

(7)    Unless otherwise stated in the conditions of approval, the tree removal permit shall be valid for a period of one year with the planting of any new trees on the applicant’s property to occur during the next planting season as determined by ANSI standards and local climate conditions. (Ord. No. 2328, § 1 (part), 2019.)


34.12 Tree removal and replacement plans.

Tree removal and replacement plans shall contain the following information:

(a)    A drawing of the property which shows the location and species of all existing protected trees;

(b)    A site plan showing the proposed development, including all existing and proposed structures, including the topography of the site, in accordance with SPMC 34.9(b);

(c)    The tree species and trunk caliper of all trees to be removed;

(d)    The reason for removal. Any trees proposed for removal due to poor health or condition shall have the condition of the tree documented in a written report prepared and signed by a certified arborist;

(e)    A second drawing of the property after the proposed tree removal which shows remaining trees and all proposed replacement trees. The replacement tree sizes and species must be clearly identified; and

(f)    A certified arborist review of the tree plan, if required by the director. The certified arborist shall be contracted and managed by the city and all fees incurred shall be the responsibility of the property owner. (Ord. No. 2328, § 1 (part), 2019.)


34.12-5 Replacement tree requirements.

(b)    Penalties for an intentional violation of this chapter not associated with development shall be as follows:

(1)    The penalties described in subsection (a) of this section; and

(2)    The payment of a tree replacement fee in an amount up to, but not to exceed double, the value of the destroyed, removed, or damaged tree. The city arborist shall determine the value of the destroyed, removed, or damaged tree by using the most recent edition of the ISA Guide for Plant Appraisal.

(c)    Penalties for an intentional violation in connection with development or anticipated future development on the property shall be the penalties described in subsections (a) and (b) of this section and, in addition, the city manager may, in his or her discretion, refer the violation to the city prosecutor for criminal charges or to the planning commission for public hearing. The burden of proof shall be on the city to demonstrate that there is clear and convincing evidence to a reasonable certainty that there is an intentional violation. The planning commission, after considering all of the evidence, may impose the additional penalty of prohibiting the issuance of building or construction-related permits for a period up to five years from the date of the violation for the property upon which the violation occurred.

In determining whether a building permit may be issued with regard to the aforementioned prohibition, the planning commission shall consider whether the tree violation appears to be in furtherance of a development, as evidenced in the extent of tree damage, removal, damage to the root system, and/or excessive trimming of trees within the buildable area of a property; oral or written admissions; actions taken despite prior warnings; notices of violations; and the number and size of the damaged and/or removed trees.

Intentional violations in the context of development or anticipated development of property shall require the planning commission to determine whether restitution trees are to be planted on the property on which the violation occurred or on public land with costs paid to the city for tree selection, planting and maintenance, or a combination of both. The restitution trees shall be subject to either of the survival guarantees described in SPMC 34.11(b)(5) or (6).

For purposes of this section, the violation shall be presumed to have occurred on the date the city has actual knowledge of the violation, and the violator shall have the burden of proving an earlier commencement date, if entitlement to an earlier date is claimed.

Notwithstanding the aforementioned prohibition, building or construction-related permits may be issued if, in the opinion of the director of planning and building, they are necessary for the preservation of public health, safety or welfare.

(d)    Payment of any penalty and planting of replacement trees shall occur within 60 calendar days of the date the violator was directed to take such action by the director. If the violator does not complete planting of replacement trees within the allotted time, the director may procure and plant the requisite replacement trees, and the violator shall be responsible for reimbursing the city for such additional costs. Reimbursement is due and payable within 30 calendar days of the city’s issuance of a billing statement.

If payment of the penalty or reimbursement costs is not received by the city in 60 calendar days, the city manager can instruct that the outstanding obligation be collected in any of the following manners:

(1)    A civil action in the name of the city, in any court of competent jurisdiction; or

(2)    Use of a debt collection agency; or

(3)    A lien on the subject property.

(e)    All penalties and additional costs related to a tree violation must be paid to the city prior to its issuance of building or construction-related permits unless, in the opinion of the director of planning and building, such permits are necessary for the preservation of public health, safety or welfare.

34.11 Criteria for approving tree removal permit applications.

(a)    Subject to the imposition of conditions pursuant to subsection (b) of this section, a tree removal permit may be issued in any one of the following instances:

(1)    Where the tree poses a reasonable risk of injury or harm to persons or property or is substantially interfering with the structural integrity or the use of an existing structure (including, but not limited to, a fence or wall), swimming pool, or building and there is no feasible and reasonable alternative to mitigate the interference.

(2)    Where, upon taking into account the size, shape, topography and existing trees upon the lot, the denial of the permit would create an unreasonable hardship on the property owner. Redesign of any proposed development as an alternative to removal of an existing protected tree does not create an unreasonable hardship.

(3)    Where a written determination has been made by a certified arborist, after a visual inspection or scientific evaluation, that the tree is so diseased or damaged that it is no longer viable or is a threat to persons or property, including to other trees. The director or commission may waive the requirement for a certified arborist’s written statement when the tree can reasonably be determined to be dead by a layperson’s visual inspection or when, after conducting an inspection of the tree, the director determines that the tree poses an obvious and imminent threat to life or property.

(4)    For the removal of a significant or mature tree, where the proposed replacement tree(s) are of greater value or provide greater benefits than the tree proposed for removal.

(b)    A tree removal permit may be conditioned upon the replacement or transplanting of the tree either on or off site. Such replacement or transplanting shall be subject to the following provisions:

(1)    Designation by the director or the commission of the number, size, species, and location of replacement tree(s) proposed for removal, the significance of the tree(s) on the lot as viewed from a public right-of-way, the size of the lot, and the number of existing trees on the lot.

(2)    Because of its size and/or significance, a single tree proposed to be removed may be required to be replaced with multiple trees. If the subject property cannot accommodate multiple trees, alternative locations within the city (public right-of-way, park, etc.) may be designated.

(3)    If a replacement tree is required, the property owner must agree to accept the conditions of replacement by his or her signature on the permit application and make the replacement tree deposit (per SPMC 34.10(a)(5) or (b)(3)) before issuance of the permit.

(4)    When the work designated in the permit is completed, the applicant shall contact the public works department for an inspection of the work. Any tree removal will require complete removal and grinding of the stump and backfilling of the hole.

(5)    Should a designated replacement or transplanted tree not survive for a period of two years, the applicant shall be required to replace it with another tree or pay to the city the full cost of replacing the tree at a location to be determined by the city.

(6)    Where the permit allows or requires the replacement or transplanting of tree(s), the director or commission may, in their discretion, as an alternative to subsection (b)(5) of this section, require the applicant to post a bond or surety for a five-year period against the survival of the tree(s). The amount of the bond or surety shall be in accordance with the “Guide for Plant Appraisal” (ISA publication, most recent edition).

(7)    Unless otherwise stated in the conditions of approval, the tree removal permit shall be valid for a period of one year with the planting of any new trees on the applicant’s property to occur during the next planting season as determined by ANSI standards and local climate conditions. (Ord. No. 2328, § 1 (part), 2019.)


34.12 Tree removal and replacement plans.

Tree removal and replacement plans shall contain the following information:

(a)    A drawing of the property which shows the location and species of all existing protected trees;

(b)    A site plan showing the proposed development, including all existing and proposed structures, including the topography of the site, in accordance with SPMC 34.9(b);

(c)    The tree species and trunk caliper of all trees to be removed;

(d)    The reason for removal. Any trees proposed for removal due to poor health or condition shall have the condition of the tree documented in a written report prepared and signed by a certified arborist;

(e)    A second drawing of the property after the proposed tree removal which shows remaining trees and all proposed replacement trees. The replacement tree sizes and species must be clearly identified; and

(f)    A certified arborist review of the tree plan, if required by the director. The certified arborist shall be contracted and managed by the city and all fees incurred shall be the responsibility of the property owner. (Ord. No. 2328, § 1 (part), 2019.)


34.12-5 Replacement tree requirements.

(b)    Penalties for an intentional violation of this chapter not associated with development shall be as follows:

(1)    The penalties described in subsection (a) of this section; and

(2)    The payment of a tree replacement fee in an amount up to, but not to exceed double, the value of the destroyed, removed, or damaged tree. The city arborist shall determine the value of the destroyed, removed, or damaged tree by using the most recent edition of the ISA Guide for Plant Appraisal.

(c)    Penalties for an intentional violation in connection with development or anticipated future development on the property shall be the penalties described in subsections (a) and (b) of this section and, in addition, the city manager may, in his or her discretion, refer the violation to the city prosecutor for criminal charges or to the planning commission for public hearing. The burden of proof shall be on the city to demonstrate that there is clear and convincing evidence to a reasonable certainty that there is an intentional violation. The planning commission, after considering all of the evidence, may impose the additional penalty of prohibiting the issuance of building or construction-related permits for a period up to five years from the date of the violation for the property upon which the violation occurred.

In determining whether a building permit may be issued with regard to the aforementioned prohibition, the planning commission shall consider whether the tree violation appears to be in furtherance of a development, as evidenced in the extent of tree damage, removal, damage to the root system, and/or excessive trimming of trees within the buildable area of a property; oral or written admissions; actions taken despite prior warnings; notices of violations; and the number and size of the damaged and/or removed trees.

Intentional violations in the context of development or anticipated development of property shall require the planning commission to determine whether restitution trees are to be planted on the property on which the violation occurred or on public land with costs paid to the city for tree selection, planting and maintenance, or a combination of both. The restitution trees shall be subject to either of the survival guarantees described in SPMC 34.11(b)(5) or (6).

For purposes of this section, the violation shall be presumed to have occurred on the date the city has actual knowledge of the violation, and the violator shall have the burden of proving an earlier commencement date, if entitlement to an earlier date is claimed.

Notwithstanding the aforementioned prohibition, building or construction-related permits may be issued if, in the opinion of the director of planning and building, they are necessary for the preservation of public health, safety or welfare.

(d)    Payment of any penalty and planting of replacement trees shall occur within 60 calendar days of the date the violator was directed to take such action by the director. If the violator does not complete planting of replacement trees within the allotted time, the director may procure and plant the requisite replacement trees, and the violator shall be responsible for reimbursing the city for such additional costs. Reimbursement is due and payable within 30 calendar days of the city’s issuance of a billing statement.

If payment of the penalty or reimbursement costs is not received by the city in 60 calendar days, the city manager can instruct that the outstanding obligation be collected in any of the following manners:

(1)    A civil action in the name of the city, in any court of competent jurisdiction; or

(2)    Use of a debt collection agency; or

(3)    A lien on the subject property.

(e)    All penalties and additional costs related to a tree violation must be paid to the city prior to its issuance of building or construction-related permits unless, in the opinion of the director of planning and building, such permits are necessary for the preservation of public health, safety or welfare.

ARTICLE III. WATER EFFICIENT LANDSCAPE


35.50 Purpose.

(a)    On April 1, 2015, Governor Brown issued Executive Order No. B-29-15 directing the California Department of Water Resources to update the state’s model water efficient landscape ordinance, previously adopted in 2010 under the Water Conservation in Landscaping Act (Cal. Gov’t Code § 65591 et seq.). Local agencies, consistent with the Department of Water Resources’ regulations and the Water Conservation in Landscaping Act, must adopt the model ordinance (as set forth in Cal. Code Regs. Title 23, Division 2, Chapter 2.7) or a water efficient landscape ordinance that is, based on evidence in the record, at least as effective in conserving water as the model ordinance. With this Article III of Chapter 35 SPMC, the city has adopted the state’s 2015 model ordinance.

(b)    The Legislature, in the Water Conservation in Landscaping Act, found:

(1)    That the waters of the state are of limited supply and are subject to ever increasing demands;

(2)    That the continuation of California’s economic prosperity is dependent on the availability of adequate supplies of water for future uses;

(3)    That it is the policy of the state to promote the conservation and efficient use of water and to prevent the waste of this valuable resource;

(4)    That landscapes are essential to the quality of life in California by providing areas for active and passive recreation and as an enhancement to the environment by cleaning air and water, preventing erosion, offering fire protection, and replacing ecosystems lost to development;

(5)    That landscape design, installation, maintenance and management can and should be water efficient;

(6)    That Section 2 of Article X of the California Constitution specifies that the right to use water is limited to the amount reasonably required for the beneficial use to be served and the right does not and shall not extend to waste or unreasonable method of use.

(b)    Consistent with the legislative findings, the purpose of this article is to:

(1)    Promote the values and benefits of landscaping practices that integrate and go beyond the conservation and efficient use of water;

(2)    Establish a structure for planning, designing, installing, maintaining and managing water efficient landscapes in new construction and rehabilitated projects by encouraging the use of a watershed approach that requires cross-sector collaboration of industry, government and property owners to achieve the many benefits possible;

(3)    Establish provisions for water management practices and water waste prevention for existing landscapes;

(4)    Use water efficiently without waste by setting a maximum applied water allowance as an upper limit for water use and reduce water use to the lowest practical amount;

(5)    Promote the benefits of consistent landscape ordinances with neighboring local and regional agencies;

(6)    Encourage local agencies and water purveyors to use economic incentives that promote the efficient use of water, such as implementing a tiered-rate structure; and

(7)    Encourage local agencies to designate the necessary authority that implements and enforces the provisions of the model water efficient landscape ordinance or its local landscape ordinance.

(c)    Landscapes that are planned, designed, installed, managed and maintained with the watershed based approach can improve California’s environmental conditions and provide benefits and realize sustainability goals. Such landscapes will make the urban environment resilient in the face of climatic extremes. Consistent with the legislative findings and purpose of this article, conditions in the urban setting will be improved by:

(1)    Creating the conditions to support life in the soil by reducing compaction, incorporating organic matter that increases water retention, and promoting productive plant growth that leads to more carbon storage, oxygen production, shade, habitat and aesthetic benefits.

(2)    Minimizing energy use by reducing irrigation water requirements, reducing reliance on petroleum based fertilizers and pesticides, and planting climate appropriate shade trees in urban areas.

(3)    Conserving water by capturing and reusing rainwater and graywater wherever possible and selecting climate appropriate plants that need minimal supplemental water after establishment.

(4)    Protecting air and water quality by reducing power equipment use and landfill disposal trips, selecting recycled and locally sourced materials, and using compost, mulch and efficient irrigation equipment to prevent erosion.

(5)    Protecting existing habitat and creating new habitat by choosing local native plants, climate adapted nonnatives and avoiding invasive plants. Utilizing integrated pest management with least toxic methods as the first course of action. (Ord. No. 2293, § 1, 2016.)


35.51 Applicability.

(a)    After December 1, 2015, and consistent with Executive Order No. B-29-15, this article shall apply to all of the following landscape projects:

(1)    New construction projects with an aggregate landscape area equal to or greater than 500 square feet requiring a building or landscape permit, plan check or design review;

(2)    Rehabilitated landscape projects with an aggregate landscape area equal to or greater than 2,500 square feet requiring a building or landscape permit, plan check, or design review;

(3)    Existing landscapes limited to SPMC 35.70, 35.71 and 35.72; and

(4)    Cemeteries. Recognizing the special landscape management needs of cemeteries, new and rehabilitated cemeteries are limited to SPMC 35.56, 35.63, and 35.64; and existing cemeteries are limited to SPMC 35.70, 35.71, and 35.72.

(b)    For local land use agencies working together to develop a regional water efficient landscape ordinance, the reporting requirements of this article shall become effective December 1, 2015, and the remainder of this article shall be effective no later than February 1, 2016.

(c)    Any project with an aggregate landscape area of 2,500 square feet or less may comply with the performance requirements of this article or conform to the prescriptive measures contained in SPMC 35.76.

(d)    For projects using treated or untreated graywater or rainwater captured on site, any lot or parcel within the project that has less than 2,500 square feet of landscape and meets the lot or parcel’s landscape water requirement (estimated total water use) entirely with treated or untreated graywater or through stored rainwater captured on site is subject only to SPMC 35.76(b)(5).

(e)    This article does not apply to:

(1)    Registered local, state or federal historical sites;

(2)    Ecological restoration projects that do not require a permanent irrigation system;

(3)    Mined land reclamation projects that do not require a permanent irrigation system; or

(4)    Existing plant collections, as part of botanical gardens and arboretums open to the public. (Ord. No. 2293, § 1, 2016.)

ARTICLE III. WATER EFFICIENT LANDSCAPE


35.50 Purpose.

(a)    On April 1, 2015, Governor Brown issued Executive Order No. B-29-15 directing the California Department of Water Resources to update the state’s model water efficient landscape ordinance, previously adopted in 2010 under the Water Conservation in Landscaping Act (Cal. Gov’t Code § 65591 et seq.). Local agencies, consistent with the Department of Water Resources’ regulations and the Water Conservation in Landscaping Act, must adopt the model ordinance (as set forth in Cal. Code Regs. Title 23, Division 2, Chapter 2.7) or a water efficient landscape ordinance that is, based on evidence in the record, at least as effective in conserving water as the model ordinance. With this Article III of Chapter 35 SPMC, the city has adopted the state’s 2015 model ordinance.

(b)    The Legislature, in the Water Conservation in Landscaping Act, found:

(1)    That the waters of the state are of limited supply and are subject to ever increasing demands;

(2)    That the continuation of California’s economic prosperity is dependent on the availability of adequate supplies of water for future uses;

(3)    That it is the policy of the state to promote the conservation and efficient use of water and to prevent the waste of this valuable resource;

(4)    That landscapes are essential to the quality of life in California by providing areas for active and passive recreation and as an enhancement to the environment by cleaning air and water, preventing erosion, offering fire protection, and replacing ecosystems lost to development;

(5)    That landscape design, installation, maintenance and management can and should be water efficient;

(6)    That Section 2 of Article X of the California Constitution specifies that the right to use water is limited to the amount reasonably required for the beneficial use to be served and the right does not and shall not extend to waste or unreasonable method of use.

(b)    Consistent with the legislative findings, the purpose of this article is to:

(1)    Promote the values and benefits of landscaping practices that integrate and go beyond the conservation and efficient use of water;

(2)    Establish a structure for planning, designing, installing, maintaining and managing water efficient landscapes in new construction and rehabilitated projects by encouraging the use of a watershed approach that requires cross-sector collaboration of industry, government and property owners to achieve the many benefits possible;

(3)    Establish provisions for water management practices and water waste prevention for existing landscapes;

(4)    Use water efficiently without waste by setting a maximum applied water allowance as an upper limit for water use and reduce water use to the lowest practical amount;

(5)    Promote the benefits of consistent landscape ordinances with neighboring local and regional agencies;

(6)    Encourage local agencies and water purveyors to use economic incentives that promote the efficient use of water, such as implementing a tiered-rate structure; and

(7)    Encourage local agencies to designate the necessary authority that implements and enforces the provisions of the model water efficient landscape ordinance or its local landscape ordinance.

(c)    Landscapes that are planned, designed, installed, managed and maintained with the watershed based approach can improve California’s environmental conditions and provide benefits and realize sustainability goals. Such landscapes will make the urban environment resilient in the face of climatic extremes. Consistent with the legislative findings and purpose of this article, conditions in the urban setting will be improved by:

(1)    Creating the conditions to support life in the soil by reducing compaction, incorporating organic matter that increases water retention, and promoting productive plant growth that leads to more carbon storage, oxygen production, shade, habitat and aesthetic benefits.

(2)    Minimizing energy use by reducing irrigation water requirements, reducing reliance on petroleum based fertilizers and pesticides, and planting climate appropriate shade trees in urban areas.

(3)    Conserving water by capturing and reusing rainwater and graywater wherever possible and selecting climate appropriate plants that need minimal supplemental water after establishment.

(4)    Protecting air and water quality by reducing power equipment use and landfill disposal trips, selecting recycled and locally sourced materials, and using compost, mulch and efficient irrigation equipment to prevent erosion.

(5)    Protecting existing habitat and creating new habitat by choosing local native plants, climate adapted nonnatives and avoiding invasive plants. Utilizing integrated pest management with least toxic methods as the first course of action. (Ord. No. 2293, § 1, 2016.)


35.51 Applicability.

(a)    After December 1, 2015, and consistent with Executive Order No. B-29-15, this article shall apply to all of the following landscape projects:

(1)    New construction projects with an aggregate landscape area equal to or greater than 500 square feet requiring a building or landscape permit, plan check or design review;

(2)    Rehabilitated landscape projects with an aggregate landscape area equal to or greater than 2,500 square feet requiring a building or landscape permit, plan check, or design review;

(3)    Existing landscapes limited to SPMC 35.70, 35.71 and 35.72; and

(4)    Cemeteries. Recognizing the special landscape management needs of cemeteries, new and rehabilitated cemeteries are limited to SPMC 35.56, 35.63, and 35.64; and existing cemeteries are limited to SPMC 35.70, 35.71, and 35.72.

(b)    For local land use agencies working together to develop a regional water efficient landscape ordinance, the reporting requirements of this article shall become effective December 1, 2015, and the remainder of this article shall be effective no later than February 1, 2016.

(c)    Any project with an aggregate landscape area of 2,500 square feet or less may comply with the performance requirements of this article or conform to the prescriptive measures contained in SPMC 35.76.

(d)    For projects using treated or untreated graywater or rainwater captured on site, any lot or parcel within the project that has less than 2,500 square feet of landscape and meets the lot or parcel’s landscape water requirement (estimated total water use) entirely with treated or untreated graywater or through stored rainwater captured on site is subject only to SPMC 35.76(b)(5).

(e)    This article does not apply to:

(1)    Registered local, state or federal historical sites;

(2)    Ecological restoration projects that do not require a permanent irrigation system;

(3)    Mined land reclamation projects that do not require a permanent irrigation system; or

(4)    Existing plant collections, as part of botanical gardens and arboretums open to the public. (Ord. No. 2293, § 1, 2016.)

36.100.040    Responsibility for Administration.


36.100.010 Purpose of the Zoning Code.

This Zoning Code implements the policies of the South Pasadena General Plan by classifying and regulating the uses of land and structures within the City in a manner consistent with the General Plan. To achieve this purpose, it is the intent of this Zoning Code to:

A.    Provide standards for the orderly development of the City, and continue a stable pattern of land uses;

B.    Conserve and protect the historical integrity and character of the City’s neighborhoods;

C.    Maintain and protect the value of property;

D.    Protect views of hillsides, ridgelines, open space, and other natural resources of the City;

E.    Ensure compatibility between land uses; and

F.    Encourage a pedestrian-friendly community by promoting a mix of land uses and pedestrian oriented development in commercial areas.

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1.)


36.100.020 Authority.

This Zoning Code is enacted based on the authority vested in the City of South Pasadena by the State of California, including but not limited to: the State Constitution; the Planning and Zoning Law (Government Code Sections 65000 et seq.); the Subdivision Map Act (Government Code Sections 66410 et seq.); and the California Health and Safety Code.

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1.)


36.100.030 Applicability of Zoning Code.

This Zoning Code applies to all land uses, structures, subdivisions, and development within the City of South Pasadena, as provided by this Section.

A.    New land uses or structures, changes to uses or structures. Compliance with the requirements of Division 36.210 (Development and Land Use Approval Requirements) or, where applicable, Division 36.360 (Nonconforming Uses, Structures, and Parcels), is necessary for any person or public agency to lawfully establish, construct, reconstruct, alter, or replace any use of land or structure.

B.    Issuance of Building or Grading Permits. The City may issue building, grading, or other construction permits only when:

1.    The proposed land use and/or structure satisfy the requirements of Subsection A. above, and all other applicable statutes, ordinances and regulations; and

2.    The site was subdivided in compliance with Article 5 (Subdivisions).

C.    Subdivisions. Any subdivision of land proposed within the City after the effective date of this Zoning Code shall be consistent with: the minimum lot size requirements of Article 2 (Zoning Districts, Allowable Land Uses, and Zone-Specific Standards), all other applicable requirements of this Zoning Code, and the City’s subdivision regulations.

D.    Effect of Zoning Code on existing uses and structures. An existing land use or structure is lawful only when it was legally established, and is operated and maintained in compliance with all applicable provisions of this Zoning Code, including Division 36.360 (Nonconforming Uses, Structures and Parcels).

Existing land uses or structures that were in violation of City zoning regulations applicable before the effective date of the ordinance codified in this Zoning Code are in violation of this Zoning Code, and shall continue to be in violation unless they conform to the current requirements.

E.    Effect of Zoning Code changes on projects in progress. An application for zoning approval that has been accepted by the Department as complete prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this Zoning Code or any amendment shall be processed according to the requirements in effect when the review authority first considers the application in a public hearing.

F.    Minimum requirements. The provisions of this Zoning Code shall be minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety, and general welfare. When this Zoning Code provides for discretion on the part of a City official or body, that discretion may be exercised to impose more stringent requirements than set forth in this Code as may be necessary to promote orderly land use development, environmental resource protection, and the other purposes of this Zoning Code.

G.    Other requirements may apply. Nothing in this Zoning Code eliminates the need for obtaining any permit, approval, or entitlement required by other provisions of the South Pasadena Municipal Code, or the regulations of any County, regional, State, or Federal agency.

H.    Conflicting requirements. Any conflict between different requirements of this Zoning Code, or between this Zoning Code and other regulations, shall be resolved in compliance with Section 36.110.030.F (Conflicting Requirements).

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1.)


36.100.040 Responsibility for Administration.

This Zoning Code shall be administered by the South Pasadena City Council, Planning Commission, Design Review Board, Cultural Heritage Commission, Director of Planning and Building, and the Planning Department in compliance with Division 36.600 (Administrative Responsibility).

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1.)

Division 36.110. Interpretation of Zoning Code Provisions

Sections:

36.110.010    Purpose of Division.

36.110.020    Authority for Interpretations.

36.110.030    Rules of Interpretation.

36.110.040    Procedure for Interpretations.


36.110.010 Purpose of Division.

This Division provides rules for resolving questions about the meaning or applicability of any part of this Zoning Code. The provisions of this Division are intended to ensure the consistent interpretation and application of the requirements of this Zoning Code and the General Plan.

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1.)


36.110.020 Authority for Interpretations.

The Director shall have the responsibility and authority to interpret the meaning and applicability of all provisions and requirements of this Zoning Code.

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1.)


36.110.030 Rules for Interpretation.

A.    Abbreviations, short form terms. For the purpose of brevity, the following phrases, personnel and document titles are shortened in this Zoning Code. The City of South Pasadena is referred to as the “City.” The City of South Pasadena Zoning Code is referred to as “this Zoning Code.” The Director of Planning and Building is referred to as “Director,” the City Council is referred to as the “Council,” and the Planning Commission is referred to as the “Commission.” The Planning and Building Department is referred to as the “Department.” “Buildings and structures” are referred to as “structures.”

B.    Terminology. When used in this Zoning Code, the words “shall,” “will,” “is to,” and “are to” are always mandatory. “Should” is not mandatory but is strongly recommended; and “may” is permissive. The present tense includes the past and future tenses; and the future tense includes the present. The singular number includes the plural number, and the plural the singular, unless the natural construction of the word indicates otherwise. The words “include,” “includes,” and “including” mean “including but not limited to...”.

C.    Number of days. Whenever a number of days is specified in this Zoning Code, or in any permit, condition of approval, or notice issued or given as provided in this Zoning Code, the number of days shall be construed as calendar days, unless business days are specified. Time limits will extend to the following business day where the last of the specified number of days falls on a day that the City is not open for business, except as otherwise provided for by the Map Act.

D.    State law requirements. Where this Zoning Code references applicable provisions of State law (e.g., the California Government Code, Subdivision Map Act, Public Resources Code, etc.), the reference shall be construed to be to the applicable State law provisions as they may be amended from time to time.

E.    Calculations—Rounding. Where provisions of this Zoning Code require calculations to determine applicable requirements, any fractional results of the calculations shall be rounded as provided by this Subsection except where a specific rounding rule is provided by the Section requiring calculations (for example, Section 36.310.040 includes a rounding requirement for off-street parking space calculations).

1.    Residential density, minimum lot area and number of lots. The fractional/decimal results of calculations of the number of dwelling units allowed on a parcel based on maximum density requirements, and the number of parcels allowed through subdivision based on a minimum lot area requirement, shall be rounded down to the next lowest whole number. For example, the RS zoning district allows a minimum lot area of 10,000 square feet for new subdivisions. Therefore, a parcel of 28,000 square feet could be subdivided into a maximum of two parcels, if approved by the review authority (28,000/10,000 = 2.8, rounded down to 2).

2.    All other calculations. For all calculations required by this Zoning Code other than those described in Subsection E.1 above, the fractional/decimal results of calculations shall be rounded to the next highest whole number when the fraction/decimal is 0.5 or more, and to the next lowest whole number when the fraction is less than 0.5.

F.    Conflicting requirements. Any conflicts between different requirements of this Zoning Code, or between this Zoning Code and other regulations, shall be resolved as follows.

1.    Zoning Code provisions. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this Zoning Code, the most restrictive requirement shall control; except in case of any conflict between the regulations of Article 2 (Zoning Districts, Allowable Land Uses, and Zone-Specific Standards) and Article 3 (Site Planning and General Development Standards), Article 3 shall control.

2.    Development agreements or specific plans. In the event of any conflict between the requirements of this Zoning Code and standards adopted as part of any development agreement or specific plan, the requirements of the development agreement or specific plan shall control as specified in the agreement or plan.

3.    Municipal Code provisions. In the event of any conflict between requirements of this Zoning Code and other regulations of the City, the Director shall determine which provision shall control.

4.    Private agreements. It is not intended that the requirements of this Zoning Code shall interfere with, repeal, abrogate or annul any easement, covenant, or other agreement that existed when the ordinance codified in this Zoning Code became effective. This Zoning Code applies to all land uses and development regardless of whether it imposes a greater or lesser restriction on the development or use of structures or land than an applicable private agreement or restriction, without affecting the applicability of any agreement or restriction. The City shall not enforce any private covenant or agreement unless it is a party to the covenant or agreement.

G.    Zoning Map boundaries. See Section 36.200.020 (Zoning Map and Zoning Districts).

H.    Allowable uses of land. See Section 36.210.030 (Allowable Land Uses and Permit Requirements).

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1.)


36.110.040 Procedure for Interpretations.

Whenever the Director determines that the meaning or applicability of any of the requirements of this Zoning Code are subject to interpretation generally, or as applied to a specific case, the Director may issue an interpretation.

A.    Request for interpretation. The request for an interpretation or determination shall be filed with the Department and shall include all information required by the Department.

B.    Referral of interpretation. The Director may choose to forward any question of interpretation or determination of the meaning or applicability of any provision of this Zoning Code directly to the Commission for determination at a public meeting.

C.    Findings, basis for interpretation. The issuance of an interpretation shall include findings stating the basis for the interpretation. The basis for an interpretation may include technological changes or new industry standards. The issuance of an interpretation shall also include a finding documenting the consistency of the interpretation with the General Plan, and any applicable Specific Plan.

D.    Record of interpretations. Official interpretations shall be:

1.    Written, and shall quote the provisions of this Zoning Code being interpreted, and the applicability in the particular or general circumstances that caused the need for interpretations, and the determination; and

2.    Distributed to the Council, Commission, Director, DRB, CHC, City Manager, City Attorney, City Clerk, and affected Department staff.

Any provision of this Zoning Code that is determined by the Director or other applicable review authority to need refinement or revision will be corrected by amending this Zoning Code as soon as is practical. Until an amendment can occur, the Director will maintain a complete record of all official interpretations as an appendix to this Zoning Code, and indexed by the number of the Division or Section that is the subject of the interpretation.

E.    Appeals. Any interpretation of this Zoning Code may be appealed in compliance with Division 36.610 (Appeals).

36.210.030    Allowable Land Uses and Permit Requirements.

36.210.040    Exemptions from Zoning Approval Requirements.


36.210.010 Purpose.

This Division describes the City’s requirements for the approval of proposed development and new land uses. The permit requirements established by this Zoning Code for specific land uses are in Divisions 36.220 through 36.250.

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1.)


36.210.020 General Requirements for Development and New Land Uses.

All land uses and structures shall be established, constructed, reconstructed, altered, relocated, or replaced in compliance with the following requirements.

A.    Allowable use. The land use shall be allowed by this Zoning Code in the zoning district applied to the site. The basis for determining whether a use is allowable is described in Section 36.210.030 (Allowable Land Uses and Permit Requirements).

B.    Permit and approval requirements. Any zoning approval or other approval required by Section 36.210.030 shall be obtained before commencing construction of the proposed use, or otherwise established or put into operation, unless the proposed use is listed in Section 36.210.040 (Exemptions from Zoning Approval Requirements).

C.    Development standards, conditions of approval. Land uses and structures shall comply with the development standards of this Article, the provisions of Article 3 (Site Planning and General Development Standards), and any applicable conditions imposed by a previously granted zoning approval.

D.    Design guidelines. Land uses and structures shall comply with the design guidelines to the extent required by the Review Authority and/or specific provisions of the design guidelines.

E.    Legal parcel. The proposed site shall be a parcel that was legally created in compliance with the Subdivision Map Act, and Article 5, Subdivisions, or earlier City subdivision regulations in effect at the time the parcel was created.

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1; Ord. No. 2183 § 1, 2009.)


36.210.030 Allowable Land Uses and Permit Requirements.

A.    Allowable land uses. The uses of land allowed by this Zoning Code in each zoning district are listed in Tables 2-2, 2-4, and 2-6, together with the type of zoning approval required for each use.

1.    Establishment of an allowable use.

a.    Any parcel or structure may be approved with one or more of the land uses identified by the tables as being allowable within the applicable zoning district, subject to all applicable requirements of this Zoning Code, and the zoning approval requirements of Subsection B. for each individual use.

b.    Where a single development proposal includes multiple uses, the overall project shall be subject to the highest permit level required by Subsection B. for any of the individual uses proposed. For example, a new building proposed in the CG zoning district with retail on the ground floor, offices on the second floor, and apartments on the third floor would require Conditional Use Permit (CUP) approval because Table 2-4 allows “mixed-use residential” (residential uses as part of an otherwise non-residential project), subject to a CUP in the CG district even though “general retail” and “offices, professional and administrative” are permitted uses, requiring only a Planning Clearance.

2.    Uses not listed. Land uses that are not listed in tables or are not shown in a particular zoning district are not allowed, except as otherwise provided by Section 36.210.040 (Exemptions from Zoning Approval Requirements), and as follows.

a.    Similar uses may be allowed. Using the interpretation procedures in Division 36.110, the Director may determine that a proposed use not listed in Tables 2-2, 2-4, and 2-6 is allowable if all of the following findings are made:

(1)    The characteristics of, and activities associated with the proposed use are equivalent to one or more of the listed uses, and will not involve a higher level of activity or population density than the uses allowed in the district;

(2)    The proposed use will be consistent with the purposes of the applicable zoning district; and

(3)    The proposed use will be consistent with the General Plan and any applicable Specific Plan.

b.    Applicable standards and permit requirements. When the Director determines that a proposed, but unlisted, use is equivalent to a listed use, the proposed use will be treated in the same manner as the listed use in determining where it is allowed, what permits are required, and what other standards and requirements of this Zoning Code apply.

c.    Commission determination. The Director may forward questions about equivalent uses directly to the Commission for a determination at a public meeting.

B.    Permit requirements. Tables 2-2, 2-4, and 2-6 provide for land uses that are:

1.    Permitted subject to compliance with all applicable provisions of this Zoning Code, subject to first obtaining a Planning Clearance (Section 36.410.020), and any Building Permit or other permit required by the Municipal Code. These are shown as “P” uses in the tables;

2.    Allowed subject to the approval of an Administrative Use Permit (Section 36.410.060) and shown as “AUP” uses in the tables; and

3.    Allowed subject to the approval of a Conditional Use Permit (Section 36.410.060), and shown as “CUP” uses in the tables.

4.    A project may require review by the Design Review Board, the Planning Commission (for a Hillside Permit) and/or the Cultural Heritage Commission (if required to obtain a Certificate of Appropriateness), in addition to the permit requirements above. See Section 36.410.040 (Design Review).

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1.)


36.210.040 Exemptions from Zoning Approval Requirements.

The zoning approval requirements of this Zoning Code other than those of the Design Review Board or the Cultural Heritage Commission, do not apply to the land uses, structures, and activities identified by this Section. These are allowed in all zoning districts subject to compliance with this Section.

A.    General requirements for exemption. The land uses, structures, and activities identified by Subsection B. below are exempt from the zoning approval requirements of this Zoning Code only when:

1.    The use, activity or structure is established and operated in compliance with the setback requirements, height limits, and all other applicable standards of this Article and Article 3 (Site Planning and General Development Standards);

2.    The use, activity or structure is not subject to design review (Section 36.410.040), or by the Planning Commission for a Hillside Development Permit (Section 36.410.065); and

B.    Exempt activities and uses. The following are exempt from zoning approval requirements when in compliance with Subsection A. above, provided that any permit or approval required by regulations other than this Zoning Code is obtained (for example, a Building Permit).

1.    Decks, paths and driveways. Decks, platforms, on-site paths, and driveways that are not required to have a Building Permit or Grading Permit by the Municipal Code.

2.    Fences and walls. See Section 36.300.050 (Walls, Fences and Hedges).

3.    Interior remodeling. Interior alterations that do not increase the number of rooms or the gross floor area within the structure, or change the permitted use of the structure.

4.    Portable spas, hot tubs, and fish ponds. Portable spas, hot tubs, fish ponds, and similar structures and equipment, that do not: exceed 120 square feet in total area including related equipment; contain more than 2,000 gallons of water; or exceed three feet in depth. These facilities shall comply with the setback requirements established by this Article for the applicable zoning district, or 36.350.170 (Residential Uses—Accessory Residential Structures), where applicable.

5.    Repairs and maintenance. Ordinary repairs and maintenance, if:

a.    The work does not change the approved land use of the site or structure, or add to, enlarge or expand the land use and/or structure; and

b.    Any exterior repairs employ the same materials and design as the feature being repaired or replaced.

6.    Small, portable residential accessory structures. Within residential zoning districts, a single portable structure, up to 120 square feet, per lot or dwelling unit, including pre-manufactured storage sheds and other small structures that are exempt from Building Permit requirements in compliance with the Municipal Code and the Uniform Building Code.

7.    Solar collectors. The addition of solar collection systems to the roofs or sides of existing structures, provided that the collectors comply with applicable height limit requirements.

This Division lists the uses of land that may be allowed within the residential zoning districts established by Section 36.200.020 (Zoning Map and Zoning Districts), determines the type of zoning approval/approval required for each use, and provides basic standards for site layout and building size.

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1.)


36.220.020 Purposes of Residential Zoning Districts.

Different residential zoning districts are intended to provide for a variety of housing opportunities through new construction, and the maintenance of existing homes and neighborhoods. The purposes of the individual residential zoning districts and the manner in which they are applied are as follows.

A.    RE (Residential Estate) district. The RE zoning district applies to areas appropriate for detached, single-family residential homes on large estate parcels. The allowable residential density ranges from one to 3.5 dwelling units per acre. The RE zoning district is consistent with the Estate/Very-Low Density Residential land use designation of the General Plan.

B.    RS (Residential Single-Family) district. The RS zoning district is intended for areas appropriate for the development of detached, single family homes. The allowable residential density ranges from 3.51 to six dwelling units per acre. The RS zoning district is consistent with the Low Density Residential land use designation of the General Plan.

C.    RM (Residential Medium Density) district. The RM zoning district applies to areas appropriate for a variety of housing types. Typical residential land uses include single-family bungalow courts, duplexes, triplexes, or other attached or detached single-family dwellings. The allowable residential density ranges from 6.1 to 14 units per acre. The RM zoning district is consistent with the Medium Density Residential land use designation of the General Plan.

D.    RH (Residential High Density) district. The RH zoning district is intended for areas appropriate for high density single-family attached or multi-family dwelling units including courtyard housing, townhouses, and apartments. The allowable residential density ranges from 14.1 to 24 units per acre. The RH zoning district is consistent with the High Density Residential land use designation of the General Plan.

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1.)

36.220.050 Development of Small Nonconforming Residential Parcels.

The following standards apply to new and remodeled single-family dwellings on legal nonconforming parcels with an area of less than 10,000 square feet, except that all standards, except subsection F (Lot Coverage), do not apply to hillside parcels (as defined by Section 36.340.2020(A) (Hillside Protection)). These standards are intended to minimize the impacts of single-family dwelling alteration, construction, expansion, and replacement by maintaining the existing residential neighborhood character that might otherwise result in overbuilding on a small single-family parcel.

A.    Design compatibility. Proposed construction shall have exterior colors, forms, and materials that are consistent throughout and visually compatible with adjacent structures and the surrounding neighborhood. The size, mass, and scale of new dwellings shall also be visually compatible with adjacent structures and the surrounding neighborhood. New dwellings shall also comply with the City’s Residential Design Guidelines.

B.    Setbacks.

1.    The front and rear setback shall be 20 feet, or 15 feet for houses with a front porch.

2.    A second story shall be set back an additional five feet from the front of the house and three feet on both sides (which may be accommodated within a sloping roof), unless the architectural style requires a zero front or side second story setback, as determined by the Review Authority. In the latter case, the ground floor front setback shall be 25 feet.

C.    Driveway width. Driveways shall be limited to a maximum paved width of 10 feet with two feet clear of obstructions on either side, or 40 percent of the parcel frontage, whichever is less. Driveway width at property lines shall be limited to 10 feet.

D.    Front yard paving. No more than 45 percent of the total area of the front setback shall be paved for walkways, driveways, and/or other hardcover pavement.

E.    Reserved.

F.    Lot coverage. The maximum lot coverage shall be 50 percent.

G.    Parking. For dwellings with detached garages located behind the primary unit, the minimum parking requirement shall be two covered spaces. Attached garages shall be set back a minimum of 10 feet from the front of the building, and shall include two enclosed spaces.

36.250.030 Altos de Monterey (AM) Overlay District.

A.    Purpose. The standards and conditions provided by this Section for the AM Overlay District are intended to:

1.    Maintain the existing architectural character and neighborhood environment;

2.    Recognize, maintain, and augment the standards and conditions of the strict Covenants, Conditions, and Restrictions (CC&Rs) to which the properties within this overlay district are held and conveyed, and which run with the land; and

3.    Provide additional conditions and restrictions not addressed by the CC&Rs that are necessitated by the long term residential use of the affected properties, also to maintain the existing architectural character and neighborhood environment.

The AM overlay district is consistent with the Altos de Monterey land use category of the General Plan.

B.    Applicability.

1.    Area affected. The AM overlay district is applied to areas identified on the zoning map indicated with the AM overlay district suffix symbol. These areas specifically include Parcels 1 through 57, Parcels 59-639, and Lot 3 of PM 7380, Tract 25588, as designated and recorded in Book 713, pages 51-77 inclusive of maps in the Office of the Los Angeles County Recorder (hereinafter described as either Tract 25588 or the AM overlay district.

2.    Applicability of standards. The standards of this Section apply to any additions, remodels or new construction proposed in the AM overlay district, in addition to all other applicable requirements of this Zoning Code.

C.    Allowable land uses and permit requirements. Land uses within the AM overlay district shall be limited to the following.

1.    Permitted uses. Only the following uses are permitted within the AM overlay district.

a.    One single-family dwelling is allowed on each legally subdivided lot not otherwise designated for semi-public or public use, subject to Planning Clearance (Section 36.410.020) and Design Review (Section 36.410.040). All structures shall be constructed on site, except that manufactured homes as defined in Government Code Section 65852.3 shall be permitted to the extent required by the Government Code.

b.    Public or semi-public open space currently maintained on Lots 117 (Lot 3 of Parcel Map 7380), 488 and 489 of Tract 25588 (“Open Space Lots”) shall be zoned and designated in the General Plan as open space in perpetuity.

c.    Trash containers, including recycling containers, may be placed forward of the required front yard setback for a maximum of 24 hours per week, immediately preceding and following trash pick-up.

A lot with a permanent (requires a construction permit/s) swimming pool or spa pool may have a poolhouse or cabana with a sink and/or shower and/or toilet. When a poolhouse has a toilet, a covenant shall be required stating that the poolhouse shall be maintained as an accessory structure and not be used for sleeping quarters or be converted to a residential use. The purpose of the covenant is to ensure that subsequent owners of the property are aware of this restriction. This covenant shall be recorded against the property’s title, and evidence of recordation shall be provided to the Planning and Building Department prior to the issuance of a construction permit.

e.    The accessory storage of building materials during on-site construction and for a maximum of 30 days after the completion of construction.

36.300.010 Purpose of Division.

This Division expands upon the standards of Article 2 (Zoning Districts, Allowable Land Uses, and Zone-Specific Standards) by addressing the details of site planning and project design that are not covered by Article 2 (for example, off-street parking requirements and sign regulations). These standards are intended to ensure that all development produces an environment consistent with the General Plan.

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1.)


36.300.020 Applicability.

The provisions of this Division apply to all proposed development and new land uses.

A.    These standards shall be considered in combination with the standards for each zoning district in Article 2 (Zoning Districts, Allowable Land Uses, and Zone-Specific Standards). If there is a conflict, the standards applicable to the zoning district shall take precedence over these general standards, except where these standards provide otherwise.

B.    All new or modified structures and uses shall comply with all applicable provisions of this Division, except as specified in Division 36.360 (Nonconforming Uses, Structures, and Parcels).

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1.)


36.300.030 Setback Measurement and Exceptions.

This Section provides standards for the use and minimum size of required setbacks. These standards are intended to provide open areas around structures for: visibility and traffic safety; access to and around structures; access to natural light, ventilation and direct sunlight; separation of incompatible land uses; and space for privacy, landscaping, and recreation.

A.    Setback requirements.

1.    All structures shall comply with the setback requirements of the applicable zoning districts established by Article 2 (Zoning Districts, Allowable Land Uses, and Zone-Specific Standards), and with any special setbacks established for specific land uses by this Zoning Code.

2.    Each required setback shall be open and unobstructed from the ground upward, except for trees and other plant materials, and except as provided by Subsection D. (Setback Exceptions, Allowed Projections into Setbacks).

B.    Exemptions from setback requirements. The minimum setback requirements of this Zoning Code apply to all uses except the following:

1.    Fences, walls, and hedges with a maximum height of three feet above the natural grade of the parcel, within a required front or street side setback area, or six feet within the side and rear setbacks; except as otherwise provided in Subsection D. (Setback Exceptions, Allowed Projections into Setbacks); and

2.    Decks, earthworks, pavement, steps, terraces, and other site design elements which are placed directly upon the finish grade and do not exceed a height of 18 inches above the surrounding finish grade at any point.

C.    Measurement of setbacks. The following setbacks shall be measured from each exterior wall of a structure, to define a setback line parallel to the adjacent property line. Figure 3-1 shows the location of each type of setback, and the points from which they are measured.

1.    Front yard setbacks. The front yard setback shall be measured at right angles from the front property line of the parcel to the point on the structure nearest to the front property line.

a.    Corner parcels. The measurement shall be taken from the nearest point on the structure to the nearest point of the property line adjoining the street which is opposite the rear yard.

b.    Flag lots. The measurement shall be taken from the nearest point on the wall of the structure facing the street to the point where the access strip meets the bulk of the parcel; establishing a building line parallel to the lot line nearest to the public street or right-of-way. See Figure 3-2.

2.    Side yard and street side yard setbacks. Side yard and street side yard setbacks shall be measured at right angles from the nearest point on the side property line of the parcel to the nearest portion of the structure; establishing a setback line parallel to the side property line, which extends between the front and rear yards.

3.    Rear yard setbacks. The rear yard setback shall be measured at right angles from the nearest point on the rear property line of the parcel to the nearest portion of the structure, establishing a setback line parallel to the rear property line.

4.    Corner traffic visibility setbacks. All structures and landscaping over 36 inches in height on corner lots shall be set back from the center of the adjacent intersection a minimum of 75 feet, as required by Section 36.300.040.C.

Figure 3-2. Flag Lot Setbacks

D.    Setback exceptions, allowed projections into setbacks. An architectural feature may extend beyond the wall of the structure and into the front, side, and rear setbacks, in compliance with Table 3-1.

	TABLE 3-1. ALLOWED PROJECTIONS INTO SETBACKS

	Projecting Feature	Allowed Projection into Specified Setback

	Front	Side	Rear

	Sills, cornices, roof overhang or eaves	No closer than 30 in. to a lot line, provided that the lowest edge of the feature is at least 8 ft above ground level.

	Chimney, bay window, greenhouse window	24 in. for no more than 10% of the length of the building wall from which it projects, or a maximum length of 10 ft, whichever is less; but no closer than 30 in. to a side lot line.

	Balcony, deck, or porch, which may be roofed but is otherwise unenclosed	0 ft	36 in. for a deck if its walking surface is 30 in. or less above grade. 36 in. for another projecting feature if it extends along no more than 10% of the length of the building wall from which it projects, or a maximum length of 10 ft, whichever is less. In no case shall a feature project closer than 30 in. to a side lot line.	8 ft

	Uncovered steps or landings up to 36 inches in height	36 inches in width, up to 10 ft in length.

	Note: Air conditioning units may be permitted if located outside front or side setbacks, and they shall not be located on rooftops in residential districts.

Figure 3-3. Examples of Allowed Projections into Setbacks

E.    Limitations on the use of setbacks. A required setback shall only be used in compliance with the following requirements.

1.    Storage. No required setback shall be used for the storage of

a.    Inoperable vehicles, scrap, junk, or similar material; or

b.    Building materials, except during on-site construction, in compliance with a valid Building Permit.

2.    Parking. Residential parking is allowable within a required setback only on driveways, in compliance with Section 36.310.080 (Parking Design Standards).

3.    Pavement. Within a residential zoning district, pavement within a required front setback shall be limited to:

a.    The maximum driveway width needed to access each garage door (12 feet for a single-family dwelling and 18 feet for multi-family units), provided that a maneuvering apron adjacent to the garage doors may be as wide as the garage doors; and

b.    A pedestrian walkway not more than five feet wide.

c.    No more than 30 percent of the area of a required front setback shall be pavement or other decorative hardscape materials, except for hillside lots (as defined by Section 36.340.020A [Hillside Protection]) where the required guest parking spaces cannot be located outside of the front setback. A parcel on a cul-de-sac may have up to 45 percent of the front yard paved. Cul-de-sac parcels are allowed more pavement because their curving street frontage and front property line result in their front yard area being smaller than that of a rectangular lot.

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1; Ord. No. 2166, § 4, 2007.)


36.300.040 Height Limits and Exceptions.

Each structure shall comply with the height limits of this Section, except for fences and walls, which are instead subject to the provisions of Section 36.300.050 (Walls, Fences, and Hedges).

A.    Maximum height of structures. No structure shall exceed the height limit established by the applicable zoning district in Article 2 (Zoning Districts, Allowable Land Uses, and Zone-Specific Standards). Because of a 1983 City of South Pasadena initiative, no commercial, office, manufacturing, or residential building shall exceed a height of 45 feet, and no Conditional Use Permit or Variance shall be granted to exceed 45 feet.

B.    Height measurement. The maximum allowable height shall be measured as the vertical distance from the existing grade of the site to an imaginary plane located the allowed number of feet above and parallel to the grade. See Figure 3-4. “Existing grade” shall be established by the Director, consistent with parcels in the immediate vicinity, and shall not be, nor have been artificially raised to gain additional building height.

See Municipal Code Chapter 2, Article VIE for permit requirements and standards for alterations to historic structures.

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1.)


36.300.110 Performance Standards.

A.    Purpose. This Section provides performance standards that are designed to minimize various potential operational impacts of all land uses and development within the City, and promote compatibility with adjoining areas and land uses.

B.    Applicability. The provisions of this Section apply to all new and existing land uses, including permanent and temporary uses, in all zoning districts unless an exemption is specifically provided. Uses existing on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this Section shall not be altered or modified thereafter to conflict with these standards.

C.    Electrical and mechanical equipment. Electrical and mechanical equipment (e.g., air conditioners, antennas, filters, heating and ventilation equipment, pumps, transformers, etc.) shall not be located and operated to disturb adjoining uses or activities.

D.    Electrical interference. Uses, activities, and processes shall not be operated to produce electric and/or magnetic fields that adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare of the community, including interference with normal radio, telephone, or television reception from off the premises where the activity is conducted.

E.    Explosive or fire hazard. Uses, activities, and processes shall comply with the minimum requirements of the Uniform Fire Code as adopted by the City, and California Code of Regulations Title 19.

F.    Light and Glare. Light or glare from mechanical or chemical processes, or from reflective materials used or stored on a site, shall be shielded or modified to prevent emission of light or glare beyond the property line. Outdoor lighting shall comply with the requirements of Section 36.300.090 (Outdoor Lighting).

G.    Noise. The City’s noise standards are in Chapter 19A of the Municipal Code.

H.    Odor. Noxious, odorous emissions of a type or quantity that would be detrimental to, or endanger the public health, safety, or general welfare of the community, are declared to be public nuisance and unlawful, and shall be modified to prevent the release of further emissions.

I.    Vibration. Uses, activities, and processes shall not generate ground vibration that is perceptible without instruments by the average person at any point along or beyond the property line of the parcel containing the activities. Vibrations from temporary construction, demolition, and vehicles that enter and leave the subject parcel (e.g., construction equipment, trains, trucks, etc.) are exempt.

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1.)


36.300.120 Private Drives.

A.    Definition. A “private drive” or “private street” or “private road” shall have the same meaning as “street (private)” as defined in this Zoning Code.

B.    It is prohibited and unlawful for anyone to construct, place or maintain a speed bump on any private street that intersects with an arterial street (arterial streets are defined in the City’s General Plan) and at least one other private or public street unless an Administrative Use Permit is issued regarding the same.

C.    It is prohibited and unlawful for anyone to construct, place or maintain any barrier on any private street that intersects with an arterial street (arterial streets are defined in the City’s General Plan) and at least one other private or public street unless a Conditional Use Permit is issued regarding the same. The findings necessary for a Conditional Use Permit shall be as set forth in the Zoning Chapter of the Municipal Code. For the purposes of this section, “barrier” shall refer to any visually or physically perceivable limitation on access (whether permanently closed or closed during certain hours, whether providing or appearing to provide selective access, whether locked or unlocked) placed or constructed on a private street that is not a speed bump. A sign indicating that a private street is private property is not a limitation on access. A sign indicating that the use of a private street is not allowed without some form of permission from the owners thereof is not a barrier. A “one-way” sign or device allowing for driving in only one direction on a through-street is not a barrier. A barrier shall not refer to a temporary barrier for the purpose of allowing for landscaping, street maintenance, or events unless such a temporary barrier exists for longer than ten cumulative days out of a thirty day period. City Manager approval shall be required in the event that a temporary barrier exists beyond that ten/thirty-day period. No fee shall be required for temporary barriers. And, if good cause exists due to frequency of use, the City Manager may recommend that such a temporary barrier be considered by the Planning Commission as if it is a permanent barrier. A barrier to a private street that intersects with only one arterial street shall not be referred to the Planning Commission for a Conditional Use Permit, but shall be setback 20?-0? from the arterial to allow adequate queuing area between the barrier and the intersecting street.

D.    Parking. Except when in conflict with other laws, or when in conflict with easements for utilities, emergency access, fire road access, or sewers dedicated to the City, parking on private streets is to be privately regulated in a manner as not to create a nuisance. Residents may request additional parking enforcement from the City Manager.

E.    Notice. For the purposes of notices, as required in Section 36.630.020.B.1.a.(3) and b., “subject parcel” shall include all parcels that front or own a private street at issue. Notices regarding private streets shall be sent to all private property owners within 300 feet of parcels that front on or own private streets.

(Ord. No. 2146 § 1.)


36.300.130 Private Streets.

“Private Streets.” Private streets, as regulated in Section 36.300.120, shall be regulated as described in this Chapter 36.360, except as provided in Section 36.300.120.D.

(Ord. No. 2146 § 2.)

a.    The site was developed comprehensively as a multi-tenant center, the parking ratio shall be the required number of spaces for the center. In this case, the parking requirement will be based on the center as a whole regardless of individual uses as provided in Table 3-6; or

b.    The site qualifies for shared parking in compliance with Section 36.310.060 (Shared Parking).

2.    Parking plan required. An applicant for the approval of a new project, or a modification to a multi-tenant project that changes its parking requirements shall submit a shared parking plan containing, at a minimum, the information listed in Section 36.310.060.C, to be approved by the review authority as part of the development plan.

D.    Uses not listed. Land uses not specifically listed in Table 3-6, shall provide parking as required by the review authority. The review authority shall use the requirements of Table 3-6 as a guide in determining the minimum number of parking spaces to be provided.

E.    Excessive parking. Parking spaces in excess of the requirements of this Division may be approved up to an increase of 25 percent, in conjunction with Design Review for the project, and if additional landscaping twice the standard requirements are provided and pedestrian improvements are also included.

F.    Bench or bleacher seating. Where fixed seating is provided as pews, benches or bleachers, a seat shall be defined to be 18 inches of bench space for the purpose of calculating the number of required parking spaces. See Table 3-6.

G.    Parking for historic commercial properties in CG Zone. Where a use is locating in a building in the CG zone that is included in the City’s Inventory of Historic Resources, the number of parking spaces required shall be equivalent to the number of spaces that can be accommodated on-site and/or behind the building. In the event that a building is removed from the Inventory of Historic Resources, the required parking for all new uses within such a building shall be in conformance with the parking requirements in Table 3-6 of this Section.

A.    Sign area measurement. The measurement of sign area for the purpose of determining compliance with Sections 36.320.070 and 36.320.080 be measured as follows.

1.    The surface area of a sign shall be calculated by enclosing the extreme limits of all framing, writing, logo, representation, emblem, or other display within a single continuous perimeter, composed of squares or rectangles with no more than eight lines. See Figure 3-20.


[IMAGE]


Figure 3-20. Sign Area

2.    Supporting framework or bracing that is clearly incidental to the display itself shall not be computed as sign area.

3.    The area of a double-faced (back-to-back) freestanding or projecting signs shall be calculated as a single sign face if the distance between each sign face does not exceed one foot at any point.

4.    Where a sign consists of one or more three-dimensional objects (i.e., balls, cubes, clusters of objects, sculpture or statue-like trademarks), the sign area shall be measured as their maximum projection upon a vertical plane. See Figure 3-21.


[IMAGE]


Figure 3-21. Sign Area. 3-D Sign

5.    For signs that incorporate time and temperature devices, the area of these devices shall not be included in the total area of the sign.

a.    A freestanding or projecting sign is set back from property lines a distance that is appropriate for its height and area;

b.    Wall or projecting signs relate to the architectural design of the building, and that no signs cover windows, or spill over natural boundaries in the facade design and architectural features;

c.    The sign does not unreasonably block the sight lines of existing signs on adjacent properties; and

d.    The sign does not adversely affect pedestrian or vehicular safety.

D.    Sign illumination. The artificial illumination of signs from an external source, shall be designed to minimize light and glare on surrounding rights-of-way and properties.

1.    External light sources shall be directed and shielded to limit direct illumination of any object other than the sign.

2.    The light from an illuminated sign shall not be of an intensity or brightness that will interfere with the reasonable enjoyment of residential properties. In areas with low ambient nighttime illumination levels (e.g., residential neighborhoods or business districts with little or no illuminated signing) applicants shall be encouraged to use light, illuminated copy against dark or opaque backgrounds.

3.    Signs shall not have blinking, flashing, or fluttering lights or other illuminating devices that have a changing light intensity, brightness or color.

4.    Colored lights shall not be used at a location or in a manner so as to be confused or construed as traffic control devices.

Division 36.340. Hillside Protection

Sections:

36.340.010    Purpose of Division.

36.340.020    Applicability.

36.340.030    Permit and Application Requirements.

36.340.040    Hillside Development Design Guidelines.

36.340.050    Hillside Project Development Standards.


36.340.010 Purpose of Division.

The standards of this Division are intended to:

A.    Preserve the City’s scenic resources by encouraging retention of natural topographic features and vegetation;

B.    Acknowledge that as the slope of a development site increases so does the potential for environmental degradation including slope failure, increased erosion, sedimentation and stormwater run-off; and

C.    Encourage grading practices that are appropriate in hillside areas; and

D.    Encourage structures on hillside parcels to be designed with scale, massing, architectural design and detailing appropriate to maintain hillsides in a natural, open character.

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1.)


36.340.020 Applicability.

A.    Sloping sites. The standards in this Division apply to subdivisions, uses, structures, and to all other development on sites with an average of slope of 20 percent or greater.

B.    Exceptions. The provisions of Section 36.340.050 (Hillside Project Development Standards) shall not apply to parcels within the AM (Altos de Monterey) overlay zone, which are instead subject to the requirements of Section 36.250.030 (Altos de Monterey (AM) Overlay District).

C.    Determination of average slope. Average slope shall be determined by applying the following formula.

	Average Slope Formula: S =	100 (I x L)

	A

Where:

S = Average natural slope in percent.

I = Contour interval in feet, at not more than 10 foot intervals, resulting in at least five contour lines being shown on the contour map.

L = The sum of the length of all the contour lines across the parcel in scale feet. See Figure 3-25.

A = The gross area of the building site in square feet.


[IMAGE]


Figure 3-25. Measurement of Contour Line Length to Determine “L” in Slope Formula

D.    Guest parking spaces. Section 36.340.050H applies only to properties located on the following streets in the Southwest Monterey Hills area of the city: Hanscom Drive, Peterson Avenue, Illinois Drive, Hill Drive, Harriman Avenue, Randolph Avenue, Hulbert Avenue, Elkins Street, Moffatt Street.

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1 Ord. No. 2166, § 1, 2007.)


36.340.030 Permit and Application Requirements.

Development that is subject to this Division shall require a Hillside Development Permit (Section 36.410.065) and Design Review by the Planning Commission (Section 36.410.040). The application shall include:

A.    Basic application contents. All information and materials required by Section 36.400.040 (Application Preparation and Filing), and all additional materials required by the application contents handout provided by the Department for hillside development; and

B.    Geotechnical report. A preliminary geotechnical report that identifies and proposes mitigation measures for any soils or geological problems that may affect site stability or structural integrity. Depending upon the site characteristics and project design, a final geotechnical report may also be required as part of a subsequent Building Permit application.

C.    Constraints analysis. For properties that have sensitive environmental resources including endangered plants and animals, or a wildlife corridor designated by the City, a qualified professional approved by the Director shall prepare a site constraints analysis in compliance with Section 36.380.030. The report shall include proposed mitigation measures to effectively protect important biological features identified.

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1; Ord. No. 2183 § 15, 2009.)


36.340.040 Hillside Development Design Guidelines.

Proposed hillside development should satisfy as many of the following objectives as feasible, as determined through the Design Review process.

A.    Terrain alteration. The project should be designed to fit the terrain rather than altering the terrain to fit the project. Development patterns that form visually protruding horizontal bands or steeply cut slopes for roads or lots shall be avoided. Large-scale slope terracing, cribwalls, or significant slope modification is discouraged. Where alteration of the terrain is necessary, contour grading techniques should be utilized to help achieve a natural appearing slope. (See Section 36.340.050.F and Figure 3-33.)

B.    Street layout. Any new streets should follow the natural contours of the terrain to minimize the need for grading. Cul-de-sacs and loop roads are encouraged where necessary to fit the natural topography, subject to the approval of the City Engineer and Fire Chief.

C.    Location of structures. Structures should be located in the most accessible, least visually prominent, and most geologically stable portion or portions of the site. They should also be oriented with the natural contours of the site. Siting structures in the least visually prominent locations is especially important on open hillsides where the prominence of construction should be minimized by placing structures so that they will be screened by existing vegetation, depressions in topography, or other natural features.

D.    Site layout and structure design. Building and site design should utilize varying setbacks and structure heights, split-level foundations, and low retaining walls to blend structures into the terrain.

E.    Architectural design.

1.    Form. Building forms should complement the character of the hillsides and avoid massive structures that dominate views of the hills.

2.    Scale and windows—Infill lots. The scale of homes proposed on infill lots should be compatible with buildings on adjacent parcels. Where feasible, windows, balconies, and outdoor living areas should be located to protect the privacy of adjacent homes and yards.

3.    Exterior wall surfaces. The apparent size of exterior wall surfaces visible from off the site should be minimized through the use of single story elements, setbacks, overhangs, roof pitches, landscaping, and/or other means of horizontal and vertical articulation to create changing shadow lines and break up massive forms.

4.    Roofs. Roof pitches should generally be placed to follow the angle of the slope; but with variations to avoid a monotonous appearance. See Figure 3-26.

Figure 3-26. Design Sensitive to Terrain

Note: This diagram is intended to provide an example of building form, and is not intended to show a preferred architectural style.

5.    Support structures. Support structures (for example, columns, pilings, etc.) below the lowest floor on the downhill side of a house, should be enclosed unless visible structural members are an integral feature of the architectural design. Support structure wall surfaces shall not exceed six feet in height.

F.    View protection. New construction should not block views from other properties.

1.    Where feasible, new structures and tall landscaping should not be placed directly in the view of the primary living areas on a neighboring parcel.

2.    New structures should be placed on the lower areas of a hillside site.

3.    Mechanical equipment may be placed on rooftops or below a deck only if the equipment is not visible from off the site, except for unobtrusive solar collectors that are compatible with the roof line and architecturally integrated with the structure.


[IMAGE]


Figure 3-27. View Protection

G.    Colors and materials. A mixture of materials, color, and forms should be used to blend structures with the natural appearance of the hillsides:

1.    Based upon the graphic principle that dark colors are less noticeable than light colors, darker tones, including earth tones should be used for building walls and roofs on highly-visible sites so that buildings appear to blend in with the natural terrain.

2.    Surface materials should be appropriate for the architectural style of the structure and compatible with the hillside environment.

H.    Exterior lighting. Night views of the hillsides should not be dominated by bright lights. Lighting within high-visibility areas should be properly shielded to avoid glare and the spill of light to surrounding areas. Low-level lighting and the use of multiple low profile fixtures is encouraged, as opposed to the use of fewer, but taller fixtures.

I.    Retaining walls. Large retaining walls in a uniform plane shall be avoided. Retaining walls shall be divided into terraces with variations in plane and include landscaping to break up the length of walls and to screen them from view. No retaining wall shall be higher than six feet, and should incorporate a three foot recessed offset feature every 30 feet, or other methods of articulation. Retaining walls more than three feet high that are visible from off the site should be screened with landscaping. See Figure 3-28.

36.340.050 Hillside Project Development Standards.

A.    Setbacks. Hillside developments shall comply with the following setback requirements, and with the limitations on the allowable uses of setbacks in Section 36.300.030.E.3.

	TABLE 3-10. HILLSIDE SETBACKS

	Property Setback	Setback Distance

	Front	10 ft.

	Side	10% of width, minimum 4 ft., maximum 10 ft.

	Corner Side	10% of width, minimum 10 ft., maximum 15 ft.

	Ridgeline (1)	50 vertical feet from ridgeline. Also see 36.340.050.C, and Figure 3-31.

	Notes:

(1) New structures or additions are prohibited within 50 feet of a ridgeline unless this restriction precludes development of the property. An exception may be granted if the review authority finds the following:

a. There are no site development alternatives that avoid ridgeline development;

b. The density has been reduced to the minimum standards consistent with the General Plan density range;

c. No new subdivision of parcels is created that will result in ridgeline development; and

d. The proposed development will not have significant adverse visual impacts due to modifications in structural design including height, bulk, size, foundation, siting, and landscaping that avoid or minimize the visual impacts of the development.

B.    Setbacks between structures and toes/tops of slopes. On adjacent lots having a difference in vertical elevation of three feet or more, the required side yard shall be measured from the nearest toe or top of slope to the structure, whichever is closer. See Figure 3-29.


[IMAGE]


Figure 3-29. Side Setback Measurement

C.    Height limitations. The maximum height for structures with a roof pitch of 3:12 or greater shall be 28 feet. If a roof pitch is less than 3:12, the maximum height shall be 24 feet.

1.    Siting restrictions. Structures shall not be placed so that they appear silhouetted against the sky when viewed from a public street, except where the review authority determines that the only feasible building site cannot comply with this standard. See Figure 3-30.


[IMAGE]


Figure 3-30. Silhouetted Structures

2.    Placement below ridgeline. Except as provided by Subsection C.3, structures shall be located so that a vertical separation of at least 50 feet is provided between the top of the structure and the top of the ridge or knoll to maintain the natural appearance of the ridge. Grading should also be avoided within 50 vertical feet of the top of a ridge or knoll. Placement of structures should also take advantage of existing vegetation for screening, and should include the installation of additional native plant materials to augment existing vegetation, where appropriate. See Figure 3-31.


[IMAGE]


Figure 3-31. Location of Structures Below Ridgelines

3.    Height limit above ridgeline. Where the review authority determines that a parcel contains no feasible building site other than where a structure will extend above the ridgeline, proposed structures shall not exceed a height of 16 feet above the highest point on the ridgeline or hilltop within 100 feet of the proposed structure.

4.    Height of lowest floor level. The vertical distance between the lowest point where the foundation meets grade and the lowest floor line of the structure shall not exceed six feet.

5.    Downhill building walls. No single building wall on the downhill side of a house shall exceed 15 feet in height above grade. Additional building height on a downhill side may be allowed in 15-foot increments, where each increment is stepped-back from the lower wall a minimum of 10 feet (see Figure 3-32).


[IMAGE]


Figure 3-32. Height Limit for Downhill Building Walls

D.    Decks. No portion of the walking surface of a deck with visible underpinnings shall exceed a height of six feet above grade. Decks should be integrated into the architecture of the house, not appearing as an “add-on” to the primary building mass.

E.    Driveways. The ramp to any garage or carport shall not have a grade steeper than five percent within 10 feet of the garage or carport entry. The finished grade of driveways shall not exceed an average of 15 percent.

F.    Natural state. A minimum of 25 percent of the lot area plus the percentage figure of the average slope must be remediated to its natural state in terms of slope and vegetation.

G.    Grading. Grading plans shall be prepared in compliance with the Municipal Code, and the General Plan, which prohibits grading on slopes over 30 percent. Grading shall utilize landform grading techniques. See Figure 3-33.

Light processing facilities are limited to baling, briquetting, compacting, crushing, grinding, shredding and sorting of source separated recyclable materials sufficient to qualify as a certified processing facility. A light processing facility shall not shred, compact, or bale ferrous metals other than food and beverage containers; and

b.    A heavy processing facility is any processing facility other than a light processing facility.

4.    Recycling facility. A center for the collection and/or processing of recyclable materials. A “certified” recycling or processing facility is certified by the California Department of Conservation as meeting the requirements of the California Beverage Container Recycling and Litter Reduction Act of 1986. A recycling facility does not include storage containers located on a residentially, commercially or industrially designated site used solely for the recycling of material generated on the site. See “Collection Facility” above.

5.    Recycling or recyclable material. Reusable domestic containers and other materials which can be reconstituted, re-manufactured, or reused in an altered form, including glass, metals, paper and plastic. Recyclable material does not include refuse or hazardous materials.

6.    Reverse vending machine. An automated mechanical device which accepts at least one or more types of empty beverage containers and issues a cash refund or a redeemable credit slip with a value not less than the container’s redemption value, as determined by State law. These vending machines may accept aluminum cans, glass and plastic bottles, and other containers.

A bulk reverse vending machine is a reverse vending machine that is larger than 50 square feet, is designed to accept more than one container at a time, and issues a cash refund based on total weight instead of by container.

7.    Scrap and dismantling yards. Outdoor establishments primarily engaged in assembling, breaking up, sorting, and the temporary storage and distribution of recyclable or reusable scrap and waste materials, including auto wreckers engaged in dismantling automobiles for scrap, and the incidental wholesale or retail sales of parts from those vehicles. Includes light and heavy processing facilities for recycling (see the definitions above). Does not include: places where these activities are conducted entirely within buildings; pawn shops, and other secondhand stores; the sale of operative used cars; or landfills or other waste disposal sites.

36.350.170 Residential Uses—Accessory Residential Structures and Private Residential Recreational Facilities.

This Section provides standards for accessory residential structures and private residential recreational facilities, which may be permitted where allowed by Article 2 (Zoning Districts, Allowable Land Uses, and Zone-Specific Standards), provided that an accessory residential structure or private residential recreational facility shall be incidental to, and not alter the residential character of the dwelling or dwellings or the site.

A.    Site and timing requirements. An accessory residential structure or private residential recreational facility may be established in compliance with this Section only on a lot with an existing dwelling or dwellings, or simultaneously with the development of a new dwelling or dwellings. If a parcel contains more than one lot, such structures/facilities shall only be established on the lot on which the dwelling is located, unless the lots are first merged or otherwise legally joined so as to constitute a single legal entity.

B.    Prohibited facilities. An accessory residential structure shall not be equipped with:

1.    Cooking or sleeping facilities, except that an unenclosed gazebo may have an “outdoor kitchen” (grill, sink, wet bar, etc.);

2.    Restroom facilities, except that a parcel with a permanent (requires a construction permit(s)) swimming pool or spa pool may have a poolhouse or cabana with a sink and/or shower and/or toilet. When a poolhouse has a toilet, a covenant shall be required stating that the poolhouse shall be maintained as an accessory structure and not be used for sleeping quarters or be converted to a residential use. The purpose of the covenant is to ensure that subsequent owners of the property are aware of this restriction. This covenant shall be recorded against the property’s title, and evidence of recordation shall be provided to the Planning and Building Department prior to the issuance of a construction permit.

3.    Plumbing, except a pool house or pool cabana may have a sink and/or shower and/or toilet per SPMC 36.350.170(B)(2), and a garage (detached or attached), but not a carport, may have washer/dryer hookups (water and gas supply and sewer connection) and/or a hand or utility sink, and a water heater, if the following conditions are satisfied:

a.    The location of the washer/dryer does not encroach into the required parking space(s).

b.    Showers and/or bathtubs and/or toilets are prohibited.

c.    Cooking facilities are prohibited.

d.    Only one of each (utility or hand sink, washer/dryer connection, water heater) is allowed per garage.

e.    A covenant shall be recorded against the property’s title noting that the plumbing facilities can only service a sink and/or washer/dryer; that toilets, bathtubs, and showers are prohibited; and that the structure cannot be used as habitable space. The purpose of the covenant is to ensure that future owners are aware of these restrictions.

f.    All applicable construction code requirements shall be adhered to and all required construction permits shall be obtained.

g.    In the event that the location of the washer and/or dryer would encroach into the required parking space(s), any extension of the garage (to create a space for these appliances) shall:

(1)    Be subject to review and approval by the chair of the applicable design authority;

(2)    Not be visible from the street;

(3)    Meet required minimum setbacks and floor area ratio/lot coverage requirements;

(4)    Meet building and fire code requirements.

C.    Site layout and design standards.

1.    Exterior design and materials. An accessory residential structure shall be architecturally compatible with the primary structure, and have the same architectural style and materials.

2.    Maximum floor area. The floor area of an accessory residential structure (excluding detached garages/carports) shall not exceed 200 square feet, and the aggregate area of all accessory structures (excluding detached garages/carports) on the site shall not exceed 700 square feet. When a detached garage is combined with another type of accessory residential structure (workshop, poolhouse, etc.), the area of the non-garage portion of said structure shall not exceed 200 square feet. All dimensions refer to gross floor area, which is measured from the outside surfaces of the exterior walls. All accessory structures are included in the applicable floor area ratio limit, except that the first 500 square feet of a garage or carport are exempted. Lot coverage limits also apply. All accessory structures that require a building permit are subject to Design Review and any adopted design guidelines.

3.    Setback requirements. An accessory residential structure shall comply with the setback requirements established by Article 2 (Zoning Districts, Allowable Land Uses and Permit Requirements), except that:

a.    A structure with a floor area of 120 square feet or less may be located within a required side or rear setback, but not within a front setback or in front of the front-most dwelling unit on the lot;

b.    An accessory residential structure shall be located at least five feet from a side and/or rear property line. Such structures cannot be located in the front setback or in front of the front-most dwelling unit on the lot;

c.    A detached garage or carport shall be located at least two feet from a side and/or rear property line provided that such structure (if less than five feet from a property line) meets the following requirements:

(1)    A detached garage shall have no openings in the exterior walls abutting the property lines,

(2)    The structure is constructed of one-hour fire resistant materials, and

(3)    A provision is made for all water runoff to drain onto the subject property;

A detached garage or carport shall not be located in the front of the front-most dwelling unit on the lot, except for development that is subject to the approval of a Hillside Development Permit (SPMC Section 36.410.065). In no case shall a detached garage or carport be allowed within a front yard setback;

d.    Accessory structures shall be located at or beyond the required street-facing side yard setback for the dwelling/s, except if the Director determines that a lesser setback can be approved using the Administrative Use Permit process detailed in subsection (C)(3)(f);

e.    Private residential recreational facilities shall be located at least five feet from a side and/or rear property line and cannot be located in the front setback or in front of the front-most dwelling unit on the lot or in the street-facing side setback of a corner lot; and

f.    A new detached garage or carport to replace a previous garage or carport that was legal nonconforming in terms of side/rear setbacks may be allowed within the required five-foot setback with the approval of an Administrative Use Permit (AUP). This exemption also applies to front setbacks for hillside properties (as defined in SPMC Section 36.340.020(A)) and to street-facing side yards for corner lots. In determining whether it is impractical or unfeasible to provide a standard size garage (20 feet by 20 feet) at the required five-foot side/rear setback (and/or 10-foot front setback for a hillside property, or required street-facing side yard setback for a corner lot), the Director shall consider if such a location will result in an inefficient site plan, a development pattern that is inconsistent with surrounding development, or the loss of the property’s only available private outdoor living area, and whether the following conditions exist/apply:

(1)    The property is substandard in size, less than 10,000 square feet,

(2)    The property is substandard in width, less than 50 feet wide, or

(3)    The property contains the following features:

(A)    Protected heritage trees,

(B)    A home listed on the City’s Inventory of Historic Resources, or

(C)    Physical features that would make it impractical or unfeasible to provide a standard size garage that observes the required setback,

(4)    The prevailing development pattern of the surrounding properties.

The exemption in subsection (C)(3)(f) shall only apply for the reconstruction of a previously existing garage or carport that was voluntarily demolished pursuant to a permit and all other necessary approvals. Replacement garages/carports shall meet (but not exceed) current minimum size requirements unless the Director determines that physical constraints (per subsection (C)(3)(f)(3)(C) of this section) preclude this. Involuntarily destroyed structures are subject SPMC 36.360.060 (Nonconforming Uses, Structures, and Parcels, Exemptions and Exceptions). New accessory structures that are not replacements shall conform to the required setbacks, except for those located on the street-facing side of the lot, which may be located within the required street-facing setback, subject to the approval of an AUP.

g.    A structure containing an “outdoor kitchen” shall meet all Fire Code requirements, which may include a 10-foot setback depending on the size, type, and location of the structure and/or the facilities contained therein.

4.    Height limit. An accessory residential structure shall not exceed:

a.    Eight feet for a structure allowed within a setback in compliance with subsection (C)(3)(a).

b.    Nine feet (at top plate height) for a new detached garage or carport if located within two to five feet from a property line. The plate height represents the top of the wall studs (or supporting pole of a carport), which intersects with the horizontal, structural member of the wall frame (or roof of a carport). Exceptions to the nine foot height limit may be allowed for the following cases:

(1)    The overall height of an accessory structure (excluding the top plate height) may rise above the nine foot height limit as it steps or slopes away from the two-foot initial setback, but shall not intercept an encroachment plane sloping inward from a point nine feet in height (beginning at the two-foot setback) and rising to a maximum of one and one-half feet for each one foot of distance starting at the two-foot setback. See Figure 1.

(2)    For a detached garage with a flat roof, the overall height of such structure (excluding the top plate height) may rise to a maximum height of 10 feet at the top of a parapet.

c.    Fifteen feet for a detached structure located at or beyond the required five-foot setback, except that a detached garage (but not a carport) height of up to 22 feet may be allowed if the Review Authority makes a finding that the additional height is required so as to be consistent with the roof pitch of the main dwelling.

d.    No accessory residential structure shall have more than one story, except that any attic space under the roof may be used for storage only, with access permitted only by pull-down stairs. Permanent stairs are prohibited.

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1; Ord. No. 2190 § 4, 2009; Ord. No. 2203 § 2, 2010; Ord. No. 2270, §§ 3, 4, 2014.)


36.350.180 Residential Uses—Courtyard Housing.

The following provisions are intended to encourage the construction of courtyard housing as an attractive and liveable alternative to other forms of multi-family housing development, by providing alternatives to certain development standards of this Zoning Code as incentives.

A.    Procedure for incentives. A multi-family housing project that is proposed as courtyard housing in compliance with this Section may be granted incentives as follows.

1.    Allowable incentives. The review authority may grant any combination of the following incentives at the request of an applicant, provided that the review authority shall have the discretion to offer none of the incentives, and may choose to require compliance with all otherwise applicable residential development regulations.

a.    Driveways used exclusively for ingress and egress or for interior parking lot circulation may be designed and improved with steeper grades in courtyard structures than in other residential structures with the approval of the Fire Department. Ramp grades shall not exceed a 20 percent slope with approach ramps as close to a three percent slope as feasible.

b.    The first floor of a structure, up to a maximum height of 12 feet, may extend 10 feet into the required rear yard setback. The second floor up to a maximum height of 24 feet, may extend five feet into the required rear setback. An area equal to the area of the required rear setback that is occupied by the building shall be provided as common open space at grade level in the courtyard area, in addition to all required front and side setbacks.

c.    The first floor of a structure with a maximum height of 15 feet, may extend a maximum of 12 feet into, and cover a maximum of 50 percent of the required front yard, but shall contain only habitable or porch space. An extension into the front yard that exceeds seven and one-half feet shall not be wider than 20 feet, and shall be separated from an adjacent extension into the front yard by a minimum of 10 feet.

d.    A semi-subterranean parking garage that does not extend more than 30 inches above grade may be built to a side property line but shall not project into the required rear setback. An area equal to the area of the required side setback that is occupied by the garage shall be provided as common open space at grade level in the courtyard area.

2.    Criteria for approval. The review authority may approve courtyard housing project with incentives in compliance with this Section if it first finds that the project:

a.    Complies with all applicable provisions of this Section; and

b.    Provides a higher quality design than would have been provided under the otherwise applicable standards.

3.    Alternatives to courtyard design standards. Project approval shall require that the review authority first make a finding of compliance for each of the design and development standards of this Section. The review authority may approve alternative courtyard design standards, provided that the review authority first finds that each alternative:

a.    Achieves a better design solution for the courtyard and development than would result from application of the basic courtyard regulations; and

b.    Would not materially affect adjoining properties.

B.    Courtyard and common open space requirements. The project shall provide common open space as required for multi-family projects by Section 36.350.190. The open space shall be located on the site as follows.

1.    Courtyard required. A courtyard housing project shall include a clearly defined courtyard space. The structure may, for example, be “O,” “L,” or “U” shaped. See Figure 3-34. A distinct outdoor communal space (or series of spaces) shall be provided to serve as a focus for the housing units, with individual entries to the living units provided from the spaces.

a.    If more than 30 percent of the common open space requirement is proposed in the rear yard, an opening of at least 10 feet wide and 10 feet high shall provide a view to the rear yard from the courtyard;

b.    For an opening less than 10 feet wide, the length shall not exceed twice the width. The height of the opening shall be no less than its width; and

c.    An opening 15 feet wide or more shall be open to the sky.

4.    Open space in balconies, decks, and terraces. A portion of the common open space requirement for the project may be provided in balconies, decks, and terraces that are open and unrestricted for use by all residents, in compliance with the following standards:

a.    75 percent of balconies, roof decks, or terraces that are counted as common open space in a courtyard project shall be directly adjacent to and overlook the courtyard, and should be seen as an extension of the courtyard;

b.    The space shall not be more than two floors above the courtyard and shall be connected directly to the courtyard with a grand stairway or other appropriate connection if it represents more than 10 percent of the common open space; and

c.    The space shall have no dimension less than 10 feet, if one level or less above the courtyard, and no dimension less than 15 feet, if two or more levels above the courtyard.

5.    Secondary courtyards. Secondary courtyards shall be allowed in compliance with the following standards:

a.    If 30 percent or more of the common open space required is provided in additional courtyards, the additional courtyards shall meet all of the requirements for the main courtyard except for visual access to the street; and

b.    If less than 30 percent of the common open space required is provided in additional courtyards the additional courtyards shall comply with the same visibility, access, and dimensional standards as common open space in the rear setback.

C.    Courtyard design standards.

1.    Entrance from street. The courtyard shall address the street, and be easily accessible from the street, with a spacious, clearly defined grand entry, grand stairs if appropriate, or other similar treatment. At least a portion of the courtyard should be visible from the street. The courtyard is best located on the level of the street or 30 inches above or below the street.

a.    On parcels with a slope greater than four percent between the street elevation and the rear elevation of the site, the courtyard may be located more than two and one-half feet above or below street level, but no more than five feet.

b.    On parcels with a slope less than four percent between the street elevation and the rear elevation of the site, the courtyard may be at the level of natural grade or up to three feet above or below natural grade. Natural grade shall be measured at the sidewalk (front) property line at the location of the entrance to the courtyard.

c.    On parcels with more than 60 feet of street frontage, an opening in the structure at least 10 feet wide and 10 feet high shall be provided. The opening may be designed with security enclosures which are treated in the same design style as the structure itself.

d.    Passageways from the front yard to the courtyard which are less than 15 feet wide shall have a length no greater than twice the width. The height of the opening shall be no less than the width.

e.    Openings that are 10 feet or more in width and 20 feet more in length shall be open to the sky.

(1)    At least 35 percent of the total courtyard area shall be planted;

(2)    A courtyard with a minimum area of 1,500 square feet shall have at least one canopy tree with a minimum mature height of 35 feet. An additional canopy tree of the same size shall be included for each additional 1,000 square feet of courtyard area. The minimum tree size at planting shall be 15 gallons; and

(3)    Poured surfaces (e.g., asphalt or concrete) may be used for walkways up to five feet in width but are not acceptable for area paving. Unplanted areas with a minimum dimension of five feet or more shall be paved with unit pavers (e.g., brick, concrete, or tile) set or covered with decomposed granite or garden gravel.

b.    Courtyard over subterranean parking. The courtyard may be at natural grade over a fully subterranean parking structure, or up to three feet above street level at the entry over a semi-subterranean parking structure. Where possible, planted areas should be installed at the same grade as adjacent walkways. Courtyards or parts of courtyards over subterranean parking shall comply with the following requirements in addition to the requirements of Subsection D.2.a, above for gardens on grade.

(1)    Planting beds shall be on two feet of soil. If above the grade level of the courtyard, the walls of the planters may be no more than two feet above finished grade.

Figure 3-35. Plantings over Garage

(3)    Appropriate drainage and irrigation shall be provided for planters, tree wells, and the soil covering the parking structure.

c.    Courtyard over partially subterranean parking. The courtyard may be no more than three feet above natural grade over a partially subterranean parking structure. For gardens or parts of gardens over partially subterranean parking the following requirements shall be met in addition to the requirements identified above for gardens at natural grade and over fully subterranean parking.

(1)    Except for tree wells, planters, and decorative garden elements (e.g., fountains, etc.) the entire surface of the courtyard shall be covered with a minimum of eight inches of soil or unit pavers set in sand or soil with a total minimum depth of eight inches.

(2)    Finished grade at the courtyard and existing grade at the sidewalk entrance to the courtyard shall be used in determining the height of the main garden above the natural grade.

E.    Building design.

1.    Upper floor setbacks. Courtyard structures of more than two stories shall set back each floor above the second a distance from the courtyard of at least one foot for each foot in height above the second floor, on at least 65 percent of the courtyard perimeter.

2.    Unit orientation. All units in a courtyard structure shall be “through” units and shall have an exposure off the courtyard as well as an exposure on at least one other side of the structure.

3.    Access to individual units.

a.    Interior corridors are prohibited. The majority of units shall have their primary entrances directly from the courtyard space. Additional entrances may serve units from the street front or from subsidiary common open spaces. No common access balcony above the level of the courtyard floor shall have a single or combined length greater than one side of the courtyard.

b.    Shared entrances from the courtyard in the form of porches, recesses in the structure, stairs, or stoops may serve no more than two units.

c.    Transitional spaces in the form of overhangs, porches, and stoops, between public areas or common spaces and entrances to the units shall be provided for each unit or group of units.

4.    Architectural standards. The following provisions address the quality of the structures that surround and define a courtyard, and make a crucial contribution to the life and quality of these spaces. These provisions are intended to encourage courtyard housing design features that are appropriate to the City, and prohibit inappropriate ones.

a.    Objectives. Architectural elements (e.g., balconies, bay windows, entrances, and porches) shall signal human habitation and are an essential aspect of a successful courtyard structure. The architectural heritage of the City’s courtyard structures owes a great deal to craftsmanship and the contributions of craftspeople to the quality of the structures. It is a purpose of this Subparagraph to perpetuate the craft tradition which is an important element of this structure type. The City is, and has always been, heterogeneous architecturally, and this Zoning Code is not prescriptive with respect to the style or the architectural character of structures. It does, however, encourage structures which are designed, detailed, and constructed with care and consistency, and which are enriched by the contribution of individual artisans.

b.    Required elements. Each new courtyard structure shall incorporate as least one feature as a conspicuous component of its architecture which demonstrates skilled craftwork. Examples of these features include cast terra cotta, iron gates, stenciled ornament, tile fountains, wood work, or other devices.

c.    Special features. Part of the special charm of courtyard structures comes from the presence of particular structural elements including the following. Each courtyard structure shall incorporate at least two of the following elements. The substitution of elements not on the list may be approved by the review authority. See Figure 3-36.

(1)    Upper floor loggias or pergolas recessed within a structure.

(2)    Roofed balconies supported by brackets or by columns at the ground floor.

(3)    Exterior wooden or masonry stairs with closed risers.

(4)    Tile or masonry fountains.


[IMAGE]


Figure 3-36. Courtyard Housing Special Features

d.    Materials.

(1)    In order to ensure that new structures appear substantial and integral, changes of exterior color, texture, or material shall be accompanied by changes in plane. An exception is the articulation of the base of a structure.

(2)    Material or color changes at the outside corners of structures give an impression of thinness and artificiality and are not allowed.

(3)    Structures should have consistent materials and details throughout. Detailing of doors, windows, and eaves and the type and quality of materials should be similar on all sides of structures.

(4)    New courtyard structures should reflect the City’s architectural traditions. This means that careful decisions shall be made concerning the choice, application, and detailing of materials so that new construction reflects the best examples of the type in the City. Windows and doors shall be outlined by projecting surrounds that completely enclose these openings, or be deeply recessed.

F.    Parking entry. The visibility of the parking entry from the street shall be minimized and designed to be architecturally sensitive to, and treated as, an integral part of the street facade.

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1.)

36.360.010 Purpose of Division.

This Division establishes uniform provisions for the regulation of nonconforming land uses, structures, and parcels.

A.    Within the zoning districts established by this Zoning Code, there exist land uses, structures, and parcels that were lawful before the adoption, or amendment of this Zoning Code, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted differently under the terms of this Zoning Code or future amendments. These are considered nonconforming uses, structures, and parcels.

B.    This Division does not apply to land uses, structures, and parcels that were illegally established, constructed, or subdivided. These are instead subject to Division 36.640 (Enforcement).

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1.)


36.360.020 Nonconforming Uses, Structures, and Parcels.

The following provisions shall apply to all nonconforming uses, structures, and parcels existing as of the effective date of this Division:

A.    Continuation of use. Any nonconforming use may be maintained and continued; provided, there is no increase or enlargement of the area, space, or volume occupied by or devoted to the nonconforming use.

B.    Abandonment or discontinuance of use.

1.    Any part of a structure or land occupied by a nonconforming use, which use is:

a.    Abandoned, shall not again be used or occupied for a nonconforming use;

b.    Discontinued for a period of at least 12 months, shall not again be used or occupied for a nonconforming use, unless the use is nonconforming due to parking, in which case the use would not be considered to be abandoned or discontinued (see also Section 36.360.060(B)); or

c.    Changed to or replaced by a conforming use shall not again be used or occupied by a nonconforming use.

2.    Without any further action by the City, a nonconforming use shall not retain the nonconforming protection/benefits provided by this Division if:

a.    The nonconforming use of land, or a nonconforming use within a structure, ceases for any reason for a continuous period of at least 180 days:

(1)    A vacant nonconformity may be occupied by a use for which it was designed if so occupied within a period of 180 days after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this Zoning Code or after the date when the nonconformity first became vacant.

(2)    If the use is discontinued for a continuous period of 180 days, the land or structure shall lose its nonconforming status, and shall be altered to conform to the current provisions of this Zoning Code. The use shall be considered discontinued when any of the following apply:

(a)    The intent of the owner to discontinue use of the nonconformity is apparent; or

(b)    Where characteristic furnishings and equipment of the use have been removed and not replaced with equivalent furnishings and equipment during this time.

(3)    The determination of discontinuance (a.k.a. abandonment) shall be supported by evidence, satisfactory to the Director (e.g., the actual removal of equipment, furniture, machinery, structures, or other components of the nonconforming use, the turning-off of the previously connected utilities, or where there are no business receipts/records available to provide evidence that the use is in continual operation).

b.    The structure in which the nonconforming use is conducted or maintained is moved any distance on the site for any reason, or is removed from the site.

c.    The use of the site after the discontinuance or removal of a nonconforming use shall comply with all current requirements of this Zoning Code and the subject zoning district.

C.    Change from one nonconforming use to another. If no structural alterations are made, a nonconforming use of a structure may be changed to another nonconforming use of a more restrictive classification. However, the replacement use shall serve as the “new bench mark” in terms of establishing the acceptable level of nonconformity.

D.    Maintenance of a nonconforming structure. Any nonconforming structure may be maintained and continued; provided, there is no physical change other than necessary maintenance and repair to the structure, except as allowed by this Division.

E.    Legally established residential parcel. An existing residential parcel that is nonconforming with respect to lot size, and was legally subdivided, is a legal, nonconforming parcel, and is not affected by the minimum lot size requirements of this Zoning Code for new subdivisions. Each nonconforming parcel may continue to be used, but shall not be further divided. Each residential structure existing on a nonconforming residential parcel may continue to be used, and may be enlarged in compliance with this Zoning Code.

F.    Made nonconforming by this Zoning Code. Any legally established use or structure made nonconforming by the adoption of this Zoning Code shall be considered legal nonconforming, and fully protected by the provisions of this Division.

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1; Ord. No. 2257 § 4, 2013.)


36.360.030 Application of Regulations.

The following provisions shall apply to all nonconforming uses and structures, located within any zoning district in the City.

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1.)


36.360.040 Continuation of Nonconforming Uses and Structures.

Except as otherwise provided in this Division, each and every nonconforming use or structure may be continually utilized and maintained, provided that there is no addition, alteration, or enlargement to any use or structure.

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1.)


36.360.050 Limitation on Other Uses.

Except as hereinafter expressly provided, so long as a nonconforming use or structure exists upon any parcel, no new use or structure may be established or constructed on the parcel.

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1.)


36.360.060 Exemptions and Exceptions.

A.    Residential uses or structures.

1.    A nonconforming single- or multifamily dwelling unit or an associated accessory residential structure that has been involuntarily damaged or destroyed by fire, explosion, act of God, or any other casualty, may be reconstructed or replaced with a new structure using the same development standards applied to the damaged or destroyed structures (e.g., setbacks, floor area, building height, and density standards) in compliance with State law (Government Code Section 65852.25), provided:

a.    The applicant provides documentation satisfactory to the Director supporting the claim that the damage or destruction occurred involuntarily;

b.    No expansion of the gross floor area occurs, except that a detached garage or carport may be enlarged to meet (but not exceed) current minimum Code requirements; and

c.    The replacement structure complies with all applicable Building Code requirements; and

d.    A Building Permit is issued no later than 18 months after the date of destruction, and construction is diligently pursued to completion.

2.    If the preceding requirements are not met, the replacement structure shall comply with all current requirements of this Zoning Code in effect on the date of application for the required Building Permit. If the applicant submits a written request before expiration of the 18 months, containing a reasonable justification for an extension, the Director may extend the deadline for the issuance of the Building Permit for up to an additional 18 months.

B.    Change of use with nonconforming parking. A use that is nonconforming only because it does not comply with applicable off-street parking requirements, may be changed to a use allowed in the zoning district that is required by Section 36.310.040 (Number of Parking Spaces Required) to provide off-street parking at the same ratio as the nonconforming use. A more intense use may be allowed provided an Administrative Use Permit is obtained. A parking study or other materials/information found to be satisfactory to the Director, may be required for the granting of an Administrative Use Permit.

C.    Public utilities exempted. The provisions of this Division concerning the required removal of nonconforming uses and structures, and the reconstruction of nonconforming structures partially destroyed, shall not apply to public utility structures when the structures pertain directly to the rendering of the service of distribution of a utility (e.g., electric distribution and transmission substations, gas storage, metering, and valve control stations, steam electric generating stations, water wells and pumps, etc.); nor shall any provision of this Division be construed to prevent the expansion, modernization, or replacement of the public utility structures, equipment, and features, as are used directly for the delivery of or distribution of the service.

D.    Public acquisition. Whenever any structure or parcel is rendered nonconforming within the meaning of this Division by reason of a reduction in a required parcel area, yard area, or reduction of off-street parking facilities, occurring solely by reason of dedication to, or purchase by, the City for any public purpose, or eminent domain proceedings, which result in the acquisition by the City or any agency authorized for the eminent domain proceedings of a portion of the property, the same shall not be deemed nonconforming within the meaning of this Division, provided that if the structures located on the parcel subsequent to the acquisition, are wholly destroyed, no reconstruction shall take place unless it is in full compliance with all applicable provisions of this Zoning Code.

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1; Ord. No. 2190 § 7, 2009; Ord. No. 2257 § 6, 2013.)


36.360.070 Abatement and Termination of Use.

Except as expressly provided in this Division, whenever any of the following facts are found to exist with respect to a nonconforming use, the use shall be abated and the use terminated.

A.    Violation. Violation of any applicable law;

B.    Change to nonconforming use. A change from a nonconforming use to another nonconforming use, except as provided by this Division;

C.    Change to conforming use. A change from a nonconforming use to a conforming use;

D.    Increase in area. An increase or enlargement of the area, space, or volume of the structure or land occupied by or devoted to the nonconforming use, except as provided by this Division, and the requirements of the Uniform Building Code are met. New additions or alterations shall not increase existing nonconformities;

E.    Structural alteration. Any structural alteration, except those required by law; or

F.    Abandonment. Abandonment (discontinuance of the utilization of a nonconforming use for a period of at least 180 days shall be deemed to constitute abandonment), in compliance with Subsection 36.360.020.B (Abandonment or discontinuance of use), above.

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1.)


36.360.080 Repair and Maintenance.

A.    Ordinary repair and maintenance. The ordinary repair and maintenance of a nonconforming structure shall be allowed only in compliance with this Section.

B.    Eminent domain. The reconstruction, remodeling, or repair of any structure shall be allowed where a part of the structure is taken for any public use by condemnation, dedication, or purchase by any agency having the power of eminent domain. The reconstruction, remolding, or repair shall be limited to that necessary to render the structure reasonably safe for continued use.

C.    Involuntary damage or destruction—Nonresidential structures. Where any nonconforming nonresidential structure is involuntarily damaged or partially destroyed by fire, explosion, Act of God, or any other casualty:

1.    To the extent that the costs for repair or replacement do not exceed 60 percent of the total replacement cost of the structure, as established by the Building Official, in any single calendar year, use of the structure may be resumed in compliance with the provisions applicable before the involuntary damage occurred.

2.    To the extent that the costs for repair or replacement exceed 60 percent, or the structure is voluntarily razed or is required by law to be razed, use of the structure shall not be resumed, except in full conformance with the current provisions of this Zoning Code.

Provided that:

a.    All reconstruction and/or repair work shall be completed within a period of 18 months from the date of application for the required Building Permit. If the applicant submits a written request before expiration of the 18 months, containing a reasonable justification for an extension, the Director may extend the deadline for completion for up to an additional 18 months;

b.    Historic landmarks and structures in historic districts shall be eligible for an extended period of time in which to complete the reconstruction and/or repair work as determined to be appropriate by the Director; and

c.    The reconstruction or replacement structure shall be subject to Design Review in compliance with Section 36.410.040 (Design Review).

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1.)


36.360.090 Alterations or Additions to Nonconforming Structures.

Nothing in this Division shall be deemed to prevent the construction, enlargement, expansion, extension, or reconstruction (hereafter referred to as “work”) of a nonconforming structure as follows:

A.    Elimination of nonconformity. The work shall be allowed in order to render the use or structure in conformity with this Zoning Code;

B.    Compliance with laws. The work shall be allowed in order to comply with any law enacted subsequent to the adoption of this Zoning Code;

C.    Increase in area. The work shall be allowed if it results in an increase or enlargement of the area, space, or volume of the structure only if the structure is nonconforming with respect to setbacks, height, distance between structures, architectural projections, staircase and landing area encroachments, and the requirements of the Uniform Building Code are met. New additions or alterations shall not increase existing nonconformities (e.g., the construction may comply with the existing nonconforming setbacks but shall not propose any further encroachment into the required setbacks);

D.    Damaged by earthquake. A nonconforming structure damaged by an earthquake or that has been identified as subject to the provisions of City Council Ordinance Number 1912 (The Earthquake Hazard Reduction in Existing Buildings), may be replaced with a new structure having the same nonconformity, provided further, that any additions or enlargements beyond that of the original structure shall conform to all applicable current developmental standards. The replacement structure shall be subject to Design Review in compliance with Section 36.410.040 (Design Review);

E.    Nonresidential off-street parking.

1.    The work shall be allowed in connection with any nonresidential use or structure which is nonconforming solely by reason of an insufficient number of off-street parking spaces, and the work would not otherwise require, by reason of the construction or reconstruction, any additional parking spaces.

2.    If the number of existing off-street parking spaces is insufficient to comply with the requirements after the expansion, increase, or modification, additional parking spaces shall be added. The number of spaces to be added shall be equal only to the number required for the area of expansion, increase, or modification. Any additional required off-street parking spaces shall be developed in compliance with Division 36.310 (Parking and Loading).

F.    Residential off-street parking.

1.    If the work is in connection with a residential unit that is listed on the City’s Cultural Heritage Inventory (hereinafter “cultural resource”) and is nonconforming due to an insufficient number of covered parking spaces, the Director may waive the requirement for two covered spaces if as part of a Certificate of Appropriateness, the Cultural Heritage Commission first determines that either of the following circumstances apply:

a.    Providing the two covered parking spaces would otherwise result in a substantial adverse change in the historic significance of a cultural resource; or

b.    Providing the two covered parking spaces would jeopardize the integrity of the cultural resource (as defined in National Register Bulletin 15: How to Apply the National Register Criteria for Evaluation).

In determining whether to waive the requirement for two covered parking spaces in connection with work to a cultural resource, all of the following conditions shall exist:

c.    The existing garage contributes to the historic significance of the cultural resource. Supporting documentation shall be provided to show that the existing garage was constructed during the period of significance of the cultural resource.

d.    The existing garage space can accommodate at least one vehicle.

e.    The historic garage shall be structurally sound or, if deteriorated, the Cultural Heritage Commission approves a rehabilitation plan for the historic garage as part of the Certificate of Appropriateness approval.

f.    The second required parking space can be accommodated outside of the existing covered parking space within an existing legal driveway, tandem space, carport, etc.

g.    Increases in square footage to the cultural resource would not exceed 50 percent of the square footage of the floor area within the structure that legally existed as of the date of adoption of the ordinance codified in this Section, including any detached accessory buildings and/or guest house.

h.    The proposed work is not associated with the addition of a second residential unit as authorized in SPMC Section 36.350.200, or is not associated with an increase in the number of dwelling units on land zoned for multi-family uses.

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1; Ord. No. 2183 § 17, 2009; Ord. No. 2243 § 4, 2013.)


36.360.100 Conditional Use Permit Requirements.

A.    Use allowed with Conditional Use Permit approval. If a land use was legally established without the requirement for a Conditional Use Permit, but would be required by current Zoning Code provisions to have a Conditional Use Permit, that use shall:

1.    Not be considered a nonconforming use; and

2.    Not be altered in any way unless a Conditional Use Permit is first obtained.

B.    Use no longer allowed with Conditional Use Permit approval. A land use that was established with Conditional Use Permit approval, but is not allowed with Conditional Use Permit approval by the current Zoning Code may continue only in compliance with the original Conditional Use Permit. If the original Conditional Use Permit specified a termination date, then the use shall terminate in compliance with the requirements of the Conditional Use Permit.

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1.)


36.360.110 Unlawful Uses and Structures.

A.    Violations. Uses and structures which did not comply with the applicable provisions of this Zoning Code or prior planning and zoning regulations when established are violations of this Zoning Code and are subject to the provisions of Division 36.640 (Enforcement).

C.    Permits required. The unlawful use or structure shall not continue unless/until permits and entitlements required by this Zoning Code and the Municipal Code are first obtained.

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1.)

G.    Decision. Notice of the Planning Commission’s decision on the affordable housing review shall be mailed within five days of the decision. The granting of a request for a density bonus, incentive, or concession pursuant to this Division shall not be effective until an affordable housing covenant has been recorded in compliance with Section 36.370.090.

H.    Appeal. A decision for an affordable housing review may be appealed in compliance with Division 36.610 (Appeals).

I.    Continued availability. All projects for which a Density Bonus review and/or affordable housing review is granted by the appropriate review authority, must maintain continued affordability of the designated units pursuant to State law and as follows:

1.    Low and very low income units. Affordable units offered for rent to low income and very low income households shall be made available for rent at an affordable rent and shall remain restricted and affordable to the designated income group for a minimum period of 30 years. A longer period of time may be specified if required by any construction or mortgage financing assistance program, mortgage insurance program, or rental subsidy program applicable to the housing development. The Director is authorized to execute the necessary agreement which shall include recordation of a covenant or other document satisfactory to the City Attorney prior to the issuance of a building permit.

2.    Moderate income units. As required by State law (Government Code Section 65915(c)), the initial occupant of moderate income units must be directly related to the receipt of the Density Bonus and are persons, and families of moderate income. Moderate income units must be offered at an affordable cost for person and families of moderate income as defined in Section 50052.5 of the Health and Safety Code. Moderate income units may be offered for subsequent sale to an above-moderate income purchaser; provided that the sale shall result in a recapture by the City, or its designee, of financial interest in the unit equal to:

(3) “CHC” means the Cultural Heritage Commission. (See Municipal Code.)

(4) The Director may defer action on zoning approval applications and refer the items to the Commission for the final decision. In a similar manner, the Director may defer action on a Design Review application and refer the item to the DRB for the final decision.

(5) The Commission shall certify the Environmental Impact Report, except in those instances where the Council has final review authority for the application.

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1; Ord. No. 2183 § 18, 2009; Ord. No. 2185 § 1, 2009; Ord. No. 2246 § 5, 2013; Ord. No. 2248 § 3, 2013; Ord. No. 2251 § 8, 2013; Ord. No. 2252 § 3, 2013; Ord. No. 2253 § 4, 2013; Ord. No. 2297 § 3, 2016.)


36.400.030 Concurrent Zoning Approval Processing.

When a single project incorporates different land uses or features so that this Zoning Code requires more than one zoning approval, the Director may determine that all of the applications should be reviewed, and approved or disapproved, by the highest level review authority identified by Table 4-1 as having authority over the separate approvals required. This action shall not be interpreted as bypassing the applicable review authority identified by Table 4-1, but rather to have their action take the form of a recommendation to the highest level of review authority identified by Table 4-1. (For example, a project that requires a Zoning Map amendment and a Conditional Use Permit should be reviewed and approved by the Council, where a Conditional Use Permit application by itself may be reviewed and acted upon by the Commission.)

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1.)


36.400.040 Application Preparation and Filing.

The preparation and filing of applications for zoning approvals, amendments (e.g., General Plan, Zoning Code, Zoning Map, and specific plan), and other matters pertaining to this Zoning Code shall comply with the following requirements.

A.    Pre-application review.

1.    A prospective applicant or agent is strongly encouraged to request a pre-application review with the Department before completion of project design and the formal submittal of a zoning approval application.

2.    A request by an applicant for pre-application review, accompanied by preliminary project plans and designs and the required filing fee, will be reviewed by affected City departments and other selected agencies.

3.    The reviewing City staff members will inform the applicant of requirements as they apply to the proposed project, provide a preliminary list of issues that will likely be of concern during formal application review, suggest possible alternatives or modifications to the project, and identify any technical studies that may be necessary for the environmental review process when a formal application is filed.

4.    Neither the pre-application review nor information and/or pertinent policies provided by the Department shall be construed as a Department recommendation for approval or disapproval of the application or project.

B.    Application contents and fee. Applications shall include the forms provided by the Department, and all information and materials required by the application content requirements handout provided by the Department for the specific type of application (e.g., Conditional Use Permit, Variance, or others), and the filing fee required by the Council’s Fee Resolution.

C.    Eligibility, filing. All zoning approval and other applications required by this Zoning Code shall be filed with the Department. Applications may be made by:

1.    The owner of the subject property; or

2.    Any agent or representative, with the written consent of the property owner.

 

D.    Filing date. The filing date of an application shall be the date on which the Department receives the last submission, map, plan, or other material required as a part of that application by Subsection A., in compliance with Section 36.400.060 (Application Review) and deemed complete by the Director.

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1.)


36.400.050 Application Fees.

A.    Filing fees required. The Council shall, by resolution, establish a schedule of fees for amendments, zoning approvals, and other matters pertaining to this Code, referred to as the Council’s Fee Resolution. The schedule of fees may be changed from time to time only by resolution of the Council.

B.    Fee waivers. The Council may waive any of the fees required by the Council’s Fee Resolution for sufficient cause being demonstrated by the applicant. The determination of what shall constitute “sufficient cause” shall be at the discretion of the Council.

C.    Refunds and withdrawals.

1.    Recognizing that filing fees are utilized to cover City costs of public hearings, mailing, posting, transcripts, and staff time involved in processing applications, no refunds due to a disapproval of an application are allowed.

2.    In the case of an application withdrawal, the Director may authorize a partial refund based upon the pro-rated costs to-date and determination of the status of the application at the time of withdrawal.

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1.)


36.400.060 Application Review.

All applications filed with the Department in compliance with this Zoning Code shall be initially processed as follows.

A.    Completeness review. No application will be scheduled for review until deemed complete in compliance with the following requirements.

1.    Notification of applicant. The applicant shall be informed in writing within 30 days of submittal, either that the application is complete and has been accepted for processing, or that the application is incomplete and that additional information, specified in the letter, shall be provided. All additional information needed shall be identified in the letter providing notice of an incomplete application.

2.    Environmental information. The Director may require the applicant to submit additional information needed for the environmental review of the project in compliance with Section 36.400.070 (Environmental Assessment), below.

3.    Second notification. If no response to the first letter is received by the Director within 30 days, a second letter shall be sent to the applicant giving an additional 30 days in which to provide the information specified in the first letter.

4.    Withdrawal of application. The Director may deem the application withdrawn if the specified information is not provided within 30 days from the date of the second letter, unless, at a minimum, the applicant submits a letter requesting a mutually agreed upon appointment with the Director to discuss the establishment of a schedule for submittal of the specified information. Application processing shall not resume thereafter until a new application is filed, including fees, plans, exhibits, and other materials that are required for any project on the same site.

5.    Criteria for acceptance. An application shall not be accepted as complete unless or until the Director determines that it:

a.    Includes all information and materials required by Section 36.400.040.B (Application contents and fees);

c.    Is accompanied by the application fee, or a deposit if appropriate, in compliance with the Council’s Fee Resolution.

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1.)


36.400.070 Environmental Assessment.

After acceptance of a complete application, the project shall be reviewed as required by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) and the South Pasadena Environmental Review Guidelines.

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1.)

B.    Subdivision review procedures. Procedures and standards for the review and approval of subdivision maps are found in Article 5 (Subdivision Procedures).

C.    Application filing and initial processing. Where applicable, the procedures of this Division are carried out after those described in Division 36.400 (Application Filing and Processing), for each application.

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1.)


36.410.020 Planning Clearances.

A.    Purpose of section. This section provides a procedure for issuing planning clearances, which are used to verify that a proposed structure or land use activity complies with the allowed list of activities and development standards applicable to the category of use or the zoning district of the subject parcel.

B.    Applicability. Generally, any project requiring a building permit in compliance with the Uniform Building Code that will result in additional floor area requires a planning clearance to determine compliance with this Zoning Code. It is at this point that the Department staff advises the property owner or applicant, if not the property owner, of further approvals that may be needed. If no further approvals are needed, the project may then proceed to the building permit process.

1.    Planning clearance required.

a.    Specifically, a planning clearance shall be required for:

(1)    The use of vacant nonresidential land or structures, which shall be filed at least 14 days before the date the use is to be commenced;

(2)    A structure which is to be erected or remodeled, which shall be filed in conjunction with the companion Building Permit application; and:

i.    Tree removals and trimming. Should a specific development project require the removal of trees, or the trimming of trees, no building permits shall be issued until the property owner, or applicant if not the property owner, obtains a permit pursuant to Chapter 34 SPMC (Trees and Shrubs).

ii.    Penalty for tree violations. Pursuant to SPMC 34.16 (Violations) of Chapter 34 SPMC (Trees and Shrubs), it is unlawful for any person to remove or transplant any significant or mature heritage tree, a significant or mature native species tree, or a significant or mature oak tree from any property within the City unless a tree removal permit is first obtained from the City. It is unlawful for any person to trim or prune more than 20 percent of the live foliage or limbs of any significant or mature heritage tree located within the City within any 12-month period, or cause the same to be done, without first obtaining a tree trimming permit from the City. It is unlawful for any person to trim or prune more than 10 percent of the live foliage or limbs of any significant or mature oak or significant or mature native species tree located within the City within any 12-month period, or cause the same to be done, without first obtaining a tree trimming permit from the City. It is unlawful for any person to damage or cause to be damaged any significant or mature heritage tree, a significant or mature oak tree, or a significant or mature native species tree located within the City. It is unlawful for any person to remove any significant or mature tree or shrub from the parkway area between a sidewalk or private property line and street curb, without the written permission of the Public Works Director or designee.

With respect to a violation of Chapter 34 SPMC (Trees and Shrubs), and pursuant to SPMC 34.17 (Penalties), if it appears that the violation is related to development or anticipated future development on the property and the violation warrants an additional penalty, the City Manager may also refer the violation to the Planning Commission for a public hearing. The burden of proof shall be on the City to demonstrate that there is clear and convincing evidence to a reasonable certainty that there is an intentional violation. The Planning Commission may then hold a public hearing. The Planning Commission, after considering all of the evidence, may impose the additional penalty of prohibiting the issuance of building or construction-related permits for a period of up to five years from the date of the violation for the property upon which the violation occurred.

iii.    For purposes of this section, the prohibition period for issuance of building permits shall commence on the date the City had actual knowledge of the violation. The owner shall have the burden of proving an earlier commencement date, if entitlement to an earlier date is claimed.

iv.    Notwithstanding the aforementioned penalty, building or construction-related permits may be issued if in the opinion of the Director of Planning and Building they are necessary for the preservation of public health, safety or welfare.

(3)    A change of ownership or tenancy of an existing nonresidential structure or use, which shall be filed before reuse or reopening under the new ownership or business name.

b.    Following the occurrence of a bona fide emergency (e.g., natural disaster, etc.), as determined by the Council, an Emergency Building Permit and Temporary Planning Clearance may be issued by the appropriate City departments with adequate security, provided in compliance with Section 36.420.030 (Performance Guarantees), in order to provide for an expeditious zoning approval review and reconstruction process.

c.    No person shall occupy or use any newly constructed or altered structure, alter any structure, or change any use, or type or class of use, without first applying for and obtaining the required Planning Clearance.

2.    Business License required. A Business License is required for all nonresidential (e.g., commercial office and retail, industrial, etc.) activities in compliance with Municipal Code Chapter 18 (Business, Professions and Trades).

C.    Review authority. The Director may only issue the Planning Clearance after determining that the proposed project complies with all applicable standards and provisions for the category of use or the zoning district of the subject parcel, in full compliance with this Zoning Code and the Municipal Code.

D.    Conflicting licenses and zoning approvals prohibited. All Departments, officials, or public employees vested with the authority or duty to issue licenses or zoning approvals where required by law shall conform to the provisions of this Zoning Code. A license or zoning approval for uses, structures, or purposes in conflict with the provisions of this Zoning Code shall not be issued. Any license or zoning approval issued in conflict with the provisions of this Zoning Code, shall be deemed void. (Ord. No. 2108 § 1; Ord. No. 2237 § 6, 2012; Ord. No. 2328 § 2, 2019.)

36.410.070 Administrative Modifications.

A.    Purpose. The provisions of this Section allow for an Administrative Modification of several specified development standards of this Zoning Code.

1.    Special privileges prohibited.

a.    An Administrative Modification may only be granted when, because of special circumstances applicable to the property, including location, shape, size, surroundings, topography, or other conditions, the strict application of this Zoning Code denies the property owner privileges enjoyed by other property owners in the vicinity and within the same zoning district, or creates an unnecessary and involuntarily created hardship, or unreasonable regulation which makes it impractical to require compliance with the development standards.

b.    An Administrative Modification shall not be granted that would have the effect of granting a special privilege not shared by other property owners in the vicinity and under identical zoning districts, or which is contrary to the public convenience, health, interest, safety, or welfare.

2.    Does not extend to uses. The power to grant Administrative Modifications does not extend to allowable land uses.

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1.)


36.410.080 Variances.

A.    Purpose. This Section allows Variances from the development standards of this Zoning Code only when, because of special circumstances applicable to the property, including location, shape, size, surroundings, topography, or other conditions, the strict application of this Zoning Code denies the property owner privileges enjoyed by other property owners in the vicinity and under identical zoning districts.

B.    Applicability. The Commission may grant a Variance from the requirements of this Zoning Code governing any development standard, provided all Variances shall comply with the limitations established by the City of South Pasadena 1983 initiative. A Variance shall not allow a use of land not otherwise allowed by the applicable zoning district.

C.    Application filing and processing. An application for a Variance shall be filed in compliance with Division 36.400 (Application Filling and Processing).

1.    There are special circumstances applicable to the subject property (e.g., location, shape, size, surroundings, topography, or other conditions), so that the strict application of this Zoning Code denies the property owner privileges enjoyed by other property owners in the vicinity and within the same zoning district, or creates an unnecessary and involuntarily created hardship, or unreasonable regulation which makes it impractical to require compliance with the development standards;

2.    Granting the Variance would:

a.    Be necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of substantial property rights possessed by other property owners in the same vicinity and zoning district, and denied to the subject property owner;

b.    Be consistent with the General Plan and any applicable specific plan, and the limitations established by the 1983 initiative;

c.    Not constitute a grant of special privileges inconsistent with the limitations on other properties in the vicinity and in the same zoning district; and

d.    Not be materially detrimental to the public convenience, health, interest, safety, or welfare of the City, or injurious to the property or improvements in the vicinity and zoning district in which the property is located.

3.    The proposed project would be compatible with the existing aesthetics, character, and scale of the surrounding neighborhood, and considers impacts on neighboring properties.

G.    Conditions of approval. In approving a Variance, the Commission may impose conditions deemed reasonable and necessary to ensure:

1.    Compliance with the purposes of this Section, consistency with the General Plan and any applicable specific plan, and the limitations established by the City of South Pasadena 1983 initiative;

2.    That the Variance does not grant special privileges inconsistent with the limitations on other properties in the vicinity and zoning district in which the property is located;

3.    Compliance with the findings required by Subsection F. (Findings and decision), above; and

36.410.090 Parking Use Permits.

A.    Purpose. This section provides a process for the discretionary review of proposed parking facilities that are not located on the same site as the land uses they serve, to ensure compliance with basic health, safety, and community welfare standards, while providing opportunities for suitable alternatives to on-site parking.

b.    An applicant proposes to make excess parking spaces available to others.

2.    Commission. The Commission shall review a Parking Use Permit where the use associated with the proposed parking requires Commission review and discretionary approval in compliance with Article 2 (Zoning Districts, Allowable Land Uses, and Zone-Specific Standards).

E.    Posted notice required. Public notice of a requested Parking Use Permit shall be provided by posting both the location of the proposed parking, and the site of the use that will utilize the parking, with a minimum 11- by 17-inch legal notice, containing the information required by the Director. The notice shall be continuously posted for seven days before the Director’s action. In the case of a Parking Use Permit for a project that requires Commission review and discretionary approval, the notice shall be combined with that required by Division 36.630 (Public Hearings) for the discretionary permit.

F.    Public hearing. A public hearing shall not be required before the approval of a Minor Parking Use Permit. A Parking Use Permit for a project that requires Commission review and discretionary approval requiring a public hearing shall be considered by the Commission concurrently with the discretionary zoning approval.

G.    Findings and decision. The review authority may approve or modify a Parking Use Permit application in whole or in part, with or without conditions, only after first finding that:

1.    The proposed off-site parking is allowed within the applicable zoning district and complies with the intent of all of the applicable provisions of this Zoning Code;

2.    The proposed off-site parking spaces would be consistent with the actions, goals, objectives, policies, and programs of the General Plan and any applicable specific plan; and

3.    In the case of a proposed use of excess parking, the number of excess spaces is validated, the spaces are not likely to be needed by the primary use of the site, and the use of the excess spaces by others will not adversely affect nearby residents or properties.

H.    Conditions of approval. In approving a Parking Use Permit, the review authority may impose reasonable and necessary specific developmental, locational, and operational conditions relating to both on- and off-site improvements, and facility operation, which are intended to ensure that:

1.    Access to the site is adequate to accommodate the proposed off-site parking and the traffic that the facility would reasonably generate;

2.    The design, location, size, and operating characteristics of the proposed off-site parking are compatible with the existing and future land uses on-site and in the vicinity of the subject property;

3.    The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the proposed parking at the location proposed does not endanger, jeopardize, or otherwise constitute a menace to the public convenience, health, interest, safety, or general welfare of persons residing or working in the neighborhood of the proposed parking lot or structure;

4.    Where the off-site parking spaces are new, and in close proximity to residential uses, and especially bedroom windows, they are designed and operated to comply with the City’s noise standards of the General Plan, and with proper consideration for headlight impacts in compliance with SPMC 36.300.090 (Outdoor Lighting).

I.    Off-site parking standards. Design, location, and operating standards for off-site parking facilities shall be provided in compliance with Division 36.310 (Parking and Loading).

J.    Terms of off-site parking.

1.    Guarantee of continued availability. Required parking spaces that are approved off-site shall be committed by a recordable covenant, lease, bond, or other agreement, acceptable to the City Attorney, between the owners, and if applicable, the lessees of the off-site parking spaces and the owners, and if applicable, the lessees of the subject site, with covenants reflecting the conditions of approval and the approved off-site parking plan. A bond may be posted in place of a covenant when approved by the applicable review authority.

2.    Proof of availability. Lessees of off-site parking that provides required spaces shall provide proof to the Director of continuous leases for the off-site spaces annually by January 31.

3.    Loss of off-site spaces.

b.    Effect of termination of agreement. Upon notification that a lease for required off-site parking has terminated, the Director shall determine a reasonable time in which one of the following shall occur:

(1)    Substitute parking is leased that is acceptable to the Director; or

(2)    The size or capacity of the use is reduced in proportion to the parking spaces lost.

4.    Parking fee reimbursement. The business operator may be required to reimburse patrons for the total cost of the parking fee for the use of a shared parking facility. The amount of the reimbursement shall be determined by the review authority at the time a Parking Use Permit is approved.

K.    Post approval procedures.

1.    Expiration and extension. To ensure continued compliance with the provisions of this section, each approved Parking Use Permit shall expire 12 months from the effective date of approval, unless otherwise specified in the permit, if the use has not been established.

36.410.100 Planned Development Permits.

A.    Purpose. Planned Development Permits provide for flexibility in the application of Zoning Code standards to proposed development. The purpose is to allow consideration of innovation in site planning and other aspects of project design, and more effective design responses to site features, uses on adjoining properties, and environmental impacts than the Zoning Code standards would produce without adjustment. The City expects all Planned Projects to be of higher quality than would be achieved through conventional design practices and standards.

B.    Applicability.

1.    When allowed. Planned Development Permit approval may be requested for an affordable housing, mixed use, or senior housing project; and shall be processed, and approved or denied, concurrently with any Conditional Use Permit required for the project.

2.    General Plan compliance. The preparation, review, and approval of a Planned Development Permit shall require strict compliance with the actions, goals, objectives, policies, and programs of the General Plan and any applicable specific plan.

3.    Scope of approval.

a.    Planned Development Permit approval may adjust or modify, where necessary and justifiable, any applicable development standard of this Zoning Code (e.g., floor area ratio, building height, setbacks, parking, street layout, etc.), provided that the approval shall not authorize a land use that is not allowed in the primary zoning district by Article 2.

b.    A project proposing increased residential density may only be approved by the Council in compliance with Division 36.370 (Affordable Housing Incentives).

C.    Application filing and processing. A Planned Development Permit application shall be filed and processed in compliance with Division 36.400 (Application Filing and Processing), and the following requirements.

1.    Application contents. The application shall be accompanied by the information identified in the Department handout for Planned Development Permit applications.

2.    Department review. Each Planned Development Permit application shall be analyzed by the Director to ensure that the proposed project is consistent with the intent of this Section. The Director shall prepare a report and recommendation on the project to the Commission for their consideration.

3.    Public hearing. The Commission shall conduct a public hearing in compliance with Division 36.630 (Public Hearings).

D.    Review authority. The Commission may grant Planned Development Permits in compliance with this Section.

E.    Commission action. Following a public hearing, the Commission may approve or disapprove the Planned Development Permit, and shall record the decision and the findings upon which the decision is based.

d.    The project complies with all applicable provisions of the City’s Design Guidelines;

e.    The project can be adequately, conveniently, and reasonably served by public facilities, services, and utilities;

f.    The planning concepts and design features of the project are reasonably suited to the characteristics of the site and the surrounding neighborhood;

g.    The location, size, planning concepts, design features, and operating characteristics of the project are and will be compatible with the character of the site, and the land uses and development intended for the surrounding neighborhood by the General Plan;

h.    The site is adequate for the project in terms of size, shape, topography, and circumstances and has sufficient access to streets and highways which are adequate in width and pavement type to carry the quantity and type of traffic expected to be generated by the use; and

i.    The establishment, maintenance, or operation of the use would not, under the circumstances of the particular case, be detrimental to the health, safety, or general welfare of persons residing or working in the neighborhood of the proposed use, or detrimental or injurious to property and improvements in the neighborhood or to the general welfare of the City.

2.    Conditions of approval. In approving a Planned Development Permit, the Commission may impose any conditions deemed reasonable and necessary to ensure that the project will comply with the findings required by Subsection E.1.

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1.)


36.410.110 Reasonable Accommodation.

A.    Purpose and intent. It is the policy of the City of South Pasadena to comply with the Federal Fair Housing Amendments Act of 1988 and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (collectively referred to hereafter as “fair housing laws”) to provide reasonable accommodation to disabled persons in the application of its zoning and land use regulations, policies, and practices for persons with disabilities seeking fair access to housing. The purpose of this Chapter is to establish procedures for the receipt and evaluation of requests for reasonable accommodation, and to eliminate the need to apply for an Administrative Modification (Section 36.410.070) or a Variance (Section 36.410.080).

B.    A request for reasonable accommodation may include a modification or exception to the rules, standards, and practices for the siting, development and use of housing or housing-related facilities that would eliminate regulatory barriers and provide a person with a disability equal opportunity to the housing of their choice.

C.    Applicability. A request for reasonable accommodation may be made by any individual with a disability, his or her representative, or a developer or provider of housing for individuals with disabilities, when the application of zoning and land use regulations, policies, and practices acts or will act as a barrier to fair housing opportunities to that individual or to those with disabilities.

D.    Review Authority.

1.    The Director shall review each application for reasonable accommodation within 30 days of deeming the application complete. Pursuant to the findings set forth in Subsection G, the Director may approve, approve subject to conditions, or deny the request.

2.    In the event that the applicant also seeks a concurrent approval, permit, or entitlement that will be reviewed by a Review Authority other than the Director, the Director may determine that the application for reasonable accommodation be reviewed pursuant to Section 36.400.030 (Concurrent Zoning Approval Processing).

3.    If necessary to reach a determination on the request for reasonable accommodation, the Review Authority may request further information from the applicant consistent with the fair housing laws, specifying in detail the information that is required, as it relates to: (a) establishing the existence of a qualifying disability to determine the applicability of this chapter; or (b) determining the necessity for the requested accommodation and its impact on access to housing to the disabled individual(s). In the event that a request for information is made, the 30-day period to issue a decision will be stayed until the applicant responds to the request.

E.    Application for reasonable accommodation.

1.    An application for reasonable accommodation shall be submitted in writing on a form prescribed by the Director.

2.    A fee shall not be required for a reasonable accommodation, but if the project requires another discretionary permit, then the prescribed fee shall be paid for the other discretionary permit(s) in compliance with the City’s adopted fee schedule.

3.    If the project for which the application for reasonable accommodation is being made also requires some other approval, permit or entitlement, the applicant shall file the request together with the application for such approval, permit or entitlement.

4.    An application for reasonable accommodation shall include all of the following:

a.    The applicant’s name, address, and telephone number;

b.    Documentation that the applicant is:

(1)    An individual with a disability,

(2)    Applying on behalf of one or more individuals with a disability, or

(3)    A developer or provider of housing for one or more individuals with a disability;

c.    Address of the property for which accommodation is being requested;

d.    The name, address, and telephone number of the property owner(s), if different from the applicant;

e.    Property owner mailing list and mailing labels pursuant to the requirements of Section 36.410.110(F), if necessary;

f.    The current use of the subject property;

g.    The specific basis for the claim that the applicant is considered disabled under the fair housing laws;

h.    A description of the accommodation requested including reference to the zoning code provision, policy, or procedure from which accommodation is sought;

i.    A detailed written explanation of why the requested accommodation is necessary for the individual(s) with a disability to use and enjoy the dwelling; and

j.    Any other information that the Director reasonably concludes is necessary to determine whether the findings required by Subsection G can be made, so long as any request for information regarding the disability of the individuals benefited complies with fair housing law protections and the privacy rights of the individuals affected.

F.    Public notice. In the event that the request is being made in conjunction with some other approval, permit or entitlement, the notice shall be transmitted along with the notice of the other proceeding.

G.    Required findings.

1.    The written decision to approve, approve with conditions, or deny an application shall be based upon the following findings, all of which are required for approval:

a.    The requested accommodation is requested by or on the behalf of one or more individuals with a disability protected under the fair housing laws and entitled to a reasonable accommodation;

b.    The requested accommodation is necessary to provide one or more individuals with a disability an equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling;

c.    The requested accommodation will not impose an undue financial or administrative burden on the City;

d.    The requested accommodation will not result in a fundamental alteration in the nature of a City program or law, including, but not limited to, the General Plan, Zoning Code, design guidelines and any specific plans; and

e.    The requested accommodation will not, under the specific facts of the case, result in a direct threat to the health and safety of other individuals or substantial physical damage to the property of others.

2.    In granting a request for reasonable accommodation, the Review Authority may impose any conditions of approval deemed reasonable and necessary to ensure that the reasonable accommodation will comply with the findings required by this Section, so long as the conditions are consistent with the purposes of this Chapter to further fair housing.

H.    Notice of decision.

1.    The Review Authority shall notify the applicant of the decision on the application for reasonable accommodation by mailing a written notice of decision to the applicant. The notice of decision shall include factual findings, conclusions, and reasons for the decision; and notify the applicant of the right to appeal the Review Authority’s decision pursuant to Division 36.610.

2.    Notice of the Review Authority’s decision shall also be given to adjoining property owners and/or other interested persons in the same manner as provided in Subsection F.

I.    Expiration, time extension, and revocation.

1.    Any reasonable accommodation approved in accordance with the terms of this Chapter shall expire within 24 months from the effective date of the approval or at an alternative time specified as a condition of approval unless:

a.    A building permit has been issued and construction has commenced;

b.    A certificate of occupancy has been issued;

c.    A time extension has been granted.

2.    The Director may approve a time extension for a reasonable accommodation for good cause for a period or periods not to exceed three years. An application for a time extension shall be made in writing to the Director no less than 30 days prior to the expiration date.

3.    Any reasonable accommodation approved in accordance with this Chapter may be revoked if any of the conditions or terms of such reasonable accommodation are violated, or if any law or ordinance is violated in connection therewith.

J.    Discontinuance.

1.    A reasonable accommodation shall lapse if the exercise of rights granted by it is discontinued for 180 consecutive days. If the disabled persons vacate the premises, the reasonable accommodation shall remain in effect only if the Director determines that:

a.    The modification is physically integrated into the residential structure such that it would be impractical to require the property to be returned to its previous condition; or

b.    The accommodation is necessary to give another disabled person an equal opportunity for use and enjoyment of the dwelling.

2.    The Director may, at any reasonable time, request in writing the applicant or his or her successor-in-interest to the property to provide documentation demonstrating that the accommodation remains necessary to ensure the equal use and enjoyment of the property by a person with disabilities and/or continued compliance with any applicable conditions of approval. Failure to provide such documentation within 15 days of the date of the Director’s request shall constitute grounds for discontinuance by the City of a previously approved reasonable accommodation.

K.    Appeals. The decision of the Director to approve, approve subject to conditions, or deny an application for reasonable accommodation shall be subject to appeal to the Planning Commission pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 36.610.050 (Appeals Filing, Processing and Decisions).

(Ord. No. 2248 § 5, 2013.)

2.    Upon failure to complete the work, failure to comply with all of the terms of any applicable zoning approval, or failure of the completed improvements to function properly, the City may do the required work or cause it to be done, and collect from the permittee or surety all the costs incurred by the City, including the costs of the work, and all administrative and inspection costs.

3.    Any unused portion of the security shall be refunded to the funding source after deduction of the cost of the work by the City.

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1.)


36.420.040 Time Limits and Extensions.

A.    Time limits.

1.    Unless conditions of approval or other provisions of this Zoning Code establish a different time limit, any Zoning Approval granted in compliance with Division 36.410 (Zoning Approval or Disapproval) that is not exercised within 12 months of its approval shall expire and become void, except where an extension of time is approved in compliance with Subsection B of this Section.

2.    The Zoning Approval shall not be deemed “exercised” until the permittee has submitted construction plans to the Building Official for plan review and paid the requisite fees for plan check. The Zoning Approval for a project that requires construction shall remain valid provided that the plan review process remains active in the Building Division. The plan review process shall be considered active for no more than 18 months from the date construction plans are submitted to the Building Official and the requisite plan check fees are paid until a Building Permit is issued. The Zoning Approval shall expire at the end of the aforementioned 18 months, if a building permit has not been issued or an extension granted pursuant to the procedures set forth herein. If no construction is required, the Zoning Approval shall be deemed “exercised” when the permittee has actually commenced the allowed use on the subject site in compliance with the conditions of approval.

3.    Zoning Approval shall remain valid after it has been exercised as long as a Building Permit is active for the project, or a final building inspection or Certificate of Occupancy has been granted. A Building Permit issued by the Building Official remains active provided it has not expired pursuant to the Building Code.

4.    If a project is to be developed in approved phases, each subsequent phase shall be exercised within 12 months from the date that the previous phase was exercised, unless otherwise specified in the Zoning Approval, or the Zoning Approval shall expire and be deemed void. If the project also involves the approval of a Tentative Map, the phasing shall be consistent with the Tentative Map and the Zoning Approval shall be exercised before the expiration of the Tentative Map, or the Zoning Approval shall expire and be deemed void.

B.    Extensions of time. Upon request by the applicant, the review authority may extend the time for a Zoning Approval to be exercised as follows.

1.    The applicant shall file a written request for an extension of time with the Department at least 10 days before the expiration of the Zoning Approval, together with the filing fee required by the Council’s Fee Resolution.

2.    The burden of proof is on the permittee to establish with substantial evidence that the Zoning Approval should be extended. If the review authority determines that the permittee has proceeded in good faith and has exercised due diligence in complying with the conditions in a timely manner, the review authority may grant a time extension for up to an additional 12 months from the effective date of approval to extend the Zoning Approval, provided that the review authority first finds that:

a.    The proposed extension is consistent with the General Plan, and any applicable specific plan and the overall project remains consistent with those plans as they exist at the time the extension request is being considered; and

b.    There are adequate provisions for public services and utilities, e.g., access, drainage, fire protection, sewers, water, etc., to ensure that the proposed change would not endanger, jeopardize, or otherwise constitute a hazard to the public health, safety, or general welfare, or be injurious to the property or improvements in the vicinity and applicable zoning district.

3.    The review authority may extend the time for a Zoning Approval beyond 12 months (up to 36 months) from the effective date of approval, provided that the applicant meets the requirements for time limits and extensions as required in this Subsection and the review authority makes the following findings:

a.    The findings set forth in subsection (B)(2) of this section; and

b.    Exercise of the Zoning Approval will be delayed by causes outside the applicant’s control, e.g., project complexities, legal challenges, an economic downturn, requirements imposed by other governmental agencies.

C.    Hearing on extension. The applicable review authority shall hold a hearing on any proposed extension of a Zoning Approval, in compliance with Division 36.630 (Public Hearings).

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1; Ord. No. 2227 § 3, 2012.)


36.420.050 Changes to an Approved Project.

A project or a new land use authorized through a zoning approval granted in compliance with this Zoning Code shall be established only as approved by the review authority and subject to any conditions of approval, except where changes to the project are approved in compliance with this Section.

A.    Request for change. An applicant shall request desired changes in writing, and shall also furnish appropriate supporting materials and an explanation of the reasons for the request. Changes may be requested either before or after construction or establishment and operation of the approved use.

B.    Minor changes. The Director shall determine whether a change is minor, and shall use the following criteria in determining what a minor change is. Changes should be deemed minor if the changes:

1.    Are consistent with all applicable provisions of this Zoning Code;

2.    Do not involve a feature of the project that was specifically addressed in, or was a basis for findings in a negative declaration or environmental impact report for the project;

3.    Do not involve a feature of the project that was specifically addressed in, or was a basis for conditions of approval for the project or that was a specific consideration by the review authority in the granting of the zoning approval;

4.    Do not expand the approved floor area or any outdoor activity area by 10 percent or more over the life of the project; and

5.    Do not change a design element for which the adopted design guidelines are applicable.

C.    Major changes. Changes to the project that do not comply with Subsection B., above, shall only be approved by the review authority through a new zoning approval application.

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1; Ord. No. 2183 § 20, 2009.)


36.420.060 Zoning Approval to Run with the Land.

A zoning approval granted in compliance with this Division shall continue to be valid upon a change of ownership (e.g., of the site, structure, or use that was the subject of the application), provided that the use remains in compliance with all applicable provisions of this Zoning Code and any conditions of approval.

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1.)


36.420.070 Resubmittals.

A.    Resubmittals prohibited within 12 months. For a period of 12 months following the disapproval, revocation, or modification of a discretionary zoning approval or amendment, no application for the same or substantially similar discretionary zoning approval or amendment for the same site shall be filed.

B.    Director’s determination. The Director shall determine whether the new application is for a discretionary zoning approval that is the same or substantially similar to the previously disapproved zoning approval or amendment.

C.    Appeal. The determination of the Director may be appealed to the Commission, in compliance with Division 36.610 (Appeals).

D.    Council waiver. The Council may waive the prohibition in Subsection A., above if the Council finds that by reason of changed legal, physical, or sociological circumstances, reconsideration would be in the best interests of the City.

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1.)


36.420.080 Covenants of Easements.

A.    Applicability. When necessary to achieve the land use goals of the City, the City may require a property owner to execute and record a Covenant of Easement in favor of the City, in compliance with Government Code Sections 65870 et seq.

1.    A Covenant of Easement may be required to provide for emergency access, landscaping, light and air access, ingress and egress, parking, solar access, or for open space.

2.    The Covenant of Easement may be imposed as a condition of approval by the review authority.

B.    Form of covenant. The form of the Covenant shall be approved by the City Attorney, and the Covenant of Easement shall:

1.    Describe the real property to be subject to the easement;

2.    Describe the real property to be benefitted by the easement;

3.    Identify the City approval which relied on or required the Covenant; and

4.    Identify the purposes of the easement.

C.    Recordation. The Covenant of Easement shall be recorded in the County Recorder’s Office.

D.    Effect of covenant. From and after the time of its recordation, the Covenant of Easement shall:

1.    Act as an easement in compliance with State law (Chapter 3 (commencing with Section 801) of Title 2 of Part 2 of Division 2 of the Civil Code), except that it shall not merge into any other interest in the real property. Civil Code Section 1104 shall be applicable to the conveyance of the affected real property; and

2.    Impart notice to all persons to the extent afforded by the recording laws of the State. Upon recordation, the burdens of the Covenant shall be binding on, and the Covenant shall benefit, all successors-in-interest to the real property.

E.    Enforceability of covenant. The Covenant of Easement shall be enforceable by the successors-in-interest to the real property benefitted by the Covenant and the City. Nothing in this Section creates standing in any person, other than the City, and any owner of the real property burdened or benefitted by the Covenant, to enforce or to challenge the Covenant or any requested amendment or release.

F.    Release of covenant. The release of the Covenant of Easement may be effected by the Commission, or the Council on appeal, following a noticed public hearing in compliance with Division 36.630 (Public Hearings).

1.    The Covenant of Easement may be released by the City, at the request of any person, including the City or an affected property owner, on a finding that the Covenant, on the subject property, is no longer necessary to achieve the land use goals of the City.

2.    A notice of the release of the Covenant of Easement shall be recorded by the Director with the County Recorder’s Office.

G.    Fees. The City shall impose fees to recover the City’s reasonable cost of processing a request for a release. Fees for the processing shall be established by the Council’s Fee Resolution.

36.500.070 Type of Subdivision Approval Required.

Any subdivision of an existing parcel into two or more parcels shall require approval by the City in compliance with the provisions of this Article. In general, the procedure for subdivision first requires the approval of a Tentative Map, and then the approval of a Parcel Map (for four or fewer parcels) or a Final Map (for five or more parcels) to complete the subdivision process. The Tentative Map review process is used to evaluate the compliance of the proposed subdivision with the adopted City standards, and the appropriateness of the proposed subdivision design. Parcel and Final Maps are precise engineering documents that detail the location and dimensions of all parcel boundaries in an approved subdivision and, after approval, are recorded in the office of the County Recorder.

A.    Tentative Map requirements. Map Act Section 66426 requires that any subdivision or resubdivision of land shall require the filing and approval of a Tentative Map.

B.    Parcel and Final Map requirements. A Parcel or Final Map shall be required as follows:

1.    Parcel Map. The filing and approval of a Parcel Map (Division 36.520) shall be required for a subdivision creating four or fewer parcels, with or without a designated remainder in compliance with Map Act Article 2, Chapter 1, except for the following subdivisions:

a.    Public agency or utility conveyances. Any conveyance of land, including a fee interest, an easement, or a license, to a governmental agency, public entity, public utility or a subsidiary of a public utility for rights-of-way, unless the Director determines based on substantial evidence that public policy necessitates a Parcel Map in an individual case;

b.    Rail right-of-way leases. Subdivisions of a portion of the operating right-of-way of a railroad corporation as defined by Section 230 of the California Public Utilities Code, which are created by short-term leases (terminable by either party on not more than 30 days’ notice in writing); or

c.    Waived Parcel Map. A subdivision that has been granted a waiver of Parcel Map requirements in compliance with Section 36.520.030 (Waiver of Parcel Map).

2.    Final Map. The filing and approval of a Final Map (Division 36.520) shall be required for a subdivision of five or more parcels.

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1.)


36.500.080 Exemptions from Subdivision Approval Requirements.

As provided by Map Act Article 1, Chapter 1, the following subdivisions do not require the filing or approval of Tentative, Parcel or Final Maps.

2.    The conversion of certain mobile home parks to condominiums in compliance with Map Act Section 66428(b).

E.    Lot Line Adjustments. A Lot Line Adjustment processed in compliance with Section 36.530.030.

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1.)


36.500.100 Exceptions to Subdivision Standards.

B.    Filing and processing. A request for an exception may be filed with the Tentative Map application to which it applies, or after approval of the Tentative Map. An exception shall be processed and acted upon in the same manner as the Tentative Map, concurrently with the Tentative Map if the exception request was filed at the same time. The approval of an exception shall not constitute approval of the Tentative Map and shall not extend the time limits for the expiration of the map established by Section 36.510.140 (Expiration of Approved Tentative Map).

C.    Approval of exception. The Commission shall have the authority to approve or deny exception requests in compliance with this Section. The Commission shall not grant an exception unless all the following findings are first made:

2.    The exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions are not due to any action of the subdivider subsequent to the enactment of this Article;

3.    The exception is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right possessed by other property in the vicinity and zoning district and denied to the proposed subdivision;

4.    Granting the exception will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare nor injurious to the property or improvements in the vicinity and zoning district in which the property is located; and

5.    The exception will not affect the consistency of the proposed subdivision with the General Plan or any applicable Specific Plan.

D.    Conditions of approval. In granting an exception, the Commission shall secure substantially the same objectives of the regulations for which the exception is requested and shall impose whatever conditions it deems necessary to protect the public health, safety, general welfare and convenience, and to mitigate any environmental impacts in compliance with CEQA.

A.    Required findings for approval. The Commission may approve a Tentative Map only when it shall first find that the proposed subdivision, together with the provisions for its design and improvement, is consistent with the General Plan, and any applicable Specific Plan, and that none of the findings for denial in Subsection C. can be made. The findings shall apply to each proposed parcel as well as the entire subdivision, including any parcel identified as a designated remainder in compliance with Map Act Section 66424.6.

B.    Supplemental findings. In addition to the findings required for approval of a Tentative Map by Subsection A. above, the Commission shall not approve a Tentative Map unless it can also make the following findings, when they are applicable to the specific subdivision proposal.

1.    Construction of improvements.

2.    The site is not physically suitable for the type or proposed density of development;

3.    The design of the subdivision or the proposed improvements are likely to cause substantial environmental damage or injure fish or wildlife or their habitat;

4.    The design of the subdivision or type of improvements is likely to cause serious public health or safety problems;

5.    The design of the subdivision or the type of improvements will conflict with easements, acquired by the public at large for access through or use of, property within the proposed subdivision. This finding may not be made if the Commission finds that alternate easements for access or use will be provided, and that they will be substantially equivalent to ones previously acquired by the public. This finding shall apply only to easements of record, or to easements established by judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, and no authority is hereby granted to the review authority to determine that the public at large has acquired easements of access through or use of property within the proposed subdivision;

6.    The discharge of sewage from the proposed subdivision into the community sewer system would result in violation of existing requirements prescribed by the California Regional Water Quality Control Board;

This Section establishes procedures to implement the Vesting Tentative Map requirements of state law, Sections 66498.1 et seq. of the Map Act.

A.    Applicability. Whenever this Zoning Code requires that a Tentative Map be filed, a Vesting Tentative Map may instead be filed, provided that the Vesting Tentative Map is prepared, filed and processed in compliance with this Section. A Vesting Tentative Map may be filed for either residential, commercial or industrial developments.

B.    Procedures for processing a Vesting Tentative Map. A Vesting Tentative Map shall be filed in the same form, have the same contents and accompanying data and reports and, shall be processed in the same manner as set forth by this Division as a Tentative Map, except as follows.

1.    Application content. The Vesting Tentative Map shall include the following information in addition to that required by Section 36.510.020 (Tentative Map Preparation, Application Contents):

a.    Title. The Vesting Tentative Map shall be prepared with the words “Vesting Tentative Map” printed conspicuously on its face; and

2.    Findings for approval. The approval of a Vesting Tentative Map shall not be granted unless the Commission first determines that the intended development of the subdivision is consistent with the zoning regulations applicable to the property at the time of filing, in addition to all other findings required for Tentative Map approval by Section 36.510.070 (Tentative Map Approval or Disapproval).

C.    Expiration of Vesting Tentative Map. An approved Vesting Tentative Map shall be subject to the same time limits for expiration as are established for Tentative Maps by Sections 36.510.130 et seq. (Tentative Map Time Limits).

D.    Changes to approved map or conditions. The subdivider may apply for an amendment to the Vesting Tentative Map or conditions of approval at any time before the expiration of the Vesting Tentative Map. An amendment request shall be considered and processed through the same procedures as a new application, in compliance with this Section and pursuant to the provisions of the Subdivision Map Act Section 66498.2.

E.    Development rights vested.

1.    The approval of a Vesting Tentative Map shall confer a vested right to proceed with development of the subdivided lots in substantial compliance with the ordinances, policies and standards (excluding fees) as provided in Map Act Section 66498.1.

2.    If Map Act Section 66474.2 is repealed, approval of a Vesting Tentative Map shall confer a vested right to proceed with development in substantial compliance with the ordinances, policies and standards in effect at the time the map is approved or conditionally approved.

3.    Subsequent land use permits, building permits, extensions of time or other entitlements filed on parcels created by the subdivision may be conditioned or denied only if the Commission determines that:

a.    A failure to do so would place the residents of the subdivision or the immediate community, or both, in a condition dangerous to their health or safety, or both; or

b.    The condition or denial is required, in order to comply with state or federal law.

4.    Fees charged for building or land use permits, filed after the approval of a Vesting Tentative Map shall be as required at the time the subsequent permit applications are filed, including any related utility or development impact fees (e.g., sewer/water hookup fees, traffic mitigation fees, etc.). Application contents shall be as required by ordinance requirements in effect at the time the subsequent application is filed.

F.    Duration of vested rights. The development rights vested by this Section shall expire if a Parcel Map or Final Map is not approved before the expiration of the Vesting Tentative Map in compliance with Sections 36.510.130 et seq. (Tentative Map Time Limits). If the Parcel or Final Map is approved and recorded, the development rights shall be vested for the following periods of time.

1.    An initial time period of 24 months from the date of recordation of the Parcel or Final Map. Where several Final Maps are recorded on various phases of a project covered by a single Vesting Tentative Map, this initial time period shall begin for each phase when the Final Map for that phase is recorded.

2.    The initial 24 months shall be automatically extended by any time used for processing a complete application for a grading permit or for design or architectural review, if processing exceeds 30 days from the date the application is accepted for processing as complete.

3.    The subdivider may apply for a one-year extension at any time before the initial 24 months expires. Application for an extension shall be submitted to the Department and shall be accompanied by the required fee. The Council shall approve or deny any request for extension.

The preparation, filing and processing of a Conditional Certificate of Compliance application shall occur in compliance with this Section.

1.    Application. An application for a Conditional Certificate of Compliance shall be prepared and include the same materials as a Certificate of Compliance (Section 36.530.050).

2.    Review and approval. Upon making a determination that the real property does not comply with the provisions of this Zoning Code or the Map Act, the City Engineer shall grant a Conditional Certificate of Compliance, imposing conditions as provided by Subsection D.3 (Conditions of Approval) below.

3.    Conditions of approval. If the owners of the property for which a certificate is requested are the original subdividers, the City Engineer may impose any conditions that would be applicable to a current subdivision, as provided by the Map Act and this Zoning Code, regardless of when the property was divided. If the owners had no responsibility for the subdivision that created the parcel, the City Engineer may only impose conditions that would have been applicable at the time the property acquired by the current owners.

4.    Appeal. A decision to issue a Conditional Certificate of Compliance and/or the conditions imposed by the City Engineer may be appealed to the Commission in compliance with Division 36.610 (Appeals) of this Zoning Code.

5.    Completion of process. Following expiration of the 10-day appeal period after the determination and imposition of conditions by the City Engineer, the City Engineer shall file a Conditional Certificate of Compliance with the County Recorder. The certificate shall identify the property, and serve as notice to the property owner or purchaser who applied for the certificate, a grantee of the owner, or any subsequent transferee or assignee of the property that the fulfillment and implementation of the conditions shall be required before subsequent issuance of a permit or other approval for the development of the property.

6.    Effective date of certificate. A Conditional Certificate of Compliance shall not become effective until the document has been recorded by the County Recorder.

a.    Calculation of area. When calculating the area of a parcel to determine compliance with this Section, Article 2, or the General Plan, the following shall be deducted from the gross area of any parcel, regardless of whether they may be used by the general public or are reserved for residents of the subdivision:

(1)    A vehicular or non-vehicular access easement through the parcel;

(2)    An easement for an open drainage course, whether a ditch, natural channel or floodway; or

(3)    The “flag pole” (access strip) of a flag lot.

b.    Minimum lot area requirements for common interest projects. The minimum lot area requirements of Article 2 shall not apply to condominiums and condominium conversions, planned developments, townhouses, zero lot line, and similar projects, but shall apply to the creation of the original parcel or parcels that are the location of the common interest development.

2.    Dimensions. The dimensions of new parcels shall comply with the applicable provisions of Article 2 (Zoning Districts, Allowable Land Uses, and Zone-Specific Standards), or as otherwise required by the review authority. Lots shall be measured at right angles to the street on straight street and shall be approximately radial on curved streets.

3.    Parcel and block configuration. The layout of proposed parcels and streets shall be designed to use land efficiently and minimize site disturbance in terms of cuts and fills and the removal of vegetation.

a.    Double-frontage lots. Parcels with streets along both the front and rear lot lines shall be prohibited, except when necessitated by topographical or other physical conditions or where access from one of the roads is prohibited.

An exception to this rule may be permitted in the case of a tract served by a storm drain pump station.

3.    Drainage scheme. No inter-lot or “cross drainage” shall be permitted. All lots shall drain their own water to the public street, public drainage facility, or natural drainage course without passing through or across an adjacent lot. No lot shall drain water over the bank of a flood control channel.

4.    Grading exceptions. Specific exceptions to the above requirements may be authorized at the discretion of the City Engineer. Exceptions are considered to be the case of an individual lot or at most a tier of lots and are not to be construed as extending to an entire subdivision.

5.    As-built grading plan. Upon completion of grading operations the owner shall furnish to the City Engineer two prints of an as-built grading plan prepared by the owner’s engineer. In case no grading plan had been prepared and no grading permit had been granted, the subdivider shall furnish to the City Engineer two prints of a map signed by the owner’s engineer and certifying that no fills had been made on the lots or else two prints of a map prepared by the owner’s engineer showing the location and depth of all compacted or uncompacted fills that had been made.

2.    Nonresidential subdivisions. Nonresidential subdivisions shall be provided landscaping as required by the review authority.

3.    Plant materials, irrigation. All proposed and/or required trees, shrubs, ground covers, vines, turf, and other plant materials shall be of a type approved by the Director and, to the greatest extent practicable, shall be of drought-resistant and drought-tolerant types or varieties. Plant materials and irrigation systems shall comply with the requirements of Division 36.330 (Landscaping Standards) of this Zoning Code. The subdivider shall provide a mechanism or system for the permanent maintenance of any common area or open space landscaping.

4.    Deferral of installation. The installation of required landscaping may be deferred until the development of the subdivided lots through the provisions of Section 36.540.080 (Improvement Agreements and Security), provided that interim erosion and sediment control measures are first installed in compliance with Section 36.540.040 (Site Preparation and Subdivision Construction).

C.    Monuments. The subdivider shall install monuments in compliance with the requirements of the City Engineer, and the Map Act.

D.    Public utilities and utility easements. Each approved parcel shall be provided connections to public utilities, including electricity, gas, water, sewer, and telecommunications services, which shall be installed as part of the subdivision improvements as provided by this Section.

1.    Underground utilities required. Utilities in new subdivisions shall be installed underground, as follows. These requirements do not apply to utility lines which do not serve the area being subdivided.

a.    When undergrounding is required. All existing and proposed utility distribution facilities (including electric, telecommunications and cable television lines) installed in and for the purpose of supplying service to any subdivision shall be installed underground. Equipment appurtenant to underground facilities, including surface mounted transformers, pedestal mounted terminal boxes and meter cabinets, and concealed ducts, shall also be located underground, unless otherwise approved by the review authority based on the recommendations of the City Engineer and the Director.

The subdivider is responsible for complying with the requirements of this Section and shall make the necessary arrangements with the affected utility companies for facility installation. The review authority may waive the requirements of this Section if topographical, soil, or other site conditions make underground installation infeasible or impractical.

b.    Location of installation. Underground utility lines may be installed within street rights of way or along a lot line, subject to appropriate easements being provided if necessary. When installed within street rights of way, their location and method of installation, insofar as it affects other improvements within the street right of way, shall be subject to the approval of the City Engineer.

2.    Utility easements. Minimum width. The minimum width of easements for public or private utilities, sanitary sewers, or water distribution systems shall be determined by the review authority based on the recommendations of the City Engineer for City facilities, and the recommendations of the applicable utility company, for public or private utilities.

3.    Overhead lines. When overhead utility lines are approved by the review authority, easements shall be located at the rear of lots where practical, and along the side of lots where necessary. Where practical, the poles supporting overhead lines shall not be installed within any street, alley, or easement designated exclusively for drainage purposes.

4.    Timing of installation. All underground utilities, water lines, sanitary sewers, and storm drains installed in streets, shall be constructed before the streets are surfaced. Connections to all underground utilities, water lines, and sanitary sewers shall be laid to sufficient lengths to avoid the need for disturbing the street improvements when service connections are made.

E.    Sewage disposal. Each parcel within an approved subdivision shall be provided a connection to the City’s sewage collection, treatment, and disposal system, in compliance with the City’s improvement standards and specifications.

F.    Street lighting. All proposed subdivisions shall provide street lighting facilities designed and constructed in compliance with the City’s improvement standards and specifications. The subdivider shall also pay the street light maintenance and energy fee required by the City.

G.    Storm drainage. Storm water runoff from the subdivision shall be collected and conveyed by an approved storm drain system. The storm drain system shall be designed for ultimate development of the drainage area. The storm drain system shall provide for the protection of abutting and off-site properties that would be adversely affected by any increase in runoff attributed to the development; off-site storm drain improvements may be required to satisfy this requirement. Any easement for drainage or flood control shall be improved as specified by the City Engineer.

H.    Water supply. Each approved parcel shall be served by the City’s water distribution system and shall be designed and constructed to accommodate both domestic and fire flows, together with necessary fire hydrants to serve each lot proposed to be created.

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1.)


36.540.060 Improvement Plans.

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1.)


36.540.070 Installation of Improvements.

Subdivision improvements required as conditions of approval of a Tentative Map in compliance with this Division (see Section 36.540.050) shall be installed as provided by this Section.

A.    Timing of improvements. Required improvements shall be constructed or otherwise installed only after the approval of improvement plans in compliance with Section 36.540.060, and before the approval of a Parcel or Final Map in compliance with Sections 36.520.060 (Parcel Map Approval) or 36.520.100 (Final Map Approval), except where:

1.    Improvements are deferred in compliance with Section 36.540.080 (Improvement Agreements and Security); or

2.    Improvements are required as conditions on the approval of a subdivision of four or fewer lots, in which case construction of the improvements shall be required:

a.    Only when a permit for development of an affected parcel is issued by the Department; or

b.    At the time the construction of the improvements is required in compliance with an agreement between the subdivider and the City, as set forth in Section 36.540.080 (Improvement Agreements and Security); or

c.    At the time set forth in a condition of approval, when the review authority finds that fulfillment of the construction requirements by that time is necessary for public health and safety, or because the required construction is a necessary prerequisite to the orderly development of the surrounding area.

3.    To avoid breaking up street paving, underground utility or service lines required to be installed as part of a subdivision and are planned to run across or underneath the right-of-way of any street or alley shall be installed prior to the preparation of subgrade and prior to the surfacing of any streets or alleys. In the event that the development of the subdivision requires the utility company to perform utility construction work, the developer shall pay a deposit satisfactory to the utility company within sufficient time to permit construction work to be performed prior to subgrade preparation. In no event shall subgrade preparation commence before installation of all necessary utilities and laterals.

B.    Inspection of Improvements. The construction and installation of required subdivision improvements shall occur as follows.

1.    Supervision. Before starting any work, the contractor engaged by the subdivider shall designate in writing an authorized representative who shall have the authority to represent and act for the contractor in contacts with the City. The designated representative shall be present at the work site at all times while work is in progress. At times when work is suspended, arrangements acceptable to the City Engineer shall be made for any emergency work that may be required.

2.    Inspection procedures.

a.    Inspections required. The City Engineer shall make any inspections as he/she deems necessary to ensure that all construction complies with the approved improvement plans. Where required by the City Engineer, the developer shall enter into an agreement with the City to pay the full cost of any contract inspection services determined to be necessary by the City Engineer.

b.    Access to site and materials. The City Engineer shall have access to the work site at all times during construction, and shall be furnished with every reasonable facility for verifying that the materials and workmanship are in accordance with the approved improvement plans.

c.    Authority for approval. The work done and all materials furnished shall be subject to the inspection and approval of the City Engineer. The inspection of the work or materials shall not relieve the contractor of any obligations to fulfill the work as prescribed.

d.    Improper work or materials. Work or materials not meeting the requirements of the approved plans and specifications may be rejected, regardless of whether the work or materials were previously inspected by the City Engineer. In the event that the City Engineer determines that subdivision improvements are not being constructed as required by the approved plans and specifications, he or she shall order the work stopped and shall inform the contractor of the reasons for stopping work and the corrective measures necessary to resume work. Any work done after issuance of a stop work order shall be a violation of this Division.

3.    Notification. The subdivider shall notify the City Engineer upon the completion of each stage of construction as outlined in this Division, and shall not proceed with further construction until authorized by the City Engineer.

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1.)


36.540.080 Improvement Agreements and Security.

A subdivider may file a Parcel or Final Map before completion of all the improvements required by this Zoning Code and conditions of approval of the Tentative Map, only when the subdivider first obtains Council approval of a subdivision improvement agreement executed and submitted for Council review by the subdivider, and provides the City performance security as required by this Section. Improvement agreements and required security shall also comply with Chapter 5 of the Map Act.

A.    Contents of improvement agreement. A subdivision improvement agreement shall be submitted on the form provided by the City Engineer and approved by the City Attorney and shall include the following provisions.

4.    Surety requirement. Require the subdivider to secure the agreement by furnishing security to insure full and faithful performance and to insure payment to laborers and material suppliers, as specified in Subsection B. of this Section. The amount of surety shall be based on an engineer’s cost estimate submitted by the subdivider and approved by the City Engineer. The total cost of improvements to be guaranteed shall be as provided in the approved engineer’s cost estimate.

5.    Phased construction. Provisions for the construction of improvements in units, at the option of the subdivider.

6.    Time extensions. Provisions for an extension of time under conditions specified therein, at the option of the subdivider, consistent with the requirements of Subsection D. following.

7.    Progress payments or partial release. Provide for progress payments from surety deposits, or partial release of the surety filed to ensure faithful performance of the contract, at the option of the subdivider, in compliance with the requirements of Subsection C. following; provided that no progress payment or partial release shall be construed to be acceptance by the City of any portion of the required improvements or any defective work or improper materials.

a.    A deposit, either with the local agency or a responsible escrow agent or trust company, at the option of the local agency, of money or negotiable bonds of the kind approved for securing deposits of public moneys.

b.    A bond or bonds executed by one or more duly authorized corporate sureties;

c.    An instrument of credit from an agency of the state, federal, or local government when any said agency provides at least 20 percent of the financing for the portion of the act or agreement requiring security, or from one or more financial institutions subject to regulation by the State or Federal government pledging that funds necessary to carry out the act or agreement are on deposit and guaranteed for payment; or a letter of credit issued by such a financial institution;

d.    A lien upon the property to be divided, created by contract between the owner and the City, where the review authority finds that it would not be in the public interest to require the installation of the required improvement sooner than two years after the recordation of the Map, or

e.    Any form of security, including security interests in real property, which is acceptable to the local agency.

C.    Progress payments or partial release. No progress payment or partial release of the surety filed to ensure faithful performance of the contract shall be made except when the City Engineer has certified that the work required to qualify for payment or release has been satisfactorily competed and the payment or release has also been approved by the Council by at least four fifths vote. No certificate given, progress payment made, or release of surety, except the final certificate of acceptance, shall be considered as any evidence of the performance of the agreement either wholly or in part. There shall be no partial acceptance of any improvements.

D.    Time extensions. An extension of time for completion of improvements under a subdivision improvement agreement shall be granted by the Council only as follows:

1.    Public Works report. The City Engineer notifies the Council that either the subdivider is proceeding to do the work required with reasonable diligence or is not yet ready to develop the subdivision, and has given satisfactory evidence of being able and willing to complete all required work within the time of the requested extension.

2.    Agreement by sureties. The sureties agree in writing to extend for the additional period of time at the original amount of the bond or other surety, or if recommended by the City Engineer, at an increased amount.

3.    Council action. The Council approves the extension by at least a four fifths vote. As a condition of granting a time extension, the Council may impose whatever additional requirements the Council deems reasonable to protect the public interest.

E.    Acceptance of improvements. Before acceptance for maintenance or final approval by the Council of subdivision improvements, the City Engineer shall verify that the improvement work has been completed in substantial compliance with the approved plans and specifications.

(Ord. No. 2108 § 1.)


36.540.090 Soils Reports.

Soils reports shall be provided by the subdivider as required by this Section.

A.    Preliminary soils report. A preliminary soils report based upon adequate test borings and prepared by a registered civil engineer shall be required for every subdivision. The preliminary soils report shall be submitted with the Tentative Map application.

1.    Form of report. A preliminary soils report may be divided into two parts:

a.    Soils reconnaissance. The soil reconnaissance shall include a complete description of the site based on a field investigation of soils matters. The soils matters reviewed shall include stability, erosion, settlement, feasibility of construction of the proposed improvements, description of soils related hazards and problems and proposed methods of eliminating or reducing these hazards and problems; and

b.    Final soils investigation and report. This investigation and report shall include field investigation and laboratory tests with detailed information and recommendations relative to all aspects of grading, filling and other earthwork, foundation design, pavement design and subsurface drainage.

The report shall also recommend any required corrective action for the purpose of preventing structural damages to the subdivision improvements and the structures to be constructed on the lots. The report shall also recommend any special precautions required for erosion control, and the prevention of sedimentation or damage to off-site property.

If the preliminary soils report indicates the presence of critically expansive soils or other soils problems which, if not corrected, would lead to structural defects, or environmental impacts, a subsequent soils investigation of each parcel in the subdivision may be required and submitted to the City Engineer before approval of a Parcel or Final Map.

2.    Preliminary soils report waiver. The preliminary soils report may be waived if the City Engineer determines that existing available information on the qualities of the soils of the subdivision makes no preliminary analysis necessary.

B.    Final soils report. A final soils report prepared by a registered civil engineer shall be required where a preliminary soils report was required, unless the final report is waived by the City Engineer.

1.    Two copies of the final soils investigation and report shall be filed with the improvement plans.

2.    The report shall contain sufficient information to ensure compliance with all recommendations of the preliminary soils report and the specifications for the project.

3.    The report shall also contain information relative to soils conditions encountered which differed from that described in the preliminary soils reports, along with any corrections, additions or modifications not shown on the approved plans.

C.    Geologic investigation and report. If the City Engineer determines that conditions warrant, a geologic investigation and report may also be required.
