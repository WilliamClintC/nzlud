     B.      To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which incorporates provisions identical to those of the Sales and Use Tax Law of the state insofar as those provisions are not inconsistent with the requirements and limitations contained in Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code;

     C.      To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which imposes a tax and provides a measure therefor that can be administered and collected by the State Board of Equalization in a manner that adapts itself as fully as practicable to, and requires the least possible deviation from the existing statutory and administrative procedures followed by the State Board of Equalization in administering and collecting the California State Sales and Use Taxes;

     D.      To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which can be administered in a manner that will, to the degree possible consistent with the provisions of Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting city sales and use taxes and at the same time minimize the burden of recordkeeping upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this chapter. (Ord. 122 § 4, 1975)

 

3.08.050 Contract with State Board of Equalization required.
     Prior to the operative date, the city shall contract with the State Board of Equalization to perform all functions incident to the administration and operation of this chapter; provided, that if the city shall not have contracted with the State Board of Equalization prior to the operative date, it shall nevertheless so contract, and in such a case the operative date shall be the first day of the first calendar quarter following the execution of such a contract rather than the first day of the first calendar quarter following the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter. (Ord. 122 § 5, 1975)

 

3.08.060 Sales tax imposed.
     For the privilege of selling tangible personal property at retail, a tax is imposed upon all retailers in the city at the rate stated in Section 3.08.020 of the gross receipts of the retailer from the sale of all tangible personal property sold at retail in this city on and after the operative date. (Ord. 122 § 6, 1975)

 

3.08.070 Place of sale designated.
     For the purposes of this chapter, all retail sales are consummated at the place of business of the retailer unless the tangible personal property sold is delivered by the retailer or his or her agent to an out-of-state destination or to a common carrier for delivery to an out-of-state destination. The gross receipts from such sales shall include delivery charges when such charges are subject to the state sales and use tax, regardless of the place to which delivery is made. In the event a retailer has no permanent place of business in the state or has more than one place of business, the place or places at which the retail sales are consummated shall be determined under rules and regulations to be prescribed and adopted by the State Board of Equalization. (Ord. 122 § 7, 1975)

 

3.08.080 Use tax imposed.
     An excise tax is imposed on the storage, use, or other consumption in the city of tangible personal property purchased from any retailer on and after the operative date for storage, use or other consumption in the city at the rate stated in Section 3.08.020 of the sales price of the property. The sales price shall include delivery charges when such charges are subject to state sales or use tax regardless of the place to which delivery is made. (Ord. 122 § 8, 1975)

 

3.08.090 State law adopted by reference.

(Ord. 122 § 9, 1975)

 

3.08.100 Substitution of “city” for “state” in state law.
     In adopting the provisions of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, wherever the state is named or referred to as the taxing agency, the name of the city shall be substituted therefor. The substitution, however, shall not be made when the word “state” is used as part of the title of the State Controller, the State Treasurer, the State Board of Control, the State Board of Equalization, the State Treasury, or the Constitution of the State of California. The substitution shall not be made when the result of that substitution would require action to be taken by or against the city, or any agency thereof, rather than by or against the State Board of Equalization, in performing the functions incident to the administration or operation of this chapter. The substitution shall not be made in those sections, including, but not necessarily limited to, sections referring to the exterior boundaries of the state, where the result of the substitution would be to provide an exemption from this tax with respect to certain sales, storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal property which would not otherwise be exempt from this tax while such sales, storage, use or other consumption remain subject to tax by the state under the provisions of Part 1 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, or to impose this tax with respect to certain sales, storage, use or other consumption of tangible personal property which would not be subject to tax by the state under the said provisions of that code. The substitution shall not be made in Sections 6701, 6702 (except in the last sentence thereof), 6711, 6715, 6737, 6797 or 6828 of the Revenue and Taxation Code; and the substitution shall not be made for the word “state” in the phrase “retailer engaged in business in this state” in Section 6203 or in the definition of that phrase in Section 6203.

     If a seller’s permit has been issued to a retailer under Section 6067 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, an additional seller’s permit shall not be required by this chapter. (Ord. 122 § 11, 1975)

 

3.08.120 Exclusions and exemptions.
     A.      The amount subject to tax shall not include any sales or use tax imposed by the state of California upon a retailer or consumer.

     B.      The storage, use, or other consumption of tangible personal property, the gross receipts from the sale of which have been subject to tax under a sales and use tax ordinance enacted in accordance with Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code by any city and county, county, or city in this state shall be exempt from the tax due under this chapter.

     C.      There are exempted from the computation of the amount of sales tax the gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property to operators of waterborne vessels to be used or consumed principally outside the city in which the sale is made and directly and exclusively in the carriage of persons or property in such vessels for commercial purposes.

     E.      There are exempted from the computation of the amount of the sales tax the gross receipts from the sale of tangible personal property to operators of aircraft to be used or consumed principally outside the city in which the sale is made and directly and exclusively in the use of such aircraft as common carriers of persons of property under the authority of the laws of this state, the United States, or any foreign government.

     F.      In addition to the exemptions provided in Sections 6366 and 6366.1 of the Revenue and Taxation Code the storage, use, or other consumption of tangible personal property purchased by operators of aircraft and used or consumed by such operators directly and exclusively in the use of such aircraft as common carriers of persons or property for hire or compensation under a certificate of public convenience and necessity issued pursuant to the laws of this state, the United States, or any foreign government is exempted from the use tax. (Ord. 315 § 2, 1983: Ord. 122 § 12, 1975)*

 

*   This section shall be operative on the operative date of any act of the Legislature of the state of California which amends Section 7202 of the Revenue and Taxation Code or which repeals and reenacts Section 7202 of the Revenue and Taxation Code to provide an exemption from the city sales and use taxes for operators of waterborne vessels in the same, or substantially the same, language as that existing in subdivisions (i) (7) and (i) (8) of Section 7202 of the Revenue and Taxation Code as those subdivisions read on October 1, 1983.

 

3.08.130 State law amendments adopted by reference.

Chapter 3.12 TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX
3.12.010 Short title.
     This chapter shall be known as the “Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax Law of the City.” (Ord. 13 § 1, 1971)

 

3.12.020 Definitions.
     Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this section govern the construction of this chapter:

     A.      1. “Hotel” means any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging, or sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodginghouse, roominghouse, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, mobile home or house trailer at a fixed location, or other similar structure or portion thereof.

     2.      “Hotel” does not include mobile homes located inside mobile home parks, nor does it include a mobile home when the tenant thereof is an employee of the owner or operator of the mobile home.

     B.      “Occupancy” means the use or possession, or the right to the use or possession, of any room or rooms or portion thereof in any hotel for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes.

     C.      “Operator” means the person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his or her functions through agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his or her principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both.

     D.      “Person” means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate, or any other group or combination acting as a unit.

     E.      “Rent” means the consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and property and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever.

     F.      “Transient” means any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other agreement for a period of thirty consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of thirty days has expired unless there is an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy. In determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date of this chapter may be considered. (Ord. 237, 1980; Ord. 13 § 2, 1971)

 

3.12.030 Tax imposed—Payment required.
     For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to and shall pay a tax in the amount of ten percent of the rent charged by the operator. Such tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the city, which is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the city. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient’s ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the

hotel, the city treasurer may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the city treasurer. (Ord. 555 § 1, 1997: Ord. 343 § 1, 1985: Ord. 175 § 1, 1977: Ord. 13 § 3, 1971)

 

3.12.040 Collection by operator required.
     Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this chapter to the same extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent charged, and each transient shall receive a receipt for payment from the operator. No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner provided in this chapter. (Ord. 13 § 4, 1971)

 

3.12.050 Transient occupancy registration certificate required.
     Within thirty days after commencing business, or within thirty days after the effective date of this chapter, whichever is later, the operator of any hotel renting occupancy to transients shall register said hotel with the city treasurer and obtain from him or her a “transient occupancy registration certificate” which shall at all times be posted in a conspicuous place on the premises. Said certificate shall, among other things, state the following:

     A.      The name of the operator;

     B.      The address of the hotel;

     C.      The date upon which the certificate was issued;

     D.      A statement as follows:

 

“This transient occupancy registration certificate signifies that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax Law by registering with the city treasurer for the purpose of collecting from transients the transient occupancy tax and remitting said tax to the city treasurer. This certificate does not authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business or to conduct any lawful business in an unlawful manner, nor to operate a hotel without strictly complying with all local applicable laws, including, but not limited to, those requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or office of this city. This certificate does not constitute a permit.”

(Ord. 13 § 5, 1971)

 

3.12.060 Return required—Remittal of tax required when.
     Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following the close of each calendar quarter, or at the close of any shorter reporting period which may be established by the city treasurer, make a return to the city treasurer, on forms provided by him or her, of the total rents charged and received and the amount of tax collected from transient occupancies. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the city treasurer. The city treasurer may establish shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder if he or she deems it necessary in order to ensure collection of the tax, and he or she may require further information in the return. Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust for the account of the city until payment thereof is made to the city treasurer. (Ord. 13 § 6, 1971)

 

3.12.070 Penalty—First delinquency.
     Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty of ten percent of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax. (Ord. 13 § 7(a), 1971)

 

3.12.080 Penalty—Second delinquency.
     Any operator who fails to remit any delinquent remittance on or before a period of thirty days following the date on which the remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second delinquency penalty of ten percent of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax and the ten percent penalty first imposed. (Ord. 13 § 7(b), 1971)

 

3.12.090 Penalty—Fraud.
     If the city treasurer determines that the nonpayment of any remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of twenty-five percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties stated in Sections 3.12.070 and 3.12.080. (Ord. 13 § 7(c), 1971)

 

3.12.100 Penalty—Additional interest.
     In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the rate of one-half of one percent per month or fraction thereof on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until paid. (Ord. 13 § 7(d), 1971)

 

3.12.110 Penalty and interest a part of tax.
     Every penalty imposed and such interest as accrues under the provisions of Sections 3.12.070 through 3.12.100 shall become a part of the tax herein required to be paid. (Ord. 13 § 7(e), 1971)

 

3.12.120 Determination and collection by city treasurer authorized when.
     If any operator fails or refuses to collect said tax and to make, within the time provided in the law, any report and remittance of said tax or any portion thereof required by this chapter, the city treasurer shall proceed in such manner as he or she may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to base his or her estimate of the tax due. As soon as the city treasurer shall procure such facts and information as he or she is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by the provisions of this chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, he or she shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by this chapter. In case such determination is made, the city treasurer shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his or her last known place of address. Such operator may within ten days after the serving or mailing of such notice make application in writing to the city treasurer for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the city treasurer shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the city treasurer shall give not less than five days’ written notice in the manner prescribed in this section to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in said notice why said amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties.

The operation, maintenance, and expansion of the inventory of AAA Three Diamond Hotels in the city will serve the existing needs of businesses and visitors and families using medical facilities within the city as well as promote and enhance the economy of the city and assist the city in promoting tourism by providing attractive and desirable visitor serving facilities and experiences that will serve the needs of visitors to medical facilities and their families and contribute to the growth and expansion of tourism opportunities in the city, providing employment opportunities for the residents of the city, and raising average daily room rates for all hotels.

     C.      It is in the best interest of the city to induce and encourage the operation of new AAA Three Diamond Hotels that, but for the hotel incentive program, would not operate within the city.

     D.      The authority granted and the purposes to be accomplished by this chapter are a municipal affair for which public funds can be expended and that the operation, maintenance, and expansion of the inventory of AAA Three Diamond Hotels are of paramount importance to the city of Loma Linda, its residents, and businesses.

     B.      The tax administrator may require said service user to identify its nonutility supplier and provide, subject to audit, filed tax returns or other satisfactory evidence documenting the quantity of electricity or gas used and the price thereof. (Ord. 506 § 9, 1994)

Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 3.18.080, the tax shall be collected insofar as practicable at the same time as and along with the charges made in accordance with the regular billing practices of the service supplier. Where the amount paid by a service user to a service supplier is less than the full amount of the energy charge and tax which has accrued for the billing period, such amount and any subsequent payments by a service user shall be applied to the utility charge first until such charge has been fully satisfied. Any remaining balance shall be applied to taxes due. In those cases where a service user has notified the service supplier of refusal to pay the tax imposed on said energy charges, Section 3.18.140(C) will apply.

     B.      The duty to collect tax from a service user shall commence with the beginning of the first full regular billing period applicable to the service user where all charges normally included in such regular billing are subject to the provisions of this chapter. Where a person receives more than one billing, one or more being for different periods than another, the duty to collect shall arise separately for each billing. (Ord. 506 § 14, 1994)

 

3.18.140 Additional powers and duties of tax administrator.
     A.      The tax administrator shall have the power and duty, and is directed to enforce each and all of the provisions of this chapter.

     B.      The tax administrator shall have the power to adopt rules and regulations not inconsistent with the provisions of this chapter for the purpose of carrying out and enforcing the payment, collection and remittance of the taxes imposed in this chapter. A copy of such rules and regulations shall be on file in the tax administrator’s office.

     C.      The tax administrator may make administrative agreements to vary the strict requirements of this chapter so that collection of any tax imposed in this chapter may be made in conformance with the billing procedures of a particular service supplier so long as said agreements result in collection of the tax in conformance with the general purpose and scope of this chapter. A copy of each such agreement shall be on file in the tax administrator’s office.

     D.      The tax administrator shall determine the eligibility of any person who asserts a right to exemption from the tax imposed by this chapter. The tax administrator shall provide the service supplier with the name of any person who the tax administrator determines is exempt from the tax imposed by this chapter, together with the address to which service is supplied to any such exempt person. The tax administrator shall notify the service supplier of termination of any person’s right to exemption or the change of any address to which service is supplied to any exempt person.

     E.      The tax administrator shall provide written notice to all service suppliers of any change in the city’s boundaries at least ninety days prior to any annexation or other change in the city’s boundaries. Said notice shall set forth the revised boundaries by street and address along with a copy of the final annexation order from local agency formation commission. (Ord. 506 § 15, 1994)

 

3.18.150 Assessment—Administrative remedy.
     A.      The tax administrator may make an assessment for taxes not remitted by a person required to remit.

     B.      Whenever the tax administrator determines that a service user has deliberately withheld the amount of tax owed by the service user from the amounts remitted to a person required to collect the tax, or that a service user has refused to pay the amount of tax, the tax administrator may relieve such person of the obligation to collect taxes due under this chapter from certain named service users for specified billing periods.

     C.      The service supplier shall provide the city with amounts refused and/or unpaid along with the names and addresses of the service users neglecting to pay the tax imposed under this chapter. Whenever the service user has failed to pay the amount of tax for a period of two or more billing periods, the service supplier shall be relieved of the obligation to collect taxes due.

     D.      The tax administrator shall notify the service user that the tax administrator has assumed responsibility to collect the taxes due for the stated periods and demand payment of such taxes. The notice shall be served on the service user by personal delivery or by deposit of the notice in the U.S. mail, postage prepaid thereon, addressed to the service user at the address to which billing was made by the person required to collect the gas; or, should the service user have changed addresses, to the last known address. If a service user fails to remit the tax to the tax administrator within fifteen days from the date of the service of the notice, which shall be the date of mailing if service is not accomplished in person, a penalty of twenty-five percent of the amount of the tax set forth in the notice shall be imposed, but not less than five dollars. The penalty shall become part of the tax required to be paid in this chapter. (Ord. 506 § 16, 1994)

 

3.18.160 Records.
     A.      It shall be the duty of every person required to collect and remit to the city any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve, for a period of three years, all records as may be necessary to determine liability for the remittance to the tax administrator, which records the tax administrator shall have the right to inspect at all reasonable times.

     B.      A person providing transportation services of natural gas to a user for delivery through a gas pipeline distribution system shall make available to the tax administrator records of the names and addresses of service users for whom only transportation services are provided by such persons. All information provided to the tax administrator pursuant to this section shall be used solely for the purposes of this chapter. (Ord. 506 § 17, 1994)

 

3.18.170 Refunds.
     A.      Whenever the amount of any tax has been overpaid or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the tax administrator under this chapter, it may be refunded by the tax administrator.

     B.      Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection (A) of this section, a service supplier may claim a refund; or take as credit against taxes remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once, or erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established that the service user from whom the tax has been collected did not owe the tax; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax erroneously or illegally collected has either been refunded to the service user or credited to charges subsequently payable by the service user to the person required to collect and remit. A service supplier that has collected any amount of tax in excess of the amount of tax imposed by this chapter and actually due from a service user, may refund such amount to the service user and claim credit for such overpayment against the amount of tax which is due upon any other monthly returns, provided such credit is claimed in a return dated no later than three years from the date of overpayment.

     C.      No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless the claimant establishes the right thereto by written records showing entitlement thereto.

     D.      Notwithstanding other provisions of this section, whenever a service supplier, pursuant to an order of the California Public Utilities Commission or a court of competent jurisdiction, makes a refund to service users of charges for past utility services, the taxes paid pursuant to this chapter on the amount of such refunded charges shall also be refunded to service users, and the service supplier shall be entitled to claim a credit for such refunded taxes against the amount of tax which is due upon the next monthly returns. In the event this chapter is repealed, the amounts of any refundable taxes will be borne by the city.

     E.      A service supplier may refund the taxes collected to the service user in accordance with this section or by the service supplier’s customary practice. (Ord. 506 § 18, 1994)

Chapter 3.20 FINANCING AND REFINANCING OF INDUSTRIAL, COMMERCIAL, HOSPITAL AND HEALTH CARE FACILITIES
3.20.010 Findings and determinations.
     A.      Hospitals and Health Care Facilities. The city council finds and determines as follows: The health and welfare of the citizens of the city and of the surrounding area is a matter of vital concern to the city and the protection and promotion of such health and welfare is the responsibility of the city, is a proper public purpose and is a municipal affair. In carrying out such responsibility, the city is dependent upon and assisted by private organizations. The issuance of revenue bonds to finance or refinance projects related to hospitals and health care facilities which provide health care services to residents of the city, including such facilities provided by private organizations, is a proper public purpose, is a municipal affair, and promotes the health and welfare of the citizens of the city.

     B.      Industrial and Commercial Facilities. The city council finds and determines as follows: The city is organized and exists to provide to its citizens and other residents of the area services and support which individually such persons cannot provide for themselves and to promote and protect the welfare and security of such persons. The welfare and security of the citizens of the city and of surrounding areas depends upon, and the responsibilities of the city extend to, the development and maintenance of a stable local economy and the provision of adequate and meaningful employment, all of which are dependent upon the maintenance, promotion and development of commercial, business, industrial, manufacturing and agricultural enterprises. The city can attract such enterprises to the area and assist those currently in the area by the issuance of revenue bonds to provide financing and refinancing for such enterprises. The issuance of revenue bonds for industrial and commercial purposes is a proper public purpose, is a municipal affair, and promotes the welfare and well being of the citizens of the city.

     G.

     H.     The procedure, if any, by which the terms may be amended or abrogated, the amount of such bonds, the holders of which must consent thereto, and the manner in which such consent may be given; and

     The principal of and interest on any bonds issued by the city under this chapter may be secured by a pledge of, or security interest in, the revenues, rentals and receipts out of which the same may be made payable or from other moneys available therefor and not otherwise pledged or used as security and may be secured by a trust indenture (which may assign the city’s rights in any loan agreements, leases, sale agreements, mortgages and deeds of trust which the city may have with the participating institution), and/or by a mortgage or deed of trust (including mortgages or deeds of trust from the participating institution to the trustee) covering all or any part of the project from which the revenues, rentals or receipts so pledged or used as security may be derived, including any enlargements of and additions to any such project thereafter made. (Ord. 271 Art. 5, 1981)

 

3.20.170 Insurance or guarantee of payment.
     The city may obtain, or aid in obtaining, from any department or agency of the United States or of the state or any private company or banking institution, any insurance, guarantee, letter of credit or contractual agreement as to, or of or for the payment or repayment of, interest or principal, or both, or any part thereof, on any bond issued under the terms of this chapter or on any loan, lease or sale obligation or any instrument evidencing or securing the same, made or entered into pursuant to the provisions of this chapter; and may accept payment in such manner and form as provided therein in the event of default by a participating institution, and may assign any such insurance or guarantee as security for bonds. (Ord. 271 Art. 6, 1981)

 

3.20.180 Refunding bonds.
     A.      The city may issue bonds for the purpose of refunding any bonds then outstanding, including the payment of any redemption premiums thereof and any interest accrued or to accrue to the earliest or any subsequent date or dates of redemption, purchase or maturity of such bonds.

     B.      The proceeds of bonds issued for the purpose of refunding any outstanding bonds may, in the discretion of the city, be applied to the purchase or retirement at maturity or redemption of such outstanding bonds, either at their earliest or any subsequent redemption date or dates, or upon the purchase or retirement at the maturity thereof and may, pending such application, be placed in escrow, to be applied together with the earnings thereon to such purchase or retirement at maturity or redemption on such date or dates as may be determined by the city.

(Ord. 271 Art. 9, 1981)

 

3.20.200 Liability.
     Neither the members of the city council, the officers or employees of the city, nor any person executing any bonds shall be liable personally on the bonds or be subject to any personal liability or accountability by reason of the issuance thereof. (Ord. 271 Art. 7, 1981)

The purposes authorized by this section may be effectuated and bonds may be issued and the special taxes levied for any such purposes under this chapter, notwithstanding that any other law or ordinance may provide for such purposes or for the issuance of bonds and the levy of special taxes for like purposes and without regard to the requirements, restrictions, limitations or other provisions contained in any other law or ordinance. (Ord. 441 § 5, 1991)

     B.      Section 53314.8 of the Government Code is deleted and in lieu thereof, insert the following:

 

At any time either before or after the formation of the district, the legislative body may provide, by resolution, that for a period specified in the resolution, the local agency may contribute, from any source of revenue not otherwise prohibited by law, any specified amount, portion, or percentage of such revenues for the purposes set forth in such resolution, including the acquisition or construction of a facility, the acquisition of interest in real property, the provision of authorized services, a periodic contribution to the debt service on the bonds of the district, and the payment of expenses incidental in connection with any of the foregoing. Such contribution shall not constitute an indebtedness or liability of the local agency.

 

     C.      This chapter incorporates all amendments made to the Act after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, in effect on the date the city council adopts the resolution of intention as provided in Section 53321 of the Government Code unless the city council shall, by resolution, provide otherwise.

(Ord. 441 § 6, 1991)

Chapter 3.24 FIRE PROTECTION CHARGES AND ASSESSMENTS
Note
*   Prior ordinance history: Ords. 332 and 422.

 

3.24.010 Legislative findings.
     The city council finds that the continuing increase in the cost of providing fire protection and other public safety services to the city has created an urgent need for adequate funds to provide these services. The following provisions are authorized, and it is further declared that the fees provided for herein are levied pursuant to the legal authority of the city and are for the purpose of providing user cost reimbursement to the city. (Ord. 423 § 2, 1989)

 

3.24.020 Temporary fire impact mitigation development assessment.
     All new construction in the city shall pay a fee which shall be used to mitigate the impact of the new development on fire protection services. The fees collected under this provision shall be used to construct or equip new fire protection facilities or to improve existing facilities or equipment as shall be recommended by the director of public safety and approved and determined by the city council as reasonable and necessary to mitigate the impact of new development on fire protection services and as set forth in the city fire protection master plan. Such fees shall be established by the city council by resolution.

     A.      Imposed Rates. Every person or entity causing to be constructed or established, dwelling, commercial, manufacturing, or public assembly units shall pay to the city in advance said fee.

     B.      Base Rate. The base rate as established by resolution of the city council shall be terminated upon completion and implementation of the fire protection master plan or AB 1600 Fee Study or on December 31, 1990, unless earlier amended or terminated by the city council.

     C.      Collection and Refunds. The amount of fees due hereunder shall be determined and collected at the time a building permit is issued for the respective development. No permit shall be issued authorizing the construction or establishment of any units without payment of such fee. Refunds for payment made will be allowed upon application, when it is established that the unit has not been established or constructed. (Ord. 423 § 3, 1989)

 

3.24.030 Fee schedule.
     The fees as established by the city council by resolution shall be based on direct costs and the city manager shall annually present to the city council for approval, a fee schedule based on the approved fire division study and report regarding costs. (Ord. 423 § 4, 1989)

Chapter 3.28 FEE AND SERVICE CHARGE REVENUE/COST COMPARISON SYSTEM
Note
*   Prior ordinance history: Ords. 353, 362 and 402.

 

3.28.010 Findings and intent.
     A.      Pursuant to Article XIIIB of the California Constitution, it is the intent of the city council to require the ascertainment and recovery costs reasonably borne from fees, charges and regulatory license fees levied therefor in providing the regulation, products or services enumerated in this chapter.

     B.      The fee and service charge revenue/costs comparison system set forth in this chapter provides a mechanism for ensuring that fees adopted by the city for services rendered do not exceed the reasonable estimated costs for providing the services for which the fees are charged.

     C.      The adoption of this chapter is exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act (Public Resources Code Sections 2100 et seq.), because it approves and sets forth a procedure for determining fees for the purpose of meeting the operating expenses of city departments, as set forth in Public Resources Code Section 21080 (b) (8) (1). (Ord. 455 § 1, 1991)

 

3.28.020 Delegation of authority and direction to manager.
     A.      The city manager is delegated the authority and directed to provide documents to the city council to implement its policy enumerated in this chapter to adjust fees and charges to recover the percentage of costs reasonably borne as established by this chapter, in providing the regulation, product or service enumerated in this chapter in the percentage of costs reasonably borne and on the schedule of rate review and revision as established in this chapter.

     B.      The city manager is delegated authority to issue executive orders defining terms, setting out administrative, fee collection, and financial procedures, definitions, and establishing effective dates of all fees set by the city council by resolution. All executive orders shall be originated and signed by the affected department head, shall be signed by the finance director certifying that the financial requirements of this chapter are complied with, and shall be signed by the city manager connoting the effective date of the executive order and new or revised rate structure, procedure or definition.

     C.      “Costs reasonably borne” shall be as defined in Section 3.28.030. In adjusting fees and charges, the city manager shall act in an administrative and ministerial capacity and shall consider only the standards and criteria established by this chapter, and the procedures set by this chapter and by applicable state law. All executive orders issued shall comply in all respects with this chapter, and the several schedules of fees and rates as set by the city council by resolution. (Ord. 455 § 1, 1991)

 

3.28.030 Costs reasonably borne—Defined.
“Costs reasonably borne,” as used and ordered to be applied in this chapter are to consist of the following elements:

     A.      All applicable direct costs including, but not limited to salaries, wages, overtime, employee fringe benefits, services and supplies, maintenance and operation expenses, contracted services, special supplies, and any other direct expense incurred.

     B.      All applicable indirect costs including, but not restricted to, building maintenance and operations, equipment maintenance and operations, communications expenses, computer costs, printing and reproduction, vehicle expenses, insurance, debt service, and like expenses when distributed on an accounted and documented rational proration system.

     C.      Fixed asset recovery expenses, consisting of depreciation of fixed assets, and additional fixed asset expense recovery charges calculated on the current estimated cost of replacement, divided by the approximate life expectancy of the fixed asset. A further additional charge to make up the difference between book value depreciation not previously recovered and reserved in cash and the full cost of replacement, also shall be calculated and considered a cost so as to recover such unrecovered costs between book value and cost of replacement over the remaining life of the asset.

     D.      General overhead, expressed as a percentage, distributing and charging the expenses of the city council, city attorney, city administration, city clerk, city treasurer, economic development, finance department, personnel office, and city promotion, and all other staff and support service provided to the entire city organization. Overhead shall be prorated between tax-financed services and fee-financed services on the basis of said percentage so that each of taxes and fees and charges shall proportionately defray such overhead costs.

     E.      Departmental overhead, expressed as a percentage, distributing and charging the cost of each department head and his or her supporting expenses as enumerated in subsections A, B, C and F of this section.

     F.      Debt service costs, consisting of repayment of principal, payment of interest, and trustee fees and administrative expenses for all applicable bond, certificate, note or securities issues or loans of whatever nature or kind. Any required coverage factors or required or established reserves beyond basic debt service costs also shall be considered a cost if required by covenant within any securities ordinance, resolution, indenture or general law applicable to the city. (Ord. 455 § 1, 1991)

 

3.28.040 Schedule of fees and service charges.
     A.      The city manager, finance director and each city department head, under the direction of the city manager, shall review annually the fees and service charges listed in Table 3.28.040, and provide an adjusted fee or charge schedule to the city council for its consideration so as to recover the listed percentage of costs reasonably borne necessary to provide the listed regulation, product or service.

The schedule of frequency of rate adjustments may be varied by the city manager to adjust revenues sufficient to meet debt service coverage requirements of any bond, certificate, or ordinance, resolution, indenture, contract, or action under which securities have been issued by the city which contain any coverage factor requirement.

     F.      The city manager may vary the review schedule listed in this section if, in the judgement of the city manager and a directly affected and requesting department head, a gross inequity would be perpetrated by not revising the rate schedule.

Chapter 3.30 DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES
3.30.010 Purpose.
     A.      In order to implement the goals and objectives of the city’s capital facilities planning and to mitigate the impacts caused by new development, certain public improvement must be or have been constructed.

     B.      The city council has determined that a development impact fee is needed in order to pay for the share of the construction costs of these improvements, which were required to accommodate the new development.

     C.      In establishing the fee described in the following sections, the city council has found the fee to be consistent with its general plan and, pursuant to Government Code Section 65913.2, has considered the effects of the fee with respect to the city’s housing needs as established in the housing element of the general plan. (Ord. 479 § 1, 1992)

 

3.30.020 Development impact fee.
     A.      A development impact fee is established on issuance of all building permits for development to pay for public improvements. The city council shall annually, by resolution:

     1.      Set forth the specific amount of the fee;

     2.      List the specific public improvements to be financed;

     3.      Describe the estimated cost of these facilities;

     4.      Describe the reasonable relationship between this fee and the various types of new developments; and

     5.      Set forth time for payment.

     B.      Payment of development impact fees shall be prescribed by the adopted fee resolution. On a periodic basis, the city council shall review this fee to determine whether the fee amounts are reasonably related to the impacts of developments and whether the described public facilities are still needed. (Ord. 479 § 1, 1992)

 

3.30.030 Limited use of fees.
     The revenues raised by payment of this fee shall be placed in a separate and special account and such revenues, along with any interest earnings on that account, shall be used solely to:

     A.      Pay for the city’s future construction of facilities described in the resolution enacted pursuant to Section 3.30.020, or to reimburse the city for those described or listed facilities constructed by the city with funds advanced by the city from other sources; or

     B.      Reimburse developers who have been required or permitted by Section 3.30.040, to install such listed facilities which are oversized with supplemental size, length or capacity. (Ord. 479 § 1, 1992)

 

3.30.040 Developer construction of facilities.
     Whenever a developer is required, as a condition of approval of a development permit, to construct a public facility described in a resolution adopted pursuant to Section 3.30.020, which facility is determined by the city to have supplemental size, length or capacity over that needed for the impacts of that development, and when such construction is necessary to ensure efficient and timely construction of the facilities network, a reimbursement agreement with the developer and a credit against the fee, which would otherwise be charged pursuant to this chapter on the development project, shall be offered. The reimbursement amount shall not include the portion of the improvement needed to provide services or mitigate the need for the facility or the burdens created by the development. (Ord. 479 § 1, 1992)

 

3.30.050 Effective date of fee.
     The fee shall apply to the issuance of any building permit, for any residential development issued sixty days following the passage of the ordinance codified in this chapter and for all other types of development thirty days following its passage. (Ord. 479 § 1, 1992)

(Ord. 452 § 20, 1991)

 

3.32.210 Formal bids—Tie.

Preference may, at this point, be given to local vendors on the basis of tax revenue returned to the city. (Ord. 452 § 21, 1991)

 

3.32.220 Action when no formal bids received.

3.32.260 Exemptions from competitive bidding.
     Procedures and requirements for formal and informal competitive bidding may be dispensed with in any of the following circumstances:

     A.      The commodity can be obtained from only one vendor or source;

     B.      The situation is categorized as an emergency by the purchasing agent:

     1.      A recognized public disaster,

     2.      A breakdown in machinery or an essential city function which requires the immediate procurement of supplies, equipment, or services in order to protect the health, welfare, safety and/or convenience of the general public;

     C.      Supplies, equipment, or services are to be acquired through an agreement entered into with another governmental entity;

     D.      The commodity in question is a professional consulting service or a service on retainer.

     The purchasing agent shall be empowered to find and determine that substantial evidence exists to support such exemptions from the competitive bid procedures. Notwithstanding any such waiver of the competitive bidding requirements, such purchases shall still be subject to purchase order requirements and administrative regulation by the purchasing agent. (Ord. 452 § 26, 1991)

 

3.32.270 Technical contract services—Regulations.
     Contracts for technical contract services, as defined in Section 3.32.020, shall be awarded on the basis of demonstrated competence and professional qualifications relevant to the task in question. The three mechanisms by which the city shall govern the awarding of such contracts are as follows: annual lists of qualified firms, requests for qualifications, and requests for proposals. These mechanisms shall operate as described in this chapter. (Ord. 452 § 27, 1991)

 

3.32.280 Annual lists of firms.
     The purchasing agent shall maintain lists of firms qualified to perform work in those areas in which the city normally solicits technical contract services. The city shall annually publish a notice inviting technical contract services firms to submit their qualifications and inviting those already on the lists to update their stated qualifications. These notices may be published in a major newspaper of general local circulation, technical publications, or newsletters of appropriate professional societies. (Ord. 452 § 28, 1991)

 

3.32.290 Request for qualifications.
     When the need for technical contract services arises which, by the determination of the purchasing agent, would not be sufficiently served by an annual list of consultants, requests for qualifications (RFQ) shall be sent to three or more firms. The RFQ should provide a general description of the project and request the consultant to submit qualifying information as specified at the time of the request. (Ord. 452 § 29, 1991)

 

3.32.300 Short list.
     A.      A selection committee assembled by the purchasing agent should review both the annual list of firms and the consultant’s responses to the RFQ (the Statement of Qualification or SOQ) and establish a short list of at least three of the most qualified consultants for further evaluation.

     B.      If the purchasing agent has determined that a request for qualifications is not necessary, the short list shall be selected from among those firms on the annual lists of firms. (Ord. 452 § 30, 1991)

 

3.32.310 Request for proposals.
     In those instances when more detailed proposals are warranted, a request for proposal (RFP) shall be sent to the short-listed firms prior to the start of negotiations. The RFP should solicit specific information on the consultant’s proposed team including subcontractors, understanding of the project, approach, scope of work, and other relevant data, but should not request fee information. (Ord. 452 § 31, 1991)

 

3.32.320 Selection and negotiation.
     Following the deadline set for receipt of qualifications and/or proposals, the selection committee shall evaluate the qualifications and/or proposals and conduct discussions with those firms on the short list regarding anticipated concepts and the relative utility of alternative methods of approach for furnishing the required services and then shall select therefrom, in order of preference, based upon criteria established and published by the selection committee, no less than three of the firms deemed to be the most highly qualified to provide the services required. From this ranked listing, the selection committee shall negotiate a contract with the best qualified firm at a compensation which the city determines to be fair and reasonable. If agreement on terms cannot be reached with the first choice firm, negotiation shall be terminated and negotiations will then proceed with the next firm on the list, and so on to the remaining firms on the list if necessary.

Chapter 5.24 MASSAGE ESTABLISHMENTS
ARTICLE I. GENERAL PROVISIONS
5.24.010 Findings and purpose.
     The city council finds and declares as follows:

     A.      The permit requirements and restrictions imposed by this chapter are reasonably necessary to protect the health, safety and welfare of the citizens of the city, while recognizing massage as a legitimate business interest that provides benefits to its patrons in a therapeutic setting.

     B.      This chapter is enacted pursuant to the provisions of the State Constitution, California Government Code Sections 37100, 51030 et seq., California Business and Professions Code Sections 460, 4600 through 4620 and Section 16000, Section 13 of the Chiropractic Act (initiative measure approved by the electors November 7, 1922, as amended) and AB 1147 (2014).

     C.      There is a significant risk of injury to massage clients by persons improperly trained and/or educated in providing massage services, and this chapter provides reasonable safeguards against injury and economic loss.

     D.      There is opportunity for acts of prostitution, lewdness, and other unlawful sexual activity to occur in massage establishments, as well as problems relating to human trafficking in massage establishments. Courts have long recognized massage as a pervasively regulated activity and that massage establishments are often brothels in disguise. The establishment of reasonable standards for issuance of permits and restrictions on operations would serve to reduce the risk of illegal activity and would thereby benefit the public health.

     E.      The provisions of this chapter are intended to enhance the efficient processing of permits for massage establishments, owners and managers and the ongoing regulation of those permittees and certificate holders by the city of Loma Linda. The provisions of this chapter in no way limit the authority of the city to inspect massage establishments or conduct investigations to ensure permittees are complying with applicable rules and regulations.

     F.      The restrictions and requirements contained in this chapter are intended to stop the practice of businesses quickly changing ownership in name upon the discovery of criminal activity by the city.

     G.      The restrictions and requirements contained in this chapter are intended to be in addition to the requirement of a valid business license issued pursuant to Chapter 5.04 of the Loma Linda Municipal Code.

     H.     The regulations and restrictions contained in this chapter are intended to discourage massage establishments from degenerating into houses of prostitution, and the means utilized in this chapter bear a reasonable and rational relationship to the goals sought to be achieved within the confines allowed by state law.

     I.       The provisions of this chapter are not intended to be exclusive and compliance therewith shall not excuse noncompliance with any state or local laws or regulations that are uniformly applied to other professional or personal service businesses.

     J.       The California Massage Therapy Council (“CAMTC”) can better, and more efficiently, regulate massage technicians in order to best protect the public and it is in the public interest to require that all persons providing massage in the city have a certificate from the CAMTC. (Ord. 730 § 1, 2016)

     C.      Any person desiring to obtain a certificate of operation and/or an operator permit shall make application in accordance with the provisions of this article, which application shall be accompanied by a nonrefundable fee in an amount established by resolution of the city council.

     D.      All applications shall be dated and shall contain the following statements:

     1.      A certification under penalty of perjury that the information contained in the application is true and correct; and

     F.      Within thirty working days following receipt of a completed application(s), the community development director shall either issue the certificate of operation and/or operator permit or mail a written statement of the reasons for denial thereof. Notwithstanding the above, failure of the city to act upon a completed application within the time frame set forth above shall not be deemed approval of the application pursuant to this chapter.

A permittee shall be required to update the information contained in his or her original permit application and provide any new and/or additional information as may be reasonably required by the community development director in order to determine whether the permit should be renewed, including all information required by subsections A and B of this section.

     J.       Each operator of a massage establishment shall be responsible for the conduct of all employees and independent contractors working on the premises of the business.

     K.      The operator of the massage establishment is responsible for verifying that all persons hold the appropriate CAMTC certificate as required by this chapter.

     L.      Any requirement of this chapter applying to an operator shall apply to each and every operator of a massage establishment. (Ord. 730 § 1, 2016)

 

5.24.090 Certificate of operation.
     A.      Applications for a certificate of operation shall be filed with the community development director and shall include the information set forth below:

     1.      The full name of the applicant;

     2.      The name under which the business is to be conducted, which name must match the name of the business under which the corresponding business license is issued under Chapter 5.04. No massage establishment business shall operate under any business name or conduct business under any designation not specified in the certificate of operation. If the applicant is a corporation, the name shall be exactly as shown on the articles of incorporation or on a valid DBA (“doing business as”);

     3.      The address of the proposed massage establishment;

     4.      A detailed description of the operation and type of services to be provided by the massage establishment, including other therapies to be provided, and other businesses to be operated on the same premises;

     5.      The full name of each operator of the massage establishment;

     6.      A legal size copy of the floor plan approved as part of the conditional use permit, drawn to scale showing: entrances; exits; windows; interior doors; restrooms; all other separately enclosed rooms with dimensions, including, but not limited to, closets, storerooms, breakrooms, and changing rooms; and location of massage tables and chairs;

     7.      The full name, address, and phone number of the legal owner of the property, if other than the applicant on which the massage establishment is to be located, along with a copy of the signed lease and a notarized acknowledgement from the owner of the property that a massage establishment will be located on his or her property; and

     8.      The hours and days of operation.

     B.      The community development director shall issue a certificate of operation upon verification of the following:

     1.      The massage establishment will comply with all applicable laws, including, but not limited to, building, fire, zoning, health and safety regulations, as well as any conditions which have been imposed to comply with such laws; and

     2.      Each person identified as an operator has obtained an operator permit.

     C.      Every massage establishment for which a certificate of operation has been granted pursuant to this chapter shall display the certificate in a conspicuous place so it may be readily seen by persons entering the premises.

     D.      A certificate of operation is not transferable to a separate location of the same business, to a different business at the same location, or to the same business under different ownership at the same location, or the same business under a different name.

     E.      It is the duty of each operator to notify the community development director whenever there is a change in information which was required to be submitted in the application for the certificate of operation in the first instance. Any sale or transfer of any reportable interest of an owner in a massage establishment, which interest would be required to be reported under subsection A of this section in the first instance, shall render the certificate of operation temporarily suspended and subject to revocation in accordance with the provisions of this chapter unless prior to the effective date of such sale or transfer, the new owner applies for and obtains an operator permit.

     F.      Notwithstanding any other provision of this code to the contrary, where a notice of intent to suspend or revoke, or a notice of suspension or revocation, has been issued regarding a massage establishment, or the business has otherwise been required to close because of suspension or revocation proceedings against the operator, the community development director shall not process or issue a new application for a certificate of operation for said location unless or until the revocation or suspension proceedings are dismissed or a final determination is made that the current certificate of operation should not be suspended or revoked, or a two-year period has passed since the occurrence of the activity which gave rise to the suspension or revocation proceedings or other criminal actions.

     G.      Notwithstanding any other provision of this code to the contrary, when a massage establishment has been closed due to criminal activity and such decision is final, no new massage establishment may open in such location and no certificate of operation shall be issued for such location for a period of two years from the date of such final determination. For purposes of this section, closure due to criminal activity includes voluntary closure of the business after there have been arrests at the location or other notices relating to criminal activity or notices relating to suspension or revocation proceedings. This provision is not meant to prohibit the issuance of a certificate of operation to a business which initially failed to obtain a certificate of operation without any prior oral or written notification by the city that such was required.

     H.     Where the applicant for the certificate of operation is not the record owner, as shown on the latest county assessment roll, then upon issuance of the certificate, the city shall send written notice to the property owner advising of the issuance of the certificate and the regulations applicable to the massage establishment and the property pursuant to this chapter; this may be accomplished by including a copy of this chapter with the notice. (Ord. 730 § 1, 2016)

 

5.24.100 Suspension and revocation of permits and certificates.
     A.      Subject to the procedures set forth in this section, the community development director may suspend or revoke a permit issued pursuant to this chapter whenever the community development director determines that any of the following has occurred:

     1.      The permittee, or an employee or independent contractor working on the premises, is conducting operations in a manner contrary to the provisions of this code;

     2.      The permittee, or an employee or independent contractor working on the premises, is conducting operations in a manner which constitutes a public nuisance;

     3.      The permittee, or an employee or independent contractor working on the premises, is conducting operations in a manner which is detrimental to the health, safety or welfare of the city or its inhabitants;

     4.      There is substantial evidence of prostitution or other unlawful activity;

     5.      The permittee, or any employee or independent contractor working on the premises, has engaged in disqualifying conduct; or

     6.      The community development director makes any of the findings that would have justified denying the application in the first instance.

     B.      If, in the discretion of the community development director, an alleged violation is minor and capable of correction, then prior to suspension or revocation a written notice shall be given to the permittee of the alleged violation(s) involved to allow a period of time to correct the alleged violation(s), which period shall not exceed five business days, at the end of which period, an inspection shall be conducted to determine whether the alleged violation(s) has been corrected. For purposes of this section, written notice shall include either a notice of violation or an administrative citation.

     C.      If the community development director determines that an alleged violation is not minor or capable of correction, that an alleged violation(s) continues without correction, or that there have been previous violations of this chapter, even if for different reasons, then the community development director may issue a notice of intent to suspend or revoke, along with an administrative or criminal citation. Examples of a violation which will be determined by the community development director to be not capable of correction include, but are not limited to, substantial evidence of prostitution activity on the massage establishment premises or an immediate threat to public health, safety or welfare.

     D.      Notice of Intent to Suspend or Revoke. A notice of intent to suspend or revoke shall contain a statement of an alleged violation(s) which constitutes the basis for the suspension or revocation, notice of the right of the permittee to respond to the charges in writing to the community development director for a pre-appeal determination, notice of the right to appeal to the city manager, and notice that a failure to respond in the time specified shall constitute a waiver of the right to respond, but not the right to appeal. If an alleged violation is capable of correction, the notice shall also advise the permittee to correct the alleged violation(s) within the time to respond.

     E.      Response to Notice of Intent/Pre-Appeal Determination.

     1.      The time to respond and request a pre-appeal determination shall be five business days from the date of service of the notice, regardless of whether the materials upon which the notice of intent is based are provided to the permittee at that time.

     2.      If there is no response, the permit shall be considered suspended or revoked upon the expiration of time in which to respond and request a pre-appeal hearing.

     3.      If there is a response, the permit shall remain in effect until a determination is made by the community development director. In no event shall the community development director hold a hearing until at least five business days have passed from the time the city provides the materials upon which the notice of intent is issued to the permittee.

     F.      Suspension or Revocation.

     1.      If, after consideration of the permittee’s response, the community development director determines that the notice of intent to suspend or revoke should be upheld, then the community development director shall issue a notice of suspension or revocation and serve it upon the permittee as well as any other interested person requesting a copy of the same. Where all massage activity is required to cease, notice shall also be served on the owner of the property if different from the operator or certificate holder. The notice shall include information about the right to appeal.

     a.      Upon issuance of a notice of suspension or revocation of a certificate of operation, all massage activity at the massage establishment shall cease and no activity for which the certificate of operation is required shall be conducted while any appeal may be pending.

     b.      Upon issuance of a notice of suspension or revocation of an operator permit, the operator must cease all work at the massage establishment. If there is no other person who has an operator permit which is not the subject of a suspension or revocation proceeding, then all massage activity at the massage establishment shall also cease and no massage activity shall be conducted while any appeal may be pending.

     G.      Surrender of Certificate of Operation and Permits. Any permittee shall immediately surrender his or her permit or certificate to the community development director upon its suspension or revocation. The operator shall immediately surrender the certificate of operation upon revocation of an operator permit if there is no other permitted operator. (Ord. 730 § 1, 2016)

 

5.24.110 Appeals to city manager.
     A.      Appeals.

     1.      Appeals shall be in writing and filed with the city clerk within the following time frames:

     a.      Appeals from any decision of the community development director to deny a permit shall be in writing, shall clearly state the applicable basis for the appeal, and shall be filed not later than ten calendar days following the giving of the notice of denial.

     b.      Appeals from a notice of intent to suspend or revoke a permit where no response is filed in accordance with Section 5.24.100(E) shall be filed not later than ten calendar days following the expiration of the response period.

     c.       Appeals from a notice of suspension or revocation issued after a response is filed in accordance with Section 5.24.100(E) shall be filed not later than ten calendar days following the giving of the notice of suspension or revocation.

     2.      The city clerk shall not accept an appeal from a decision of the community development director, and no hearing shall be held, unless the appellant has paid a filing fee, in an amount set by resolution of the city council, to defray the cost of such appeal. Any appeal without the timely payment of fees shall be considered to be untimely.

     3.      The scope of the appeal hearing pursuant to this section shall be limited to those issues raised by the appellant in the written appeal, as submitted pursuant to subsection (A)(1) of this section.

     B.      City Manager Action.

     1.      Upon receipt of a timely filed appeal, the city clerk shall set the matter for hearing before the city manager. The hearing shall be held not fewer than ten calendar days nor more than thirty calendar days from the date of the appeal request. The hearing may be continued from time to time upon the mutual consent of the parties. For the purposes of this section, “city manager” may include a hearing officer appointed by the city manager, who shall then act in the city manager’s place.

     2.      The appellant shall be provided with notice of the time and place of the appeal hearing, as well as a copy of all relevant materials at least seven calendar days prior to the hearing.

     a.      The city manager shall permit any interested person to present any relevant evidence bearing on the issues involved in the matter.

     b.      In conducting the hearing, technical rules relating to evidence and witnesses shall not apply. Any relevant evidence may be admitted if it is material and if it is evidence customarily relied upon by responsible persons in the conduct of their affairs regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule which might make admission of such evidence improper over objection in civil actions. Hearsay evidence may be admissible if it is the sort upon which reasonable persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs. The rules of privilege shall be applicable to the extent they are now, or are hereafter permitted in civil actions. Irrelevant, collateral, and repetitious testimony shall be excluded.

     c.       In determining whether a person should be disqualified for meeting the definition of person who has engaged in disqualifying conduct as set forth in Section 5.24.020, the city manager may consider: the nature and severity of the act(s) or crime(s); whether there were any additional subsequent act(s) or crime(s); the number of act(s) or crime(s); and how recent the act(s) or crime(s) were.

     4.      The appellant shall have the burden of proving that he or she meets the requirements for issuing the permit or certificate in the first instance; the city shall have the burden in proving that grounds exist for revoking or failing to renew a permit.

     5.      Based upon the evidence presented at the hearing, the city manager shall determine whether the decision should be affirmed, modified or reversed.

     6.      The city manager’s decision shall be communicated in writing to the appellant within ten working days after the close of the hearing and submission of the matter to the city manager for decision. The city manager’s decision shall state whether the decision is affirmed, modified or reversed and shall state the reasons therefor.

     7.      The decision of the city manager shall include notice that the decision is final and conclusive, that judicial review may be sought therefrom pursuant to California Civil Procedure Code Section 1094.5, and that any action filed in the superior court shall be filed within ninety days following the city manager’s notice pursuant to California Civil Procedure Code Section 1094.6. (Ord. 730 § 1, 2016)

All notices required to be given pursuant to this chapter shall be served on the responsible party (i.e., permittee, applicant, appellant, or a representative thereof) either by personal delivery or by deposit in the United States mail in a sealed envelope postage prepaid addressed to such responsible party as the name and address appear in the most recent application on file with the city. Service by mail shall be deemed to have been completed on the date deposited in the mail. Notices shall include information regarding appeal rights and a statement that the failure to file an appeal shall constitute a failure to exhaust administrative remedies.

     B.      In all cases where the certificate holder is not the property owner, notices shall also be sent to the property owner of record where the notice relates to possible closure of the business due to suspension or revocation. (Ord. 730 § 1, 2016)

The lighting shall be shown on the required sketch or diagram of the premises.

     D.

     6.      The floors, seats, walls and other interior portions of all video booths shall be maintained clean and free from waste and bodily secretions.

This provision may not be complied with by applying an opaque covering simulating the appearance of the specified anatomical part required to be covered.

     L.      Adult-oriented businesses shall employ security guards in order to maintain the public peace and safety, based upon the following standards:

     3.      Security guard(s) shall be charged with preventing violations of law and enforcing compliance by patrons of the requirements of these regulations.

Primary tank filling operations of underground storage tanks containing motor vehicle fuels which are visually monitored and controlled by a facility operator satisfy the requirements of the subsection;

     D.      Different substances that in combination may cause a fire or explosion, or the production of flammable, toxic, or poisonous gas, or the deterioration of a primary or secondary container, shall be separated in both the primary and secondary containment so as to avoid potential intermixing;

     E.      If water could enter into the secondary containment by precipitation or infiltration, the facility shall contain a means of removing the water by the owner or operator. This removal system shall also provide for a means of analyzing the removed water for hazardous substance contamination and a means of disposing of the water, if so contaminated at an authorized disposal facility. (Ord. 314 § 1, 1983)

 

8.06.090 Monitoring devices.
     For every underground storage tank installed on or before January 1, 1984, and used for the storage of hazardous substances, the following actions shall be taken:

     A.      On or before January 1, 1985, the owner shall outfit the facility with a monitoring system capable of detecting unauthorized releases of any hazardous substances stored in the facility, and thereafter, the operator shall monitor each facility, based on materials stored and the type of monitoring installed;

     B.      Provide a means for visual inspection of the tank, wherever practical, for the purpose of the monitoring required by subsection A of this section. Alternative methods of monitoring the tank on a monthly, or more frequent basis, may be required by the city manager, consistent with the regulations of the board. The alternative monitoring methods include, but are not limited to, the following methods:

     1.      Pressure testing, vacuum testing or hydrostatic testing of the piping systems or underground storage tanks,

     2.      A groundwater monitoring well or wells which are down gradient and adjacent to the underground storage tank, vapor analysis within a well where appropriate, and analysis of soil borings at the time of initial installation of the well. The city manager, or any other public agency specified by the city manager, shall approve the location and number of wells, the depth of wells and the sampling frequency, pursuant to these regulations.

     3.      For monitoring tanks containing motor vehicle fuels daily gauging and inventory reconciliation by the operator, if inventory records are kept on file for one year and are reviewed quarterly, the tank is tested for tightness hydrostatically or, when appropriate with pressure between three and five pounds, inclusive per square inch at time intervals specified by the board and whenever any pressurized system has a leak detection device to monitor for leaks in the piping. The tank shall also be tested for tightness hydrostatically or where appropriate, with pressure between three and five pounds, inclusive, per square inch whenever there is a shortage greater than the amount which the board shall specify by regulation. (Ord. 314 § 1, 1983)

 

8.06.100 Records and reporting.
     A.      The operator of the underground storage facility shall monitor the facility using the method specified on the permit for the facility. Records shall be kept in sufficient detail to enable the city manager to determine that the operator has undertaken all monitoring activities required by the permit to operate.

     B.      If the operator is not the owner, the owner shall provide a copy of the permit to the operator, enter into a written contract with the operator which requires the operator to monitor the tank as set forth in the permit, and provide the operator with a copy of Section 25287 of California Health and Safety Code, or a summary of this section, in the form which the board specifies by regulation. The owner shall notify the city manager of any change of operator.

     C.      Any unauthorized release from the primary containment which the operator is able to clean up within eight hours, and which does not escape from the secondary containment, does not increase the hazard of fire or explosion and does not cause any deterioration of the secondary containment of the underground storage tank, shall be recorded on the operator’s monitoring reports.

     D.      Any unauthorized release which escapes from the secondary containment, increases the hazard of fire or explosion, or causes any deterioration of the secondary containment of the underground tank shall be reported by the operator to the city manager within twenty-four hours after the release has been detected or should have been detected. A full written report shall be transmitted by the owner or operator of the underground storage tanks within five working days of the occurrence of the release.

     E.      The reporting requirements imposed by this section are in addition to any requirements which may be imposed by Section 13271 of the California Water Code. (Ord. 314 § 11, 1983)

 

8.06.110 Modifying or terminating permits.
     The city manager shall review the permit whenever there has been an unauthorized release or when it determines that the underground storage tank is unsafe. The city manager may modify or terminate the permit. In determining whether to modify or terminate the permit, the city manager shall consider the age of the tank, the methods of containment, the methods of monitoring, the feasibility of any required repairs, the concentration of the hazardous substances stored in the tank, the severity of potential unauthorized releases, and the suitability of any other long-term preventive measures which would meet the requirements of this chapter. (Ord. 314 § 1, 1983)

Upon such a request, the inside of such unit shall not be subject to the smoking restrictions of this section while such tenant(s) continuously occupy(ies) the unit. If such tenant(s) subsequently relocates from that unit to another unit within the same multi-unit residence, both such units shall thereafter be subject to the smoking restrictions of this section unless either is designated as a smoking unit as permitted by subsection A of this section. A multi-unit residence shall be considered “new” for purposes of this section if a certificate of occupancy for any unit is first issued by the city after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter.

     C.      By December 1, 2008, each landlord of a multifamily residence in the city shall report, in writing, to the city manager, the number and locations of: (1) designated nonsmoking units in the multifamily residence, (2) any unit in the multifamily residence which is designated as a grand-fathered unit under subsection B of this section, (3) designated smoking units in the multifamily residence, and (4) the location of any smoking area designated pursuant to Section 8.12.051(B) of this chapter. Each landlord of a multifamily residence in the city shall make this written report annually thereafter until the multi-unit residence for which the report is made complies with the seventy percent smoke-free requirement of subsection A of this section, exclusive of grand-fathered smoking units under subsection B of this section.

     3.      A clause stating that all lawful occupants of units in the multi-unit residence are third-party beneficiaries of the clauses required by subsections (A)(1) and (A)(2) of this section.

     B.

     C.      A tenant who breaches the smoking regulations included in a lease pursuant to subsection A of this section, or incorporated into a lease by subsection B of this section, or who knowingly allows another person to do so shall be liable to: (1) the landlord; and (2) to any lawful occupant of a unit in the multi-unit residence who is exposed to secondhand smoke as a result of that breach.

     E.      Failure to enforce any smoking regulation of a lease or agreement on one or more occasions shall not constitute a waiver of the lease or agreement provisions

required by this section and shall not prevent future enforcement of any such smoking regulation. (Ord. 677 § 2, 2008)

8.12.200 Commercial organic waste recycling program.
     A.      Purpose. In October of 2014 Governor Brown signed AB 1826 Chesboro (Chapter 727, Statutes of 2014), which requires businesses to recycle their organic waste on and after April 1, 2016, depending on the amount of waste they generate per week. Organic waste means food waste, green waste, landscape and pruning waste, nonhazardous wood waste, and food-soiled paper waste that is mixed in with food waste. This law phases in the mandatory recycling of commercial organics over time, with the minimum threshold of organic waste generation by businesses decreasing over time. This chapter establishes the city of Loma Linda commercial organic waste recycling program.

     B.      Application. The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all businesses as defined in the mandatory organics recycling law, which defines a business as a commercial or public entity (such as a school or hospital) including multifamily residential dwellings (five units or more), that generate a specified amount of organic waste within the city limits (multifamily dwellings are not required to have a food waste diversion program). A business that meets the waste generation threshold shall engage in one of the following organic recycling activities:

     1.      Source separate organic waste from other waste and participate in a waste recycling service provided through the city’s waste hauler that includes collection and recycling of organic waste.

     2.      Recycle its organic waste on site, or self-haul its organic waste off site for recycling.

     3.      Subscribe to an organic waste recycling service that may include mixed waste processing that specifically recycles organic waste.

     Businesses may be required to show proof of compliance.

     C.      Implementation Schedule. The implementation schedule is as follows:

     1.      April 1, 2016. Businesses that generate eight cubic yards of organic waste per week shall arrange for organic waste recycling services.

     2.      January 1, 2017. Businesses that generate four cubic yards of organic waste per week shall arrange for organic waste recycling services.

     3.      January 1, 2019. Businesses that generate four cubic yards or more of commercial solid waste per week shall arrange for organic waste recycling services.

     4.      Summer/Fall 2021. If CalRecycle determines that the statewide disposal of organic waste in 2020 has not been reduced by fifty percent of the level of disposal during 2014, the organic recycling requirements on businesses will expand to cover businesses that generate two cubic yards or more of commercial solid waste per week. Additionally certain exemptions may no longer be available if this target is not met.

     D.      Exemptions. On a case-by-case basis, individual businesses may be exempt from the organic waste recycling requirements. Exemptions may include, but are not limited to, the following:

     1.      Lack of sufficient space in multifamily complexes or businesses to provide additional organic material recycling bins.

     2.      The current implementation by a business of actions that result in the recycling of a significant portion of its organic waste.

     3.      Limited-term exemptions for extraordinary and unforeseen events.

     E.      Enforcement. It will be the responsibility of the waste hauler to implement and enforce this program.

     1.      Contractor shall provide commercial organic waste collection services for commercial customers in the city generating eight cubic yards or more of organic waste per week. Contractor shall provide appropriate containers to commercial customers and provide weekly collection for such commercial organic waste containers. Contractor will deliver the collected organic waste to a composting or processing facility approved by the city for composting, anaerobic digestion, use as animal feedstock or other means of diversion accepted by CalRecycle, depending on the reasonable availability of a composting or processing facility and as permitted by applicable law.

     2.      Collection of all associated fees shall be subject to all provisions under the current franchise agreement with the waste hauler, and as outlined in the most recently adopted waste hauler fee schedule.

     F.      Incompatible Provisions. To the extent any provision of this chapter is incompatible with or at variance with any prior adopted ordinance or resolution, the provisions of this chapter shall take precedence, and all prior ordinances and resolutions shall be interpreted to harmonize with and not change the provisions of this chapter.

     G.      Severability. If any provision, section, subsection, sentence, clause or phrase of this chapter, or the application of same to any person or set of circumstances is held to be unconstitutional, void, or invalid, such decision shall not affect the remaining portions of this chapter which shall remain in full force and effect, and all provisions of this chapter are declared to be severable for that purpose. (Ord. 746 § 1, 2018)

 

8.12.210 General penalty.

Chapter 9.14 GRAFFITI
9.14.010 Declaration of graffiti as a public nuisance.
     Graffiti or other inscribed material on public and private property is a blighting factor which not only depreciates the value of the property which has been the target of such vandalism but depreciates the value of the adjacent and surrounding properties, and in so doing has a negative impact on the entire city. The council finds and determines that the graffiti is obnoxious and a public nuisance unless it and other inscribed materials are removed from public and private property, they tend to remain. Other properties then become the target of graffiti with the result that entire neighborhoods are affected and the entire community depreciates in value and becomes a less desirable place in which to be. (Ord. 463 § 1, 1992)

 

9.14.020 Graffiti defined.
     “Graffiti or other inscribed material” includes any unauthorized inscription, word, figure, or design that is marked, etched, scratched, drawn, sprayed, or painted on any structural component or any building, structure, or other facility regardless of the nature of the material of that structure or component. (Ord. 463 § 1, 1992)

 

9.14.030 Graffiti prohibited.
     It is unlawful for any person to apply graffiti or inscribing material on public or privately owned real property within the city of Loma Linda. (Ord. 463 § 1, 1992)

 

9.14.040 Authorization to remove graffiti from both public and private property.
     Whenever the city manager determines that graffiti or other inscribed material is so located on public or privately owned, structures on public or privately owned real property within the city so as to be capable of being viewed from adjacent property or by a person utilizing any public right-of-way in the city, the city manager is authorized to provide for the removal of the graffiti or other inscribed material upon the following conditions:

     A.      In removing the graffiti or other inscribed material, the painting or repair of a more extensive area shall not be authorized.

     B.      Where a structure is owned by a public entity other than the city, the removal of the graffiti or other inscribed material may be authorized only after securing the consent of the public entity having jurisdiction over the structure and such entity executes a release and waiver approved as a form by the city attorney.

     C.      Where a structure is privately owned, the removal of the graffiti or other inscribed material may be authorized only after securing the consent of the owner and the owner execute a release and waiver approved as to form by the city attorney. (Ord. 463 § 1, 1992)

 

9.14.050 Alternative procedures available.
     The city may utilize the abatement process set forth in Chapter 9.12 of the Loma Linda Municipal Code, upon the determination of the city manager. (Ord. 463 § 1, 1992)

     The city council may by resolution offer and pay a reward for information leading to the determination and identify of, and the apprehension and conviction of any person affixing graffiti or other inscribed material as defined in Section 9.14.020. Any person who has damaged property by inscribing thereon graffiti or other inscribed material shall be liable for the amount of any reward paid pursuant to this chapter and Section 53069.5 of the California Government Code, and if he or she is an unemancipated minor, his or her parent or guardian shall be liable for that amount.

9.14.070 Vandalism damages.
     The city manager is authorized to inform any court finding any person guilty of the act of vandalism as defined in Section 594 of the California Penal Code that the city has an ordinance wherein the city council has authorized the city manager or his or her agent to clean

up and repair the property damaged by the act of vandalism and the cost to the city of doing that cleanup and repair and to further request that the court order the person convicted of the vandalism to pay the city for said cost to repair pursuant to Section 594 of the California Penal Code. (Ord. 463 § 1, 1992)

 

9.14.080 Penalties.
     If any person shall violate any of the provisions of this chapter, or fail to comply with any of the mandatory requirements of this chapter, he or she shall be guilty of an infraction. Any person convicted of an infraction under the provisions of a city ordinance shall be punishable pursuant to Chapter 1.12 of the Municipal Code as amended. (Ord. 463 § 1, 1992)

Chapter 9.16 ABANDONED ORCHARDS
9.16.010 Purpose.
     The city council finds that neglected, or abandoned orchards within the city are places where the trees constitute a fire hazard, are places where vagrants or dissolute persons can dwell, are places which constitute ugly and unsightly conditions which adversely affect neighboring property, are places from which agricultural pests develop and spread, and that such orchards are public nuisances. (Ord. 285 § 3, 1982)

     C.      “Neglected or abandoned” means an orchard or part of an orchard, the trees of which being in such a condition that the limbs are moribund and the leaves or branches of which are dead, and that the individual in charge of same is not taking such ordinary care of the orchard as may be required for a harvested orchard and is not watering or discing or spraying such trees, all for a period of at least six months, which period of time need not be continuous. (Ord. 285 § 3, 1982)

 

9.16.030 Neglected or abandoned orchards.
     No orchard shall be permitted to be neglected or abandoned within the city. (Ord. 285 § 3, 1982)

     Within fourteen calendar days of sending the notice hereof, the owner or person in charge of, or in possession of, the orchard may appeal the director’s determination in accordance with Section 2.08.030 of this code. (Ord. 285 § 3, 1982)

     Unless otherwise determined as provided in Section 9.16.050, the orchard in question shall be brought into conformance with this chapter, by removal of all neglected or abandoned trees within forty-five calendar days after the sending of written notice as provided above. If there is no compliance within that period of time, the owner or any other person in charge of, or in possession of, said orchard, who shall have received notice hereof, shall be guilty of an infraction. Each period of one week thereafter, during which time the orchard is not in compliance with this chapter, shall constitute a separate infraction. (Ord. 285 § 3, 1982)

The compliance shall be achieved, as reasonably and as economically as possible, as per the discretion of the director. The cost of such compliance shall be computed and a bill for such cost shall be mailed to the record owner of such orchard. Such cost shall constitute a debt due and owing to the city from such owner. If such cost is not paid within thirty-five calendar days after the bill for such is mailed to the record owner, such cost shall be collected pursuant to procedures for public nuisances. (Ord. 285 § 3, 1982)

Chapter 9.20 NOISE REGULATIONS
9.20.010 Purpose.
     The purpose of this chapter is to protect the public, health, and welfare by providing an acceptable noise environment for existing and future residents within the city. The city seeks to accomplish this by establishing the following:

     A.      A community noise standard that specifies acceptable limits of noise for various land uses and activities;

     B.      Measures to minimize noise impacts from transportation-related noise sources;

The A-weighting filter de-emphasizes the very low and very high frequency components of the sound in a manner similar to the response of the human hearing system and provides good correlation with subjective reactions to noise.

     B.      “Community noise equivalent level (CNEL)” means the average equivalent A-weighted sound level during a twenty-four-hour day, obtained after the addition of five decibels to sound levels occurring during the evening from seven p.m. to ten p.m. and addition of ten decibels to sound levels occurring during the night from ten p.m. to seven a.m. The five and ten decibel penalties are applied to account for increased noise sensitivity during the evening and nighttime hours. The CNEL is not measured, but is computed.

     C.      “Cumulative time period” means an additive period of time composed of individual time segments which may be continuous or interrupted.

     D.      “Day-night average level (Ldn)” means the average equivalent A-weighted sound level during a twenty four-hour day obtained after the addition of ten decibels to sound levels occurring during the nighttime from ten p.m. to seven a.m. The ten-decibel penalty is applied to account for increased noise sensitivity during the nighttime hours. The Ldn represents the daily energy noise exposure averaged on an annual basis.

     E.      “Hearing board” means the board appointed by city council as arbitrators of the Loma Linda Municipal Code to review and determine violations, nuisances, abatement procedures, and penalties of this chapter.

     F.      “Motor-driven vehicle” shall includes but is not limited to, any automobile, truck, van, bus, motorcycle, mini-bike, go-cart or other self-propelled vehicle, on or off road.

     G.      “Noise” means any sound that exceeds the limitations set herein.

     H.     “Noise level” means the A-weighted sound pressure level in decibels audible to humans obtained by using a sound level meter. The unit of noise level measurement shall be designated as dB(A).

     I.       “Person” means a person, firm, association, co-partnership, joint venture, corporation, or any entity, public or private in nature.

     J.       “Residential property” (zoned R-1 - R-3 including uses within the institutional zone) means a parcel of real property which is developed and used either in part or in whole for residential purposes, other than transient uses such as hotels and motels.

     K.      “Simple tone noise” means a noise characterized by a predominant frequency, or frequencies so that other frequencies cannot be readily distinguished. (Ord. 481 § 1, 1992)

 

9.20.030 Excessive noise—Unlawful.
     A.      It is unlawful for any person at any location to create any noise, or to allow the creation of any noise when such noise causes the noise level to exceed any noise level as specified in Section 9.20.040.

     B.      Furthermore, notwithstanding any specified noise level, it is also unlawful for any person to make or continue, or cause to be made or continued, any loud, unnecessary, or unusual noise which disturbs the peace or quiet of any neighborhood or which causes discomfort, or annoyance to any reasonable person residing in the area, and it shall be unlawful for any person in ownership, or control of any premises to knowingly permit a violation of this section upon said premises. (Ord. 481 § 1, 1992)

 

9.20.040 Land use compatibility for community noise environments.
     These standards are established guidelines from the Loma Linda general plan that provide a decibel range for the city manager, or designee to follow and help determine what type of noises are nuisances and are unacceptable to the community. This determination will be on a case by case basis at the discretion of the city manager.

 

     PERFORMANCE STANDARDS:

 

 

     Normally acceptable: Specified land use activities that are satisfactory, based upon the assumption that any land use or building involved are of ordinary performance standards.

 

     Conditionally Acceptable: Activities or Actions shall be undertaken only after a detailed analysis of the noise reduction (muffling) requirements is made and noise reduction insulation features are included as a preventive measure.

9.20.060 Noise level measurement criteria.
     A.      Any noise level measurement, made pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, shall be determined by using a sound level meter that meets the minimum requirements of the American National Standard Institute for sound level meters, or by using an equivalent instrument with associated recording and analyzing equipment that provides equivalent data.

     B.      Noise readings shall be taken at the receptor’s/ generator’s property line and the receptor’s building setbacks to verify noise levels as categorized in Section 9.20.040 of this chapter.

     C.      The factors which shall be considered in determining whether a violation of the provisions of Section 9.20.050 exists shall include, but not be limited to, the following:

     1.      The sound level of the objectionable noise;

     2.      The sound level of the ambient noise;

     3.      The proximity of the noise to residential bedroom facilities;

     4.      The nature and zoning of the area within which the noise emanates;

     5.      The number of persons affected by the noise source;

     6.      The duration of the noise and its tonal, informational, or musical content;

     7.      Whether the noise is continuous, recurrent, or intermittent;

     8.      Whether the noise is produced by a commercial or noncommercial activity.

     D.      These factors shall be considered in addition to the noise levels set forth in Section 9.20.040 in determining a violation. Noises do not necessarily need to exceed those noise level limits to be considered unnecessary, or unusual so as to cause hearing loss, speech interference, sleep interference, physiological responses, or annoyance to persons in the area. This shall be determined by the city manager, or his designee on a case by case basis. (Ord. 481 § 1, 1992)

 

9.20.070 Temporary permit procedures.
     A.      The owner or operator of a noise source which violates, or potentially violates any of the provisions of this chapter may file an application with the city manager for a temporary noise waiver from the provisions of Sections 9.20.030 and 9.20.050. The property owner, lessee, or operator shall set forth all actions taken to comply with such provisions, the reasons why immediate compliance cannot be achieved, a proposed method of achieving compliance, and a proposed time schedule for its accomplishment. The application shall be accompanied by a fee set forth by resolution of the city council.

     B.      A separate application shall be filed for each noise source; provided, however, that several mobile sources under common supervision, or several fixed sources on a single property, may be combined into one application. Upon receipt of the application and fee, the city manager shall refer to it with his/her recommendation within thirty days to the hearing board for action in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. Copies of all applications for variances and other notices shall be sent to the city.

     C.      Developers that are involved with building construction and subdivision grading may exceed maximum noise levels between the hours of seven a.m. and eight p.m., Monday through Friday, provided that all equipment is properly equipped with standard noise muffling apparatus specifically for such equipment (i.e., exhaust mufflers). Heavy construction is not permitted on weekends, or national holidays.

     D.      No provision contained herein exempts any individual from complying with stricter noise standards imposed as condition(s) of development approvals such as subdivision and conditional use permits and similar approvals by the city. (Ord. 481 § 1, 1992)

 

9.20.080 Violation—Public nuisance.

     1.      To provide reasonable available and convenient parking for the benefit of the adjacent residents;

Each permit issued pursuant to this chapter shall be subject to all the conditions and restrictions set forth in this title and of the permit parking zone for which it was issued, including conditions or restrictions which may be altered or amended from time to time.

     Upon request by the owner of the vehicle or the owner of the land received by the director within ten calendar days after the mailing of the notices of intention to abate and remove, a public hearing shall be held by the director on the question of abatement and removal of the vehicle, or parts thereof, as an abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicle, and the assessment of the administrative costs and the cost of removal of the vehicle, or parts of a vehicle, against the property on which it is located.

     If the owner of the land submits a sworn statement, in writing, denying responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on his land within such ten-day period, said statement shall be construed as a request for a hearing which does not require his presence. Notice of the hearing shall be mailed, by registered/certified mail, at least ten calendar days prior to the date of the hearing to the owner of the land and to the owner of the vehicle, unless the vehicle is in such condition that identification numbers are not available to determine ownership. If such a request for hearing is not received within said ten calendar days after mailing of the notice of intention to abate and remove, the city shall have the authority to abate and remove the vehicle or parts thereof as a public nuisance without holding a public hearing.

The owner of the land may appear in person at the hearing or present a sworn statement, in writing, in time for consideration at the hearing, and deny responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on the land, with his reasons for such denial.

     The director may impose such conditions and take such other action as he deems appropriate under the circumstances to carry out the purpose of this chapter.

The order requiring removal shall include a description of the vehicle or parts thereof and the correct identification number and license number of the vehicle if available at the site.

     If it is determined at the hearing that the vehicle was placed on the land without the consent of the owner of the land and that he has not subsequently acquiesced in its presence, the director shall not assess the costs of administration or removal of the vehicle against the property upon which the vehicle is located or otherwise attempt to collect such costs from such owner of the land.

     If the owner of the land submits a sworn statement denying responsibility for the presence of the vehicle on his land but does not appear or if an interested party makes a written presentation to the director but does not appear, he shall be notified in writing of the decision.

Chapter 10.42 INTERSTATE TRUCK TERMINALS
10.42.010 Intent and purposes.
     It is the intent and purpose of the ordinance codified in this chapter to provide for the public necessity, health, safety or general welfare through the establishment of procedures for terminal designation and truck route designation to terminals for interstate trucks.

     Since STAA 1982 and AB 866 revised current state law on truck combinations’ length and width and implements federal requirements dealing with access to the federally designated system by interstate trucks, it is required that the city enact an ordinance delineating the process of application for terminal and route designation within the bounds of the city limits by citizens/business establishments requiring the service of said interstate trucks off said federally designated system (i.e., I-10 and I-215). (Ord. 327 § 1, 1984)

 

10.42.020 Definitions.
“Terminal” and “interstate truck” as used in this chapter shall be defined as follows:

     A.      “Interstate truck” means tractor semis or doubles with unlimited length as regulated by CVC 35401.5 (a) (1) and (2).

     B.      “Terminal” means a facility at which freight is consolidated to be shipped or where full load consignments may be loaded and off loaded or at which the vehicles are regularly maintained, stored or manufactured. (Ord. 327 § 3, 1984)

 

10.42.030 Application process.
     A.      Those persons qualifying as a “terminal” as defined in Section 10.42.040 of this chapter and requiring terminal access from federally designated highways, shall submit an application and appropriate fee to the City Manager, City Hall, 11128 Anderson Street, Loma Linda, California. Said application is Attachment “A” to the ordinance codified in this chapter.

     B.      Upon receipt of the application, the city manager or his designated representative will determine the applicant’s conformance with the “terminal” designation and if so approved, will then determine the capability of the route requested and/or alternate routes. Capability will be determined by the adequate turning radii and land widths of ramps, intersections and highways. Also a determinant factor will be general traffic conditions such as sight distance, speed and traffic volumes for safe operation. Access off the federally designated highways will require Cal Trans (District 08) approval.

     C.      If the requested route passes through several jurisdictions (i.e., county or other municipality), applicant shall comply with that jurisdiction’s application process. Coordination will be the responsibility of the entity which controls the terminal’s land use. (Ord. 327 § 2, 1984)

     A.      Fees/costs for the application of a terminal designation. Application fee is to cover the cost of reviewing route(s) and terminal designation and to be established by city council resolution. The application fee is nonrefundable.

     B.      If the application for a terminal designation is approved, the applicant will be required to pay for the purchase and installation of terminal access signs and trailblazer signs. Trailblazer signs will be required at every decision point on the route to the terminal. Said costs to be determined by the office of the city manager of the city. (Ord. 327 § 4, 1984)

 

10.42.050 Revocation of route.
     The city manager is authorized to revoke any approved route if said route proves to be a safety hazard for any vehicular traffic. A safety hazard is defined as inability of the interstate trucks to negotiate route and/or said trucks causing unsafe driving conditions for other vehicular traffic and/or pedestrians. (Ord. 327 § 5, 1984)

 

10.42.060 Appeals process.
     A.      If the office of the city manager denies terminal designation and/or route feasibility or revokes a previously approved route per Section 10.42.050 of this chapter, the applicant/terminal owner, within ten days following the date of a decision of the city manager on a revocation of terminal access or terminal designation may appeal said decision to the city council. An appeal shall be made on a form prescribed by the city manager and shall be filed with the city clerk. The appeal shall state specifically wherein there was an error or abuse of discretion by the city manager or wherein its decision is not supported by the evidence in the record. Within five days of the filing of an appeal, the city manager shall transmit to the city

     clerk the terminal application, the sketches of the revoked route and all other data filed therewith, the report of the city manager or his designated representative, the findings of the city manager and his decision on the application.

     B.      The city clerk shall give notice to the applicant and to the appellant (if the applicant is not the appellant) and may give notice to any other interested party of the time when the appeal will be considered by the city council.

     C.      If Cal Trans (District 08) and not the city manager denies or revokes terminal access from federally designated highways, no appeal may be made to the city council, but must be made to said Cal Trans (District 10). (Ord. 327 § 6, 1984)

 

10.42.070 Retrofitting ramps, intersections and roadways.
     If all feasible routes to a requested terminal are deemed unsatisfactory by the office of the city manager, the applicant may request retrofitting the deficiencies, but all costs of engineering, construction and inspection will be borne by the applicant. (Ord. 327 § 7, 1984)

     D.      All extensions of mains, fire hydrants, laterals and connections provided for in accordance with this chapter and approved by the city council shall by agreement become and remain the property of the city. When a contractor or subdivider installs water mains, fire hydrants, laterals and connections in any subdivisions at his own expense, but under the supervision of the utility services division (water), such installations, upon completion and before water service is provided shall be transferred to the ownership of the city by appropriate grant deed and bill of sale.

     E.      No dead-end lines shall be permitted, except with the approval of the utility services superintendent, and in cases where circulation lines are necessary they shall be designed and approved by the utility services division (water) in advance of installation before becoming a part of the city system.

     F.      The city will provide all main pipe line extensions in existing streets to properties along dedicated roads and streets upon application for water service and if in their opinion such water service is economically feasible and to the advantage of the city system in serving the requirements of the area. The cost of such extension of water mains shall be at the expense of the applicant or group of applicants to be shared by them. If an applicant could be served adequately by a certain size pipe line to provide for future expansion of water services in the area, the city may agree to share the cost of the pipe lines on terms agreeable to both parties concerned. In the event that a larger pipe line is installed at partial cost to the city, the city may require future water users in the area who apply for new connections to reimburse the utility services division (water) for such main line extension cost until the full amount of the cost has been recovered.

     G.      If the property owners or subdividers initiating the pipe line extension are required to defray the entire cost of any main line extension under these regulations, and they wish to put up the entire cost of the project, the city may agree to reimburse such property owners or subdividers over a period of years by requiring all new connections in that area to pay a proportionate amount of the cost to the city, which money shall then be paid to the original investors until the full amount has been paid.

Chapter 13.24 DRAINAGE PLAN
13.24.010 Findings.
     The city is seriously affected by surface and storm-waters and the continual development of property within the city has placed a serious demand on the existing facilities to handle surface and stormwaters. In order to plan and develop drainage facilities for the removal of surface and stormwaters and to provide for an equitable manner for the apportionment of the cost of the development of such facilities, the city council has determined that a drainage plan must be adopted and a drainage fee established to acquire funds to be used for the construction of the facilities described in the drainage plan. (Ord. 77 § 1, 1973)

 

13.24.020 Drainage plan adopted.
     The drainage plan for the city entitled “Existing Master Plan Storm Drains” and dated December, 1975, on file with the city clerk is found and declared to be the drainage plan of the city of Loma Linda. (Ord. 137 § 1, 1976: Ord. 77 § 2, 1973)

 

13.24.030 Fee—Payment required—Basis.
     As a condition of approval of a final subdivision map or parcel map for a division of land not defined as a subdivision or the issuance of a building permit, the city shall require the payment of a fee as shall hereafter be established by resolution of the city council for purposes of defraying the actual or estimated costs of constructing planned drainage facilities for the removal of surface and storm waters from local or neighborhood drainage areas. The costs, whether actual or estimated, shall be based upon a finding by the city council that development of property within the drainage plan area will require construction of the facilities described in the drainage plan, and that the fees are fairly apportioned, either on the basis of benefits conferred on the property in question or on the need for such facilities created by the proposed subdivision or subparcel or development of property. The fee as to any property shall not exceed the pro rata share of the amount of the total actual or estimated costs of all facilities pursuant to the drainage plan which would be assessable on such property if such costs were apportioned on a per-acre basis. (Ord. 77 § 3, 1973)

 

13.24.040 Fee—Deposit—Expenditure.
     The fee required to be paid by this chapter shall be paid into a “planned drainage facilities fund” and shall be expended solely for the construction or reimbursement for the construction of drainage facilities pursuant to the drainage plan or to reimburse the city for the cost of engineering and administrative services to establish, design and construct the plan and facilities. (Ord. 77 § 4, 1973)

 

13.24.050 Land dedication in lieu of fee authorized when.
     The city council may, where it finds that land is necessary for park and recreational purposes, accept the dedication of land in lieu of the payment of drainage fees. The value of the land to be dedicated shall be in direct proportion to the amount of any fee that would have been paid. The land so dedicated shall be used only for park and recreational facilities and shall be designed so that it will serve the development from which it was dedicated, and the dedication shall be in accordance with the principals of the parks and recreation element of the general plan. Whether or not the city council shall accept such offer of dedication in lieu of fees shall be solely at their discretion. (Ord. 77 § 5, 1973)

 

13.24.060 Fee—Not required when.
     Drainage fees herein provided shall not be required of any of the following projects: alterations, repairs or remodeling of single-family residences or trainer or mobile home spaces involving a construction valuation of less than a specified amount which shall be established by resolution; building projects having a floor area of less than seven hundred fifty square feet; buildings or additions devoted solely to off-street parking of vehicles; city buildings. (Ord. 243 § 1, 1981: Ord. 77 § 6, 1973)

 

13.24.070 Fee—Credit for prior payment.
     No parcel of land shall be subject to payment of a drainage fee more than once. If any portion of a parcel has previously paid a drainage fee, credit shall be given for such prior payment and the proper apportionment made as a credit toward any fee payment required by this chapter. (Ord. 77 § 7, 1973)

Chapter 13.32 WATER-EFFICIENT LANDSCAPE
13.32.010 Purpose.
     A.      The State Legislature has found that:

     1.      The limited supply of state waters are subject to ever increasing demands;

     2.      California’s economic prosperity depends on adequate supplies of water;

     3.      State Policy promotes conservation and efficient use of water;

     4.      Landscapes provide recreation areas, clean the air and water, prevent erosion, offer fire protection and replace ecosystems displaced by development; and

     5.      Landscape design, installation and maintenance can and should be water efficient.

     B.      Consistent with the legislative findings, the purpose of this chapter is to:

     1.      Promote the values and benefits of landscapes while recognizing the need to invest water and other resources as efficiently as possible;

     2.      Establish a structure for designing, installing and maintaining water-efficient landscapes in new projects; and

     3.      Establish provisions for water management practices and water waste prevention for established landscapes. (Ord. 488 § 1, 1992)

 

13.32.020 Definitions.
     The words used in this chapter have the meaning set forth below:

“Anti-drain valve” or “check valve” means a value located under a sprinkler head to hold water in the system so it minimizes drainage from the lower elevation sprinkler heads.

“Application rate” means the depth of water applied to a given area, usually measured in inches per hour.

“Applied water” means the portion of water supplied by the irrigation system to the landscape.

“As-builts” means a set of reproducible drawings which show significant changes in the work made during construction and which are usually based on drawings marked up in the field and other data furnished by the contractor.

“Automatic controller” means a mechanical or solid state timer, capable of operating valve stations to set the days and length of time of a water application.

“Backflow prevention device” means a safety device used to prevent pollution or contamination of the water supply due to the reverse flow of water from the irrigation system.

“Conversion factor (0.62)” means a number that converts the maximum applied water allowance from acre-inches per acre per year to gallons per square foot per year. The conversion factor is calculated as follows:

 

     (325,829 gallons/43,560 square feet)/12 inches = (0.62)

     325,829 gallons = one acre foot

“Main line” means the pressurized pipeline that delivers water from the water source to the valve or outlet.

“Maximum applied water allowance” means, for design purposes, the upper limit of annual applied water for the established landscaped area. It is based upon the area’s reference evapotranspiration, the ET adjustment factor, and the size of the landscaped area. The estimated applied water use shall not exceed the maximum applied water allowances.

“Mined-land reclamation projects” means any surface mining operation with a reclamation plan approved in accordance with the Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975.

“Mulch” means any material such as leaves, bark, straw or other materials left loose and applied to the soil surface to reduce evaporation.

“Overspray” means the water which is delivered beyond the landscaped area, wetting pavements, walks, structures or other non-landscaped areas.

“Plant factor” means a factor that when multiplied by reference evapotranspiration, estimates the amount of water used by plants. For purposes of this chapter, the average plant factor or low water using plants ranges from 0 to 0.3, for average water using plants the range is 0.4 to 0.6, and for high water using plants the range is 0.7 to 1.0.

“Rain sensing device” means a system which automatically shuts off the irrigation system when it rains.

“Record drawing” or “as-builts” means a set of reproducible drawings which show significant changes in the work made during construction and which are usually based on drawings marked up in the field and other data furnished by the contractor.

“Recycled water,” “reclaimed water,” or “treated sewage effluent water” means treated or recycled waste water of a quality suitable for nonpotable uses such as landscape irrigation; not intended for human consumption.

“Reference evapotranspiration” or “ETo” means a standard measurement of environmental parameters which affect the water use of plants. ETo is given in inches per day, month, or year, and is an estimate of the evapotranspiration of a large field of four-inch to seven-inch tall, cool-season grass that is well watered. Reference evapotranspiration is used as the basis of determining the maximum applied water allowances so that regional differences in climate can be accommodated.

“Rehabilitated landscape” means any re-landscaping project that requires a permit.

“Run off” means water which is not absorbed by the soil or landscape to which it is applied and flows from the area. For example, run off may result from water that is applied at too great a rate (application rate exceeds infiltration rate) or when there is a severe slope.

“Soil moisture sensing device” means a device that measures the amount of water in the soil.

“Soil texture” means the classification of soil based on the percentage of sand, silt, and clay in the soil.

     2.      The Maximum Applied Water Allowance.

     a.      A project’s maximum applied water allowance shall be calculated using the following formula:

 

MAWA

= (ETo) (o.8) (LA) (o.62) where:

MAWA

= Max. applied water allowance (gallons per year)

ETo

= Reference evapotranspiration (inches per year)

0.8

= ET adjustment factor

LA

= Landscaped area (square feet)

0.62

= Conversion factor (to gallons per square foot)

 

     b.      Two example calculations of the maximum applied water allowance

     i.        Project Site One: Landscaped area of 50,000 sq. ft. in Fresno

 

MAWA

= (ETo) (.8) (LA) (.62)

 

= (51 inches) (.8) (50,000 square feet) (.62)

 

Maximum applied water allowance = 1,264,800 gallons per year (or 1,691 hundred-cubic-feet per year: 1,264,800/748 = 1,691)

 

     ii.       Project Site Two: Landscaped area of 50,000 sq. ft. in San Francisco

 

MAWA

= (ETo) (.8) (LA) (.62)

 

= (35 inches) (.8) (50,000 square feet) (.62)

 

Maximum Applied Water Allowance = 868,000 gallons per year (or 1,160 hundred-cubic-feet per year)

 

     c.       Portions of landscaped areas in public and private projects such as parks, playgrounds, sports fields, golf courses, or school yards where turf provides a playing surface or serves other recreational purposes may require water in addition to the maximum applied water allowance. A statement shall be included with the landscape design plan, designating areas to be used for such purposes and specifying any needed amount of additional water above the maximum applied water allowance.

     3.      Estimated Applied Water Use.

     a.      The estimated applied water use shall not exceed the maximum applied water allowance.

     b.      A calculation of the estimated applied water use shall be submitted with the landscape documentation package. It may be calculated by summing the amount of water recommended in the irrigation schedule.

     4.      Estimated Total Water Use.

     a.      A calculation of the estimated total water use shall be submitted with the landscape documentation package. The estimated total water use may be calculated by summing the amount of water recommended in the irrigation schedule and adding any amount of water expected from effective precipitation (not to exceed twenty-five percent of the local annual mean precipitation) or may be calculated from a formula such as the following:

 

     The estimated total water use for the entire landscaped area equals the sum of the estimated water use of all hydrozones in that landscaped area:

 

EWU (hydrozone)

=

(ETo) (PF) (HA) (.62)

     (IE)

EWU (hydrozone)

=

Estimated water use (gallons per year)

ETo

=

Reference evapotranspiration (inches per year)

PF

=

Plant factor

HA

=

Hydrozone area (square feet)

(.62)

=

Conversion factor

IE

=

Irrigation efficiency

 

     b.      If the estimated total water use is greater than the estimated applied water use due to precipitation being included as a source of water, an effective precipitation disclosure statement such as the one in the section entitled “Effective Precipitation” shall be included in the landscape documentation package.

     D.      “Code,” Refers to the current adopted building code as established in Section 15.08.010. (Ord. 757 § 1, 2019; Ord. 193 § 20, 1978)

 

15.04.030 Fees deleted.
     Any and all references to fees in any of the codes adopted in Chapters 15.08, 15.12, 15.16, 15.20 and 15.24 are deleted and referred to the building and safety fee resolution adopted by the city. (Ord. 757 § 1, 2019; Ord. 193 § 21, 1978)

 

15.04.040 Annual permits permitted when.
     A.      Where any person, firm, or corporation in the course of normal maintenance procedures proposes to install, alter or repair any electrical wiring, devices appliances, plumbing, drainage systems, septic tanks, seepage pits, leaching lines, heating, ventilating, refrigeration or water equipment in an existing facility located on property under the direct controls of said person, firm or corporation and is able to, and does in fact, furnish inspection service which meets the requirements and rules and regulations of the city and whose operations are under the continuous supervision of a professional engineer or engineers, duly registered with and licensed by the state, such person, firm, or corporation shall be required only to obtain an annual permit or annual permits.

     B.      The fee for each separate annual permit (electrical, plumbing, mechanical) shall be based on the number of employees doing work in the crafts covered in each annual permit in accordance with the fee ordinances adopted by the city.

     C.      The designated responsible supervising engineer shall file with the building and safety department a written report specifying the work done under the issued annual permit. Such written report shall be filed with the department of building and safely within thirty days following the end of the fiscal year for which the permit was issued. (Ord. 757 § 1, 2019; Ord. 193 § 22, 1978)

 

15.04.050 Enforcement and interpretation duty.
     It shall be the duty of the director of the building and safety department to enforce the provisions of the Code, and to determine the intent and meaning thereof. (Ord. 757 § 1, 2019; Ord. 193 § 23, 1978)

 

15.04.060 Preliminary soil report requirements.
     A.      Subdivision maps shall not be given a final approval until a preliminary soil report prepared by a civil engineer registered by the state has been filed with and approved by the director of building and safety.

     B.      The preliminary soil report shall indicate the presence, if any, of expansive soils or another soil problem, which, if not corrected, would lead to structural defects. If defective soil conditions are indicated, the preliminary report shall include recommendations for corrective measures intended to prevent structural damage to buildings erected on the site. Acceptance and approval of these recommendations shall not preclude the consideration and approval of alternate methods of correction which may be submitted by any other California-registered civil engineer when accompanying a permit application for construction of a specific building or buildings.

     C.      The preliminary soil report shall be based upon test borings or excavations. The number of borings or excavations shall be adequate to determine fully the extent and degree of soil problems, if any, which exist in the proposed subdivision; provided, however, that not less than three such borings or excavations shall be required for each report. If critically defective soil conditions are disclosed by initial borings or excavations, additional borings or excavations shall be made at the probable building location on each lot or parcel within the subdivision. Appropriate notations shall be made upon the subdivision map so as to indicate the location and type of defective soil noted in the preliminary report.

     D.      The director of building and safety shall approve the preliminary soil report:

     1.      If no defective soils are present on the site; or

     2.      If the corrective measures recommended in the report would be likely to prevent structural damage to any buildings constructed on the site.

     E.      The preliminary soil report may be waived when the sole purpose of the subdivision map is to assemble small lots or parcels into larger lots or parcels or to define, adjust or correct property lines of existing subdivisions.

     F.      The issuance of a building permit for the construction of a building on a lot or parcel of land which has been found to have defective soils shall be conditioned to the incorporation of an approved corrective measure intended to prevent structural damage to the building. (Ord. 757 § 1, 2019; Ord. 193 § 24, 1978)

 

15.04.070 Wasting water prohibited.
     Water used as a coolant in any stationary equipment or machinery, or water utilized for heating or cooling in an industrial process, shall not be wasted but shall be recirculated and reused. Every evaporative cooler shall be equipped with a circulating pump. (Ord. 757 § 1, 2019; Ord. 193 § 25, 1978)

 

15.04.080 Penalty fees authorized when.
     Where work for which a permit is required by the codes adopted in this title is started or proceeded with prior to obtaining said permit, the specified fees shall be doubled, or, if said permit is not secured because of willful neglect, the fee required shall be equal to ten percent of the total value of the project or two hundred dollars, whichever is less; but the payment of such penalty fees shall not relieve any persons from fully complying with the requirements of these codes in the execution of the work nor from any other penalties prescribed in this title; provided, however, that this provision shall not apply to emergency work when it shall be proved to the satisfaction of the director of building and safety that such work was urgently necessary and that it was not practical to obtain a permit therefor before commencement of the work. In all such cases a permit must be obtained as soon as it is practical to do so, and if there is an unreasonable delay in obtaining such permit, a double fee as herein provided shall be charged. (Ord. 757 § 1, 2019; Ord. 193 § 26, 1978)

 

15.04.090 Construction.
     In interpreting and applying the provisions of this chapter, they shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of public health, safety, and general welfare. (Ord. 757 § 1, 2019; Ord. 193 § 26, 1978)

 

15.04.100 Public nuisance declared when.
     Any building or structure erected or maintained, or any use of property, contrary to the provisions of this title shall be unlawful and a public nuisance, and the city attorney shall, upon order of the director of building and safety, immediately commence an action or actions, proceeding or proceedings, for the abatement, removal and enjoinment thereof in the manner provided by law and shall take such steps and shall apply to such court or courts as may have jurisdiction to grant such relief as will abate or remove such building, structure, or use, and restrain and enjoin any person from erecting or maintaining such building or structure or using any property contrary to the provisions of this title. It shall be the right and duty of every citizen to participate and assist the city officials in the enforcement of the provisions of this title. (Ord. 757 § 1, 2019; Ord. 193 § 26, 1978)

 

15.04.110 Remedies cumulative.
     All remedies provided for in this chapter shall be cumulative and not exclusive. The conviction and punishment of any person hereunder shall not relieve such person from the responsibility of correcting prohibited conditions or removing prohibited buildings, structures or improvements, nor prevent the enforced correction or removal thereof. (Ord. 757 § 1, 2019; Ord. 193 § 26, 1978)

 

15.04.120 Violation—Penalty.

Chapter 15.58 RECYCLING AND DIVERSION OF CONSTRUCTION AND DEMOLITION (C&D) WASTE
15.58.010 Findings and statement of intent.
     Under California law as embodied in the California Waste Management Act of 1989 (California Public Resources Code Sections 40000 et seq.), the city of Loma Linda is required to prepare, adopt and implement source reduction and recycling plans to reach landfill diversion goals, and is required to make substantial reductions in the volume of waste materials going to the landfills, or face fines up to ten thousand dollars per day.

     In order to meet these goals, it is necessary that the city promote the reduction of solid waste, and reduce the stream of solid waste going to landfills.

     Waste from construction, demolition, and renovation of buildings represents a significant portion of the volume of waste presently coming from the city of Loma Linda and much of this waste is particularly suitable for recycling and reuse.

     The city’s commitment to the reduction of waste requires the establishment of programs for recycling and salvaging of construction and demolition (C&D) waste.

     Certain types of projects are exempt from these requirements.

     The city has previously adopted Council Bill R-2000-18 for the construction and demolition policy and now therefore desires to enact said ordinance to further enhance the recycling of materials within the city. (Ord. 661, 2007)

The applicant shall provide written supporting documentation such as letters of donation, bills of sale or other information with the final submission of the waste management plan results that shall clearly document the final destination of the recovered or salvaged materials, the quantity or items that were recovered or salvaged, and the recipient of those materials.

     H.     Compliance with this chapter shall be listed as a condition of approval on any building or demolition permit issued for a covered project. (Ord. 661, 2007)

 

15.58.060 Waste management plan.
     Prior to starting the project, every applicant shall submit a properly completed “waste management plan” (WMP) to the WMP compliance official, in a form as prescribed by that official, as a portion of the building or demolition permit process. The completed WMP shall contain the following:

     A.      The square footage of the proposed project;

     B.      The estimated weight of project waste to be generated by material type;

     C.      The maximum weight of such materials that can feasibly be diverted via reuse or recycling by material type;

     D.      The vendor(s) that the applicant proposes to use to haul the materials;

     E.      The facility(s) that the materials will be hauled to, and their expected diversion rates by material type;

     F.      Estimated weight of construction and demolition waste that will be disposed.

     Because actual material weights are not available in this stage, estimates are used. In estimating the weight of materials as identified in the WMP, the applicant shall use the standardized conversion rates approved by the city of Loma Linda for this purpose. Approval of the WMP as complete and accurate shall be a condition precedent to the issuance of any building or demolition permit. If the applicant calculates the projected feasible diversion rate as described above, and finds the rate does not meet the diversion goal, the applicant must then submit information supporting the lower diversion rate. If this documentation is not included, the WMP shall be deemed incomplete.

     A.      Approval. No building or demolition permit shall be issued for any covered project unless and until the WMP compliance official has approved the WMP. Approval shall not be required, however, where emergency demolition is required to protect public health or safety. The WMP compliance official shall only approve a WMP if he or she determines that all of the following conditions have been met:

     1.      The WMP provides all of the information set forth in this section.

     2.      The WMP indicates that sixty percent of all C&D waste generated by the project shall be diverted (or new diversion goal set in accordance with the applicant’s approved diversion exemption request); and

     3.      The applicant has submitted an appropriate deposit for the project.

     B.      Nonapproval. If the WMP compliance official determines that the WMP is incomplete or fails to indicate that at least sixty percent (or new diversion goal set in accordance with the applicant’s approved diversion exemption request) of all C&D waste generated by the project will be diverted, he or she shall either:

     1.      Return the WMP to the applicant marked “Disapproved,” including a statement of reasons, and will notify the building department, which shall then immediately stop processing the building or demolition permit application; or

     2.      Return the WMP to the applicant marked “Further Explanation Required.” (Ord. 661, 2007)

 

15.58.070 Performance security required.
     As a condition precedent to the issuance of any permit for construction or demolition for a covered project, the applicant shall post a performance security (cash, letter of credit, performance or surety bond, money order) in the amount of one dollar for each estimated square foot, but not less than fifty dollars. The performance security shall be returned, without interest, in total or prorated, upon proof of satisfaction by the WMP compliance official that no less than the required percentage of construction and demolition material tonnage generated by the covered project has been diverted from disposal and has been recycled or reused or stored for later reuse or recycling. If a lesser percentage of construction and demolition material tonnage than required is diverted, a proportionate share of the performance security shall be returned. The performance security shall be forfeited entirely or to the prorated extent that there is a failure to comply with the requirements of this chapter. The city may, by formal resolution, modify the amount of the required performance security. (Ord. 661, 2007)

 

15.58.080 On-site practices.
     During the term of the covered project, the applicant shall recycle and reuse the required percentage of waste, and shall keep records of the tonnage or other measurements approved by the city that can be converted to tonnage amounts. The WMP compliance official will evaluate and may monitor each covered project to determine the percentage of construction and demolition materials salvaged, recycled or reused from the covered project as well as the tonnage of materials that was subject to disposal. For covered projects including both construction and demolition, diversion of materials shall be tracked and measured separately. To the maximum extent feasible, project waste shall be separated on-site if this practice increases diversion. For construction and/or demolition projects, on-site separation shall include salvageable materials (e.g., appliances, fixtures, plumbing, metals, etc.,) and dimensional lumber, wallboard, concrete and corrugated cardboard. Under no condition shall the on-site practices, including but not limited to the process of separating materials on-site, storage of separated materials or other activities under this chapter violate the areawide urban stormwater runoff permit for San Bernardino County and the incorporated cities, NPDES Permit No. CAS618036 or subsequent permits as adopted by the Santa Ana regional water quality control board. (Ord. 661, 2007)

 

15.58.090 Reporting.
     Within fifteen calendar days following the completion of the demolition phase of a covered project, and again within fifteen calendar days following the completion of the construction phase of a covered project, the applicant shall, as a condition precedent to final inspection and to issuance of any certificate of occupancy or final approval of project, submit documentation to the WMP compliance official that proves compliance with the requirements of Sections 15.58.060 (waste management plan) and 15.58.030 (diversion requirement). The documentation shall consist of a final completed WMP showing actual waste tonnage data, supported by original or certified photocopies of receipts and

weight tags or other records of measurement from recycling companies, deconstruction contractors, and/or landfill and disposal companies. In addition, where materials were recovered or salvaged recyclables and reusable materials were given away or sold on the premises, or removed to a reuse facility for storage or sale, the applicant shall provide written supporting documentation such as letters of donation, bills of sale or other information that shall clearly document the final destination of the recovered or salvaged materials, the quantity or items that were recovered or salvaged, and the recipient of those materials. Receipts and weight tags will be used to verify whether waste generated from the covered project has been or are to be recycled, reused, salvaged or disposed. The applicant shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that all designated recyclable and reuse waste salvaged or disposed are measured and recorded using the most accurate method of measurement available.

     To the extent practical, all construction and demolition waste shall be weighed in compliance with all regulatory requirements for accuracy and maintenance. For construction and demolition waste for which weighing is not practical due to small size or other considerations, a volumetric measurement shall be used. For conversion of volumetric measurements to weight, the applicant shall use the standardized conversion rates approved by the city for this purpose.

     If a covered project involves both demolition and construction, the report and documentation for the demolition project must be submitted and approved by the WMP compliance official before issuance of a building permit for the construction phase of a covered project.

     In the event that a covered project does not generate any waste or recyclable materials, the applicant may submit a letter stating that no waste or recyclable materials were generated from the covered project, in which case this statement shall be subject to verification by the WMP compliance official. Said letter shall contain the following statement:

The undersigned hereby certifies that, to the best of his/her knowledge, that the above provided information is correct; that the undersigned understands that the submission of any known false statements regarding the generation of no waste or recyclable materials from the project shall be subject to civil penalties as set forth in Chapter 15.58 of the City of Loma Linda Municipal Code.

(Ord. 661, 2007)

 

15.58.100 Violation.
     Violation of any provision of this chapter may be enforced by civil action including an action for injunctive relief. In any civil enforcement action, administrative or judicial, the city shall be entitled to recover its attorney’s fees and costs from an applicant who is determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have violated this chapter.

     In the event that an applicant who would be subject to the requirements set forth in this chapter, fails to comply with Section 15.58.060 (waste management plan), prior to commencement of work on a covered project, shall be fined the equivalent of three times the amount of deposit that would have been required under Section 15.58.070 (deposit required), and shall be subject to a “stop work” order issued by the city until such WMP is submitted as required. Such fine shall be separate from the deposit required under Section 15.58.070 (deposit required) and in addition to the fines set forth herein Section 15.58.100 (violations).

     At minimum, any deposit posted pursuant to Section 15.58.070 (deposit required) shall be forfeited if the applicant does not meet the timely reporting requirements of Section 15.58.090 (reporting), or does not comply with any other requirements of this chapter. (Ord. 661, 2007)

 

15.58.110 Appeals.
     Any decision issued by the waste management plan compliance official may be appealed by submission of a written appeal to the city manager within ten calendar days from the date of the decision. (Ord. 661, 2007)

When large lots are proposed, the shapes and building locations may be required to be so established as to permit later practical resubdivision. No reserved lots or strips shall be permitted. Every lot shall front or abut on a dedicated street, except for deep lot subdivisions, where the extension of a public street is not practical, access may be provided by a private street or common driveway, the standards for which shall be established by the city council as part of the approval of the tentative parcel map. Deep lot subdivisions shall apply only to subdivisions of four lots or less. In the case of all subdivisions, double frontage lots shall be avoided.

In no event shall the city council authorize a release of the improvement security which would reduce such security to an amount below that required to guarantee the completion of the act or work and any other obligation imposed by this chapter, the Subdivision Map Act, or the improvement agreement.

     C.      Security given to secure payment to the contractor, his subcontractors and to persons furnishing labor, materials or equipment, may, six months after the completion and acceptance of the act or work, be reduced to an amount equal to the amount of all claims therefor filed and of which notice has been given to the legislative body, plus an amount reasonably determined by the city council to be required to assure the performance of any other obligations secured thereby. The balance of the security shall be released upon the settlement of all such claims and obligations for which the security was given.

     D.      No security given for the guaranty or warranty of work shall be released until the expiration of the period thereof. (Ord. 109 § 19(E), 1975)

Chapter 16.08 VESTING TENTATIVE MAPS FOR RESIDENTIAL SUBDIVISIONS
16.08.010 Statutory authority.
     The ordinance codified in this chapter is enacted pursuant to the authority granted by Chapter 4.5 (commencing with Section 66498.1) of Division 2 of Title 7 of the Government Code of the state of California (hereinafter referred to as the “Vesting Tentative Map Statute”), and may be cited as the “vesting tentative map ordinance.” (Ord. 345 § 1-1, 1985)

 

16.08.020 Purpose and intent.
     A.      It is the purpose of this chapter to establish procedures necessary for the implementation of the Vesting Tentative Map Statute, and to supplement the provisions of the Subdivision Map Act and Chapter 16.04 of the Loma Linda Municipal Code. Except as otherwise set forth in the provisions of this chapter, the provisions of Chapter 16.04 of the Loma Linda Municipal Code shall apply to this vesting tentative map chapter.

     B.      To accomplish this purpose, the regulations outlined in this chapter are determined to be necessary for the preservation of the public health, safety and general welfare, and for the promotion of orderly growth and development. (Ord. 345 § 1-2, 1985)

 

16.08.030 Definitions.
     A.      A “vesting tentative map” means a tentative map for a residential subdivision, as defined by Chapter 16.04, of the Loma Linda Municipal Code, that shall have printed conspicuously on its face the words “Vesting Tentative Map” at the time it is filed in accordance with Section 16.08.060, and is thereafter processed in accordance with the provisions hereof.

(Ord. 345 § 1-3, 1985)

 

16.08.050 Applicability.
     A.      This chapter shall apply only to residential developments. Whenever a provision of the Subdivision Map Act, as implemented and supplemented by Chapter 16.04 requires the filing of a tentative map or tentative parcel map for a residential development, a vesting tentative map may instead be filed, in accordance with the provisions hereof.

     B.      If a subdivider does not seek the rights conferred by the Vesting Tentative Map Statute, the filing of a vesting tentative map shall not be a prerequisite to any approval for any proposed subdivision, a permit for construction, or work preparatory to construction. (Ord. 345 § 1-5, 1985)

 

16.08.060 Filing and processing.
     A vesting tentative map shall be filed in the same form and have the same contents, accompanying data and reports, and shall be processed in the same manner as set forth in Chapter 16.04 for a tentative map except as hereinafter provided:

     A.      At the time a vesting tentative map is filed it shall have printed conspicuously on its face the words “Vesting Tentative Map.”

     For example:

     1.      Height, size and location of buildings (existing and proposed);

     3.      Geological studies;

     4.      Flood control report or engineer’s study;

     5.      Environmental impact report (if necessary). (Ord. 345 § 2-1, 1985)

 

16.08.070 Fees.
     Upon filing a vesting tentative map, the subdivider shall pay the same fees as required for a tentative subdivision map. The rate of such fees shall be set by resolution of the city council for the filing and processing of a tentative map. (Ord. 345 § 2-2, 1985)

 

16.08.080 Approval of vesting tentative map—Expiration.
     The approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall expire at the end of the same time period and shall be subject to the same extensions established by Chapter 16.04 for the expiration of the approval or conditional approval of a tentative map. (Ord. 345 § 2-3, 1985)

 

16.08.090 Approval of vesting tentative map—Conditions and limitations.
     A.      The approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall confer a vested right to proceed with development in substantial compliance with the ordinances, policies and standards described in Government Code Section 66474.2.

     B.      Notwithstanding subsection A of this section, a permit, approval, extension or entitlement may be made conditional or denied if any of the following are determined:

     1.      A failure to do so would place the residents of the subdivision or the community, or both, in a condition dangerous to their health or safety, or both;

     2.      The condition or denial is required, in order to comply with state or federal law.

     C.      The rights referred to herein shall expire if a final map is not approved prior to the expiration of the vesting tentative map as provided in Section 16.08.080. If the final map is approved, these rights shall last for the following periods of time:

     1.      An initial time period of twenty-four months. Where several final maps are recorded on various phases of a project covered by a single vesting tentative map, this initial time period shall begin for each phase when the final map for that phase is recorded;

     2.      The initial time period set forth in subsection C1 of this section shall be automatically extended by any time used for processing a complete application for a grading permit or for design or architectural review;

     3.      A subdivider may apply for a one-year extension at any time before the initial time period set forth in subsection C1 of this section expires;

     4.      If the subdivider submits a complete application for a building permit during the periods of time specified in subsections C1 through C3 of this section, the rights referred to herein shall continue until the expiration of that permit, or any extension of that permit. (Ord. 345 § 3-1, 1985)

 

16.08.100 Development inconsistent with zoning—Conditional approval.
     A.      Whenever a subdivider files a vesting tentative map for a subdivision whose intended development is inconsistent with the zoning ordinance in existence at that time, the inconsistency shall be noted on the map. The city may deny such a vesting tentative map or approve it conditioned on the subdivider, or his or her designee, obtaining the necessary change in the zoning ordinance to eliminate the inconsistency. If the change in the zoning ordinance is obtained, the approved or conditionally approved vesting tentative map shall, notwithstanding Section 16.08.090A, confer the vested right to proceed with the development in substantial compliance and the map, as approved.

     B.      The rights conferred by this section shall be for the time periods set forth in Section 16.08.090C. (Ord. 345 § 3-2, 1985)

     1.      To provide each sign user the opportunity for adequate business or other identification and information while guarding against the potentially excessive and confusing proliferation of signs by appropriately regulating the time, place, and manner under which signs may be displayed.

     2.      To preserve and enhance the community’s appearance by regulating the type, number, size, location, quality, design, character, scale, illumination, and maintenance of signs.

     3.      To encourage the creation and maintenance of well-designed signs that attract and invite rather than demand the public’s attention.

     4.      To encourage the design of signs that complement the structures and uses to which they relate.

     5.      To ensure freedom of expression for sign uses for both commercial and noncommercial speech by maintaining a content-neutral approach to sign regulation. (Ord. 740 § 1, 2017)

 

17.18.020 Applicability.
     A.      Regulatory Scope. The provisions of this chapter shall regulate signs, as defined by this chapter, that are placed on private property, in the public right-of-way, and on property owned by public agencies other than the city and over which the city has zoning authority.

     B.      Applicability.

     1.      The regulations in this chapter shall apply to all signs in all zones that come within the regulatory scope as defined in subsection A, unless specifically exempted by this chapter.

     2.      Sign permits shall be required for specific sign types in compliance with Section 17.18.040 (Procedures for sign permits, exemptions, and revocations). In addition, the provisions of Municipal Code Title 15 (Buildings and Construction) relating to building and electrical codes, fees, penalties, and a method of enforcement shall also apply.

     3.      Applications for sign permits that comply with all applicable requirements of this chapter and other applicable laws shall be granted. Signs approved in conjunction with any other application shall be consistent with this chapter, unless otherwise approved by the city.

     C.      Nonconforming Signs. An existing legally established sign that does not conform to the requirements of this chapter shall be deemed a nonconforming sign and shall be subject to the requirements of Section 17.18.160 (Nonconforming signs).

     D.      Specific Plans. Sign regulations contained in a city-adopted specific plan may vary from the regulations in this chapter. If the adopted specific plan does not provided regulations for sign types or circumstances, the requirements of this chapter shall apply. (Ord. 740 § 1, 2017)

 

17.18.030 General provisions.
     A.      Applicability. The rules and regulations stated in this section apply to all signs subject to compliance with this chapter.

     B.      Compliance Required. No person shall erect, re-erect, construct, maintain, enlarge, alter, change copy, repair, move, improve, remove, convert, or equip any sign or sign structure, or cause or permit the same to be done, contrary to, or in violation of, any provision of this chapter.

     C.      Interpretations by Director. Interpretations of the requirements of this chapter shall be exercised in light of the city’s content neutrality policy. Where a particular sign type is proposed in a permit application and the type is neither expressly allowed nor prohibited by this chapter, or whenever a sign does not qualify as a “structure” as defined in the California Building Code, then the director of community development or designee shall approve, conditionally approve, or deny the application based on the most similar sign type expressly regulated by this chapter.

     D.      Content Neutrality. It is the city’s policy to regulate signs in a constitutional manner that does not favor commercial speech over noncommercial speech and is content neutral without consideration of the content of the sign message. Except to the extent that a sign is required to be reviewed to determine whether it is an on-site sign versus an off-site sign (billboard) as defined by this chapter, the sign content of both a noncommercial and commercial message shall not be considered in any manner when a required sign permit or comprehensive sign program application is reviewed. This chapter regulates signs based on “time, place, or manner” standards, where signs are regulated based on the duration they may be displayed, the location where they are placed, their size (area), frequency of placement, lighting, and design. See Section 17.18.040 (Procedures for sign permits, exemptions, and revocations).

     E.      Message Substitution. Signs authorized by this chapter are allowed to carry noncommercial messages in lieu of any other commercial or noncommercial messages. Substitution of messages may be made without an additional permitting process. This provision prevails over any more specific provision to the contrary within this chapter. The purpose of this provision is to prevent an inadvertent favoring of commercial speech over noncommercial speech, or favoring of any particular noncommercial message over any other noncommercial message. This provision does not create a right to increase the total number of signs or allowable sign area on a parcel, nor does it affect the requirement that a sign structure or mounting device be properly constructed.

     F.      Property Owner’s Consent Required. Signs shall not be displayed without the expressed written consent of the legal owner of the property or authorized representative of the property on which the sign is mounted or displayed. For purposes of this regulation, “owner” means the holder of the legal title to the property and all parties and persons holding a present right to possession, control, or use of the property.

     G.      Nuisance Abatement. In addition to the penalties provided for violation of this chapter, any condition caused or allowed to exist in violation of any of the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed a public nuisance and may be abated.

     H.     Severability. If any part, section, subsection, paragraph, subparagraph, sentence, phrase, clause, term, or word in this chapter is declared invalid, the invalidity shall not affect the validity or enforceability of the remaining portions of this chapter. (Ord. 740 § 1, 2017)

 

17.18.040 Procedures for sign permits, exemptions, and revocations.
     A.      Sign Permits—When Required. To ensure compliance with the regulations contained in this chapter, a sign permit shall be required to erect, move, alter, change copy on, or reconstruct any permanent sign or sign structure, except for signs exempt from permits in compliance with Section 17.18.060 or signage that has been approved via a comprehensive sign program.

     B.      All Permits Required Prior to Establishment. No sign shall be erected or otherwise established on a property until all required permits and approvals have been issued by the community development director or designee and all building, electrical permits and, where applicable, encroachment permits issued by the building division. For all sign permits, an application for a sign permit shall be made in writing on forms provided by the city.

     C.      Sign Permits—Approving Authority. The director of community development or designee shall review all sign permit applications for conformance with the provisions of this chapter in accordance with the following.

     1.      The director shall act to approve or deny the permit applications within thirty days from the receipt of a complete application and the applicable fees.

     2.      If the application is denied, the director shall notify the applicant with the reason(s) stated for denial. Notification shall be sent via method guaranteeing receipt of delivery to the address provided on the application, which shall be considered the correct address.

     3.      In the event an application is denied, the applicant may appeal the director’s decision to the planning commission in compliance with Section 17.30.400 (Appeals) et seq., of the municipal code.

     D.      Planning Commission Authority—Compre-hensive Sign Programs. The planning commission shall have the authority to review and act upon comprehensive sign programs. The process for such review shall be as set forth in Section 17.18.050 (Comprehensive sign program).

     E.      Exemptions to Sign Permit Requirements. Sign permits shall not be required for the signs listed as exempt in this chapter. Exempt signs shall not be included in the determination of the total allowable number of signs or total allowable sign area for a site or project. However, exempt signs shall be required to adhere to the development standards and regulations established for each sign type. Signs erected without complying with the applicable regulations are considered illegal and shall be removed in compliance with Section 17.17.180 (Illegal signs). An exempt sign may still require a building permit, subject to the provisions of Municipal Code Title 15 (Buildings and Construction).

     F.      Routine Maintenance. Painting, repainting, or cleaning of a sign shall not be considered erecting or altering a sign and shall not require a sign permit unless structural changes are made.

     G.      Expiration and Extension of Sign Permit. An approved sign permit shall expire twelve months from the date of approval unless the sign has been installed or a different expiration date is stipulated at the time of approval. Before the expiration of a sign permit, the applicant may apply to the director of community development for an extension of up to an additional twelve months from the original date of expiration. In response to an extension, the director may require modifications or deny the extension.

     H.     Revisions to Sign Permit and Comprehensive Sign Program. The director of community development or designee may approve minor changes to an approved sign permit or comprehensive sign program if the intent of the original approval is not affected. Revisions that would substantially deviate from the original approval shall require the approval of a new/revised sign permit or comprehensive sign program as set forth in this chapter.

     I.       Revocation of Sign Permit.

     1.      The director of community development may, in writing, suspend or revoke a sign permit if the permit was issued on the basis of a material omission or misstatement of fact, or in violation of any ordinance or any of the provisions of this chapter, or if the allowed sign violates any applicable law.

     2.      Within thirty days after issuance of the written notice, any sign authorized by the revoked sign permit shall be removed.

     3.      Failure to remove the sign display within the thirty-day period shall be a violation of this Zoning Code, and the sign shall be deemed a public nuisance. (Ord. 740 § 1, 2017)

 

17.18.050 Comprehensive sign program.
     A.      Purpose. The purpose of a comprehensive sign program is to integrate all signs proposed for a development project with the overall site design and the structures’ design into a unified architectural statement, and to allow for modifications to the sign requirements established in this chapter for large properties developed with multiple tenant spaces. A comprehensive sign program provides a means for the flexible application of sign regulations for projects that require multiple signs in order to provide latitude in the design and display of multiple signs and to achieve the purpose of this chapter. A comprehensive sign program shall not be used to override the prohibition on new off-site commercial signs specified in Section 17.18.070 (Prohibited signs).

     B.      When Required. A comprehensive sign program shall be required whenever any of the following circumstances outlined below exist. Once a comprehensive sign program has been approved, no individual sign permit shall be required for any individual proposed sign that conforms to the provisions of the applicable comprehensive sign program, as determined by the director of community development. However, building and electrical permits may be required subject to the provisions of Municipal Code Title 15 (Buildings and Construction) prior to the establishment of such sign(s).

     1.      For any property with frontage on Interstate 10 where more than one sign is proposed;

     2.      For a combination of properties within one thousand feet of the Interstate 10 corridor where at least one property fronts on Interstate 10 and where all uses propose to utilize one single freestanding center identification sign;

     3.      For any property within the public facilities zone that is two gross acres in size or larger;

     4.      Whenever five or more non-exempt signs are proposed for a single-tenant development;

     5.      Whenever an applicant proposes any combination of three or more monument and/or pylon signs along the frontage of a public street;

     6.      Whenever an application for a development agreement has been filed to permit private wayfinding signage as off-site signage on public or private property;

     7.      Whenever the unique circumstances described in Section 17.18.090(G) (Properties with limited or no street frontage) exist; or

     8.      Whenever the director of community development determines that a comprehensive sign program is needed because of special project characteristics (e.g., the size of proposed signs, limited visibility, a business within another business, the location of the site relative to major transportation routes, etc.).

     C.      Application Requirements. An application for a comprehensive sign program shall include all information and materials required by the director of community development and the filing fee set by the city’s planning division fee schedule.

     D.      Review Authority. The planning commission shall be the review authority for a comprehensive sign program.

     1.      An application shall be filed on forms provided by the city. Within thirty days of receipt of a complete application and the applicable fees, the director of community development shall schedule the application for a public hearing before the planning commission.

     2.      The director shall give notice of such application and of the time and place of such hearing by posting of a notice in at least three public places in the city at least ten days prior to the date of the hearing and by one of the following methods:

     a.      By mailing notices not less than five days prior to the date of hearing to the owners, as their names and addresses are shown by the last equalized assessment roll, of real property owners within three hundred feet of the external boundaries of property under consideration; or

     b.      By posting said notice in conspicuous places close to the property affected, not less than ten days prior to the date of such hearing, a notice consisting of the words: “NOTICE OF PROPOSED COMPREHENSIVE SIGN PROGRAM” printed in plain type letters not less than one inch in height and containing a statement in legible print setting forth a description of the property, the nature of the proposed comprehensive sign program, and time and place of public hearing; or

     c.       By placing a legal advertisement in a newspaper of local circulation at least ten days prior to the date of the hearing.

     3.      The planning commission shall act to approve, approve with conditions, or deny the application. In acting to approve or conditionally approve a comprehensive sign program, the commission shall be required to make the following findings:

     a.      That the comprehensive sign program provides for the coordinated arrangement and placement of signage on the property appropriate to advertise the businesses on the property;

     b.      That the comprehensive sign program provides for the integration of the project’s signs with the design of the structures to achieve a unified architectural statement;

     c.       That the site is adequate in size and shape to accommodate all proposed signs;

     d.      That the comprehensive sign program accommodates future revisions that may be required due to changes in uses or tenants; and

     e.       That the comprehensive sign program complies with the standards of this chapter, except that flexibility is allowed regarding sign area, number, location, and/or height to the extent that the comprehensive sign program will enhance the overall development and will more fully accomplish the purposes of this chapter.

     4.      In the event an application is denied, the applicant may appeal the planning commission’s decision in compliance with Section 17.30.430 (Appeals) of the municipal code.

     E.      Standards. A comprehensive sign program shall comply with the following standards:

     1.      The proposed sign program shall comply with the purpose and intent of this chapter and any sign design guidelines by the city council or planning commission.

     2.      The proposed signs shall enhance the overall development, be in harmony with, and relate visually to other signs included in the comprehensive sign program, to the structures and developments they identify, and to surrounding development when applicable.

     3.      The sign program shall include all signs, including permanent, temporary, and exempt signs.

     4.      The sign programs shall accommodate future revisions that may be required because of changes in use or tenants.

     5.      The sign program shall comply with the standards of this chapter, except that deviations are allowed regarding sign area, total number, location, and height of signs to the extent that the comprehensive sign program will enhance the overall development and will more fully accomplish the purposes and intent of this chapter. Any such deviations shall consider the context in which a proposed sign or signs are to be located, with consideration to be given, for example, to the height and sign area of existing signs on surrounding properties, location relative to residential neighborhoods, and the city’s aesthetic goals established in the general plan. (Ord. 740 § 1, 2017)

 

17.18.060 Exempt signs.

     The following signs and sign types shall be prohibited in all zones in the city.

     A.      Flashing Signs. Any sign that displays an intermittent or sequential flashing light source, exclusive of electronic changeable message signs that meet the standards in this chapter.

     B.      Hazardous Location. No sign shall be located in any manner where the sign, or a portion of the sign or sign supports, interferes with the free use of a fire escape, exit, or standpipe; obstructs a required door, stairway, ventilator, or window; encroaches into a public right-of-way without a proper city-issued encroachment permit; blocks doors, windows, or otherwise prevent ingress and egress to or from any window or door; blocks the view of traffic control devices; constitutes a traffic hazard or detriment to traffic safety by obstructing the vision of drivers, or by directing or tending to direct the attention of the drivers of moving vehicles from the traffic movement on the public street and highways; or is otherwise hazardous.

     C.      Animated Sign and Moving Signs. Any sign that blinks, flashes, shimmers, glitters, rotates, oscillates, is projected, or which gives the appearance of blinking, flashing, shimmering, glittering, rotating, oscillating, or moving, uses lighting, or special materials to depict action or create a special effect or scene. This classification includes wind-actuated and other elements (e.g., bunting, pennants, streamers, whirligigs) or other similar devices, except for feather flags and wind dancers permitted as temporary signs. For the purposes of this chapter, time and temperature displays, flags, banners, traditional barber poles, and approved electronic changeable message signs that comply with the provisions of Section 17.18.100(B) (Electronic changeable message signs) are not considered animated signs.

     D.      Off-Site Commercial Signs.

The city adopts this regulation to the extent allowed by the law and in compliance with California Government Code Section 65850, California Business and Professions Code Sections 5354(a) and 5408.3 (both effective January 1, 2003), or as subsequently amended. Permits shall not be issued for off-site signs displaying off-site commercial messages that violate this regulation, and the city will take immediate abatement action against signs constructed or maintained in violation of this regulation. This city intends for this off-site sign regulation to be severable and separately enforceable even if other provisions of this chapter may be declared, by a court of competent jurisdiction, to be unconstitutional, invalid, or unenforceable. This provision does not prohibit agreements to relocate existing, legal off-site signs, as encouraged by California Business and Professions Code Section 5412.

This regulation shall not apply to buses and taxicabs legally operating within the city limits, business identification signs painted or attached to a vehicle making deliveries or otherwise conducting normal business operations or vehicles owned and offered for sale by the owner, or other allowed uses regulated under other titles of the municipal code. (Ord. 740 § 1, 2017)

 

17.18.080 Standards for all types of signs.
     A.      Compliance Required. No person shall erect, re-erect, construct, maintain, enlarge, alter, change copy, repair, move, improve, remove, convert, or equip any sign or sign structure, or paint a new wall-mounted sign in the city, or cause or permit the same to be done, contrary to or in violation of any provision of this chapter.

     B.      Determination of Sign Location.

     1.      The maximum allowed sign area for a sign shall be calculated by first determining if the sign is to be placed on a “primary” or “secondary” frontage (as defined in this chapter) and then referring to Tables 17.18-1 through 17.18-3 in Section 17.18.090 (Permanent signs by zone—Locations and design requirements).

     2.      In cases where a building has more than one street frontage, the building frontage with the primary business entrance shall be considered the primary building frontage. For multi-tenant buildings, ground-floor tenants may have their primary building frontage determined independently by the director of community development based upon this rule.

     C.      Measurement of Sign Area.

     1.      The surface area of a sign shall be calculated by enclosing the extreme limits of all framing, emblem, logo, representation, letters applied to the building without a distinctive background (e.g., channel letters), or other display within a single continuous perimeter composed of the smallest square, circle, rectangle, triangle, or other shapes. See Figure 17.18-1 (Sign Area Measurement).



Figure 17.18-1 Sign Area Measurement

 

     2.      For an awning or canopy sign, sign copy applied to an awning or canopy shall be computed at one hundred percent of the area within a single rectangle enveloping the sign copy.

     3.      For a freestanding sign, the sign area shall include the frame, if any, but shall not include:

     a.      Structural supports unless the structural supports are illuminated or otherwise designed to constitute a display device or a part of a display device. See Figure 17.18-2 (Calculation of Freestanding Sign Area).

     b.      Features that are not an integral part of the sign (i.e., landscaping). See Figure 17.18-2 (Calculation of Freestanding Sign Area).

3-26 Calculatoin of Freestanding Sign Area

Figure 17.18-2 Calculation of Freestanding Sign Area

 

     4.      Only one face of a double-faced sign shall be counted in computing the allowed area of the sign. Double-faced (back-to-back) signs shall be counted as a single sign when the sign is mounted on a single structure and the distance between each sign face does not exceed two feet at any point. If the sign is multi-faced (e.g., more than two sides), then each face shall be counted in computing the allowed area of the sign.

     5.      Where a sign consists of one or more three-dimensional objects (i.e., balls, cubes, clusters of objects, sculpture, or statue-like trademarks), the sign area shall be measured as the maximum projection upon a vertical plane of the three-dimensional objects, as viewed from a position in the public right-of-way which produces the largest visual projection. See Figure 17.18-3 (Sign Area Measurement for Three-Dimensional Objects). Signs shall not contain three-dimensional objects that exceed a projection of six inches from the sign face.

3-34 3D Sign Area

Figure 17.18-3 Sign Area Measurement for Three-Dimensional Objects

 

     D.      Measurement of Sign Height. The height of a sign shall be measured from the highest part of the sign, including any decorative features, to the height of the planned finished grade directly beneath the sign. For freeway center identification signs, the height may be measured from the freeway grade closest to the sign to the highest part of the sign.

     E.      Sign Construction Materials. All signs that are not temporary signs shall be constructed of weather-durable materials, including, but not limited to, metal, wood, acrylic, or other comparable durable weatherproof materials, as determined by the director of community development. No material more combustible than treated wood shall be used in the construction of any permanent sign.

     F.      Consistent Design. Where multiple signs are proposed, all signs shall be consistent with one another in terms of construction material, sign design, letter size and style, support method, and themes. Signs shall be designed to complement the use to which they are related through design elements of similar scale, color, and material.

     G.      Sign Proportion and Rhythm. The size and proportion of the elements of the sign’s message, including logos, letters, icons, and other graphic images, shall be in general proportion to the use to which they are related. Sign messages oriented toward pedestrians shall be smaller than those oriented toward drivers. Lettering and logos shall not occupy no more than seventy-five percent of the sign panel area.

     H.     Illuminated Signs and Lights. The following standards shall apply to all illuminated signs:

     1.      Sign illumination shall not interfere with the use and enjoyment of adjacent properties, create a public nuisance, or create public safety hazards. Exterior light sources shall be shielded from view and directed to illuminate only the sign face. The light from an illuminated sign shall not be of an intensity or brightness or directed in a manner that will create a negative impact on residential properties in direct line of sight to the sign. No sign covered by this chapter shall present a display or any part of a display that exceeds one hundred fifty nits between the end of twilight in the evening and the beginning of twilight in the morning. The city may require a photometric study to ensure compliance with this provision.

     2.      Signs may be internally or externally illuminated. Internal illumination shall be allowed only if the sign background is opaque and the only portion of the sign that appears as illuminated is the actual lettering and registered trademark or logo.

     3.      Colored lights shall not be used at a location or in a manner so as to be confused with or construed as traffic control devices.

     4.      Reflective-type bulbs and incandescent lamps that exceed fifteen watts shall not be used on the exterior surface of signs so that the face of the bulb or lamp is exposed to a public right-of-way or adjacent property.

     5.      Light sources shall utilize energy-efficient bulbs.

     I.       Sign Removal or Replacement. When a sign is removed, all brackets, poles, and other structural elements that supported the sign shall also be removed. For wall-mounted signs, affected building surfaces shall be restored to match the finish of the building, with sign wiring removed and all holes and other surface blemishes appropriately patched and finished (i.e., painted), subject to the approval of the director of community development.

     J.       Conditional Use Permit Required for Electronic Changeable Message Signs. A conditional use permit is required for all signs with electronic changeable messages, meaning any such sign that uses video display, flip-disks, incandescent lamps, fluorescent lamps, fiber optics, light-emitting diodes (LED), liquid crystal displays, plasma-displays, field emission displays, or any other mechanical or light emitting matrix to convey changing copy, message, or images. (Ord. 740 § 1, 2017)

 

17.18.090 Permanent signs by zone—Locations and design requirements.
     A.      Applicability. This section establishes regulations for permanent signs by zone. References in the last column of Tables 17.18-1 through 17.18-3 provide additional regulations for specific sign types located elsewhere in this chapter and identifies required permits.

     B.      Either Monument or Pylon as Primary Sign Type. No property shall be permitted to have both a monument sign(s) and a pylon sign(s) as the primary signage. Where the regulations in this section indicate that a monument sign(s) and a pylon sign(s) are permitted, only one such sign type shall be allowed as the primary signage.

     C.      Zones Not Specified. Signs in all other zones not specified within this section shall be subject to approval through a comprehensive sign program in compliance with Section 17.17.050 (Comprehensive sign program).

     D.      Properties in the East Valley Corridor Overlay Zone. Tables 17.18-1 through 17.18-3 include regulations specific to properties within the East Valley Corridor Overlay Zone. Where specific regulations for the East Valley Corridor Overlay Zone are not indicated, the standards for the base zone shall apply.

     E.      Freeway Center Identification Signs. For any freeway center identification sign, as defined in this chapter, in addition to regulations contained in this paragraph, the following shall apply. In a circumstance where a property is eligible for a freeway center identification sign and lies within the East Valley Corridor Overlay Zone, these freeway center identification sign regulations shall apply.

     1.      A comprehensive sign program shall be required for any proposed freeway center identification sign. The comprehensive sign program shall only be approved if the planning commission can find in the affirmative all the following:

     a.      The signs are compatible with all other sign on the parcels for which the new signs are proposed, including individual freeway gateway signs;

     b.      The signs identify all of the parcels as a single center by a proper name for the center intended to be commonly used in other media to identify the property or properties, and that the name of the center shall be a dominant element of the sign by location, size, and prominence in the sign design; and

     c.       The parcels eligible for a freeway center identification sign are integrated in design and layout by at least one common feature, including, but not limited to, significant common open space, a common private street, driveway, or parking facilities.

     2.      Only one freeway center identification sign shall be allowed per center.

     3.      Notwithstanding the sign height requirements specified in this section, the maximum height of a freeway center identification sign may be extended to one hundred feet, subject to all criteria contained in this section, and provided all of the following apply:

     a.      The new freeway center identification sign shall be located no closer than one thousand feet from the closest existing freeway center identification sign; and

     b.      The freeway center identification sign shall serve a single parcel or collection of parcels having at least one thousand lineal feet of freeway frontage.

     4.      In approving a comprehensive sign program for a height extension for a freeway center identification sign, the planning commission, and city council on appeal, shall be required to make the following findings:

     a.      The increased height will create increased visibility for the business or businesses that the sign advertises, thus allowing for heightened recognition and improved competition with similar commercial uses in other cities and surrounding areas;

     b.      The sign will not create adverse aesthetic impacts due to the casting of shadows, interference with protected views, or glare and lighting that impinges on nearby residential and other sensitive land uses;

     c.       A larger freeway center identification sign identifying a larger area and with greater sign separation would be more effective than a freeway gateway sign that follows the regulations of this section; and

     d.      As applicable, that the presence of a visual obstruction of the property in question, such as bridges, structures, or vegetation not under the control of the owner/applicant, would prevent a shorter sign from being viewed, or the fact that the orientation of the property to the public right-of-way where the sign is intended to be viewed is unusual.

     F.      Bus Shelter Advertising Panel.

     1.      Where Allowed. Bus shelter advertising panels are allowed in any zone where a bus shelter associated with a public transit service provider is located, subject to the requirements of this section.

     2.      Sign Permit Required. A sign permit shall be required to establish an advertising panel at any public transit center, bus shelter, bus stop, or other public transit-oriented structure that displays a public or commercial message.

     3.      Agreement and Encroachment Permit Required. An agreement between the city and the transit provider shall be established as a program to maintain and administer all bus shelter advertising panels. An encroachment permit shall be obtained for all bus shelter advertising panels located in the public right-of-way.

     4.      Dimensions and Design.

     a.      Bus shelter advertising panels shall not exceed twenty-five square feet in area.

     b.      Such signs are allowed to have one double-sided advertising panel.

     G.      Properties with Limited or No Street Frontage. In any circumstance where a property has no street frontage or less than twenty feet of street frontage (for example, as a flag lot), signage shall be allowed on an adjacent property with the same zone as the subject property, subject to approval of a comprehensive sign program and with the written permission of the property owner on whose property the sign is to be erected.

 

Table 17.18-1: R-1 and R-2 Zones

No sign shall be allowed other than exempt signs, as included in Section 17.18.060 (Exempt signs) of this chapter, and signs erected as entry monumentation to a subdivision or residential development or neighborhood. Such entry monumentation signs shall require issuance of a conditional use permit pursuant to Sections 17.30.130 through 17.30.240 of the municipal code or, if associated with a precise plan of design application, shall be reviewed in conjunction with the precise plan of design application pursuant to Sections 17.30.260 through 17.30.310 of the municipal code.

17.20.020 Dedication or payment of fees required when.
     Where a park and recreation service area has been proposed in the adopted general plan or in the adopted development plan for parks and recreation and a residential development is proposed in whole or in part within such service area, then park land dedication or park fees shall be required in accordance with one or more of the following provisions:

     A.      The developer will be required to dedicate a site or sites for a neighborhood park, sufficient in size and topography to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of the developed area, based on an adopted ratio of 2.8 acres of park per one thousand persons.

     B.      Where the proposed residential development is in close proximity to an already existing neighborhood park, as determined by the city council, through the general plan, and if the already existing park is outside of the proposed limits of the development, the developer will be required to make a cash payment, in lieu of dedication, equivalent to the cost of the park land as determined by the city council based on the adopted ratio of park land per dwelling unit. These moneys will be used only in the acquisition and development of that community park serving that proposed development.

Chapter 17.22 NONCONFORMING USES
17.22.010 Intent—Nonconforming defined.
     A.      It is the intent of this chapter to regulate the extension, enlargement, reestablishment, continuation, maintenance, alteration, or change of nonconforming uses, buildings, structures, and lots. It is the purpose of this chapter to ensure an ultimate goal of the elimination, or to add a more substantial degree of conformity of, nonconforming uses, buildings, structures, and lots.

     B.      For the purpose of this chapter, the term “nonconforming” and regulations herein may apply to uses, buildings, structures, and lots. The term “nonconforming” pertains to any use, building, structure, or lot which was commenced, constructed, or created in compliance with the then applicable zoning regulations but which, by virtue of a change in such regulations, no longer complies therewith. (Ord. 98 § 12.17.01, 1974)

 

17.22.020 Extension or change prohibited when.
     A.      No nonconforming use of property and/or building shall be extended to any portion of a property or building previously vacant or occupied by another use.

     A.      A nonconforming building housing a nonconforming use shall not be moved, altered, or enlarged unless required by law.

     B.      A nonconforming building housing a conforming use may be altered, once enlarged, or reconstructed, provided:

     1.      That such alteration, enlargement, or reconstruction does not exceed twenty-five percent of the value of the existing building;

     2.      That floor area shall not be increased over ten percent of the total existing floor area of the building, except that this limitation shall not apply to single-family residences in an area zoned for single-family use.

     3.      That the alteration, enlargement, or reconstruction shall not increase any discrepancy between existing conditions and the regulations prescribed by code;

     4.      That the planning director shall determine that added safety, reduction of fire hazard, aesthetic improvement, or closer conformity to surrounding conforming structures shall be achieved.

     C.      1. Repairs or interior alterations which do not enlarge a nonconforming building or structure may be made; provided, however, that any nonconforming building or structure destroyed by fire, explosion, act of God, natural calamity, or act of the public enemy to a greater extent than fifty percent shall be removed or reconstructed in conformance to zoning regulations. The extent of damage shall be determined by the ratio of the estimated cost of restoring such building or structure to its prior condition, before damage, to the estimated cost of duplicating the entire structure as it existed prior thereto.

     2.      If such damage is fifty percent or less, a nonconforming building or structure may be restored providing such restoration is commenced within one hundred eighty days and diligently pursued to completion. (Ord. 98 § 12.17.03, 1974)

Chapter 17.26 ART IN PUBLIC PLACES
17.26.010 Purpose.
     A.      The purpose of the Loma Linda public arts program is to develop and maintain a visual arts program for the residents and visitors of Loma Linda, to add to the economic viability of the community, and to enhance the environment and unique character of Loma Linda by providing for the acquisition and maintenance of quality works of public art.

     B.      The city council finds and declares as follows:

     1.      Cultural and artistic resources enhance the quality of life for individuals living in, working in and visiting the city.

     2.      Balanced development of cultural and artistic resources preserves and improves the quality of the urban environment and increases real property values.

     3.      As development and revitalization of the real property within the city continues, the opportunity for creation of cultural and artistic resources is diminished.

     4.      As this development and revitalization continue as a result of market forces, urbanization of the community results.

     5.      As these opportunities are diminished and this urbanization occurs, the need to develop alternative sources for cultural and artistic outlets to improve the environment, image and character of the community is increased.

     6.      Development of cultural and artistic assets should be financed by those whose development and revitalization diminish the availability of the community’s resources for those opportunities and contribute to community urbanization.

     7.      Establishment of this public arts program will promote the general welfare through balancing the community’s physical growth and revitalization and its cultural and artistic resources.

     8.      It is the purpose of this chapter to modify, clarify and codify the city’s existing public arts program. (Ord. 651 § 2, 2006)

 

17.26.020 Definitions.
     For the purpose of this chapter:

“Commission” means the Loma Linda planning commission.

“Public arts fund” means a separate fund and account which is established to receive moneys collected for the designated purposes of the public arts program.

     4.      A narrative statement to demonstrate that the artwork will be displayed in an area open and freely available to the general public, or otherwise provide public accessibility in an equivalent manner based on the characteristics of the artwork or its placement on the site; and

     5.      Maintenance factors required to insure its permanence. (Ord. 651 § 2, 2006)

 

17.26.090 Approval procedures for placement of artwork on private property.

may refer the application to the city council for approval. Any changes, questions or recommendations shall be conveyed in writing to the applicant. The commission will determine when all issues have been addressed and accept or reject the artwork. The applicant will be notified in writing of the public arts commission’s decision.

     B.      If the applicant proposes or the planning commission or city council recommends significant revisions to the architecture or physical design and layout of the proposed project subsequent to the receipt of the public arts commission’s approval, the application shall, if legally permitted, be returned to the public arts commission for further review and recommendation concerning the revised proposal prior to final approval unless the council otherwise directs.

     C.      A contract between the city and the applicant spelling out all requirements, including insurance and maintenance, shall be executed prior to the city’s final acceptance of the applicant’s art-in-lieu proposal. (Ord. 651 § 2, 2006)

     A.      The planning commission on the date set shall hold a public hearing on the application and establish that the applicant has shown a reasonable existence of grounds for consideration of the matter. Before any variance may be granted the city council on appeal, it shall be shown:

     1.      That there are exceptional and extraordinary circumstances of conditions applicable to the property involved;

     2.      That such variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of the substantial property right possessed by other property in the same vicinity and zone and denied to the property in question;

     3.      That the granting of such variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in such vicinity and zone in which property is located;

     4.      The granting of such variances will be consistent with the general plan for the city;

     5.      That a public hearing was held wherein the applicant is heard and in which he or she substantiates all of the conditions cited in this subsection;

17.30.125 Minor use permits.
     A.      Purpose and Process.

     1.      Purpose. The purpose of a minor use permit is to provide sufficient flexibility in the use regulations to further the objective of this Development Code.

     2.      Process for Reviewing Uses. A minor use permit provides a process for reviewing uses and activities that may be appropriate in the applicable zone, but whose effects on a specific site and surroundings cannot be determined before being proposed for the specific site.

     3.      Special Consideration. Certain types of land uses require special consideration in a particular zone or in the city as a whole because they possess unique characteristics or present special problems that make automatic inclusion as allowed uses either impractical or undesirable.

     B.      Applicability. A minor use permit is required to authorize proposed land uses identified in Chapter 17.32 (Residential Zones) through Chapter 17.48 (Combining Overlay Zones), inclusive, as being allowable in the applicable zone subject to the approval of a minor use permit.

     C.      Review Authority.

     D.      Application Requirements. A signed application and payment of such fee as shall be established by resolution of the city council shall be submitted to the planning department accompanied by copies of the site development and elevation as required by the planning department. The application shall include:

     1.      A site plan prepared to scale showing accurately, and with complete dimensioning, all buildings proposed for the parcel. The data contained on the plan shall include information on all buildings, structures, signs, parking, landscaping, walls or fences, and the points of ingress and egress. In addition, all necessary information to clearly define the intended use of the property and its relationship to adjacent properties shall be included;

     2.      A legal description of the property involved;

     3.      Reference to specific provisions of this title which are applicable to the minor use permit sought;

     4.      A list of all names and addresses of all owners of real property within three hundred feet from external boundaries of the property involved, as shown on the latest available tax roll;

     5.      Evidence of ability and intention of applicant to proceed with actual construction work in accordance with a submitted plan within one hundred eighty days from the date of granting the permits; and

     6.      Any additional information required by the planning department to evaluate the application.

     E.      Project Review, Notice, and Hearing. Each application shall be reviewed by the director to ensure that the proposal complies with all applicable requirements of this title. Before a decision on a minor use permit, the city shall provide notice as follows.

     1.      Notice.

     a.      The notice shall state that the director will decide whether to approve or deny the minor use permit application on a date specified in the notice, and that a public hearing will be held only if requested in writing by any interested person at least five days before the specified date for the decision.

     b.      The written request for a hearing shall be based on issues of significance directly related to the application (e.g., provision of evidence that the request cannot meet one or more of the findings identified in subsection F, Findings and decision).

     c.       If the director determines that the evidence has merit and can be properly addressed by a condition(s) added to the minor use permit approval, the director may consider the permit in compliance with subsection (E)(3), If no hearing is requested.

     2.      If Hearing is Requested. If a public hearing is requested, and the provisions of subsection (E)(1)(c), do not apply, the director shall schedule the hearing that shall be noticed and conducted in compliance with Sections 17.30.180 and 17.30.200.

     3.      If No Hearing is Requested. If no public hearing is requested, the director shall render a decision on the date specified in the notice referred to in subsection (E)(1)(a).

     4.      Appeals. The director’s decision is appealable to the planning commission.

     e.       The measure of site suitability shall be required to ensure that the type, density, and intensity of use being proposed will not adversely affect the public convenience, health, interest, safety, or general welfare, constitute a nuisance, or be materially injurious to the improvements, persons, property, or uses in the vicinity and zone in which the property is located.

     f.       The applicant agrees in writing to comply with any and all of the conditions imposed by the review authority in the approval of the conditional use permit or minor use permit.

(Ord. 739 § 2, 2017)

17.30.130 Conditional use permits—Approval conditions generally.
     Uses permitted subject to conditional use permit are those uses necessary for the development of the community, but which uses must be located, planned, and used in such a manner as not to be detrimental to the property abutting such uses and to the community as a whole. In considering conditional use permit, the planning commission shall determine whether the use is suitable in the area and if a grant is made, shall require the safeguards necessary to protect the health, safety, morals, and general welfare. In approving such uses, the planning commission shall set forth the manner in which the use is to be conducted, approve the design or plan of the structures, including their location and the yards around them, and consider the adequacy and facilities to serve them.

17.30.260 Precise plan of design—Required when.
     In order to fairly administer and provide for adequate consideration of all provisions of this title, it shall be required for all property development or establishment of use on a property to file a precise plan of design (minor or major) to accomplish as nearly as possible a uniformity in the permitted use and enjoyment in any zone while at the same time imposing a uniformity of regulation to protect use and enjoyment of surrounding properties. Therefore, no person shall commence any use and no building permit shall be issued for any structure until a precise plan of design (minor or major) covering the parcel or parcels to be used shall be approved and adopted as herein provided. For purposes of this section, the term “minor” shall be defined as all new individual single-family homes, including additions or modifications that are five hundred square feet or larger, and all other types of development projects considered to be small projects of over one hundred twenty square feet and up to and including five hundred square feet in total building area, which require public notice and an administrative director’s hearing. The term “major” shall be defined as all other types of development projects, except for those classified as “exceptions” in this section. Exceptions to this include additions or modifications to individual single-family homes of less than five hundred square feet, fences in residential zones, or any other accessory structure having a valuation of one thousand five hundred dollars or less. (Ord. 739 § 3, 2017; Ord. 98 § 20.07, 1974)

 

17.30.270 Precise plan of design—Contents.

17.30.280 Precise plan of design—Approval or rejection.
     Any such precise plan of design may be rejected, adopted, modified and adopted, or adopted subject to conditions. Any such precise plan of design after adoption, may be amended in the same manner as a precise plan of design is first adopted hereunder. If the precise plan of design would substantially depreciate property values in the vicinity or would unreasonably interfere with the use or enjoyment of property in the vicinity by the occupants thereof for lawful purposes or would adversely affect the public peace, health, safety or general welfare to a degree greater than that generally permitted by this title, such plan shall be rejected or shall be so modified or conditioned before adoption as to remove the said objections. Otherwise, such proposed precise plan shall be approved. Modifications and conditions may be imposed only to the extent reasonably necessary in connection with the proposed use to remove the said objections, and to that extent may impose greater, but shall not permit lesser, restrictions than those imposed by this title.

     A.      Upon the filing of an application and prior to setting the same for hearing before the planning commission, the secretary shall refer it to the city planner. If the city planner determines that none of the grounds for rejection as set forth in Sections 17.30.030 through 17.30.060 exist, he or she shall endorse his or her approval thereon in writing within ten days after the date of filing. His or her approval may be subject to express written alterations or conditions if the applicant accepts the same in writing. Such approval shall be final or terminate the proceedings; otherwise, it shall be set for hearing before the city council.

     B.      Notice of the public hearing shall be mailed no less than ten calendar days prior to the date of the public hearing to all property owners within a three-hundred-foot radius of the property and by posting at the official notice locations as determined by the resolution of the city council.

The city council shall establish, by resolution, a processing fee to be paid upon the filing of a request for such time extension. (Ord. 485 § 4, 1992; Ord. 98 § 20.08.04, 1974)

 

17.30.370 Zoning device—Refund of application fees.
     The city council is authorized to establish a standardized refund policy by resolution of the city council for the purpose of determining the amount and method of calculating refunds for zoning device application fees. (Ord. 292 § 1, 1982)

 

17.30.380 Providing zoning flexibility to encourage smaller affordable housing units through the use of bonus density or alternative incentives.
     When a developer of housing agrees to construct at least twenty-five percent the total units of a housing development for persons and families of low or moderate income, as defined in Section 50093 of the California Health and Safety Code, or ten percent of the total units of a housing development for lower income households as defined in Section 50079.5 of the California Health and Safety Code, the city will enter into an agreement with the developer to either grant a density bonus or provide other alternative incentives for the development project.

     The factors determining the incentives shall be set forth by minute order of the planning commission from time to time, and shall be on file with the city planning department.

     In considering such developments, the city shall assure that the number of units allowed will be compatible with surrounding land uses, that traffic and public services will not be adversely impacted, and that the development will not result in adverse off-site parking impact.

In granting a conditional use permit, the city council may grant deviations or relief from the yard, fence, sign, height, parking, loading, and open space regulations of this chapter.

     B.      In any case, the granting authority may attach a requirement of a bond (in the form of cash, surety bond or certificate of deposit) for the purpose of guaranteeing faithful performance of any conditions imposed. (Ord. 485 § 16, 1992)

 

17.30.450 Acceptance.
     The acceptance of any of the benefits of such grant shall constitute acceptance of the burdens and conditions attached thereto. (Ord. 485 § 16, 1992)

 

17.30.455 Interpretation.
     The attaching of conditions shall be construed as a material part of the grant, without which the application would otherwise be denied. The invalidation of any condition shall constitute invalidation of the entire grant. (Ord. 485 § 16, 1992)

 

17.30.460 Variances, conditional use permits, precise plans of design—Revocation.
     A.      Upon recommendation by the city manager, the body which originally granted the permit, shall conduct a noticed public hearing to determine whether the permit, should be revoked. If the granting agency or city council finds any one of the following facts to be present, it shall revoke the permit:

     1.      That any condition of the permit has not been complied with or has been violated;

     2.      That the use is detrimental to public health, safety or is a nuisance;

     3.      That the permit was obtained by fraud;

     4.      That the use for which the permit was granted has ceased or has been discontinued or has not been pursued for a period of one year.

     B.      Notice.

     1.      Notice shall be by registered mail, return receipt requested, to the recorded owner or lessee of the subject property not less than twenty days prior to giving public notice. The notice shall state the complaint and shall request appearance of the owner or lessee at the time and place specified for the hearing to show cause why the permit should not be revoked.

     2.      Public notice shall be given as provided in Section 17.30.415.

     If the planning commission conducts the hearing, the action taken, shall be subject to an appeal in the manner prescribed in this chapter.

     C.      The body which originally granted the permit shall make its findings and decision within forty days after the conclusion of the hearing by a formal and numbered resolution. After revocation, the subject property shall conform to all regulations of the zone in which it is located.

     The action of the city council shall be final and conclusive. (Ord. 485 § 16, 1992)

 

17.30.465 Time limit.
     Any permit shall be null and void to the extent the grant permitted thereunder is not exercised within the time specified in the minute order approving such permit, or if no time is so specified, to the extent the same is not exercised within one year from the date the permit is granted; provided that the granting body, upon request of applicant showing good cause, may extend the time limitations imposed by this section for a period not to exceed one year. (Ord. 485 § 16, 1992)

 

17.30.470 Modification.
     Any condition imposed upon the granting of a permit may be modified or eliminated, or new conditions may be added, provided that the granting body shall first conduct public hearings thereon, in the same manner as required for the granting of the same:

     A.      No such modification shall be made unless the hearing body finds that such modification is necessary to protect the public interest, or, in the case of deletion of such a condition, that such action is necessary to permit reasonable operation under the permit;

     B.      All planning commission determinations regarding modification proceedings shall be subject to an appeal as set forth in this title (Ord. 485 § 16, 1992)

Chapter 17.32 RESIDENTIAL ZONES (R-1, R-2, R-3 AND R-4)
17.32.010 Purpose and intent.
     The purposes of the individual residential zones and the manner in which they are applied are as follows.

     A.      R-1 Single-Family Residential Zone (Zero to Four Dwelling Units/Acre). The intent of the single-family residential zone is to accommodate traditional single-family houses and subdivisions on relatively flat areas of the city and to support accessory dwelling units consistent with state law. The allowable density ranges from zero to four dwelling units per acre. This zone implements the general plan low density residential land use designation.

     B.      R-2 Medium Density Residential Zone (Zero to Nine Dwelling Units/Acre). The intent of the medium density two-family residential zone is to accommodate single-family and duplex types of residential development, with appropriate amenities for the residents. The allowable density ranges from zero to nine dwelling units per acre. This zone implements the general plan medium density residential land use designation.

     C.      R-3 High Density Residential Zone (Zero to Thirteen Dwelling Units/Acre). The intent of the high density multifamily zone is to accommodate and encourage multifamily residential uses consisting of low-rise (one to three stories in height) apartment, condominium, and townhouse style development, with appropriate amenities for the residents and common and private open spaces. The allowable density ranges from zero to thirteen dwelling units per acre. This zone implements the general plan high density residential land use designation.

     D.      R-4 Very High Density Residential Zone (Zero to Twenty Dwelling Units/Acre). The intent of the very high density multifamily zone is to accommodate and encourage multifamily residential uses consisting of low- rise (one to three stories in height) apartment, condominium, and townhouse style development, with appropriate amenities for the residents and common and private open spaces. The allowable density ranges from zero to twenty dwelling units per acre. This zone implements the general plan very high density residential land use designation. (Ord. 739 § 4, 2017)

 

17.32.020 Land use regulations and allowable uses.
     A.      Table 2-1. Table 2-1 indicates the uses allowed within each residential zone and any permits required to establish the use, in compliance with Chapter 17.30 (Administration) and Chapters 17.30.410 (Hearings) through 17.30.470 (Modification), inclusive.

     B.      Primary and Accessory Uses. Residential uses represent the primary allowed use, and only those additional uses that are complementary to, and can exist in harmony with, the residential character of each zone may be allowed as accessory, conditionally permitted, and/or temporary uses. Accessory uses deemed appropriate may only be allowed when provided as a secondary use on property for which a legally allowed residential unit exists or is proposed in conjunction with establishment of the accessory use, except as may be otherwise allowed in Chapter 17.22 (Nonconforming Uses).

     C.      Prohibited Land Uses. Any table cell with a
“—” means that the listed land use is prohibited in that specific zone.

     D.      Land Uses Not Listed in Table 2-1. Land uses that are not listed in Table 2-1 or are not shown in another zone are not allowed, except as otherwise provided by Section 17.02.040 (Interpretation by city council).

     E.      Additional Regulations. Where the last column in the Table 2-1 includes a chapter or section number, the regulations in the referenced chapter or section shall apply to the use. Provisions in other sections of this title may also apply.

     F.      Precise Plan of Design Review. See Sections 17.30.260 (Precise plan of design—Required when) through 17.30.300 (Precise plan of design—Conditional approval), inclusive, requirements for new or modified construction activities.

     G.      Definitions. See Chapter 17.02 (Introduction and Definitions) for land use definitions and explanations.

     H.     General Plan Considerations. Development must conform with the General Plan, Hillside Conservation Measure, Hillside Development Control Measure, Growth Management Element of the General Plan, and South Hills Preservation Measure.

Notes:

1.    Garage entrances shall face side parcel lines on all parcels having front setbacks of less than 25 feet. The minimum garage setbacks shall be 20 feet measured from the face of the garage door to the front property line.

2.    All front setbacks in a subdivision shall average a minimum of not less than 25 feet.

3.    No portion of a second story wall shall be closer than 10 feet to the property line; however, if the greater side setback has an unobstructed graded area on that side intended for garage use suitable for vehicle parking, a side setback may be allowed having a minimum dimension from the structure to the property line of 10 feet open from ground to sky, however, in no case less than 12 feet from the structure’s exterior wall to the property line.

4.    Carport structures may be allowed on side property lines to not less than five feet from the rear property lines. The structures shall be fire rated in compliance with the Uniform Building Code and may be required to be screened for aesthetic purposes. No structure shall be allowed within the front setback or exterior side setback on corner parcels or within 15 feet of an exterior side (street side) property line within the rear setback of corner parcels. All carport structures shall be subject to the review of the director.

5.    Accessory Structures. Accessory structures both attached and detached shall be allowed under the same standards as the main structures, except that detached one-story accessory structures may have a rear setback of 5 feet. Attached patios which are completely unenclosed, except for fully ventilated screening, may come to within not less than 5 feet of the rear property line.

6.    Density Designation. The ordinance establishing any residential zone may contain a number suffixed with the zone symbol. The number shall be the number of square feet of total parcel area allocated to each dwelling unit. The designation may be indicated on the Zoning Map (e.g., R-2-3000, R-2-36000). The designation shall not exceed the density specified in the General Plan.

7.    R-2: Height. When abutting an R-1 zone, no structure shall exceed one story in height within 50 feet of the subject boundary and shall not exceed 2 stories within 100 feet of the subject boundary.

8.    R-2, R-3, and R-4: Open Space Requirements. The open space areas shall not include any type of roofed or enclosed structure (except a specifically designated recreation structure), driveway, driveway easement, open parking, or required front or exterior side setbacks. Equipped outdoor recreation areas containing swimming pools, children’s playgrounds with equipment, tennis, volleyball, shuffleboard, or handball courts, and similar facilities may be counted as one square foot of area fulfilling 2 square feet of the required open space area as may be determined by the director. The director’s determinations may be appealed directly to the council.

9.    R-2, R-3, and R-4: Private Balconies and Patios. Private balcony and patio areas may be utilized to fulfill not more than 50 percent of the open space requirement, provided the areas have direct access from the dwelling unit it is designed to serve, a minimum dimension of seven feet, and a minimum area of 70 square feet.

10.  R-3 and R-4: Accessory Structures.

a.     Accessory structures except carport structures and enclosed storage structures as specified in Section 17.38.130(B) shall observe the same front, side, and rear setbacks as the main structures.

b.     Enclosed storage structures are allowed on the property line as specified in Section 17.38.080 provided that all of the following conditions are met:

(1)     The minimum acreage of the related development project shall be 3.5 acres;

(2)     The enclosed storage structure shall not exceed 1,000 square feet in area and one story in height;

(3)     A conditional use permit and precise plan of design application in compliance with provisions of this Development Code shall be required;

(4)     The enclosed storage structure shall be allowed on property lines that are adjacent to zoning designations that allow development equal to or more intense than the R-3 zone; and

(5)     Subject to a finding by the council that there is no other reasonable location for the enclosed storage structure on the subject property.

c.     The minimum distance between accessory and main structures and accessory structures shall be 10 feet exclusive of any vehicular accessway or parking area with an additional 10 feet for each story over one on the accessory structure.

d.     Garages or carports opening onto an alley shall supply a minimum turning radius of 25 feet to the opposite side of the alley.

11.  R-3 and R-4: Garages and Parking Areas. When a parcel abuts an arterial highway, as depicted on the Master Plan of Arterial Highways, and an alley or local street, access to all garages and parking spaces shall be from the alleys or local streets and not from the arterial highway. No more than 2 garage spaces shall take access directly from a local street for each 65 feet of parcel frontage on a local street. No open parking shall take access directly from a local street. Any garage entered directly from the street shall have a minimum setback of 20 feet from the ultimate right-of-way, measured from the face of the garage door to the front property line.

12.  R-3 and R-4: Side and Rear Setbacks. The interior side setback shall be maintained free and unencumbered from the ground to the sky and shall not be used for any driveway, parking space, or access. If a dwelling unit faces an interior side setback, the minimum required setback shall be the same as that required for a front setback (20 feet) with an additional five feet supplied for each additional story above a one-story structure.

13.  Landscaping. Any part of a developed parcel that is visible from the street, including turf on separated parkways, shall be landscaped in compliance with Section 17.02.215 (Landscaping). On a natural slope, the slope may be left in its natural condition or as otherwise required; however, a manufactured slope shall be landscaped. All lawns, yards, and gardens visible from the street shall be maintained in a manner which creates a neat, clean, and orderly appearance and which prevents visual blight and property deterioration. Pruning, mowing and edging of lawns, weeding, removal of litter, fertilizing, and regular watering of all plantings are examples of proper maintenance. All dead plants shall be replaced. Landscaping shall be maintained by the property owner or any occupant or person in charge or control of the subject property.

14.  Minimum Floor Area. For purposes of this section, any separately enclosed, habitable room shown on a submitted floor plan shall be considered a bedroom regardless of designation as a “den,” “family room,” “study,” or similar room. No balcony, patio, porch, or similar feature shall be considered in determining unit floor area.

Chapter 17.36 HILLSIDE RESIDENTIAL ZONES (HR-C, HR-LD, HR-MD, HR-RE, HR-VL AND HR-SH)
17.36.010 Intent and purpose.
     A.      Intent. The intent of the hillside residential zone is to provide opportunities for hillside residential development approaches, including clustering of development consistent with the General Plan and policy directives associated with the Hillside Conservation Measure, Hillside Development Control Measure, Growth Management Element of the General Plan, and South Hills Preservation Measure (that balance preservation of hillside environments with the city’s desire to accommodate single-family neighborhoods on large parcels) including rural-type development.

     B.      Purpose. The purposes of the individual hillside residential zones and the manner in which they are applied are as follows.

     1.      HR-C Hillside Conservation (Zero to One Dwelling Unit per Ten Acres). The purpose of the hillside conservation zone is to accommodate extremely low density single-family residential homes in the hillside conservation area. The allowable density for this category ranges from zero to one dwelling unit per ten acres.

     2.      HR-LD Low Density Hillside Preservation (Zero to One Dwelling Unit per Ten Acres). The purpose of the low density hillside preservation zone is to accommodate low density single-family residential homes in the hillside preservation area. The allowable density for this category ranges from zero to one dwelling unit per ten acres.

     3.      HR-MD Medium Density Hillside Preservation (Zero to One Dwelling Unit per Five Acres). The purpose of the medium density hillside preservation zone is to accommodate low density single-family residential homes in the hillside preservation area. The allowable density for this category ranges from zero to one dwelling unit per five acres.

     4.      HR-RE Rural Estates (Zero to One Dwelling Unit per Acre). The purpose of the rural estates zone is to accommodate single-family homes in a rural setting. The allowable density for this category ranges from zero to one dwelling unit per acre.

     5.      HR-VL Very Low Density (Zero to Two Dwelling Units per Acre). The purpose of the very low density zone is to accommodate single-family homes in a rural setting. The allowable density for this category ranges from zero to two dwelling units per acre. (Ord. 739 § 4, 2017)

 

17.36.020 Land use regulations and allowable uses.
     A.      Table 2-3. Table 2-3 indicates the uses allowed within each hillside residential zone and any permits required to establish the use, in compliance with Chapter 17.30 (Administration) and Chapters 17.30.410 (Hearings) through 17.30.470 (Modification), inclusive.

     B.      Primary and Accessory Uses. Residential uses represent the primary allowed use, and only those additional uses that are complementary to, and can exist in harmony with, the hillside residential character of each zone may be allowed as accessory, conditionally permitted, and/or temporary uses. Accessory uses deemed appropriate may only be allowed when provided as a secondary use on property for which a legally allowed residential unit exists or is proposed in conjunction with establishment of the accessory use, except as may be otherwise allowed in Chapter 17.22 (Nonconforming Uses).

     C.      Prohibited Land Uses. Any table cell with a
“—” means that the listed land use is prohibited in that specific zone.

     D.      Land Uses Not Listed in Table 2-3. Land uses that are not listed in Table 2-3 or are not shown in another zone are not allowed, except as otherwise provided by Section 17.02.040 (Interpretation by city council).

     E.      Additional Regulations. Where the last column in Table 2-3 includes a chapter or section number, the regulations in the referenced chapter or section shall apply to the use. Provisions in other sections of this title may also apply.

     F.      Precise Plan of Design Review. See Sections 17.30.260 (Precise plan of design—Required when) through 17.30.300 (Precise plan of design—Conditional approval), inclusive, requirements for new or modified construction activities.

     G.      Definitions. See Chapter 17.02 (Introduction and Definitions) for land use definitions and explanations.

     H.     General Plan Considerations. Development must conform with the General Plan, Hillside Conservation Measure, Residential and Hillside Development Control Measure, Growth Management Element of the general Plan, and South Hills Preservation Measure.

Notes:

1.    No portion of a second story wall shall be closer than 30 feet to the property line; however, if the greater side setback has an unobstructed graded area on that side intended for garage use suitable for vehicle parking, a side setback may be allowed having a minimum dimension from the structure to the property line of 30 feet open from ground to sky.

2.    Carport structures may be allowed on side property lines to not less than 5 feet from the rear property lines. The structures shall be fire rated in compliance with the Uniform Building Code and may be required to be screened for aesthetic purposes. No structure shall be allowed within the front setback or exterior side setback on corner parcels or within 15 feet of an exterior side (street side) property line within the rear setback of corner parcels. All carport structures shall be subject to the review of the director.

3.    Accessory Structures. Accessory structures both attached and detached shall be allowed under the same standards as the main structures, except that detached one-story accessory structures may have a rear setback of 5 feet. Attached patios which are completely unenclosed, except for fully ventilated screening, may come to within not less than 5 feet of the rear property line.

4.    Permitted Development. The city shall only allow future development within the hillside preservation area, the hillside conservation area, and the expanded hillside area which:

a.  Protects the area’s natural environment and sensitive environmental features, as well as public health and safety, maximizing the preservation of land in permanent public open space;

b.  Ensures that the design and layout of future hillside development adapts to the natural hillside topography; and

c.  Minimizes the need for and costs of providing infrastructure, utilities, and public services to all hillside areas.

5.    Preservation of Natural Scenic Vistas and View Shed Areas.

a.  Preservation of Vistas. New development shall only be approved if it preserves scenic vistas of natural hillside areas and ridgelines.

b.  Minimization of View Shed Intrusion. New development shall only be approved if it minimizes wall surfaces facing towards view shed areas through the use of split pads, varying setbacks, low roof pitches, and landscaping.

c.  Architectural Compatibility. New development shall only be approved if it uses architectural style which is compatible with the natural setting. The use of colors, textures, materials, and forms which will attract attention shall be avoided.

d.  Massing and Scale. The overall scale and massing of structures shall respect the natural surroundings by incorporating designs which minimize bulk and mass, and minimize visual intrusion on the natural landscape. Structures shall be sited to best fit with a hillside’s natural contours in hillside areas.

6.    Ridgeline Setbacks. Development shall be set back from primary ridgelines 100 feet horizontally and 100 feet vertically. “Primary ridgelines” include ridgelines having any of the following characteristics:

a.  Ridges that have a difference in elevation of at least 200 feet from the toe of slope of the valley floor or the toe of slope of any canyon floor.

b.  Ridges which, prior to grading, are visible, or which would be visible but for manmade obstructions such as buildings or houses.

c.  Ridges that form a prominent landform in the foreground, a major skyline ridge in the background, or one of the layers of ridges that may be visible in between, or which would be visible but for man-made obstructions such as buildings or houses.

d.  Ridges that frame major visual access when a person is traveling through the hillside preservation area, the hillside conservation area or the expanded hillside area and will provide the first view of valley and canyon areas as a traveler emerges from the other side of the ridge.

7.    Grading.

a.  Focused Grading Required. Focused grading is defined as the minimum grading required for access roads, the grading necessary for the extension of city services, and/or the grading of no more than the size of the footprint of the house and ancillary structures on each individual parcel, with each footprint and ancillary structures separated from each adjacent parcel by ungraded, natural terrain. Mass grading is defined as any grading that does not meet the definition of focused grading.

b.  Mass Grading Prohibited. Mass grading on any primary ridgeline or any northerly facing slope is prohibited.

c.  Slope Conforming Foundations Required. Development shall preserve natural scenic vistas were the natural slope is 15 percent or greater by requiring building foundations for structures to conform to the natural slope to minimize grading and other environmental impacts and to ensure that roof lines do not eliminate or obstruct ridgelines.

8.    Average Slope and Parcel Coverage Standards.

a.  For the purposes of this subsection, the average slope of any parcel shall be determined by the following formula.

 

S = .0023IL

A

 

Where: S is the average slope expressed as a percent; I is contour interval in feet; L is the combined length of contour lines in scale feet; and A is the gross area in acres of the parcel.

 

b.  The calculation of the average slope, S, shall be prepared by a registered civil engineer or land surveyor using the following criteria:

c.  The contour map shall have a maximum interval of 10 feet;

d.  An interval of 2 feet shall be used for calculation of the average slope and shall be interpolated if necessary;

e.  The scale of development plans and topographic maps shall be no smaller than:

(1) For a parcel smaller than 2 acres, one inch equals 20 feet,

(2) For a parcel from 2 to 20 acres, one inch equals 50 feet,

(3) For a parcel larger than 20 acres, one inch equals 100 feet,

f.   The plans and maps shall be in compliance with the requirements for tentative maps established by the Subdivision Code.

9.  The maximum parcel coverage on a parcel located within the hillside residential zones shall be as specified in the following table:

Chapter 17.40 COMMERCIAL AND INDUSTRIAL ZONES (BP, C1, C2, CM AND CO)
17.40.010 Purpose and intent.
     The purposes of the individual commercial zones and the manner in which they are applied are as follows.

     A.      B-P Business Park Zone. The intent of the business park zone is to provide locations for professional offices, research and development activities, and light industrial uses that contribute both revenues and jobs to the local economy. Limited retail or service uses designed to meet the business needs of offices or the personal needs of office workers are also allowed. Development profiles may consist of low- to high-rise developments (one to five stories in height) constructed either as stand-alone structures or a coordinated project in terms of site layout, architectural design, and landscaping to form a campus-like setting. The community seeks to expand these types of uses by attracting firms that are related to the medical technology field, or that would benefit from the medical advances associated with businesses and institutions in the city. This zone implements the general plan business park land use designation.

     B.      C-O Office Commercial Zone (Administrative and Professional Office Zone). The intent of the office commercial zone is to accommodate professional and medical office uses. However, commercial uses that support the office uses or office workers (e.g., office supply stores, copy services, pharmacies, day care, restaurants, dry cleaners, and sundry stores) are also allowed. Development intensity may vary from one to five stories in height depending on adjacent uses, with lower-rise structures required adjacent to residential development. This zone implements the general plan office land use designation.

     C.      C-1 Neighborhood Business Zone. The intent of the neighborhood business zone is to provide locations for shopping and commercial service businesses that cater to the daily needs of the residential community and local workers. Examples of intended development include neighborhood shopping centers, specialty shops, and stand-alone commercial uses. This zone also allows limited office and religious assembly uses that are incorporated into commercial development (e.g., offices in small storefronts, or religious assembly uses in structures originally designed for commercial uses) if the dominant character of the overall development remains commercial. The overall character of uses in this zone is one of low impact in terms of traffic generation, noise, and other features that might adversely affect adjacent residential neighborhoods. This zone implements the general plan commercial land use designation.

     D.      C-2 General Commercial Zone. The intent of the general commercial zone is to accommodate the shopping and commercial service needs of the residential community, local workers, and visitors to the city. Examples of intended development include larger shopping centers and in-line shops, hotels/motels, specialty shops, and stand-alone commercial uses. This zone also allows a limited number of religious assembly uses incorporated into commercial development if the dominant character of the overall development remains commercial. This zone implements the general plan commercial land use designation.

     E.      C-M Commercial Manufacturing Zone. The intent of the commercial manufacturing zone is to accommodate light industrial uses (e.g., manufacturing, assembly, warehousing, and distribution businesses) that have limited or no impact related to air quality, electrical or electronic interference, hazardous materials, light and glare, liquid and solid wastes, noise, odors, ground vibration, or water quality. Warehousing and distribution uses are limited to those uses that generate a relatively low number of vehicle trips. Office uses that are ancillary to the principal commercial or manufacturing uses are allowed. This zone implements the general plan industrial land use designation. (Ord. 752 §§ 1, 2, 2018;

Ord. 739 § 4, 2017)

 

17.40.020 Land use regulations and allowable uses.
     A.      Table 2-5. Table 2-5 indicates the uses allowed within each residential zone and any permits required to establish the use, in compliance with Chapter 17.30 (Administration) and Chapters 17.30.410 (Hearings) through 17.30.470 (Modification), inclusive.

     B.      Prohibited Land Uses. Any table cell with a  “—” means that the listed land use is prohibited in that specific zone.

     C.      Land Uses Not Listed in Table 2-5. Land uses that are not listed in Table 2-5 or are not shown in another zone are not allowed, except as otherwise provided by Section 17.02.040 (Interpretation by city council).

     D.      Additional Regulations. Where the last column in the Table 2-5 includes a chapter or section number, the regulations in the referenced chapter or section shall apply to the use. Provisions in other sections of this title may also apply.

     E.      Precise Plan of Design Review. See Sections 17.30.260 (Precise plan of design—Required when) through 17.30.300 (Precise plan of design—Conditional

approval), inclusive, requirements for new or modified construction activities.

     F.      Definitions. See Chapter 17.02 (Introduction and Definitions) for land use definitions and explanations.

Chapter 17.44 SPECIAL PURPOSE ZONES (I-HC, OS, PC AND PF) AND SPECIFIC PLANS
17.44.010 Purpose and intent.
     The purposes of the individual special purpose zones, including specific plans, and the manner in which they are applied are as follows.

     A.      I-HC Institutional-Health Care Zone. The primary intent of the institutional-health care zone is to accommodate hospitals, medical clinics, medical research facilities, rehabilitation centers, and residential facilities that provide a high degree of medical care and supervision. This zone also allows employee housing as an accessory use. The zone also accommodates educational institutions and religious assembly uses including the Loma Linda University campus inclusive of lecture halls, administration, classroom, laboratory, and service buildings. Also allowed is student housing (dorms, detached or attached dwelling units) and employee housing (detached or attached dwelling units). This zone also accommodates educational uses and religious assembly uses, inclusive of assembly areas or structures, classrooms, religious administrative offices, and limited accessory residential facilities. This zone implements the general plan health care land use designation.

     B.      OS Open Space Zone. The intent of the open space zone is to define properties reserved for the preservation of wilderness areas for passive recreational use and other undeveloped recreation lands. Development of structures is prohibited, except for those structures that may be ancillary to a passive recreational use (e.g., restrooms and small service buildings). This zone implements the general plan public open space land use designation.

     C.      PC Planned Community Zone. The intent of the planned community zone is to accommodate flexibility in development, encourage creative and imaginative design, and provide for development of parcels of land as coordinated projects involving a mixture of residential densities and housing types, community facilities both public and private and commercial areas. This zone is further intended to accommodate the optimum integration of urban and natural amenities within developments. The planned community zone allows for creation of unique use regulations and development standards for a development project, provided the regulations and standards clearly implement general plan policy and subsequent project proposals under the planned community zone reflect the character envisioned by the city at the time of planned community zone approval. This zone implements various general plan land use designations and can be used to implement the special planning area designation.

     D.      PF Public Facilities Zone. The intent of the public facilities zone is to accommodate civic, government, quasi-public uses (e.g., utility easements), and public parks and recreational facilities. Civic uses include a range of uses and facilities that support government service operations (e.g., City Hall, fire stations, parks, and senior and community centers). This zone implements the general plan city facilities, institutional and parks land use designations.

     E.      Specific Plans. Authority for the specific plan is established by California Government Code, Title 8, Division 1, Chapter 3, Article 8, Sections 65450 through 65457, which grants authority to cities to adopt specific plans for the purposes of implementing the goals and policies of their general plans. A specific plan must be consistent with the adopted general plan of the jurisdiction within which it is located. In turn, all subsequent subdivision, development, public works projects and zoning regulations for the defined area must be consistent with the adopted specific plan. A draft specific plan presented for review by the city shall include detailed information in the form of text and diagrams, organized in an outline and format approved by the community development director and in compliance with state law (California Government Code Section 65451). After the adoption of a specific plan, subsequent projects to implement the specific plan may be approved or adopted within an area covered by a specific plan only if first found consistent with the specific plan. The city council may impose a specific plan fee surcharge on development permits within the specific plan area, in compliance with state law (California Government Code Section 65456).

     Adopted specific plans, along with a summary description of each, are identified in Table SP.

General Description of Special Plan

The Groves at Loma Linda Specific Plan

(Ordinance No. O 2018-04; Case File No. SPA/ZMA 17-193 adopted June 26, 2018)

A 299.81 acre area, within the corporate limit of the city of Loma Linda, coincident with an area identified in the Loma Linda General Plan as special planning area D. The Groves at Loma Linda Specific Plan (aka The Groves) establishes land uses, development standards, design guidelines and implementation program for this area consistent with implementing policies in General Plan Section 2.2.7.4, including Table 2-B, and voter-approved Measure V. The allowed land uses, development standards and complete specific plan components for The Groves are on file with the community development department and the city clerk.

 

     The allowed uses and development standards for specific plans are developed as part of the project approval process. The allowed uses and development standards for the above established specific plans are on file with the community development department and the city clerk. (Ord. 748 § 4, 2018; Ord. 739 § 4, 2017)

 

 

17.44.020 Land use regulations and allowable uses.
     A.      Table 2-7. Table 2-7 indicates the uses allowed within each special purpose zone and any permits required to establish the use, in compliance with Chapter 17.30 (Administration) and Sections 17.30.410 (Hearings) through 17.30.470 (Modification), inclusive. Unless specifically stated otherwise, the allowed uses for specific plans are determined as part of the project/plan approval process and are as set forth in the adopted specific plan.

     B.      Prohibited Land Uses. Any table cell with a  “—” means that the listed land use is prohibited in that specific zone.

     C.      Land Uses Not Listed in Table 2-7. Land uses that are not listed in Table 2-7 or are not shown in another zone are not allowed, except as otherwise provided by Section 17.02.040 (Interpretation by city council).

     D.      Additional Regulations. Where the last column in Table 2-7 includes a chapter or section number, the regulations in the referenced chapter or section shall apply to the use. Provisions in other sections of this title may also apply.

     E.      Precise Plan of Design Review. See Sections 17.30.260 (Precise plan of design—Required when) through 17.30.300 (Precise plan of design—Conditional approval), inclusive, requirements for new or modified construction activities.

     F.      Definitions. See Chapter 17.02 (Introduction and Definitions) for land use definitions and explanations.

(Ord. 748 § 4, 2018; Ord. 739 § 4, 2017)

Chapter 17.48 COMBINING/OVERLAY ZONES (FP, GH, HM AND PD)
17.48.010 Applicability.
     A.      Applicability.

     1.      The applicability of any combining/overlay zone to specific sites is illustrated by the overlay zoning map symbol established by Section 17.04.050 (Zones established).

     2.      Combining/overlay zones will generally be applied to areas that have different underlying zones, but have unique features or characteristics that are common to the parcels that are located within the combining/overlay zone.

     B.      Identification. Combining/overlay zones shall be identified by suffixing the applicable combining/overlay letters next to the underlying zoning map’s symbol.

     C.      In the Event of Conflicts. In the event of any conflict between the provisions of this chapter and any other provision of Title 17, this chapter shall control. (Ord. 739 § 4, 2017)

 

17.48.020 Purpose and intent.
     The purposes of the individual combining/overlay zones and the manner in which they are applied are as follows:

     A.      FP Floodplain Overlay Zone. The intent of the floodplain overlay zone is to safeguard those areas of the city subject to periodic flooding and accompanying hazards, with the objective of promoting health, safety, and general welfare of the people of the city. This overlay zone implements various general plan land use designations. The objectives of the floodplain overlay zone are:

     1.      To prohibit occupancy or the encroachment of any structure, improvement, or development that would obstruct the natural flow of floodwaters within a designated floodway on the floodplain;

     2.      To keep developments in the remainder of the floodplain above the design flood flow elevation; and

     3.      To prevent economic loss caused by excessive flooding and to prevent loss of life or property.

     B.      GH Geologic Hazards Overlay Zone. The intent of the geologic hazards overlay zone is to provide for suitable protection for areas subject to the threat of loss, life, and/or personal property due to seismic shaking and resultant ruptures or ground failure, landslides, and other potential geologic hazards. More specifically, this overlay zone will allow the city to exercise the mandated approval authority within special study zones as established by the state geologist required by the provisions of the Geologic Hazards Zones Act (Chapter 7.5, Division 2, of the California Public Resources Code). This overlay zone implements various general plan land use designations.

     C.      H Historic Mission Overlay Zone.

     1.      The intent of the historic mission overlay zone is to accommodate a basic framework for future development to achieve the following objectives:

     a.      To preserve and enhance the Mission Road area and associated historical and cultural resources;

     b.      To preserve and enhance the rural atmosphere of the area;

     c.       To facilitate the continued use and enjoyment of existing properties by focusing on new development projects and/or rehabilitation, restoration, and adaptive reuse of historical and/or cultural resources;

     d.      To allow for consistent, compatible, and complementary development of the vacant properties within the Mission Road area; and

     e.       To encourage pedestrian friendly new development in the area through the incorporation of livable/walkable community concepts.

     2.      This overlay zone implements various general plan land use designations.

     D.      PD Planned Development Overlay Zone.

     1.      The intent of the planned development overlay zone is to provide opportunities for nontraditional approaches to residential development. Using this overlay zone, applicants can craft unique development standards, provided that the density complies with that established for the underlying zone and all applicable general plan policies, and further provided that the development plan:

     a.      Preserves natural land features, open space, and other valuable and desirable environmental features of a particular area;

     b.      Provides for specified community benefits not otherwise required for development in the underlying zone as a trade-off for deviating from the otherwise applicable development standards;

     c.       Clearly demonstrates compatibility of use with respect to existing and future developments in the surrounding areas;

     d.      Provides for specified community benefits not otherwise required for development in the underlying zone as a trade-off for deviating from the otherwise applicable development standards; and

     e.       Clearly demonstrates compatibility of use with respect to existing and future developments in the surrounding areas.

     2.      This overlay zone shall only be applied to suitable properties classified in the commercial, institutional, mixed use, and residential zones. This zone implements various general plan land use designations. (Ord. 739 § 4, 2017)

Chapter 17.54 H HILLSIDE DEVELOPMENT SUFFIX ZONE
17.54.010 Purposes.
     The Hillside Development Suffix is established in order to:

     A.      Regulate use, development, and alteration of land in hill areas so that essential natural characteristics such as land form, vegetation and wildlife communities, scenic qualities, and open space can be substantially maintained;

     B.      Preserve unique and significant geologic, biologic, and hydrologic features of public value;

     C.      Encourage, in hill areas, alternative approaches to conventional flat land construction practices;

     D.      To achieve land use patterns and intensities that are consistent with the natural characteristics of hill areas such as slope, land form, vegetation, and scenic quality;

     E.      Protect predominant views of and from hill areas in order to maintain the identity, image, and environmental quality of the city;

     F.      To achieve land use densities that are in keeping with the general plan; however, in order to retain the significant natural features of the hill areas, land coverage (not density) will diminish as the slope of the terrain increases. (Ord. 98 § 50.01, 1974)

     I.       The commission shall not recommend that a resource be removed from the city’s list of designated cultural resources unless it is discovered that the information relied on by the commission and the city council in making the original decision was erroneous or false, or that circumstances wholly beyond the owner’s control have rendered the resource ineligible for designation based on the criteria listed in Section 17.80.070, and it would be infeasible to restore the resource, or for other good cause.

Using the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Historic Preservation Projects as a guide, the commission and city council shall approve the issuance of a certificate of appropriateness for any proposed work if and only if it makes any one of the following findings:

     1.      With regards to a designated resource, the proposed work will neither adversely affect the significant architectural features of the designated resource nor adversely affect the character of historical, architectural, or aesthetic interest or value of the designated resource and its site;

     2.      With regard to any property located within a historic district, the proposed work conforms to the prescriptive standards and design guidelines for the district adopted by the commission, and does not adversely affect the character of the district;

A certificate of appropriateness shall become void unless a building permit is obtained or for applications not requiring a permit work is commenced within twelve months of the date of issuance. Certificates of appropriateness may be renewed for an additional twelve-month period at the discretion of the historical commission. If the building permit obtained pursuant to a certificate of appropriateness expires, a new certificate of appropriateness is required.

     K.      If no building or other permit is required to pursue work on a designated resource, whoever is responsible for the work, whether it is the tenant, resident, or property owners, shall apply for a certificate of appropriateness to the commission staff directly.

     L.      For any designated cultural resource, the commission may give a certificate of appropriateness on approval of the city council for a change of use of a property not otherwise permitted by zoning provided the following findings can be made:

     1.      The change of use is required for an adaptive re-use of the resource and is compatible with the neighborhood in which it is located;

     5.      The applicant has made reasonable efforts to secure the facade or other features of the resource in perpetuity;

     6.      The change of use is to a use of the following types:

     a.      Small-scale office uses with limited employment and visitation needs, including but not limited to offices for an architect, landscape architect, interior designer, graphic artist, real estate broker, consulting firm, attorney, and artist studios, or

When the commission has approved a plan for the preservation of a cultural resource, historic district, or neighborhood conservation area which sets forth particular development standards, an application to the commission to do work consistent with the approved plan development standards may be approved by the staff person designated by the commission. If such staff person does not approve the application, it shall be processed as set forth in this chapter and considered by the commission. (Ord. 482 § 1, 1992)

Written notice of the determination shall be provided in the same manner as required by Section 17.80.080.

     C.      If the applicant presents facts and clear evidence demonstrating to the commission that failure to approve the application for a certificate of appropriateness will cause an immediate extreme hardship because of conditions peculiar to the particular structure or other feature involved, and the damage to the owner of the property is unreasonable in comparison to the benefit conferred to the community, the commission may approve or conditionally approve such certificate even though it does not meet the standards set forth herein. The commission shall hold a public hearing in order to determine whether a certificate of appropriateness will be approved or denied. A certificate of economic hardship shall be accompanied by a written determination, based on the following findings:

     3.      An adaptive reuse study has been conducted and found that utilization of the property for lawful purposes is prohibited or impractical;

     4.      Rental at a reasonable rate of return is not feasible;

     3.      Estimated market value of the property in its current condition; estimated market value after completion of the proposed construction, alteration, demolition, or removal; after any changes recommended by the commission; and, in the case of a proposed demolition, after renovation of the existing property for continued use;

The Mission Road Historic District, Final Report (Report), (The Dangermond Group, May 22, 2002) is a synthesis of several studies historical and archaeological studies of the area and the efforts of the city’s elected officials, historical and planning commissions, area residents and stakeholders to balance the competing interests for historic preservation, continued use of existing properties, and development of vacant properties in the mission road area. The report shall be used as the primary reference document for the implementation of the ordinance codified in this chapter and projects subject to this chapter shall be consistent with the recommendations of the report unless otherwise waived by the city council. (Ord. 623 § 2, 2004)

 

17.82.020 Intent.
     Therefore, the intent of the historic mission overlay district ordinance is to provide a basic framework for future development that will:

     A.      Preserve and enhance the Mission Road area and associated historical and cultural resources;

     B.      Preserve and enhance the rural atmosphere of the area;

     C.      Allow for the continued use and enjoyment of existing properties by limiting the focus of the ordinance codified in this chapter to new development projects and/or rehabilitation, restoration, adaptive reuse, and demolition of historical and/or cultural resources;

     D.      Allow for consistent, compatible, and complementary development of the vacant properties (structures and lands) within the Mission Road area; and, encourage that all new development in the area is pedestrian friendly through the incorporation of livable/walkable community concepts.

     It is also intended that this chapter be consistent with and a companion document to Chapter 17.80, Historic Preservation of the Loma Linda Municipal Code and other chapters of this code, as applicable. (Ord. 623 § 3, 2004)

 

17.82.030 Definitions.
“Flow of history” means the primary theme of the historic mission overlay district that refers to the zanja, which had a major impact on irrigation and agriculture, and influenced the landscape and land use and development patterns in the area.

“Guachama (wah-cha-ma)” means the Native American village that was once located in the vicinity of Mission Road and the Edison Easement.

“Guachama rancheria” means an adobe mission storehouse/mayordomo residence that was built in 1819 as part of the establishment of the San Bernardino Rancho, an outpost of the Mission San Gabriel.

“Rural atmosphere” means the pervading or surrounding influence, reminiscent of the farming and citrus period of history, that lends a feeling of openness and space.

“Zanja (zahn-hah)” means a water ditch that was constructed by the Guachama Indians under the direction of Pedro Alvarez to bring water for irrigation from its intake on Mill Creek near what is now Mentone to the San Bernardino Rancho buildings at Guachama. The zanja serves as the most important unifying element of the historic mission overlay district.

     The definitions of historic preservation terminologies that are contained in Section 17.80.040, Definitions shall also apply to this chapter. (Ord. 623 § 4, 2004)

 

17.82.040 Scope and district boundaries.
     The requirements of this chapter shall apply to all cultural resources that are more than fifty years old, new development projects, and adaptive reuse, rehabilitation, restoration, and demolition of existing structures and landscape materials and features within the historic mission overlay district (as defined, below).

     The district boundaries are Redlands Boulevard on the north, San Timoteo Creek on the south, California Street on the east, and Mountain View Avenue on the west. The western boundary extends further west to include the Van Leuven Mansion. The boundary is also extended east of California Street to include a future study area that is roughly bounded by Orange Avenue on the north, city limits on the south, New Jersey Street on the east (and a small extension east of New Jersey Street fronting on Barton Road), and California Street on the west.

     The San Bernardino County unincorporated area, which is located approximately five hundred feet south of Redlands Boulevard, east and adjacent to Mountain View Avenue, west and adjacent to the Edison Easement, and north and adjacent to Mission Road, and commonly known as the Petersen Tract, is excluded from the district boundaries, but included as a future study area. (Ord. 623 § 5, 2004)

 

17.82.050 Primary historical themes.
     A.      Flow of History. Previous studies, including the report, have identified the most important unifying element in the historic mission overlay district area as the zanja. The zanja was built by Native Americans under the direction of the Spanish mission authorities and had a major impact on irrigation and agriculture. It influenced the landscape and land use development patterns in the area and represents the “Flow of History” over time and claims title to the significance of the historic overlay district. The primary historical theme for the historic mission overlay district shall be the “Flow of History.” Future development projects shall be required to submit cultural resource studies for use in the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) review of each project, and to further the public knowledge of local history.

     B.      Other Historical Themes. The existence of the zanja is responsible for the underlying themes of mission influence, education, settlements, citrus heritage, and economic and industrial enterprises. The underlying themes shall also be considered in any required cultural resource study and evaluated as part of the project and environmental review processes for future development projects. (Ord. 623 § 6, 2004)

 

17.82.060 Inventory and the need for further study.
     An inventory of known cultural resources that includes historic sites, buildings, structures, landscape features, rural agricultural landscape features, and linear features such as transportation routes, and the irrigation canal (zanja) is contained in the report as Table 1, “Known Historical Resources in the Historic Mission Overlay District.” The inventory shall be updated based on information provided by cultural resource studies required for development projects located within the overlay district boundaries, as needed. The respective project applicant and/or developer shall be responsible for the preparation of any required cultural resource study.

     Due to the many questions that remain about the history of the Mission Road area, further study is needed to determine the boundaries of the Guachama Rancheria; precise alignment of the zanja; the locations of possible archaeological sites of former buildings, settlements, and other cultural features and artifacts; the ages, origins, and ownership histories of specific resources; architectural styles (with evaluations) of individual buildings; and, the documentation of oral history. These topics shall be addressed as part of the cultural resource study(s) required for each future development project located within the overlay district boundaries. The respective project applicant and/or developer shall be responsible for the preparation of any required cultural resource study. (Ord. 623 § 7, 2004)

 

17.82.070 Project and environmental review.
     Development projects, including general plan amendments, zone changes, specific plans, development code amendments, tentative tract and parcel maps, conditional use permits, precise plan of design applications, small project applications, and modifications, revisions, and/or amendments to approved projects and plans for projects and properties within the overlay district boundaries shall be reviewed by the historical commission and other review authorities, as applicable. All projects shall meet the requirements of the Loma Linda Municipal Code and zoning ordinance, CEQA, and other state and federal laws. (Ord. 623 § 8, 2004)

 

17.82.080 Historic resource evaluation report and cultural resources study.
     A.      Historic Resource Evaluation Report (Report). A report shall be required as a submittal for new development, rehabilitation, restoration, adaptive reuse, and demolition projects when buildings and structures that are more than fifty years old may be affected, if found to be significant. As a general guideline, a report shall contain the following elements:

     1.      Purpose and scope;

     2.      Methods of evaluation: field and archival;

     3.      Location and setting;

     4.      Architectural description of the resource;

     5.      Historical background;

     6.      Discussion of eligibility for listing on the National Register of Historic Resources, California Register of Historic Resources, or Local Cultural Resource Designation;

     7.      Statement of significance;

     8.      Conclusions;

     9.      Recommendations (at a minimum this element shall include recommendations for eligibility; rehabilitation, restoration, adaptive reuse, demolition; proposed mitigation measures; and, if demolition is proposed, recommendations for salvage of historical and/or architectural features and artifacts shall be included);

     10.    Archival documentation;

     11.    Appendices.

     The statement of significance element (subsection 7 of this section) shall be made using the criteria listed in Section 17.80.070, Cultural resource designation criteria and shall include a discussion of relative contextual themes.

     The archival documentation of a resource (subsection 10) shall include a completed Department of Parks and Recreation (DPR) 523 Form and archival quality photo documentation. This information shall be included as an appendix to the report.

     Preparation and submittal of the report shall be the responsibility of the applicant. All reports shall be prepared by consultants who meet the professional qualification standards for the field of historic preservation as described in the Federal Register.

     B.      Cultural Resources Study (Study). Studies prepared to evaluate archaeological and paleontological resources shall follow the format outlined for historical resources evaluation reports, and other criteria as required by the Society of Professional Archaeologists (SOPA). (Ord. 623 § 9, 2004)

 

17.82.090 Design criteria and development standards for new development.
     A.      General Plan Land Use Designation and Zoning. The general plan land use designation for the historic mission overlay district shall be mixed use and the zoning shall be Planned Community (PC). Prior to adoption of the new general plan in 2004, proposed development projects shall be required to amend the general plan and zoning maps to the mixed use designation and PC zoning, respectively. A specific plan or master development plan shall be required for development proposals within the overlay district.

     B.      Permitted Uses. Uses permitted in the overlay district shall be consistent with the mixed use general plan land use designation and planned community (PC) zoning. The planning commission may also permit other nonlisted uses, which support the purposes of the district as conditional uses through a public hearing process. In general, the mixed use designation and PC zoning permit a mix of residential uses (of varying density), community facilities, commercial retail, office, and service uses, business park, and open space and recreational uses. With the exception of land uses and properties that legally existed prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, all new development projects and/or new uses of existing properties shall be subject to the PC zoning as part of a specific plan or master development plan.

     C.      Standards for New Development. New development, adaptive reuse, rehabilitation, and restoration projects shall conform to the following standards:

     1.      Architectural and Site Design. The density/intensity, lot size, lot width, lot coverage, setbacks, building separations, building height, and uniform sign programs for new developments in the overlay district shall be established through the specific plan or master development plan processes. Development standards shall vary based on the proximity of a proposed development project to a historical and/or cultural resource(s) or the presence of a historical and/or cultural resource(s) within a project site.

     Mission Road, Redlands Boulevard, and California Street are important corridors to the overlay district and the city in terms of preservation and economic viability. Of the three corridors, Mission Road is the most important in terms of historic preservation due to the high concentration of historic and cultural resources, particularly on the north side of the road. Mission Road is the focal point and heart of the overlay district. New development along the Mission Road frontage shall conform to the historic architectural styles and site design parameters listed below. New development along the California Street and Redlands Boulevard frontages shall be sensitive to the historic nature of the area while encouraging the use of interpretive historic architectural styles and site designs.

     The planning commission shall consider the design characteristics of each development project through the context of a specific plan or master development plan. The historical commission shall provide recommendations regarding the appropriateness of proposed deviations based on the potential impacts to historic resources located in or adjacent to the project site.

     2.      Architectural Styles. All new development shall be designed using historical architectural styles from the following list:

     a.      Residential development:

    Bungalow

    Colonial Revival

    Craftsman

    Italianate

    Mediterranean Revival

    Mission

    Monterey

    Prairie

    Queen Anne

    Stick

    Tudor Revival

    Victorian

     b.      Commercial development—Adaptations of the architectural styles in subsection (C)(2)(a):

    Art Deco

    Art/Streamline Moderne

    Commercial

    Googie/50s

    Business and technology park development - may design using adaptations of the architectural styles outlined in subsection (C)(2)(a) and (C)(2)(b) of this section, or the Usonian architectural style.

     3.      Landscape Design. Landscaping shall be approved conceptually through the entitlement process and a state licensed landscape architect shall prepare landscape/irrigation plans. The landscape plan, in terms of layout, plant materials and color pallet, shall be consistent with and reflective of appropriate historical architectural styles and preservation practices and techniques (i.e., establishment of protective dry zones adjacent to adobe buildings and structures), and shall enhance the adjacent and surrounding properties.

     4.      Buffer Zones. Historical resources shall be protected from adjacent uses and enhanced by a minimum of fifty-foot-buffer zones. The planning commission may require a larger or smaller buffer zone based on the nature of the affected resource(s) and how well the resource(s) has been integrated into the proposed development project. The historical commission may provide recommendations to the planning commission as appropriate.

     5.      Trails and Pedestrian Paths. All new development in the overlay district shall provide trails and pedestrian paths, and linkages to local and regional trails. Whenever possible, feasible, and appropriate, trails shall provide interpretive signage relating to adjacent historic resources, local history, and other pertinent historical facts and information about the area to educate the community and visitors to the area. A district emphasis shall be the preservation of the zanja and the creation of a continuous trail along its path that shall include interpretive signage of historical events, locations, and resources.

     6.      Parking. Parking shall be provided as required by Chapter 17.24 for residential development.

     7.      Lighting and Street Furniture. Light standards, street furniture, and other permanent fixtures (i.e., drinking fountains, bus stops and shelters) shall be compatible with the historical architectural styles on the development site and in the surrounding area.

     8.      Sign Programs. Each development within the district shall have a uniform sign program that characterizes the historical significance of the area. Sign programs may be customized per development but shall include an element or component (such as a district logo, sign shape, materials, or colors) that unifies all of the sign programs within the district. Neither billboards nor advertising signs shall be permitted along the Mission Road frontage.

     9.      Mission Historical Overlay District Identification Monument Signs. Two identical monument signs identifying the overlay district shall be placed in the Mission Road median, as follows:

     a.      At the east end near the intersection with California Street; and

     b.      At the west end, just west of the Edison Easement.

     The historical commission, planning commission, and city council shall approve the design of the signs.

     10.    Mission Road Street Standards. All new development and adaptive reuse projects along Mission Road shall construct the right-of-way in accordance with the approved street design standards prepared by the city’s public works department. The street design shall include a landscape median in the road, and landscape easement behind the sidewalk on both sides of the street. No median shall be installed in front of an existing residential use. This requirement may be waived if written authorization from the owner of an affected, existing property is obtained and submitted to the community development and public works departments during the entitlement process. (Ord. 623 § 10, 2004)

 

17.82.100 Standards for rehabilitation and guidelines for rehabilitating historic buildings.
     All rehabilitation projects shall follow The Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings (1990). Rehabilitation, restoration, and adaptive reuse, in the order listed, shall be the preferred methods of treatment for historic buildings and structures. Demolition shall be considered only as a last resort.

     A.      Standards for Rehabilitation. The following standards are applied to specific rehabilitation projects in a reasonable manner, taking into consideration economic and technical feasibility.

     1.      A property shall be used for its historic purpose or be placed in a new use that requires minimal change to the defining characteristics of the building and its site and environment.

     2.      The historic character of a property shall be retained and preserved. The removal of historic materials or alteration of features and spaces that characterize a property shall be avoided.

     3.      Each property shall be recognized as a physical record of its time, place, and use. Changes that create a false sense of historical development, such as adding conjectural features or architectural elements from other buildings, shall not be undertaken.

     4.      Most properties change over time; those changes that have acquired historic significance in their own right shall be retained and preserved.

     5.      Distinctive features, finishes, and construction techniques or examples of craftsmanship that characterize a historic property shall be preserved.

     6.      Deteriorated historic features shall be repaired rather than replaced. Where severity of deterioration requires replacement of distinctive feature, the new feature shall match the old in design, color, texture, and other visual qualities and, where possible, materials. Replacement of missing features shall be substantiated by documentary, physical, or pictorial evidence.

     7.      Chemical or physical treatments, such as sandblasting, that cause damage to historic materials shall not be used. The surface cleaning of structures, if appropriate, shall be undertaken using the gentlest means possible.

     8.      Significant archaeological resources affected by a project shall be protected and preserved. If such resources must be disturbed, mitigation measures shall be undertaken.

     9.      New additions, exterior alterations, or related new construction shall not destroy historic materials that characterize the property. The new work shall be differentiated from the old and shall be compatible with the massing, size, scale, and architectural features to protect the historic integrity of the property and its environment.

     10.    New additions and adjacent or related new construction shall be undertaken in such a manner that if removed in the future, the essential form and integrity of the historic property and its environment would be unimpaired.

     As stated in the definition, the treatment “rehabilitation” assumes that at least some repair or alteration of the historic building will be needed in order to provide for an efficient contemporary use; however, these repairs and alteration must not damage or destroy materials, features or finishes that are important in defining the building’s historic character. For example, certain treatments—if improperly applied—may cause or accelerate physical deterioration of historic building. This can include using improper reappointing or exterior masonry cleaning techniques, or introducing insulation that damages historic fabric. In almost all of these situations, use of these materials and treatments will result in a project that does not meet the standards. Similarly, exterior additions that duplicate the form, material, and detailing of the structure to the extent that they compromise the historic character of the structure will fail to meet the standards.

     B.      Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings. All rehabilitation projects shall also follow the guidelines contained in the Secretary of the Interior’s Standards for Rehabilitation and Guidelines for Rehabilitating Historic Buildings (1990). Copies of this document shall be available from the community development department. (Ord. 623 § 11, 2004)

 

17.82.110 Demolition of historical buildings and structures.
     Rehabilitation, restoration, and adaptive reuse, in the order listed, shall be the preferred methods of treatment for historic buildings and structures. Demolition shall be considered only as a last resort:

     A.      Demolition Prohibited. No building or structure more than fifty years old shall be demolished unless the building division pursuant to this chapter has issued a valid demolition permit.

     B.      Dangerous Buildings and Structures. Buildings or structures that are more than fifty years old may be demolished if findings have been made by the building official pursuant to other provisions of the Municipal Code declaring that the building or structure is either a public nuisance or a dangerous building. Prior to issuance of a demolition permit, the community development department director (or designee) shall confer with the historical commission chair and building official to determine the potential for alternative, nondemolition remedies and/or the salvage and reuse of historical architectural features and artifacts. In addition, photo documentation and recordation may be required if the resource is historically significant to the city. Photo documentation and recordation would be conducted in accordance with the standards and guidelines of the Historic American Building Survey and Historic American Engineering Record (HABS/HAER). If no alternative, nondemolition remedies are available; the demolition permit may be issued in accordance with all other city ordinances and requirements.

     C.      Evaluation Thresholds and Review Requirements. Buildings and structures more than fifty years old that are proposed for demolition shall be evaluated to determine historical significance. A historic resource evaluation report shall be required, as follows:

     1.      A report shall be required for any resource listed in Table 1, Known Historical Resources (Mission Road Historic District, Final Report, The Dangermond Group and Statistical Research, Inc., May 22, 2002);

     2.      A report shall be required for any age qualified resource that is not listed in Table 1 (referenced) and not exempt from these requirements as a dangerous building or structure.

     All historic resource evaluation reports shall be prepared as outlined in this chapter.

     D.      Salvage and Reuse of Historical and Architectural Features and Artifacts. When feasible, historic and/or architectural features and artifacts shall be salvaged or recycled for reuse onsite or within the mission historic overlay district. (Ord. 623 § 12, 2004)

 

17.82.120 Certificates of appropriateness and economic hardship.
     All rehabilitation, restoration, adaptive reuse, and demolition projects shall comply with Chapter 17.80, Historic Preservation, as applicable.

     A.      Certificate of Appropriateness. A certificate shall be required pursuant to Section 17.80.090.

     B.      Certificate of Economic Hardship. A certificate shall be granted pursuant to Section 17.80.120. (Ord. 623 § 13, 2004)

 

17.82.130 Sample tools and treatments.
     The report states that the significant historic features (uses, buildings, street, agriculture, industry, and land use patterns) define the historic character of the area. The sample tools and treatments outlined below are intended to preserve the historic character and architectural integrity of the area by strengthening such patterns and setting development standards and guidelines for rehabilitation, preservation, and new construction.

     A.      Sample Tools. The following list of approaches to preservation shall be considered to strengthen and preserve the historic feeling of the Mission Road overlay district. Selection of the appropriate preservation tool(s) shall be determined through cultural resources studies on a project-by-project basis:

     1.      Preserve and Protect. Identify historically significant sites and features for purposes of preservation, restoration, rehabilitation, and protection.

     2.      Preserve and Do Nothing. Identify historically significant sites and features for purposes of preservation, but do not restore, rehabilitate or protect.

     3.      Preserve and Restore with Parks and Groves. Identify historically significant sites and features for purposes of preservation, and protect and restore/rehabilitate in nodes. Develop parks and groves that enhance the sites that can be open to the public.

     4.      Adaptive Uses. Preserve, restore, rehabilitate, and protect historically significant sites and buildings. Develop adaptive uses such as gardens, food service, specialty shops, indoor and outdoor public spaces, and private uses and buildings that are thematically related to the Mission Road historic overlay district.

     B.      Sample Treatments. The purpose of various possible treatments is to preserve the historic character and architectural integrity of the overlay district, and to promote and encourage the use of architectural styles that are consistent with the period of historic significance of the district. Treatments should define neighborhood character and strengthen the edges of the district through the use of signed entry points, integration of historic properties as “anchors” for the surrounding properties and “linkages” between historic resources to provide a sense of continuity throughout the overlay district.

     1.      Incentives and Restrictions. The following incentives and restrictions shall be used, if possible and as appropriate, to gain the cooperation of major developers, property owners with the city and public interest to achieve the goals of the overlay district:

     a.      Promote land exchanges used for historic preservation goals;

     b.      Allow parks containing historical resources to count toward park and open space requirements;

     c.       Cooperative planning of park edges to maximize added value to developments;

     d.      City to seek state and federal funds to assist in historic preservation projects such as restoration, pathways, parks, etc.;

     e.       Allow density transfers and clustering to provide buffers around historic resources;

     f.       Use parks fees for development of historic parks and zanja trail;

     g.       Explore use of redevelopment funds for historic preservation;

     h.      Employ a tiered approach to restrictions, with strict requirements in the immediate vicinity of historic resources and more flexible requirements that evoke the feeling of the historic themes in other areas more distant to historic resources.

     2.      Development Standards. See above.

     3.      Design Guidelines. See above.

(Ord. 623 § 14, 2004)

 

17.82.140 Penalties.
     If any person shall violate any of the provisions of this chapter, or fail to comply with any of the mandatory requirements of this chapter, he or she shall be guilty of an infraction. Any person convicted of an infraction under the provisions of a city ordinance shall be punishable by (1) a fine of not more than one hundred dollars for a first violation; (2) a fine not exceeding two hundred dollars for a second violation of the same ordinance within one year and (3) a fine not exceeding five hundred dollars for each additional violation of the same ordinance within one year. Each such person shall be deemed guilty of a separate offense for every day during such portion of which any violation of this chapter is committed, continued or permitted by such person, and shall be punishable therefore as provided by this chapter. (Ord. 623 § 15, 2004)

Chapter 17.90 ADULT-ORIENTED BUSINESSES
17.90.010 Title.
     This chapter shall be known as the adult-oriented business ordinance of the city of Loma Linda. (Ord. 566 § 2, 1998)

 

17.90.020 Purpose.
     It is the intent of this chapter to prevent community wide adverse economic impacts, increased crime, decreased property values, and the deterioration of neighborhoods which can be brought about by the concentration of adult-oriented businesses in close proximity to each other or proximity to other incompatible uses such as parks, schools, houses of worship, residential uses, and residential zones. The city council finds that it has been demonstrated in various communities that the concentration of adult-oriented businesses causes an increase in the number of transients in the area, and an increase in crime and in addition to the effects described above, can cause other businesses and residents to move elsewhere. It is, therefore, the purpose of this chapter to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the concentration of adult-oriented businesses or their close proximity to incompatible uses, while permitting the location of adult-oriented businesses in certain areas. (Ord. 566 § 2, 1998)

 

17.90.030 Definitions.
     As used in this chapter:

     A.      “Establishment of an adult-oriented business” means and includes any of the following:

     1.      The opening or commencement of any adult-oriented business as a new business;

     2.      The conversion of an existing business, whether or not an adult-oriented business, to any adult-oriented business defined herein;

     3.      The addition of any of the adult-oriented businesses defined herein to any other existing adult-oriented businesses; or

     4.      The relocation of any such adult-oriented business.

     B.      “Specified anatomical areas” means and includes any of the following:

     1.      Less than completely and opaquely covered human (i) genitals or pubic region; (ii) buttocks; and (iii) female breast below a point immediately above the top of the areola;

Chapter 17.95 WIRELESS COMMUNICATION FACILITIES
17.95.010 Intent.
     This chapter applies to all wireless telecommunications facilities existing and proposed to be located within the corporate boundary of the city of Loma Linda, except wireless telecommunications facilities in the public right-of-way which are subject to Chapter 17.96.

     The intent of the wireless communications ordinance is to promote general compatibility with other electrical and communication facilities in the city and to find locations for said facilities that are compatible with the height, mass and visual character of surrounding buildings and public facilities by applying the same standards and aesthetic considerations to such facilities as apply to buildings and public facilities in the zone district in which they are proposed.

     In applying these standards and any specific standards that will apply to such facilities, the planning commission will consider wireless communication facilities as accessory structures, subject to the following considerations for the same:

     A.      As accessory facilities they should not be the visually dominant structure in the area and therefore should be:

     1.      Located at the rear of properties away from street frontages;

     2.      Located to the rear of buildings to allow the buildings to be the primary focus of the property from the public street;

     3.      In compliance with the height limit of the zone or allowed to exceed the height limit slightly if in a less prominent location;

     4.      Located near other tall structures or landscape features so as to reduce its visual presence;

     5.      Provided with a landscaped surrounding especially trees that will reduce its visual dominance;

     6.      Provided with architectural or decorative features that provide the structure with proper proportion and balance as a structure;

     7.      Colored in a manner to blend with its surroundings;

     8.      Added to a building as an architectural component of the building, which means that its structure or a parent structure should respond to other architectural features of the building.

     But in no case should a wireless communication facility be so dominant as to compromise the architecture of the host building.

     B.      City-owned property should be given priority as potential sites for the placement of wireless communication facilities. (Ord. 755 § 4, 2019; Ord. 592 § 1, 2001)

 

17.95.020 Small project application and conditional use permit.
     Each wireless communication facility requires either an application for a small project or a conditional use permit. Both types of projects shall meet all the requirements described below. Small project applications shall be reviewed and approved by the community development director. Conditional use permits shall require the approval of the planning commission. (Ord. 592 § 2, 2001)

 

17.95.030 Required findings for wireless communication facilities.
     All wireless communication facilities permitted in this section shall be subject to the following findings. These are in addition to any applicable criteria outlined in Chapter 17.30, Administration, for the city of Loma Linda or the criteria for a small project application.

     A.      There is adequate space on the property for the wireless communication facility and accessory wireless communication equipment. Adequate space shall mean that the wireless communication facility will not be in conflict with existing buildings or other structures on the property, or reduce required parking, landscaping or

other property improvements based on city development standards.

     B.      The design and placement of the wireless communication facility and accessory wireless communication equipment will not adversely impact the use of the

 

property, other buildings and structures located on the property, or the surrounding area or neighborhood (i.e., encroach on walkways or openings, block or impair valuable views of or from the subject property or nearby properties).

     C.      The wireless communication facility and accessory wireless communication equipment as proposed are consistent with the intent of this part and comply with the general standards for all wireless communication facilities and special standards for ground-mounted structures below.

     D.      The operation of the facility will not cause Radio Frequency Interference (RFI) to any of the city’s communication operations including public works department, public safety department and San Bernardino County sheriff’s department radio systems, other radio and communications systems, computer and/or electronic equipment, and SCADA facilities. In addition, the operation of the facility will not cause RFI to Loma Linda University, Loma Linda University Medical Center, Jerry L. Pettis Veterans Medical Center, Loma Linda University Community Medical Center, or other medical or educational related facilities’ communications operations, computer equipment, and/or sensitive medical research and/or testing equipment, or to other consumer electronic products (i.e., televisions, radios, amateur radios, cordless telephones or other communications devices, bearing aids, or stereos), or to railroad communications, control or telemetry systems. (Ord. 592 § 3, 2001)

 

17.95.040 General standards for wireless communication facilities.
     A.      Wireless communication facilities shall comply with all applicable building codes and shall not be erected or used except as permitted.

     B.      Wireless communication facilities and accessory wireless communication equipment shall be located, installed, and mounted in a manner to minimize to the greatest extent possible the visibility of the antennas and equipment.

     C.      Wireless communication facilities and accessory wireless communication equipment shall be painted in non-reflective matte finished shades designed to be compatible with the surrounding site and neighborhood.

     D.      Wireless communication facilities and accessory wireless communication equipment shall be screened from view by an existing structure, or by constructing screening that blends in with the adjacent scenery or structures in color and form, or landscaping where constructed screening cannot occur. If landscaping is required, trees shall be a minimum twenty-four inch box size.

     E.      The need for stealth-designed facilities (i.e., slim-line monopole, mono-palm, mono-pine, water tower, clock tower, windmill, weather vane, flag pole, sculpture or other interesting and artistic visual form) shall be determined by the planning commission based on the aesthetics and character of the area surrounding the project site and the appropriateness and compatibility of the proposed design with other existing features and structures in the area.

     F.      No advertising, signs, or lighting shall be incorporated or attached to any wireless communication facility or accessory wireless communication equipment, except as required by the city’s building division or federal regulations.

     G.      The height of the proposed wireless communication facility shall be justified by the need for such height to effectively provide services by the applicant through a radio frequency analysis subject to review and approval by the city. The analysis shall be prepared by a qualified engineer and shall include the required technical information and an executive summary written in layman’s terms. (Ord. 592 § 4, 2001)

 

17.95.050 Special standards for ground-mounted structures.
     A.      Ground-mounted structures and wireless communication facilities and/or accessory wireless communication equipment shall not be located within or project into any required setbacks of the underlying land use district.

     B.      Ground-mounted structures and wireless communication facilities or wireless communication accessory equipment shall not be located or project within ten feet of any right-of-way of a street, freeway, or railroad line.

     C.      Ground-mounted structures for wireless communication facilities shall not be located on lots developed with residential uses nor within one hundred feet of any residential zone and/or residential use.

     D.      The height of a ground-mounted structure shall be compatible with that of the surrounding neighborhood so that existing trees or other tall elements of the neighborhood can serve as a backdrop for the antenna and ground-mounted structure. No ground-mounted structure shall exceed the height limit of the underlying land use district without the review and approval of the planning commission. In the absence of a height limitation in a land use district, the maximum height of a ground-mounted structure shall be sixty-five feet.

 

     E.      A new ground-mounted structure shall not be located within eight hundred feet of an existing ground-mounted structure for a wireless communication facility except in a temporary situation wherein a new structure is replacing an existing structure for purposes of locating more than one wireless communication facility on the structure (co-location).

     F.      If co-location is not feasible due to height restrictions, the height allowance may be increased by an additional fifteen feet to provide for co-location provided that the planning commission determines that the increased height will have less visual impact than two such structures of lower height located in close proximity to one another, and that the increased height of the structure will be consistent with the character of the surrounding development.

     G.      All security fencing shall be of a material, color, and design that is consistent and compatible with the character of the surrounding development or environment.

     H.     Ground-mounted structures, including accessory equipment, shall be screened or architecturally or stealth designed (i.e., mono-palm, mono-pine, water tower, clock tower, windmill, weather vane, and sculpture or other interesting and artistic visual form and, antenna incorporated into existing light standards, flag poles, or building signs) if the planning commission determines that there is a need to mitigate negative aesthetic impacts and achieve compatibility with the surrounding site and neighborhood. (Ord. 592 § 5, 2001)

Chapter 19.03 DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS
19.03.010 Findings and statutory authorization.
     A.      Government Code Sections 65864—65869.5 authorize cities and counties to enter into binding development agreements with persons having legal or equitable interests in real property for the development of such property and authorize the city of Loma Linda to establish procedures for the consideration of applications for such agreements.

     B.      A set of procedures and requirements for consideration of development agreements has been proposed, has been the subject of public hearings, and the city council proposes to adopt such regulations.

     C.      It is in the public interest to adopt such regulations and the public health, safety and welfare will be promoted thereby. (Ord. 311 § 1, 1983)

 

19.03.020 Procedures and requirements adopted by reference.
     A.      The procedures and requirements for the consideration of development agreements as set forth in Exhibit “A,” attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter and made a part of this reference, are adopted.

     B.      The planning director is instructed to prepare and adopt such application forms, checklists and such other documents as he or she considers necessary to implement the procedures and requirements. (Ord. 311 § 2, 1983)

Chapter 19.08 HILLSIDE AREA DEVELOPMENT
19.08.010 Short title.
     This chapter shall be known, and may be cited, as the “hillside area ordinance” of the city. (Ord. 209 § 1, 1979)

 

19.08.020 Findings.
     The city council of the city finds and declares that:

     A.      Foothill faces, and other hillside areas, along the southerly side of the city provide a unique natural landmark which differentiates this portion of the city from other locations within the city;

     B.      Foothill areas in the city range in geologic characteristics from steep, rocky slopes to brush-covered regions;

     C.      Development in brush or wooded regions requires recognition of various physical constraints; including fire hazards, tree removal, drainage and erosion, visible scarring and delicate, easily disturbed rock formations;

     D.      Because of the uniqueness of these areas within the city, special hillside development policies are needed to restrict and/or control development on these significant natural resources; and

     E.      Adoption of policies and procedures for reviewing proposed hillside area developments, designed to ensure the preservation of natural hillside characteristics, would contribute to the preservation and/or conservation of the valuable, scenic, natural amenity of the city hillsides. (Ord. 209 § 2, 1979)

 

19.08.030 Purpose.
     A.      The purpose of this chapter is to ensure that the density and type of all hillside developments within the city are suitable to the topography of the existing terrain, that proposed developments will provide for the minimal disturbance of the natural terrain, and that the natural hillside characteristics will be retained wherever practicable.

     B.      Achievement of these intentions shall be accomplished by the adoption of a resolution which will set forth policies, standards and other appropriate specifications which will include but not be limited to the following:

     1.      A map showing the area to which this chapter applies;

     2.      Criteria to guide the design of proposed developments to ensure the grading and excavation conforms to natural landforms and avoids the usual appearance normally associated with excessive padding and/or terracing of building sites;

     3.      Incentives to encourage variety in proposed developments on hillside areas through a mixture of housing types, padding and/or terracing techniques and with density allowances and amount of undisturbed areas based on slope analysis;

     4.      Measures to protect and conserve hillside ecosystems through the retention of unique natural topographic features and hillside characteristics, including drainage patterns, streams, slopes, ridgelines, rock outcroppings, vistas, natural vegetation and migratory routes of animals;

     5.      Methods to preserve areas that may have an historic interest, significance or educational value;

     6.      Standards of design to ensure streets which provide for the safe and convenient circulation of vehicles, emergency equipment and pedestrians.

     C.      In areas where specific engineering, biological, hydrological, historical or archeological data and findings are found to be necessary and essential elements of the decision process for the achievement of the purpose and intent of this chapter, such specific studies may be required to the satisfaction of the city. (Ord. 209 § 3, 1979)

     A.      “Hillside area” means any area having a grade of ten percent or more as shown on the Hillside area map.

     B.      “Hillside character” means the exemplification of natural hillside traits and compatibilities in form, texture, color and line.

     C.      “Hillside subdivision” means a subdivision having more than twenty percent of its acreage within a hillside area.

     D.      “Proposal” means an application for permit to grade, in accordance with the Uniform Building Code or any grading within a hillside area.

     E.      “Slope analysis” means an analysis completed by a registered civil engineer, based upon a topographic map with contour intervals at not more than five feet. The slope analysis shall show the following slope categories:

    10 to 15% slope

    15 to 25% slope

    25 to 35% slope

    35% and over slope

     F.      “Undisturbed area” means that area on which no grading, filling or removal of trees and native vegetation shall be permitted, and any area which has been determined as being, or for which there is reasonable evidence to suspect as being, environmentally, archeologically or geologically sensitive. Undisturbed area may include the installation of underground utilities or that landscaping which is performed in accordance with city standards. (Ord. 209 § 4, 1979)

 

19.08.050 Development committee established.
     A.      A hillside development committee shall serve to review all proposals for grading in hillside areas for conformity to policies and standards as established by resolution of the city. Such committee shall also review proposals for conformity to the intent and purpose of this chapter.

(Ord. 209 § 5, 1979)

 

19.08.060 Grading permit bond required.
     A.      A permit to grade shall not be issued unless the permittee shall first post with the city a bond executed by the owner and a corporation surety authorized to do business in the state as a surety in an amount sufficient to cover the cost of the grading project, including the construction of drainage and protective devices and any corrective work necessary to remove and eliminate engineering and geological hazards in a form prescribed by the building official or approved as to form by the counsel of the permit-issuing authority.

     B.      In lieu of a surety bond, the applicant may file a cash bond or, if approved by the council, a letter of credit from one or more financial institutions subject to regulations by the state or federal government in an amount equal to that which would be required in the surety bond. (Ord. 209 § 6, 1979)

 

19.08.070 Specific development standard adoption.
     A.      Provisions of this chapter shall apply to future development proposals in hillside areas located within the city. Specific standards for hillside areas may be adopted by resolution of the city council in order to ensure that developments within hillside areas are accomplished in an orderly and efficient manner necessary to protect the public health, safety and general welfare and which conform to the purpose and intent set forth in this chapter.

Chapter 19.12 FLOOD CONTROL MEASURES
Note
*   Prior ordinance history: Ords. 148 and 369.

 

19.12.010 Statutory authorization.
     The legislature of the state of California has in Government Code Sections 65302, 65560, and 65800 conferred upon local government units authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city council of the city of Loma Linda does ordain as follows. (Ord. 678 § 1, 2008: Ord. 595 § 1, 2002; Ord. 380 § 1, 1987)

 

19.12.020 Findings of fact.
     A.      The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation, which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare.

     B.      These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities, and when inadequately anchored, damage uses in other areas. Uses that are inadequately flood proofed, elevated or otherwise protected from flood damage also contribute to the flood loss.

     C.      On June 23, 2001, the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) revised the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM) and Flood Insurance Study (FIS) report to redesignate the flood hazard area along San Timoteo Creek as a special Flood Hazard Area known as Zone A99. FEMA recommends that, as a minimum, the building restriction and flood proofing requirements within Zone A99 be identical to Zone X. (Ord. 678 § 1, 2008: Ord. 595 § 1, 2002; Ord. 380 § 1, 1987)

 

19.12.030 Statement of purpose.
     It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specified areas by provisions designed to:

     A.      Protect human life and health;

     B.      Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects;

     C.      Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public;

     D.      Minimize prolonged business interruptions;

     E.      Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard;

     F.      Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the second use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future flood blight areas;

     G.      Insure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and

     H.     Insure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. (Ord. 678 § 1, 2008: Ord. 595 § 1, 2002; Ord. 380 § 1, 1987)

 

19.12.040 Methods of reducing flood losses.
     A.      In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions for:

     1.      Restricting or prohibiting uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities;

     2.      Requiring that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction;

     3.      Controlling the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters;

     4.      Controlling filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and

     5.      Preventing or regulating the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas.

     B.      This chapter will apply to all areas of special flood hazards within the jurisdiction of the city.

     C.      The areas of special flood hazard are identified by the Federal Insurance Administration in a scientific and engineering report entitled “The Flood Insurance Study for the City of Loma Linda dated June 27, 2001,” which report and maps and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions are adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. The Flood Insurance Study is on file at the office of the city engineer, City Hall, 25541 Barton Road, Loma Linda, California.

     D.      It is unlawful for any person to construct or locate, or extend, convert or alter any structure or land as defined in Section 19.12.050, “Special Flood Hazard Areas” without full compliance with the terms of this chapter and other applicable regulations. This chapter is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this chapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail.

     E.      In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be: considered as minimum requirements; liberally construed in favor of the governing body; and deemed neither to limit or repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. (Ord. 678 § 1, 2008: Ord. 595 § 1, 2002; Ord. 380 § 1, 1987)

 

19.12.050 Definitions.
     Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.

     “Appeal” means a request for a review of the city engineer’s interpretation of any provision of this chapter or a request for a variance.

     “Area of shallow flooding” means an area or zone designated AO or AH on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). The base flood depths range from one foot to three feet; a clearly defined channel does not exist; the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; and velocity flow may be evident.

     Area of Special Flood Hazard. See “Special flood hazard area.”

     “Base flood” means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (also called the one hundred year flood).

     “Basement” means any area of the building having its floor subgrade (below ground level) on all sides.

     “Breakaway walls” are any type of walls, whether constructed of concrete, masonry, wood, metal, plastic or any other suitable building material which is not part of the structural support of the building and which is designed to break away under abnormally high tide or wave action without causing any damage to the structural integrity of the building on which they are used or any buildings to which they might be carried by flood waters. A breakaway wall shall have a safe design loading resistance of not less than ten and no more than twenty pounds per square foot. Use of breakaway walls must be certified by a registered engineer or architect and shall meet the following conditions:

     1.      Breakaway wall collapse shall result from a water load less than that which would occur during the base flood; and

     “Floodplain or flood-prone area” means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source (see definition of “flooding”).

     “Floodplain management” means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works and floodplain management regulations.

     “Floodplain management regulations” means zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as floodplain ordinance, grading ordinance and erosion control ordinance) and other applications of police power. The term describes such state and local regulations in any combination thereof, which provide standards for the purpose of flood damage prevention and reduction.

     “Floodproofing” means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures and their contents.

     “Floodway” means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. Also referred to as “Regulatory floodway.”

     “Habitable floor” means any floor usable for living purposes, which includes working, sleeping, eating, cooking or recreation, or a combination thereof. A floor used only for storage purposes is not a “habitable floor.”

     “Highest adjacent grad” means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls or a structure.

     “Lowest floor” means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure, usable solely for parking or vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area is not considered a building’s lowest floor; provided, that such enclosure is not built so as to render the structure in violation of the applicable non-elevation design requirements of this chapter.

     “Manufactured home” means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when connected to the required utilities. For floodplain management purposes the term “manufactured home” also includes park trailers, travel trailers and other similar vehicles placed on a site for greater than one hundred eighty consecutive days.

     “Mean sea level” means, for purposes of National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community’s Flood Insurance Rate Map are referenced.

     “New manufactured home park or manufactured home subdivision” means a parcel or contiguous parcels of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lot (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads, and the construction of streets) is completed on or after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter.

     “One hundred year flood” or “100-year flood” means a flood which has a one percent annual probability of being equaled or exceeded. It is identical to the “base flood,” which will be the term used throughout this chapter.

     “Person” means an individual or his or her agent, firm, association or corporation, or agent of the aforementioned groups, or this state or its agencies or political subdivisions.

     “Remedy a violation” means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with state or local floodplain management regulations, or, if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of the ordinance codified in this chapter or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development.

     “Special flood hazard area (SFHA)” means an area having special flood or flood-related erosion hazards, and shown on an FHBM or FIRM as Zone A, AO, AE, A99, AH, VO, V1-V30, VE, V, X, or D.

     “Start of construction” means the first placement of permanent construction of a structure (other than a manufactured home) on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings or any work beyond the stage of excavation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling, nor does it include the installation of streets or walkways; nor does it include the installation of streets or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not as part of the main structure. For a structure (other than a manufactured home) without a basement or poured footings, the “start of construction” includes the first permanent framing or assembly of the structure of any part thereof on its piling or foundation. For manufactured homes not within a manufacture home park or manufactured home subdivision, “start of construction” means the affixing of the manufactured home to its permanent site. For manufactured homes within manufactured home parks or manufactured home subdivisions, “start of construction” is the date on which the construction of facilities for servicing the site on which the manufactured home is to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the construction of streets, either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads, and installation of utilities) is completed.

     “Structure” means a walled or roofed building including a gas or liquid storage tank or manufactured home that is principally above ground.

     “Substantial improvement” means any repair, reconstruction, or improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure either:

     1.      Before the improvement or repair is started; or

     2.      If the structure has been damaged and is being restored, before the damage occurred. For the purposes of this definition, “substantial improvement” is considered to occur when the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of the building commences, whether or not the alteration affects the external dimensions of the structure.

     The term does not, however, include either:

     3.      Any project for improvement of a structure to comply with existing state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which are solely necessary to assure safe living conditions; or

     4.      Any alteration of a structure listed on the National Register of Historic Places or state Inventory of Historic Places.

     “Variance” means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter.

     “Violation” means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with the community’s floodplain management regulations. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. (Ord. 678 § 1, 2008: Ord. 595 § 1, 2002; Ord. 380 § 1, 1987)

 

19.12.060 Warning and disclaimer of liability.
     The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of the city, and officer or employee thereof, of the Federal Insurance Administration, for any flood damages that result by reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. (Ord. 678 § 1, 2008: Ord. 595 § 1, 2002; Ord. 380 § 1, 1987)

 

19.12.070 Flood hazard area permit.
     A flood hazard area permit shall be obtained before construction or development begins within any area of special flood hazard established in Section 19.12.040. Application for a flood hazard area permit shall be made on forms furnished by the city engineer and may include, but not be limited to: plans in duplicate draw to scale shoeing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of the area in question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities; and the location of the foregoing. Specifically, the following information is required:

     A.      Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level of the lowest floor (including basement) of all structures;

     B.      Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any structure has been floodproofed;

     C.      Certification by a registered civil engineer or architect that the floodproofing methods for any nonresidential structure meet the floodproofing criteria in Section 19.12.110, “Flood Hazard Reduction—General Standard”;

     D.      Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development. (Ord. 678 § 1, 2008: Ord. 595 § 1, 2002; Ord. 380 § 1, 1987)

 

19.12.080 Variances.
     A.      Variances may be issued for the reconstruction, rehabilitation or restoration of structures listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the State Inventory of Historic Places, without regard to the procedures set forth in the remainder of this section.

     B.      Variances shall not be issued within any designated floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result.

     C.      Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.

     D.      Variances shall only be issued upon:

     1.      A showing of good and sufficient cause;

     2.      A determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship to the applicant; and

     3.      A determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances.

     E.      Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice that the structure will be permitted to be built with a lowest floor elevation below the base flood elevation and that the cost of flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor elevation. (Ord. 678 § 1, 2008: Ord. 595 § 1, 2002; Ord. 380 § 1, 1987)

 

19.12.090 Administration.
     The city engineer is appointed to administer and implement this chapter by granting or denying flood hazard area permit applications in accordance with its provisions. Duties of the city engineer shall include, but not be limited to:

     A.      Permit Review.

     1.      Review all development permits to determine that the permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied;

     2.      Review all development permits to determine that all necessary permits have been obtained from those federal, state or local governmental agencies from which prior approval is required by federal or state law, including Section 404 of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972;

     3.      Review all development permits to determine if the proposed development adversely affects the flood carrying capacity of the area of special flood hazard. For purposes of this chapter, “adversely affects” means that until a regulatory floodway is designated the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point;

     4.      Review to determine the site is reasonably safe from flooding.

     B.      Use of Other Base Flood Data. When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Section 19.12.040(C), the city engineer shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation data available from a federal, state or other source, in order to administer Section 19.12.110, “Flood Hazard Reduction—General Standard.”

     C.      Information to be Obtained and Maintained.

     1.      Obtain and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the lowest habitable floor (including basement) of all new or substantially improved structures;

     2.      For all new or substantially improved floodproofed structures:

     a.      Verify and record the actual elevation (in relation to mean sea level), and

     b.      Maintain the floodproofing certifications required in Sections 19.12.060 and 19.12.070;

     3.      Maintain for public inspection all records pertaining to the provisions of this chapter.

     D.      Alteration of Watercourses.

     1.      Notify adjacent communities and the San Bernardino County Flood Control District prior to any alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Insurance Administration;

     2.      Require that maintenance is provided within the altered or relocated portion of the watercourse so that the flood-carrying capacity is not diminished.

     E.      Interpretation of FIRM Boundaries. Make interpretations where needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazards (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions). The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in Section 19.12.040(D).

     F.      Take action to remedy violations of this chapter as specified in Section 19.12.040(D). (Ord. 678 § 1, 2008: Ord. 595 § 1, 2002; Ord. 380 § 1, 1987)

 

19.12.100 Appeals.
     A.      The city council is designated as the appeal board. Interested persons may appeal a decision of the city engineer in accordance with the provisions of the city code.

     B.      In passing upon such applications, the appeal board shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and:

     1.      The danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others;

     2.      The danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage;

     3.      The susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the individual owner;

     4.      The importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community;

     5.      The availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage;

     6.      The compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development;

     7.      The relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area;

     8.      The safety of access to the property in times of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles;

     9.      The expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise and sediment transport of the floodwaters and the effects of wave action, if applicable, expected at the site; and

     10.    The costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water systems, and streets and bridges.

     C.      Generally, variances may be issued for new construction and substantial improvements to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, provided subsections (B)(1) through (10) of this section have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond the one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases.

     D.      Upon consideration of the factors of this section and the purposes of this chapter, the appeal board may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

     E.      The city engineer shall maintain the records of all appeal actions and report any variances to the Federal Insurance Administration up request. (Ord. 678 § 1, 2008: Ord. 595 § 1, 2002; Ord. 380 § 1, 1987)

 

19.12.110 Flood hazard reduction—General standards.
     In all areas of special flood hazards the following standards are required:

(Ord. 678 § 1, 2008: Ord. 595 § 1, 2002; Ord. 380 § 1, 1987)

 

19.12.120 Flood hazard reduction—Specific standards.
     In all areas of special flood hazards where base flood elevation data has been provided as set forth in Section 19.12.090, the following provisions are required:

     A.      New construction and substantial improvement of any residential structure shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM, or at least two feet if no depth number is specified. New construction and substantial improvement of any commercial, industrial or other nonresidential structure shall either have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated above the highest adjacent grade at least as high as the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM, or at least two feet if no depth number is specified or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities, shall:

     1.      Be floodproofed so that below the base flood level the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water;

     2.      Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy;

     3.      Be certified by a registered civil engineer that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certifications shall be provided to the city engineer.

     B.      All new construction and substantial improvements, that are fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwaters. Designs for meeting this requirement must either be certified by a registered professional engineer or meet or exceed the following minimum criteria:

     1.      Either a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding shall be provided. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters; or

     2.      Be certified to comply with a local floodproofing standard approved by the Federal Insurance Administration.

     C.      Manufactured homes shall be anchored in accordance with this section. New manufactured home parks and manufactured home subdivisions; expansions to existing manufactured home parks and manufactured home subdivisions; existing manufactured home parks and manufactured home subdivisions where the repair, reconstruction or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds fifty percent value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement has commenced; and manufactured homes not placed in a manufactured home park or manufactured home subdivision, require that:

     1.      Stands or lots are elevated on compacted fill or on pilings so that the lowest floor of the manufactured home will be at or above the base flood level;

     2.      Adequate surface drainage and access for a hauler are provided; and

     3.      In the instance of elevation of pilings, that: lots are large enough to permit steps; piling foundations are placed in stable soil no more than ten feet apart; and reinforcement is provided for pilings more than six feet above the ground level.

     D.      No manufactured home shall be placed in a floodway, except in an existing manufactured home park or existing manufactured home subdivision. (Ord. 678 § 1, 2008: Ord. 595 § 1, 2002; Ord. 380 § 1, 1987)

 

19.12.130 Flood hazard reduction—Floodways.
     Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 19.12.040 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply:

     A.      Encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development are prohibited unless certification by a registered civil engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge.

     B.      If subsection A of this section is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this section.

     C.      The placement of manufactured homes is prohibited, except in an existing manufactured home park or existing manufactured home subdivision. (Ord. 678 § 1, 2008: Ord. 595 § 1, 2002; Ord. 380 § 1, 1987)

 

19.12.140 Flood hazard reduction—Shallow flooding.
     Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in Section 19.12.040 are areas designated as shallow flooding. These areas have special flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist and where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply:

     A.      All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated above the crown of the nearest street to or above the depth number specified on the community’s FIRM.

     B.      All new construction and substantial improvements of nonresidential structures shall:

     1.      Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated above the crown of the nearest street to or above the depth number specified on the FIRM; or

     2.      Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be completely floodproofed to or above that level so that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy. (Ord. 678 § 1, 2008: Ord. 595 § 1, 2002; Ord. 380 § 1, 1987)

Chapter 19.16 RESIDENTIAL AND HILLSIDE DEVELOPMENT CONTROL MEASURE
19.16.010 Purpose and findings.
     A.      The unique character of the city of Loma Linda (the “city”) as a quiet university town surrounded by open spaces, including undeveloped hills, and agricultural and citrus producing lands is cherished by its residents. Residents of Loma Linda perceive the city as a community of homes and businesses where grown children are eager to return to raise their families.

     B.      Uncontrolled high density urban development would permanently alter the character of the city and threaten the public health, safety, and welfare by causing increased traffic congestion, associated air pollution, noise, and higher crime rates. Costly expansion of public facilities and services, including police and fire services, would be required to meet the needs of a rapidly urbanizing community. This would create inevitable conflicts between urban and rural uses within the city and would permanently degrade the quality of life experienced by its residents.

     C.      The hillside areas within the city and its sphere of influence contribute to the community’s health and welfare by providing open space, natural beauty, wildlife habitat, and recreational opportunities. Development of these critical hillside areas at no more than the maximum allowable densities set forth in this initiative measure will minimize the need for and costs of extension of city services such as sewer, water, streets, utilities, and emergency services. Limiting densities in the hillside areas will minimize the need for grading and land form alteration and contribute to the public health, safety, and welfare by reducing the risks of landslides, fires, erosions, slope instabilities, floods, earthquakes, and related hazards which often occur when steep hillsides are developed at higher densities.

     D.      The Loma Linda General Plan is comprised of Resolution 105, which was adopted on September 11, 1973 and all amendments adopted through September 14, 2005 (the “Loma Linda General Plan”). The Loma Linda General Plan also includes an initiative measure (Ordinance 495) enacted by a vote of the people in 1993 to address hillside conservation issues and an amendment to that initiative measure which was adopted by a vote of the people in 1996 (Ordinance 541). Ordinance 541 is codified at Chapter 20.12 of the Loma Linda Municipal Code. Ordinances 495 and 541 are collectively referred to in this initiative measure as the “Hillside Conservation Amendments.” This initiative measure is intended to support and expand the Hillside Conservation Amendments as growth management tools and to include areas of land not previously subject to those provisions of law as well as to address other growth management related issues that affect urban development in the city.

     E.      The purpose and intent of this initiative measure is to amend the Loma Linda General Plan by the addition of a new growth management element designed to establish principles of managed growth that will preserve, enhance, and maintain the special quality of life valued by this community, including the protection of hillside areas, preservation of open space, and maintenance of safe, quiet residential areas so that future development within the city will occur in a way that promotes the social and economic well-being of the entire community.

     F.      This initiative measure is consistent with and furthers the explicit policy of the state of California set forth in California Government Code Section 51220 which reads in relevant part as follows:

 

“...[T]he discouragement of premature and unnecessary conversion of agricultural land to urban uses is a matter of public interest and will be of benefit to urban dwellers themselves in that it will discourage discontiguous urban development patterns which unnecessarily increase the costs of community services to community residents.”

 

“...[I]n a rapidly urbanizing society agricultural lands have a definite public value as open space, and the preservation in agricultural production of such lands, the use of which may be limited under the provisions of this chapter, constitutes an important physical, social, esthetic and economic asset to existing or pending urban or metropolitan developments.”

 

     G.      The maximum allowable densities set forth in this initiative measure for the city and for its hillside areas as designated in this initiative measure are reasonable and appropriate. These limitations and regulations relating to growth within the city are intended to provide for appropriate management of city resources and to reduce the risks of fires, landslides, and other geologic hazards.

     H.     If adopted, this initiative measure will continue to allow sufficient development of housing consistent with land designations and zoning within the city and its sphere of influence as they currently exist and as they are amended by this measure to meet the city’s regional fair share housing obligations for the foreseeable future. (Ord. 658 § 1, 2006)

 

19.16.020 Substantive general plan amendment.
     A.      Establishment of New Chapter 2A, Entitled “Growth Management Element.” To achieve the purpose of this measure, the existing general plan enacted on September 11, 1973 by Resolution No. 105 as amended thereafter through September 14, 2005 (the “Loma Linda General Plan”) is amended by the addition of a new Chapter 2A reading in its entirety as follows:

 

“CHAPTER 2A: GROWTH MANAGEMENT ELEMENT

 

    In order to achieve the goal of maintaining the unique quality of life in the City of Loma Linda and to assure the protection of natural hillsides, the preservation of open space, the reduction of traffic congestion, and the maintenance of safe, quiet residential areas, the following principles of managed growth shall apply to all new development:

 

    SECTION 1: SIX PRINCIPLES OF MANAGED GROWTH

 

    A. PRINCIPLE ONE — New development within the planning area and sphere of influence of the City of Loma Linda shall conform to City development standards that promote environmentally sensitive development designed to preserve and enhance the quality of life now experienced in the City.

 

    In order to assure that future development within the City of Loma Linda is limited so that it promotes the environmental, social and economic well-being of the entire community, the following standards shall apply to new development in all areas within the City and its sphere of influence:

 

    1. Definitions

 

    (a) Definition of Gross Land Area. Gross Land Area of developable land in any residential project is defined as the area remaining after deducting the area of any floodway easement, utility easement, and the area of the right-of-way of any bordering street.

 

    (b) Residential Land Use Designations and Standards Defined. The following maximum allowable densities apply with regard to Gross Land Areas within the residential land use designations set forth below:

    Du=dwelling unit

* With potential bonus when the specified criteria of the Hillside Conservation Amendments are met.

** With potential bonus when the specified criteria of this Chapter 2A are met.

 

    (c) Minimum Residential Lot Size. The minimum lot size for a single family residence, regardless of density bonuses, shall not be less than seven thousand two hundred (7,200) square feet in any planning area or zone.

 

    (d) Maximum Residential Building Height. The maximum residential building height shall not exceed thirty-five (35) feet.

 

    (e) Avoidance of Environmentally Sensitive Areas. New development shall be sited so as to maximize the permanent preservation of large blocks of unbroken open space and to minimize the loss of habitat, wildlife, and watershed resources.

 

    (f) Development to Respect Wildlife Habitats. Development projects are to be designed to protect habitat values and to preserve significant habitat areas and habitat connections in their natural condition:

 

    i. Within habitat areas of rare, threatened or endangered species, disturbance of protected biotic resources is prohibited.

 

    ii. Development shall avoid “canyon bottoms,” which are defined as the land occurring within 200 feet of either side of a line referred to as a “blue line stream” as designated on a U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) map. Within riparian and wetland areas, the vegetative resources that contribute to habitat carrying capacity (vegetative diversity, faunal resting areas, foraging areas, and food sources) shall be preserved in place or replaced so as to not result in a measurable reduction in the reproductive capacity of sensitive biotic resources. Development shall not result in a net loss of wetlands.

 

    iii. Buffer zones adjacent to areas of preserved biological resources shall be provided. Such buffer zones shall be adequate in width so as to protect biological resources from grading and construction activities, as well as from the long-term use of adjacent lands. The landscape design adjacent to areas of preserved biological resources shall be designed so as to avoid invasive species that could negatively impact the value of the preserved resource.

 

    (g) Animal Uses Preserved. Within single family residential areas, existing entitlements for recreational, equestrian and animal uses shall be preserved.

 

    (h) Alternative Infrastructure. Use of alternative infrastructure (e.g., septic systems, water systems, etc.,) may be permitted in areas where municipal systems feasibly cannot be extended in an economically feasible manner. The cost of either alternative infrastructure or the extension of municipal systems shall be the responsibility of the developer.

 

    (i) San Timoteo Creek Area Designation. The San Timoteo Creek Area is depicted on Exhibit A to this Chapter 2A. Land area in the San Timoteo Creek Area shall not be re-designated for any use other than single family residential use and the maximum allowable density shall not exceed more than two (2) dwelling units per acre. Land in this area may only be re-designated for single family residential use at a maximum allowable density which shall not exceed two (2) dwelling units per acre upon approval by a four-fifths (4/5) vote of the total authorized membership of the City Council following a noticed public hearing. The boundaries of the San Timoteo Creek Area are described in Exhibit A1 to this Chapter 2A.

 

    2. Development in the City’s Planning Area and Sphere of Influence

 

    Development within the planning area and within the sphere of influence of the City, and within all other areas outside the City for which City services are requested to be provided, shall conform to development standards within the City and shall be subject to the following policies:

 

    (a) Residential Density Standards Shall be Retained. Neither the number of residential land use designations nor the maximum residential density standards set forth in this Chapter 2A shall be increased without a vote of the people.

 

    (b) Development Agreements. All development agreements entered into by the City and any developer pursuant to California Government Code Sections 65864, et seq., shall conform to the policies contained in the Loma Linda General Plan, including without limitation this Chapter 2A, and the Loma Linda zoning ordinance.

 

    (c) Annexation. No pre-annexation agreement shall be entered into by the City that conflicts with the Loma Linda General Plan and/or this Chapter 2A. Any property subject to a pre-annexation agreement or otherwise annexed to the City shall be designated and zoned to conform to the Loma Linda General Plan including this Chapter 2A, and any previous designation and zoning imposed by any other jurisdiction shall be null and void.

 

    (d) Extension of Public Utilities Outside the City Limits. Extension of utility services shall mean the provision of any utility or public service to any parcel of land not subject to City metering, billing, taxation or other fee for service arrangement for such services. No extension, connection, or provision, either directly or indirectly through any other entity, of City-provided utility services to areas or parcels outside the City limits shall occur until such areas or parcels are properly annexed to the City, except that utility services may be extended, connected, or provided to areas or parcels outside the City limits without prior annexation if, and only if, all of the following conditions are met:

 

    i. The area or parcel to be served is not contiguous to the City;

 

    ii. The City and the landowner have entered into a properly recorded and binding pre-annexation agreement establishing covenants running with the land that assure full compliance with all development standards of the City, payment of all capital improvement and other development fees which would be applicable to the property if it were within the City limits at the time of extension, connection, or provision of such services, and immediate processing of annexation to the City at the City’s request; and

 

    iii. The landowner agrees as a condition of extension, connection, or provision of utility services or facilities to serve the proposed development to pay the full cost of such extension, connection, or provision of such utility services or facilities, including without limitation its proportionate share of the cost of developed infrastructure necessary for the extension, connection, or provision of such utility services.

 

    3. Development Fee Policy

 

    In accord with the provisions of California Government Code Sections 66000 et seq., all development projects as defined therein shall be required to pay development fees to cover 100% of their pro rata share of the cost of any public infrastructure, facilities, or services, including without limitation roads, sewer, utility, police and fire services, necessitated as a result of the approval of such development. The City Council shall set and determine development fees sufficient to cover 100% of their pro rata share of the estimated cost of such public infrastructure, facilities, and services based on appropriate cost-benefit analyses, as required by the provisions of California law.

 

    B. PRINCIPLE TWO — The hillside areas of the City of Loma Linda, its planning area and its sphere of influence are important to the community and shall be preserved in as natural a state as possible consistent with the Hillside Conservation Amendments and the standards set forth in this Chapter 2A.

 

    1. Hillside Preservation Area Defined

 

    The Hillside Preservation Area is depicted on Exhibit A to this Chapter 2A. The boundaries of the Hillside Preservation Area are described in Exhibit A1 to this Chapter 2A.

 

    2. Hillside Conservation Area Defined

 

    The Hillside Conservation Area is described in the Hillside Conservation Ordinance (Ordinance 495) as amended by Ordinance 541, which is codified as Chapter 20.12 of the Loma Linda Municipal Code, and is described in Exhibit B of that Ordinance. The boundaries of the Hillside Conservation Area as depicted on Exhibit A to this Chapter 2A are intended to be consistent with Ordinance 541. In the event that any inconsistency should be found, the map set forth as Exhibit A to this Chapter 2A shall control over the map attached to Ordinance 541 as Exhibit A and the legal description attached to Ordinance 541 as Exhibit B.

 

    3. Expanded Hillside Area Defined

 

    The Expanded Hillside Area is depicted on Exhibit A to this Chapter 2A. The boundaries of the Expanded Hillside Area are described in Exhibit A1 to this Chapter 2A.

 

    4. Hillside Preservation Area, Hillside Conservation Area and Expanded Hillside Area Development

 

    (a) Permitted Development. The City shall only allow future development within the Hillside Preservation Area, the Hillside Conservation Area, and the Expanded Hillside Area which:

 

    i. Protects the area’s natural environment and sensitive environmental features, as well as public health and safety, maximizing the preservation of land in permanent public open space;

 

    ii. Ensures that the design and layout of future hillside development adapts to the natural hillside topography; and

 

    iii. Minimizes the need for and costs of providing infrastructure, utilities, and public services to all hillside areas.

 

    (b) Ridgeline Setbacks. Development shall be set back from Primary Ridgelines 100 feet horizontally and 100 feet vertically. “Primary Ridgelines” include ridgelines having any of the following characteristics:

 

    i. Ridges that have a difference in elevation of at least 200 feet from the toe of slope of the valley floor or the toe of slope of any canyon floor;

 

    ii. Ridges which, prior to grading, are visible, or which would be visible but for man-made obstructions such as buildings or houses, from north of Barton Road, Interstate 10, or east of San Timoteo Canyon Road;

 

    iii. Ridges that form a prominent landform in the foreground, a major skyline ridge in the background, or one of the layers of ridges that may be visible in between, or which would be visible but for man-made obstructions such as buildings or houses; or

 

    iv. Ridges that frame major visual access when a person is traveling through the Hillside Preservation Area, the Hillside Conservation Area or the Expanded Hillside Area and will provide the first view of valley and canyon areas as a traveler emerges from the other side of the ridge.

 

    (c) Commercial Uses Generally Prohibited. No commercial uses such as, but not limited to, retail stores, professional or medical buildings, offices, warehouses, construction or manufacturing businesses, and hotels, shall be allowed in the Hillside Preservation Area, the Expanded Hillside Area or the Hillside Conservation Area except that commercial animal and agricultural uses such as ranches, stables, grazing, citrus and avocado groves that existed as of the Effective Date of enactment of this Chapter 2A shall be allowed. Commercial recreational uses and associated uses may be allowed consistent with the protection of environmental values.

 

    (d) Trails Master Plan Policies. The City shall develop a Trails Master Plan that identifies existing usable trails and potential future trails and open space areas in the Hillside Preservation Area, the Expanded Hillside Area, and the Hillside Conservation Area. Once a Trails Master Plan is adopted, the City shall encourage new development to be consistent with the Trails Master Plan. New development in the Hillside Preservation Area, the Expanded Hillside Area and the Hillside Conservation Area shall provide a trail system that will link with future dedicated trails. Sidewalks in development projects are not considered trails unless such sidewalks are suitably broad and equipped for equestrian use.

 

    5. Clustering Policies for Hillside Preservation Area

 

    (a) Clustering. Clustering requires development to be grouped in the more level and less environmentally sensitive portions of the Hillside Preservation Area, while steeper or more environmentally sensitive areas are preserved in a natural state. Clustering should facilitate the permanent protection of key natural features, such as, without limitation, steep slopes, biological habitats, recreational roads and trails, ridgelines, and scenic areas.

 

    (b) Only Single Family Residences Permitted. Only single family residences shall be permitted in the Hillside Preservation Area.

 

    (c) Dedication of Open Space. Where clustering is allowed, the remaining open space shall be preserved and deeded to the City and dedicated as permanent open space and/or conservation area or subject to a permanent conservation easement and shall be open to the public for non-commercial recreational uses consistent with environmental values. The City is prohibited from permitting any development inconsistent with non-commercial recreational uses or open space on such dedicated land without a vote of the people.

 

    (d) No Clustering on Northerly Facing Slopes. In no event shall clustering be permitted on the northerly facing slopes which, prior to grading, are visible, or which would be visible but for man-made obstructions such as buildings or houses, from north of Barton Road, Interstate 10, or east of San Timoteo Canyon Road (the “Northerly Facing Slopes”).

 

    (e) No Commercial Recreational Development on Northernmost Northerly Facing Slopes. In no event shall commercial recreational development or associated development be permitted on the northernmost Northerly Facing Slopes.

 

    (f) Urban Slope Line. The Urban Slope Line is depicted on Exhibit A to this Chapter 2A. This line is intended to correspond to the toe of slope of the hillside. If there is a discrepancy between the Urban Slope Line as depicted on Exhibit A and the toe of a slope for a particular parcel as determined by a registered civil engineer or surveyor, the line which is farther north is the line which shall be used for purposes of determining the Cluster Area boundary line for that particular parcel.

 

    (g) Cluster Areas. The following are general descriptions of the only areas where clustered housing is allowed:

 

    i. Cluster Area A, with 2 1/2-acre minimum lot size: south of Beaumont Avenue and the southern boundary of the railroad, north of the Urban Slope Line, east of Bryn Mawr Avenue, and west of Nevada Street.

 

    ii. Cluster Area B, with 1-acre minimum lot size: south of the eastern boundary of Loma Linda’s Sphere of Influence, north of the Urban Slope Line, east of Nevada Street, and west of the eastern boundary of Loma Linda’s Sphere of Influence.

 

    iii. Cluster Area C, with 1/2-acre minimum lot size: with the exception of the Northerly Facing Slopes, south of the ridgelines of the northernmost Northerly Facing Slopes.

 

    6. Density Bonus Policies for Developments in Hillside Preservation Area

 

    A density bonus is allowed only where clustering of dwelling units and additional public benefits, such as preservation of open space, are provided. In no event shall more than one density bonus be allowed for any particular project.

 

    (a) Criteria for Allowing a Density Bonus.

 

    Where all of the following criteria are met, a density bonus as provided in Section 6(b) may be permitted:

 

    i. No dwelling unit or related structure or commercial recreational development or associated development is located on the northernmost Northerly Facing Slopes;

 

    ii. The project is clustered except for in no event shall clustering be permitted on any Northerly Facing Slopes;

 

    iii. In no event shall a lot size less than 2 1/2 acres be permitted in Cluster Area A;

 

    iv. In no event shall a lot size less than 1 acre be permitted in Cluster Area B;

 

    v. In no event shall a lot size less than 1/2 acre be permitted in Cluster Area C;

 

    vi. In no event shall densities or density bonuses be transferred from parcels south of the northernmost ridgelines to land north of the northernmost ridgelines;

 

    vii. All development infrastructure, including roads, and utility and service extensions, is kept off of the Northerly Facing Slopes to the fullest extent possible;

 

    viii. The need for extensions of streets and other utilities and services is minimized;

 

    ix. The remaining open space created through clustering, including without limitation, significant natural areas, view areas, and habitats, is preserved and deeded to the City and dedicated as permanent open space and/or conservation area;

 

    x. Provision is made for riding and hiking trails; and

 

    xi. The land is not located within the area depicted as Rural Estates on Exhibit A to this Chapter 2A.

 

    (b) Extent of Density Bonus Allowed Where All Criteria Are Met.

 

    Where all of the criteria set forth in Section 6(a) above are met, the City may grant a density bonus as follows:

 

    i. In the Low Density Hillside Preservation Area, one unit per 10 acres is allowed, subject to a density bonus of up to one dwelling unit per 5 acres; and

 

    ii. In the Medium Density Hillside Preservation Area, one unit per 5 acres is allowed, subject to a density bonus of up to one dwelling unit per 2.5 acres.

 

    (c) Alternative Density Bonus Standard.

 

    In lieu of the above density bonuses, the City may grant a density bonus of up to 1.5 dwelling units per 5 acres in the Low Density Hillside Preservation Area, and a density bonus of up to 1.5 dwelling units per 2.5 acres in the Medium Density Hillside Preservation Area, where all of the following criteria are met:

 

    i. All of the criteria set forth in Section 6(a) above; and

 

    ii. The densities and resulting density bonuses are transferred to land south of the northernmost ridgelines from parcels any portion of which is north of the northernmost ridgelines.

 

    (d) Transfer of Densities. Transferring densities from land north of the northernmost ridgelines to south of those ridgelines shall be encouraged.

 

    (e) The City May Refuse to Allow a Density Bonus. The City may refuse to allow a density bonus for reasons that include, but are not limited to the public health, safety, and welfare, environmental concerns, protection of view sheds, habitat preservation, maintenance of recreational trails, or any other rational basis consistent with the goals of the Loma Linda General Plan, the Trails Master Plan, and this Chapter 2A.

 

    7. Grading Policies for Hillside Preservation Area

 

    (a) Focused Grading Allowed. Focused Grading is defined as the minimum grading required for access roads, the grading necessary for the extension of City services, and/or the grading of no more than the size of the footprint of the house and ancillary structures on each individual lot, with each such footprint and ancillary structures separated from each adjacent lot by ungraded, natural terrain. Mass Grading is defined as any grading that does not meet the definition of Focused Grading.

 

    (b) Mass Grading Prohibited. Mass Grading on any Primary Ridgeline or any Northerly Facing Slope is prohibited.

 

    (c) Slope Conforming Foundations Required. Development shall preserve natural scenic vistas where the natural slope is fifteen (15) percent or greater by requiring building foundations for structures to conform to the natural slope to minimize grading and other environmental impacts and to ensure that roof lines do not eliminate or obstruct ridgelines.

 

    8. Limitation of Traffic Impacts

 

    Roads through the Hillside Conservation Area and/or the Hillside Preservation Area and/or the Expanded Hillside Area from Reche Canyon Road or San Timoteo Canyon Road to roads north of the Hillside Conservation Area or the Hillside Preservation Area or the Expanded Hillside Area shall be restricted to use by emergency vehicles only. Otherwise, no existing or future roads shall be connected to Reche Canyon Road or San Timoteo Canyon Road, or to each other by roads through the Hillside Conservation Area or the Hillside Preservation Area or the Expanded Hillside Area. Examples of existing roads which these restrictions apply to, include, but are not limited to, Anderson Way, Allen Way, Carrol Court, Loma Linda Drive, Welebir Street, Almond Court, Pecan Way, Crestview Drive, Richardson Street, Sierra Vista Drive, Oakwood Drive, Bryn Mawr Avenue, Whittier Avenue, Wellesley Avenue, Beaumont Avenue and roads extending to the south of Beaumont Avenue, Lawton Avenue and roads extending to the south of Lawton Avenue, and Mountain View Avenue. A road which connects to Beaumont Avenue in two different locations may be allowed, so long as it does not connect to other existing roads.

 

    9. Roads in Hillside Conservation Area, Expanded Hillside Area, and Hillside Preservation Area

 

    Construction of roads in the Hillside Conservation Area, the Expanded Hillside Area, and the Hillside Preservation Area must minimize grading and be consistent with environmental concerns, view sheds, habitat preservation, wildlife corridor preservation, recreational trails, landslide avoidance, and other factors related to the public health, safety, and welfare.

 

    The Hillside Preservation Area, the Hillside Conservation Area, and the Expanded Hillside Area shall be developed with the minimum number of roads possible, with clustering of development strongly encouraged to minimize the need for access roads. The purpose of limitations on through roads is to minimize the adverse impacts of through traffic and the environmental damage that is often caused by road construction. All roads in the Hillside Preservation Area, the Hillside Conservation Area, and the Expanded Hillside Area should be designed to fit the hilly terrain by following contour lines, using minimum pavement widths, relaxed curve and other standards, and slow speeds.

 

    C. PRINCIPLE THREE — New developments shall be planned and constructed in a manner that preserves natural scenic vistas and protects against intrusion on the view shed areas.

 

    1. Preservation of Vistas

 

    New development shall only be approved if it preserves scenic vistas of natural hillside areas and ridgelines, which, prior to grading, are visible, or which would be visible but for man-made obstructions such as buildings or houses, from north of Barton Road, Interstate 10, or east of San Timoteo Canyon Road.

 

    2. Minimization of View Shed Intrusion

 

    New development shall only be approved if it minimizes wall surfaces facing towards view shed areas through the use of split pads, varying setbacks, low roof pitches, and landscaping.

 

    3. Architectural Compatibility

 

    New development shall only be approved if it uses architectural style which is compatible with the natural setting. The use of colors, textures, materials, and forms which will attract attention shall be avoided.

 

    4. Massing and Scale

 

    The overall scale and massing of structures shall respect the natural surroundings by incorporating designs which minimize bulk and mass, and minimize visual intrusion on the natural landscape. Structures shall be sited to best fit with a hillside’s natural contours in hillside areas.

 

    D. PRINCIPLE FOUR — Preservation of open space and agricultural land areas is a priority in the City of Loma Linda, its planning area and its sphere of influence, and dedication of open space in perpetuity shall be a requirement for certain development as well as for the City.

 

    1. City-owned Land

 

    The City-owned land in the Hillside Conservation Area, the Expanded Hillside Area, and the Hillside Preservation Area (approximately 850 acres) is designated open space with no development of any type allowable except as provided in this Chapter 2A. The City shall not sell, rent, lease, or otherwise confer any right or title to land in the Hillside Conservation Area, the Expanded Hillside Area or the Hillside Preservation Area to which the City holds title without a vote of the people. The sole exception to this restriction is that the City-owned land southwest of the San Jacinto Fault Line (approximately 350 acres) may be traded for other land inside the Hillside Conservation Area and/or the Hillside Preservation Area and/or the Expanded Hillside Area so long as the land received is preserved and deeded to the City and dedicated as permanent open space and/or conservation area. Land southwest of the San Jacinto Fault Line that is traded by the City may be re-designated for use other than open space after it is traded. Land may be traded only to preserve open space and to reduce densities in other, more highly valued hillside areas, and for no other purposes. The City shall not approve a trade of land unless all of the following conditions are met: (1) Mountain View Avenue shall not connect to future development in the traded land, (2) All roads connecting to future development in the traded land shall not extend farther east than Mountain View Avenue, and (3) The only roads which may connect to future development in the traded land are Oakwood Drive or roads connecting to Reche Canyon Road.

 

    City-owned land in the Hillside Conservation Area, the Hillside Preservation Area, and the Expanded Hillside Area shall be open to public non-commercial recreational uses consistent with the protection of environmental values. Public non-commercial recreational amenities, such as, but not limited to, parks, trails, and tennis courts may be allowed on City-owned land.

 

    2. Planned Residential Developments and Planned Communities

 

    Planned Residential Developments and Planned Communities shall meet one of the following open space standards as described below:

 

    (a) Properties under Fifteen Percent Slope. Not less than twenty percent of the gross land area shall be held in common as landscaped, recreational open space. Such open space shall contain a minimum dimension of fifty square feet, and be accessible to each lot through a system of public or private walkways. Open space areas may include swimming pools, putting greens, court games, and other recreational leisure facilities, as well as landscaped areas or areas with native vegetation. Such areas shall be identified as permanent open space on the final tract map. Open space calculations shall not include buildings, private patios, balconies, driveways, and off-street parking areas.

 

    (b) Properties with an Average Slope of Fifteen Percent or More. Not less than twenty-five percent of the gross land area shall be held in common open space. Such open space shall contain a minimum dimension of twenty-five square feet, and be accessible to each lot through a system of public or private walkways. Open space areas may include natural undeveloped areas of land, swimming pools, putting greens, court games, and other recreational leisure facilities, as well as landscaped areas or areas with native vegetation. Such areas shall be identified as permanent open space on the final tract map. Open space calculations shall not include buildings, private patios, balconies, driveways, and off-street parking areas.

 

    (c) Preservation of Citrus Groves. The City recognizes the desire to maintain citrus and avocado groves and other agricultural uses as a means to provide open space, to provide and maintain a balanced economy, and to maintain green space and vegetation that will consume carbon dioxide and improve air quality. The open space requirement of paragraphs (a) and (b) of this section may be met by preserving citrus and/or avocado groves or other agricultural uses determined appropriate by the City Council, and assuring ongoing maintenance through a conservation easement or other legal mechanism, provided that the minimum percentage open space requirement of (a) and (b) are met.

 

    (d) Common Open Space. Common open space may include areas held in common by associations where the perpetual open space is guaranteed by acceptable legal mechanisms including public and private easements and conservation easements and other open space conditions, restrictions and covenants guaranteed in perpetuity by similar mechanisms. If an applicant proposes to dedicate a portion of a site as public park lands, this area may be considered as common open space by the affirmative vote of a majority of the City Council.

 

    (e) Maintenance of Common Open Space. Maintenance of common open space areas within Planned Residential Developments and Planned Communities shall be the responsibility of the developer and the residents. In no event shall the City be responsible for such maintenance.

 

    E. PRINCIPLE FIVE — Water quality and availability are critical to the current and future residents of the City of Loma Linda, its planning area and its sphere of influence. No new development shall be approved that endangers the quality or quantity of water delivered to households within the City.

 

    No development project shall be approved which would cause the quality of water delivered to Loma Linda households to fail to meet State and/or Federal water quality standards, or which would cause an increase in residential rates, or which would result in a restriction of water usage, except for those projects exempt under State and/or Federal law.

 

    F. PRINCIPLE SIX — Traffic levels of service throughout the City of Loma Linda shall be maintained at current levels and new development shall be required to fully mitigate any impact on traffic resulting from that development.

 

    Limitations on traffic levels of service are essential to managing growth within the City by preventing undue urbanization and its attendant urban blight, the degradation of public services, and the over-intensive development of land.

 

    1. Traffic Levels of Service Defined

 

    Level of service (LOS) is a qualitative measure of traffic service along a roadway or at an intersection. LOS ranges from A to F, with LOS A being best and LOS F being worst. LOS A, B and C indicate conditions where traffic can move relatively freely. LOS D describes conditions where delay is more noticeable and average travel speeds are as low as 40 percent of the free flow speed. LOS E indicates significant delays and average travel speeds of one-third the free flow speed or lower where traffic volumes are generally at or close to capacity. Finally, LOS F characterizes flow at very slow speeds (stop-and-go), and large delays (over a minute) with queuing at signalized intersections; in effect, the traffic demand on the roadway exceeds the roadway’s capacity. Levels of Service are defined according to the following table:

 

Level of Service

Description

Volume to Capacity Ratio:

Freeway Segments

Street Segments

LOS A

Conditions of free flow; speed is controlled by driver’s desires, speed limits, or physical roadway conditions.

0 to 0.30

0 to 0.60

LOS B

Conditions of stable flow; operating speeds begin to be restricted; little or no restrictions on maneuverability from other vehicles.

0.31 to 0.49

0.61 to 0.70

LOS C

Conditions of stable flow; speeds and maneuverability more closely restricted; occasional backups behind left-turning vehicles at intersections.

0.50 to 0.71

0.71 to 0.80

LOS D

Conditions approach unstable flow; tolerable speeds can be maintained but temporary restrictions may cause extensive delays; little freedom to maneuver; comfort and convenience low; at intersection, some motorists, especially those making left turns, may wait through one or more signal changes.

0.72 to 0.88

0.81 to 0.90

LOS E

Conditions approach capacity; unstable flow with stoppages of momentary duration; maneuverability severely limited.

0.89 to 1.00

0.91 to 1.00

LOS F

Forced flow conditions; stoppages for long periods; low operating speeds.

>1.00

>1.00

    2. Levels of Traffic Service Throughout the City Shall Be Maintained

 

    To assure the adequacy of various public services and to prevent degradation of the quality of life experienced by the residents of Loma Linda, all new development projects shall assure by implementation of appropriate mitigation measures that, at a minimum, traffic levels of service (LOS) are maintained at a minimum of LOS C throughout the City, except where the current level of service is lower than LOS C. In any location where the level of service is below LOS C at the time an application for a development project is submitted, mitigation measures shall be imposed on that development project to assure, at a minimum, that the level of traffic service is maintained at levels of service that are no worse than those existing at the time an application for development is filed. In any location where the Level of Service is LOS F at the time an application for a development project is submitted, mitigation measures shall be imposed on that development project to assure, at a minimum, that the volume to capacity ratio is maintained at a volume to capacity ratio that is no worse than that existing at the time an application for development is filed. Projects where sufficient mitigation to achieve the above stated objectives is infeasible shall not be approved unless and until the necessary mitigation measures are identified and implemented.

 

    SECTION 2: EXEMPTIONS

 

    The following categories of development shall be exempt from certain restrictions of the Principles of Managed Growth set forth in this Chapter 2A, as specified herein.

 

    A. Vested Projects. This Chapter 2A shall not apply to or affect any property on which a vested right has been legally perfected and acquired pursuant to state law prior to the Effective Date.

 

    B. Certain Non-Profit Entities. Development projects that directly further the primary institutional purposes of Loma Linda University Adventist Health Sciences Center and/or related entities or subsidiaries are exempt from the traffic level of service requirements except as to those related to the Hillside Preservation Area, the Hillside Conservation Area and the Expanded Hillside Area, the building height requirements, and the maximum allowable residential densities except for those set forth for the Hillside Conservation Area and the Hillside Preservation Area, so long as such development projects are either 1) non-residential in character, or 2) provide only student and/or staff housing for those exempt entities. In no event shall such entities be exempt from the standards established in Principle Two of this Chapter 2A.

 

    C. Infill Construction. New infill construction of individual single family homes on existing lots of record that are smaller than 5 acres, and bounded on three sides by developed property as of the Effective Date of this Chapter 2A, are exempt from the traffic level of service requirements.

 

    D. Remodeling, Rehabilitation and Additions. Rehabilitation, remodeling or additions to existing single family residential structures are exempt from the traffic level of service requirements.

 

    E. Reconstruction and Replacement. Reconstruction or replacement of any uses to the same density, intensity and classification of use as existed on the Effective Date of this Chapter 2A, including legal non-conforming uses, are exempt from the traffic level of service requirements.

 

    F. Temporary Uses. Special, temporary, or occasional uses of public streets, including parades, local sporting and cultural events, graduation ceremonies, approved school activities, religious gatherings, and other occasional public gatherings, are exempt from the traffic level of service requirements.

(Ord. 658 § 2, 2006)

 

19.16.030 General plan internal text amendments.
     To achieve the purpose of this initiative measure and to address its findings, the text of the existing general plan as adopted by the Loma Linda City Council on September 11, 1973, and as amended through September 14, 2005 (the “Loma Linda General Plan”) is further amended to assure internal consistency as required by California law. Text additions are shown in underline and deletions in strikethrough.

     A.      Goals and Policies. Chapter Two of the Loma Linda General Plan as amended by Ordinance 541 entitled “Goals and Policies” is amended as follows:

     1.      Pages 7 to 8 Policy 6, is amended as follows:

 

    6. The citizens of Loma Linda will have available a choice of areas of varying densities and housing of ranging costs. The General Plan has provided for the following residential gross densities land use designations throughout the community:

 

    (a) Hillside Conservation, zero to one dwelling unit per 10 acres, with a potential bonus up to one dwelling unit per 5 acres when the specified criteria of the Hillside Conservation designation are met.

 

    (b) Low Density Hillside Preservation, zero to one dwelling unit per 10 acres, with a potential bonus when the specified criteria of Chapter 2A, Growth Management Element, are met.

 

    (c) Medium Density Hillside Preservation, zero to one dwelling unit per 5 acres, with a potential bonus when the specified criteria of Chapter 2A, Growth Management Element, are met.

 

    (d) Rural Estates, zero to one dwelling unit per acre.

 

    (b)(e) Very Low Density, one-tenth zero to two dwelling units per acre.

 

    (c)(f) Low density, one zero to four dwelling units per acre.

 

    (d)(g) Medium density, five zero to 10 nine dwelling units per acre.

 

    (e)(h) High density, 11 zero to 20 13 dwelling units per acre.

 

    (i) Very High Density, zero to 20 dwelling units per acre.

 

    (j) Senior Citizen Housing, zero to 25 dwelling units per acre.

 

     B.      Planning Elements. Chapter Three of the Loma Linda General Plan entitled “Planning Elements” is amended as follows:

     1.      Page 10. The opening paragraph of Planning Elements is amended as follows:

 

    The comprehensive General Plan consists of a number of parts called elements. This approach provides for a systematic analysis of the community’s planning functions. It must be constantly remembered, however, that all of the elements are intricately woven together, and a significant change in one could effect affect them all. Chapter 2A, “Growth Management Element” augments and updates the provisions of this Planning Element with regard to land use densities, planned residential developments and communities, circulation, housing, conservation and open space provisions. To the extent that any inconsistency exists, the provisions of Chapter 2A control. Any provision of this element that is inconsistent with any provision of Chapter 2A is null and void.

 

     C.      Land Use Element.

     1.      Chapter Three of the Loma Linda General Plan entitled “Land Use Element” is amended as follows:

     a.      Page 10. The opening paragraph of the Land Use Element is amended as follows:

 

    Public and private uses of land constitute a major ingredient of the General Plan to form an instrument of public policy decision-making. It is in the land use element that the goals and policies previously determined and agreed to, find their greatest fulfillment. Chapter 2A, “Growth Management Element” augments and updates the provisions of this Land Use Element with regard to land use densities, planned residential development and communities, hillside conservation, traffic, circulation and open space provisions both within the City and within its planning areas and sphere of influence. To the extent that any inconsistency exists between this Land Use Element and the provisions of Chapter 2A, the provisions of Chapter 2A control. Any provision of this element that is inconsistent with any provision of Chapter 2A is therefore null and void.

 

     2.      Page 10. The first three sentences in the section entitled “Residential-Low Density” are amended as follows:

 

    Residential neighborhoods in Loma Linda’s General Plan are comprised of three ten densities of families — Hillside Conservation, Low Density Hillside Preservation, Medium Density Hillside Preservation, Rural Estates, Very Low Density, low Density, medium Density, and high Density, Very High Density, and Senior Citizen Housing. These densities are expressed on a gross basis, i.e., an inclusion of streets, easements and other non-residential uses customarily found in residential neighborhoods consistent with Chapter 2A, Growth Management Element. Low density has a range of from 1 0 - 4 dwelling units per acre.

 

     3.      Page 11. The first sentence in the section entitled “Residential-Medium Density” is amended as follows:

 

    Medium density residential areas range from 5 0 to 10 9 dwelling units per acre.

 

     4.      Page 12. The first sentence of the sixth paragraph in the section entitled “Residential-High Density” is amended as follows:

 

    High Density residential density land usage is intended to have residential densities of 11 0 to 20 13 dwelling units per acre and rise no higher than three stories.

 

     5.      Pages 12 to 13. The following language is deleted from the Land Use Element of the Loma Linda General Plan:

 

    Estimated Population

    Based on the gross densities in the residential density categories above, it was possible to calculate the estimated number of dwelling units and population when the several areas are completely built up. No estimations were made when such a saturation would occur.

3834 x 2.0 = 7667

2890 x 2.0 = 5780

 

The population estimates of the General Plan based on the above table showed a holding capacity of between 24,200 and 30,200 people.

    Density was calculated in three categories. Low density was figured at an assumed 4 dwelling units per gross acre; medium density at a range of from 5 to 10 dwelling units per gross acre; high density at a range of from 11 to 20 dwelling units per gross acre.

    Gross acreage consists of land used for streets and other non-residential purposes such as churches, public and quasi-public facilities normally found in residential neighborhoods.

    Since not every parcel of land will be built upon, or used for residential purposes in residentially designated areas, the total available acreage for residential development was adjusted to 85 percent of available land.

    For purposes of calculating the number of people living in each dwelling unit, the following was assumed:

    Low density — 3.0 persons per dwelling unit

    Medium density — 2.20 persons per dwelling unit at 5 dwelling units per gross acre; 2.0 persons per dwelling unit at 12 dwelling units per gross acre;

    High density — 2.0 persons per dwelling unit

     2.      The following resolutions amending the Land Use Element of the Loma Linda General Plan are repealed:

     a.      Resolution 2023, adopted on April 21, 1998, and the map attached to the resolution;

     b.      Resolution 1744, adopted on April 13, 1993, and the map attached to the resolution;

     c.       Resolution 584, adopted on August 26, 1980, and the map attached to the resolution.

     D.      Circulation Element. The 1973 version of the Loma Linda General Plan contained a circulation element (the “1973 Circulation Element”). In November of 1989, a new circulation element was adopted by the city, replacing and superseding the provisions set forth in the 1973 version of the circulation element (the “1989 Circulation Element”). In 1996, the adoption of Ordinance 541 added further amendments to the circulation element, but referenced the 1973 Circulation Element rather than the 1989 Circulation Element (collectively, the “circulation element”). In order to clarify the status of the 1973 and 1989 Circulation Element amendments made by this initiative, amendments below are referenced to each version of the circulation element as noted.

     1.      Page 1. The opening paragraph of the 1989 Circulation Element is amended by the addition of the following paragraph to the beginning of the Introduction to read as follows:

 

    The Circulation Element provides the transportation backbone for the City of Loma Linda, its planning area and its sphere of influence. The plan identifies highways which will carry volumes of traffic that are far heavier than those intended for local streets. It is vital to the future growth of the community that these streets be constructed as development occurs so that congestion and strangulation of traffic movements are prevented. Chapter 2A, “Growth Management Element” augments the provisions of this Circulation Element with regard to traffic standards and other circulation issues both within the City and within its planning areas and sphere of influence. To the extent that any inconsistency exists between this Circulation Element and the provisions of Chapter 2A, the provisions of Chapter 2A control. Any provision of this element that is inconsistent with any provision of Chapter 2A is therefore null and void.

 

     2.      Page 4. Paragraph 6 on page 4 of the section entitled “Existing Conditions” in the introduction to the 1989 Circulation Element is amended to read in its entirety as follows:

 

    While the majority of the city is developed at this time, the approximately two three thousand acres in the south hills are still undeveloped. While the terrain is very steep, this area has been master planned for a future road system. The eastern portions of the city are also largely undeveloped. The land use element has not been updated since 1979 but the designations for this area are mainly residential to the south, office and business parks to the north.

 

     3.      Page 8. Section One — Transportation of the 1989 Circulation Element is amended by the addition of the following paragraph immediately under the heading Roadways to read in its entirety as follows:

 

    Those areas designated ‘Hillside Conservation’ should be developed with the minimum number of roads possible, with clustering of development strongly encouraged to minimize the need for access roads. No through roads should be permitted in this area with the exception of Oakwood Drive extended continuously to connect to Scotch Lane and Reche Canyon Road, as shown conceptually on Exhibit ‘A,’ intended primarily to serve areas outside of the Hillside Conservation Area. The purpose of limitations on through roads is to minimize the adverse impacts of through traffic. Those roads which are necessary within the Conservation Area, other than the Oakwood Drive extension, should minimize cut and fill, should avoid disruption of important natural habitat, sensitive areas, and view areas, and should be designed to fit the hilly terrain by following contour lines, using minimum pavement widths, relaxed curve and other standards and slow speeds.

 

     4.      Page 23. The following language which was added by Ordinance 541 to the 1973 Circulation Element of the Loma Linda General Plan immediately above the “Major Highways” category on Page 23 is deleted as follows:

 

   Those areas designated “Hillside Conservation” should be developed with the minimum number of roads possible, with clustering of development strongly encouraged to minimize the need for access roads. No through roads should be permitted in this area with the exception of Oakwood Drive extended continuously to connect to Scotch Lane and Reche Canyon Road, as shown conceptually on Exhibit “A,” intended primarily to serve areas outside of the Hillside Conservation Area. The purpose of limitations on through roads is to minimize the adverse impacts of through traffic. Those roads which are necessary within the Conservation Area, other than the Oakwood Drive extension, should minimize cut and fill, should avoid disruption of important natural habitat, sensitive areas, and view areas, and should be designed to fit the hilly terrain by following contour lines, using minimum pavement widths, relaxed curve and other standards, and slow speeds.

 

     5.      Exhibit H. Exhibit H to the 1989 Circulation Element is repealed.

     E.      Housing Element. The Housing Element of the Loma Linda General Plan as updated in 1986 entitled “Housing Element” is amended as follows:

     1.      Page 1. The opening paragraph of the Housing Element is amended by the addition of the following paragraph to the beginning of the Introduction to read as follows:

 

    The residential character of the City of Loma Linda places great importance on the community’s plans for housing. If Loma Linda is to be planned as a residential community oriented toward the University and Medical Center, then housing must become a prominent consideration for public policies and guidance. Parts of the City have a very old stock of housing and consist of dwelling units which are badly in need of replacement. Other City residential areas are quite new. Chapter 2A, “Growth Management Element” augments the provisions of this Housing Element with regard to residential land use densities, planned residential development and communities, hillside conservation, and open space both within the City and within its planning areas and sphere of influence. To the extent that any inconsistency exists between this Housing Element and the provisions of Chapter 2A, the provisions of Chapter 2A control. Any provision of this element that is inconsistent with any provision of Chapter 2A is therefore null and void.

 

     F.      Conservation Element. Chapter Three of the Loma Linda General Plan entitled “Conservation Element” is amended as follows:

     1.      Page 38. The opening paragraph of the Conservation Element is amended as follows:

 

    The purpose of the Conservation Element is to designate those areas of natural resources within the Loma Linda Planning Area City of Loma Linda, its planning areas and sphere of influence so that policies for their conservation and utilization can be developed and carried out. The Conservation Element includes a plan for flood control of San Timoteo Creek. Since natural resources are of area wide significance, it is necessary for the Conservation Element to be coordinated with the responsibilities of other governmental agencies including the State of California, County of San Bernardino, and adjacent cities and service districts. Chapter 2A, “Growth Management Element” augments the provisions of this Conservation Element with regard to land use densities, hillside conservation, traffic standards and open space provisions both within the City and within its planning areas and sphere of influence. To the extent that any inconsistency exists between this Conservation Element and the provisions of Chapter 2A, the provisions of Chapter 2A control. Any provision of this element that is inconsistent with any provision of Chapter 2A is therefore null and void.

 

     G.      Open Space Element. Chapter Three of the Loma Linda General Plan entitled “Open Space Element” is amended as follows:

     1.      Page 41. The opening paragraph of the Open Space Element is amended as follows:

 

    The purpose of the Open Space Element is to identify areas of natural scenic beauty, recreation, and natural resources. The Element’s purpose also is to develop a plan for the preservation of open space and to coordinate that plan with the plans of other governmental agencies charged with the conservation and preservation of open space lands. Chapter 2A, “Growth Management Element” augments the provisions of this Open Space Element with regard to land use densities, hillside conservation, traffic standards and open space provisions both within the City and within its planning areas and sphere of influence. To the extent that any inconsistency exists between this Open Space Element and the provisions of Chapter 2A, the provisions of Chapter 2A control. Any provision of this element that is inconsistent with any provision of Chapter 2A is therefore null and void.

 

     2.      Pages 42 to 43. The eighth paragraph on page 42 which continues over to the top of page 43 of the Open Space Element of the Loma Linda General Plan is deleted as follows:

 

    One of the greatest methods by which private land will contribute to City Open Space will be through the construction of planned unit developments. The General Plan has designated multiple-family sites where land has yet to be developed as “PD” or Planned Development. Instead of conventional structures on lots, it is intended that these projects be designed and built with small private open space areas, but a sizeable portion of the site, at least twenty-five percent, held in common open space for all of the occupants of the project.

 

     H.     City Official General Plan Land Use Element Map. The city official general plan land use element map is amended to depict the San Timoteo Creek Area, the Hillside Preservation Area (consisting of Low Density Hillside Preservation, Medium Density Hillside Preservation, and Rural Estates), the Expanded Hillside Area, the Hillside Conservation Area and the Urban Slope Line as shown on Exhibit A to Chapter 2A, and any legal descriptions to the delineations set forth in the official general plan land use element map are amended to conform to legal descriptions consistent with the land areas depicted in Exhibit A to Chapter 2A. Any text in the official general plan land use element map is also amended to show residential land use designations and the maximum allowable densities set forth in Chapter 2A.

     The open space and conservation elements map attached as Exhibit B to the Loma Linda General Plan is deleted and superseded by Exhibit A to Chapter 2A to depict the San Timoteo Creek Area, the Hillside Preservation Area (consisting of Low Density Hillside Preservation, Medium Density Hillside Preservation, and Rural Estates), the Expanded Hillside Area, the Hillside Conservation Area and the Urban Slope Line as shown on Exhibit A to Chapter 2A. (Ord. 658 § 3, 2006)

 

19.16.040 Implementation.
     A.      On the effective date of this initiative measure as provided by California law (the “effective date”), all provisions of the general plan amendment set forth in Sections 19.16.020 and 19.16.030 of this chapter are inserted into and become part of the Loma Linda General Plan, except that, if for any reason the four amendments permitted by state law to be made to the mandatory elements of the Loma Linda General Plan have already occurred prior to the effective date, the provisions of the general plan amendment set forth in Sections 19.16.020 and 19.16.030 of this chapter shall become a part of the Loma Linda General Plan as soon thereafter as legally possible.

     B.      No provision of the Loma Linda Municipal Code that is inconsistent with this initiative measure shall be enforced after the effective date.

     C.      Except as provided in Section 19.16.050 of this chapter, any amendment to the Loma Linda General Plan adopted after September 11, 1973, that is inconsistent with this initiative measure is repealed and declared null and void as of the effective date of this initiative measure.

     D.      Except as provided in Section 19.16.050 of this chapter, upon the effective date, all general plan amendments, rezonings, specific plans, tentative or final subdivision maps, parcel maps, conditional use permits, building permits or other ministerial or discretionary entitlements for use, shall not be approved or issued unless consistent with the policies and provisions of this initiative measure. (Ord. 658 § 4, 2006)

 

19.16.050 No unconstitutional taking.
     A.      This initiative measure is not intended, and shall not be applied or construed to authorize the city to exercise its powers in a manner which will take private property for public use without the payment of just compensation, but shall be interpreted, applied and implemented so as to accomplish its purposes to the maximum constitutionally permissible extent without requiring payment of compensation.

     B.      If application of this initiative measure to a specific property of record as of the effective date would create a taking, then the city council may, upon application by the landowner, allow additional density or uses on such property, upon findings that the level of additional development permitted is the minimum necessary to avoid a taking, and no lesser level of development would be sufficient to avoid a taking. (Ord. 658 § 5, 2006)

 

19.16.060 Severability.
     A.      In interpreting this initiative measure or resolving any ambiguity thereof, the city council and all other city entities charged with implementing or enforcing this initiative measure or any part of it, as well as any reviewing court, shall interpret this initiative measure in the manner which most vigorously and effectively accomplishes its purposes and operative provisions.

     B.      If any portion of this initiative measure is hereafter determined to be invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, all remaining portions of this initiative measure shall remain in full force and effect. Each section, subsection, sentence, phrase, part or portion of this initiative measure would have been adopted and passed irrespective of the fact that any one or more sections, subsections, sentences, phrases, parts or portions be declared invalid or unconstitutional. (Ord. 658 § 6, 2006)

 

19.16.070 Amendment and repeal.
     This initiative measure and all of its provisions may be amended or repealed only by a majority vote of the electorate. (Ord. 658 § 7, 2006)

Chapter 20.12 HILLSIDE AREAS PRESERVATION
20.12.010 Statement of purposes and intent.
     A.      The overall intent and purpose of this chapter is to recognize the importance of preserving the significant natural hillside amenities within the boundaries of the city of Loma Linda. The reasons for preserving the hillside areas include:

     1.      Provide for preservation of the unique flora and fauna of this area;

     2.      Provide visual relief from our rapidly urbanizing area;

     3.      Minimize fire, flood, earthquake, erosion, and other natural hazards;

     4.      Provide a natural buffer for the city proper;

     5.      Minimize the costs of extending streets, utilities, and other services to difficult terrain;

     6.      Achieve the goals of the conservation and open space elements of the general plan as herein amended to preserve significant hillside areas;

     7.      Provide for trails and other natural, environmentally sensitive accesses to assist in meeting the recreational needs of the city.

     B.      It is further the intent and purpose of this chapter to provide, within those areas defined by this chapter as conservation areas, for a density and pattern of development consistent with the terrain and high visual profile and unique characteristics of the areas so defined, which will provide a reasonable use to landowners consistent with the terrain and the foregoing objectives. (Ord. 541 § 1, 1996: Ord. 495 § 1, 1993)

 

20.12.020 Findings.
     A.      A maximum density of one unit per ten acres, with the possibility of a maximum density of up to one unit per five acres where certain conditions are met, is reasonable and appropriate for this rugged, hillside terrain.

     B.      Loma Linda’s general plan, as herein amended designates, the most critical hillside areas as “conservation” in its conservation and open space elements. The intent is to preserve the sensitive hillside areas so defined by ensuring lower density development on private lands and open space on city acquired land to ensure that conservation objectives are part of the long range plan for the hillside areas.

     C.      It is necessary and appropriate to designate the critical areas of the South Hills as “conservation areas.” Authorization for development at a density of one unit per ten acres, and upon certain conditions up to one per five acres, is the maximum density that can be permitted consistent with the overall purposes and conservation goals of this chapter. A density bonus of up to one unit per five acres is acceptable only where clustering and additional public benefits are provided as herein specified.

     D.      Development of these critical hillsides at one unit per ten acres and up to one per five acres will minimize the need for the city to extend service such as sewer, water, streets, and other utilities, will minimize the risks of fire, erosion, flood, earthquake, and related hazards which often occur when steep hillsides are developed at higher densities, and will minimize the need for grading and land form alteration. (Ord. 541 § 2, 1996: Ord. 495 § 2, 1993)

 

20.12.030 Hillside conservation area defined.
     For the purpose of this chapter, the following words and phrases shall have the following meanings:

“Hillside conservation area” means that area described on Exhibit “B,” set out at the end of this chapter, and depicted on Exhibit “A,” also set out at the end of this chapter. (Ord. 541 § 3, 1996: Ord. 495 § 3, 1993)

 

20.12.040 Exemptions.
     Legal lots existing as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter that do not have sufficient land area to comply with the density requirements of this chapter are allowed to be developed as a matter of right with one residential dwelling unit, consistent with all other applicable provisions of this chapter and guidelines adopted pursuant thereto. (Ord. 541 § 7, 1996: Ord. 495 § 8, 1993)

 

20.12.050 General plan amendment.
     A.      Amendment of City Official General Plan Land Use Element Map. The city official general plan land use element map is amended to depict the conservation area and to delete the urban slope line, except for that portion in the city’s sphere of influence east of the aforementioned conservation area boundary as said urban slope line was depicted in the 1973 general plan land use map and as shown on Exhibit “A” set out at the end of this chapter.

     B.      Amendment of General Plan Text. The Loma Linda general plan is amended as follows:

     1.      A new goal is hereby added to Chapter 2 of the general plan to read as follows:

 

    It is the goal of the City of Loma Linda to preserve and protect designated sensitive hillside areas in a portion of the south hills area of the City designated as “Hillside Conservation” on the General Plan Land Use Element Map.

 

     2.      Policy 6 of the general plan is amended to read as follows:

 

    6.            The citizens of Loma Linda will have available a choice of areas of varying densities and housing of ranging costs. The General Plan has provided for the following residential gross densities throughout the community:

 

    (a)           Hillside Conservation, one dwelling unit per 10 acres, with a potential bonus up to one dwelling unit per 5 acres when the specified criteria of the Hillside Conservation designation are met.

 

    (b)           Very Low Density, one-tenth to two dwelling units per acre.

 

    (c)           Low density, one to four dwelling units per acre.

 

    (d)           Medium density, five to 10 dwelling units per acre.

 

    (e)           High density, 11 to 20 dwelling units per acre.

 

     3.      Page 10 of Chapter 3, Planning Elements, of the general plan is amended by adding the following as a new third paragraph under the heading “Land Use Element”:

 

    Hillside Conservation - the Hillside Conservation area of the City is comprised of the most significant hilly and sensitive area of the southern portions of the City. Limited development at one unit per 10 acres, and under certain specified criteria development at one unit per 5 acres, is permitted. Greater development intensity would be inconsistent with the overall goals of this General Plan to preserve and protect the natural, scenic, and other amenities of this sensitive area. The limited density is necessary to minimize costs to taxpayers for extensions of services and to minimize the risks of fire, flood, erosion, earthquake, and other hazards which are normally attendant upon higher density development of difficult hillside terrain.

 

     4.      Page 22, Land Use, of the general plan is amended by adding the following directly under “Land Use Category”:

 

    Hillside conservation - gross acres: approximately 1,157.

 

     5.      The circulation element of the general plan is amended by addition of the following immediately above the “Major Highways” category on Page 23:

 

    Those areas designated “Hillside Conservation” should be developed with the minimum number of roads possible, with clustering of development strongly encouraged to minimize the need for access roads. No through roads should be permitted in this area with the exception of Oakwood Drive extended continuously to connect to Scotch Lane and Reche Canyon Road, as shown conceptually on Exhibit “A,” intended primarily to serve areas outside of the Hillside Conservation Area. The purpose of limitations on through roads is to minimize the adverse impacts of through traffic. Those roads which are necessary within the Conservation Area, other than the Oakwood Drive extension, should minimize cut and fill, should avoid disruption of important natural habitat, sensitive areas, and view areas, and should be designed to fit the hilly terrain by following contour lines, using minimum pavement widths, relaxed curve and other standards, and slow speeds.

 

     6.      The conservation element of the general plan (beginning at Page 38) is amended by addition of the following immediately under the first paragraph on Page 38:

 

   Hillside Conservation Area. That area designated “Hillside Conservation” on the Land Use Element Map is an important conservation area for the City. This area is characterized by natural, scenic hillsides, rough terrain, and limited services constituting the highest ridgelines visible from the City proper. Only that development which is consistent with the overall conservation goals for this area is permitted, including residential development at a density not greater than one unit per 10 acres, unless the criteria specified by the Hillside Conservation Land Use Designation are met in which event development at a maximum of up to one unit per 5 acres is permitted. Other consistent uses should be limited to riding, hiking, and other trails, educational, and research activities consistent with conservation of the area. In addition, uses normally accessory to such uses, such as corrals, riding stables, groves, and the like may be allowed where the City determines, based upon environmental review, that such uses are consistent with the overall conservation goals for this area.

 

     7.      Chapter 4, Implementation, of the general plan is amended by addition of the following paragraph immediately after the existing first paragraph:

 

    Implementation in the Hillside Conservation Area. Preservation and conservation in the areas designated “Hillside Conservation” is a high priority for the City. The City shall undertake a work program as a matter of high priority to develop and adopt any necessary ordinances and/or other programs and policies which may be necessary to implement the Hillside Conservation provisions of this General Plan, provided that any such ordinances, policies, or programs are consistent with the terms of this Plan. Such follow up implementation programs may include the following:

 

    (a)           An acquisition and/or land exchange program to place some or all of the Hillside Conservation Area in public ownership;

 

    (b)           Implementation of a planned residential development ordinance applicable to the area to encourage clustering and to help achieve the other goals specified for this area;

 

    (c)           The development of a Hillside Conservation Circulation Plan;

 

    (d)           The development of such other ordinances, policies, and programs as the City shall determine necessary to implement the Hillside Conservation designation; and

 

    (e)           Adoption of a slope density ordinance to specify maximum permitted densities on a sliding scale as determined by slope, provided that in no event shall any lot be less than 2.5 acres in size nor shall the maximum authorized density for any area exceed the densities specified for the Hillside Conservation area.

 

    (f)           Adoption and implementation of a trails and public access plan for the area. Such a plan should be adopted and implemented in consultation with interested organizations and individuals.

 

    In addition, the City shall undertake as a matter of highest priority to amend any and all provisions of the Municipal Code, including but not limited to, the Zoning Ordinance and the Subdivision Ordinance, to ensure that they are consistent with the Hillside Conservation Provisions of the General Plan.

 

     8.      A new heading is added to Chapter 3, Planning Elements, as follows:

 

“Hillside Conservation Area:” One unit per 10 acres, subject to a density bonus of up to one dwelling unit per 5 acres where all of the following criteria are met:

 

    (1)           The project is clustered, provided that in no event shall a lot size less than 2.5 acres be permitted;

 

    (2)           The City determines that, to the maximum extent feasible, all development, including roads, and utility extensions, is kept off of the north facing slopes of the hillsides which comprises the prime view from Downtown Loma Linda;

 

    (3)           The need for extensions of streets and other utilities and services is minimized;

 

    (4)           Significant natural areas, view areas, and habitats are preserved and set aside as permanent open space and/or conservation areas; and

 

    (5)           Provision is made for riding and hiking trails as called for by applicable City Plans.

 

     All that area shown on Exhibit A attached hereto and incorporated herein by this reference is hereby designated on said Land Use Element Map as “Hillside Conservation Area.”

(Ord. 541 § 4, 1996: Ord. 495 § 4, 1993)

 

20.12.060 Implementation.
     The city council and all city agencies, boards, and commissions, are directed to take any and all actions necessary to carry out the provisions of this chapter as a matter of the highest priority to the city. (Ord. 541 § 5, 1996: Ord. 495 § 6, 1993)

 

20.12.070 Guidelines.
     The city council may adopt guidelines to implement this chapter following public notice and public hearing, provided that any such guidelines shall be consistent with this chapter. Any such guidelines must be adopted by four-fifths affirmative vote of the total authorized membership of the city council and may be amended at any time by four-fifths vote of the city council. (Ord. 541 § 6, 1996: Ord. 495 § 7, 1993)

TO OWN, OPERATE AND MAINTAIN A CABLE TELEVISION SYSTEM IN LOMA LINDA, CALIFORNIA AND SETTING FORTH TERMS, PROVISIONS AND CONDITIONS ACCOMPANYING THE GRANT OF FRANCHISE, AND PROVIDING FOR THE REGULATION AND USE OF SAID SYSTEM.

 

     WHEREAS, COMCAST CABLEVISION OF SAN BERNARDINO, INC., a Delaware Corporation (“Operator”) is the successor in interest to that certain franchise (“Prior Franchise”) issued on or about October 28, 1980 to TelePrompTer Corporation by the CITY OF LOMA LINDA, a municipal corporation, (“City”); and WHEREAS, the Prior Franchise expired on or about October 27, 1995; and

     WHEREAS, the City and Operator elected not to invoke the provisions of subsections (a) through (g) of 47 USC 546 and instead, pursuant to an alternative procedure pursuant to 47 USC 546(h), derived this ordinance (“Ordinance”) through negotiations, which began in December, 1994, to effect a renewal of the Prior Franchise upon certain terms, provisions and conditions; and

     WHEREAS, during the course of the negotiations to derive this Ordinance, the Prior Franchise expired and the Operator continued to occupy the public rights-of-way of the City under the terms of the prior franchise during the period of continued negotiations; and

     WHEREAS, the City is now convinced that this Ordinance, as it has heretofore resulted from such negotiations, reflects a workable revision and renewal of the Prior Franchise which is consistent with the public interest; and

     WHEREAS, the City and Operator desire to have the franchise established by the Ordinance (“Franchise”) constitute a contract between Operator as franchisee and the City as franchisor (the City and Operator in said capacities hereinafter “the Parties”); and

     WHEREAS, the Parties have negotiated the terms, provisions and conditions of this Franchise with the anticipation that, during the term of this Franchise, Operator could well be subject to a much higher level of competition than may have heretofore existed from, inter alia, telephone companies and direct broadcast satellite service providers, and that some or all of the competitors may deliver their services without, inter alia, the payment of fees to any level of government comparable to the level of Franchise Fee required by this Franchise even though some or all of such competitive providers may utilize public rights of way under other authorizations than those provided by City to a degree substantially similar to the utilization authorized hereby; and

     WHEREAS, Operator, in recognition of the potential competitive advantages which will accrue to it by reason of the benefits accorded by this Franchise, including without limitation the advantages of potentially solidifying its position as first provider of such services, nonetheless desires to be bound to the terms, provisions and conditions of this Franchise including, inter alia, to the payment of the Franchise Fee as specified herein to the fullest extent allowed by law, provided only that the City use its best efforts to impose similar or equivalent terms, provisions and conditions to those set forth herein when it is within City’s lawful power so to do; and

     WHEREAS, the City has following reasonable notice conducted a public hearing, affording all persons reasonable opportunity to be heard, which proceeding was for the purpose of considering authorizing a franchise for a community antenna television system, establishing rules and regulations regarding such services and consideration of the technical ability, financial condition, legal qualification and general character of Operator; and

     WHEREAS, the City after such consideration and deliberation, has found and determined sufficient the technical ability, financial condition, legal qualification, and character of Operator; and

     WHEREAS, the City has at the said public hearing, also considered the plans of Operator for the construction and operation of the Cable System (“System” or “Cable System”) as defined herein and found and determined the same to be adequate and feasible in view of the needs and requirements of the area to be served by the System;

     WHEREAS, City has determined that it is in the best interest of and consistent with the convenience and necessity of the City to grant this Franchise to Operator to operate the System within the boundaries of the City and on the terms, provisions and conditions hereinafter set forth;

     b.      The City hereby grants to Operator the right and privilege to construct, erect, operate and maintain, in, upon, along, across, above, over and under the Streets as they now and hereafter shall exist in the City such poles, wires, cables, underground conduits, manholes, and other cable conductors and fixtures as are necessary for the maintenance and operation in the City of a cable communications system, to be used for the sale and distribution of Cable Service to the residents of the City.

     b.      With respect to requests for connection requiring a drop line (measured from the outer edge of the nearest Street to a point twelve (12) inches outside the point of connection to the Dwelling Unit) in excess of one hundred and fifty (150) feet, the Operator must extend and make available Cable Service to the residents of such Dwelling Unit at a connection charge not to exceed the actual installation costs incurred by the Operator for this distance exceeding one hundred and fifty (150) feet. In the event that the Operator elects to impose any additional charge whatever for the distance of drop beyond one hundred and fifty (150) feet, it shall explicitly demonstrate that such portions of such drops have been excluded from any capitalization of drop costs for rate regulatory purposes.

     c.

In all other areas, Operator shall make good faith efforts to provide service concurrently with the installation of other utilities where reasonably feasible. For purposes of this section, Dwelling Units shall be counted on the basis of the parcels on the final subdivision map approved by the City, adjusted for the maximum permissible number of Dwelling Units upon such parcels under applicable zoning regulations.

 

Section 6. Construction And Technical Standards
     a.      Operator shall construct, install, operate and maintain its Cable System in a manner consistent with all laws, ordinances, construction standards, governmental requirements, FCC technical standards, and detailed standards submitted by Operator as part of its application, which standards are incorporated by reference herein.

Section 7. Transfers and Assignments
     a.      Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, no part of element of a Cable System or any other real or personal property which is a part of said Cable System shall be sold, transferred, assigned, mortgaged, pledged, leased, sublet or otherwise encumbered for any purpose whatsoever, nor shall title thereto, either legal or equitable or any right, interest or property therein, pass to or vest in any person without the prior written consent of the City except, however, the Franchise may be transferred without said consent to a wholly-owned subsidiary of Operator provided that the Operator shall remain jointly and severally responsible for its obligations hereunder. The proposed assignee must show financial responsibility as reasonably determined by the City and must agree to comply with all provisions of the franchise. City shall be deemed to have consented to a proposed transfer or assignment in the event its refusal to consent is not communicated in writing to Operator within sixty (60) days following receipt of written notice of the proposed transfer or assignment or unless said sixty (60) day period is tolled by the City by written notice to Operator in order to obtain additional information reasonably necessary to its consideration of the proposed transfer.

     b.      The Operator shall promptly notify the City of any actual or proposed change in, or transfer of, or acquisition by any other party of, control of the Operator. The word “control” as used herein is not limited to major stockholders but includes actual working control in whatever manner exercised. Every change, transfer, or acquisition of control of the Operator requiring the consent of the City shall make the Franchise subject to cancellation unless and until the City shall have theretofore consented thereto, which consent will not be unreasonably withheld. For the purpose of determining whether it shall consent to such change, transfer, or acquisition of control, the City may inquire into the qualifications of the prospective controlling party, and the Operator shall be obligated to respond to any reasonable questions put to it by the City in any such inquiry regarding such qualifications.

     c.       The consent or approval of the City to any transfer of the Franchise shall not constitute a waiver or release of the rights of the City in and to the Streets, and any transfer shall by its terms, be expressly subordinate to the terms, provisions and conditions of this Franchise and such additional terms, provisions and conditions as the Parties may mutually agree.

     d.      In no event shall a transfer of ownership or control be approved without the successor in interest becoming a signatory and obligor to this Franchise.

 

Section 8. Subscriber Service Rates
     In the event that the City is permitted, under California and/or federal law, at any time during the Franchise term, to regulate cable television subscriber service rates, and, if the City elects to assume rate regulation jurisdiction, the City shall comply with applicable law and regulations of the FCC.

 

Section 9. Payment Of Franchise Fee
     a.      For the reason that the Streets to be used by the Operator in the operation of its system within the boundaries of the City are valuable public properties acquired and maintained by the City at great expense to its taxpayers, and that the permission to the Operator to use the said Streets is a valuable property right without which the Operator would be required to invest substantial capital in right-of-way costs and acquisitions, and because the City will incur cost in regulating and administering the Franchise, and at the option of the City Council, the City may make available a portion of the Franchise Fee to further the development of public and community uses of cable television, the Operator shall, subject to applicable law, pay to the City an amount equal to five percent (5%) of Operator’s applicable annual Gross Revenues. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that any current legal limitation upon the amount of Franchise Fees is increased or decreased, then the Franchise Fee specified herein shall be increased or decreased accordingly such that, at all times during the term hereof, the City shall receive the maximum Franchise Fee allowed by law.

     b.      To the extent permitted by State and Federal law, Gross Revenues shall include any revenue received by the Operator from the delivery of Other Communications Services over its Cable System, including without limitation, telephone, data transmission, interactive services and other broadband information services. Operator agrees to pay the City a Franchise fee on the gross revenues associated with such other telecommunications services at the maximum rate permitted by State and Federal law. The fee shall be payable quarterly at the same time the regular Cable Television franchise payment is due.

     c.       The Franchise Fee shall be payable quarterly and any other cost or penalties assessed by the City pursuant hereto shall be payable quarterly for each cost or penalty assessed during the term of this Franchise to the office of City Manager. The foregoing payments shall be made within sixty (60) days after the expiration of each period. The Operator shall file a complete and accurate audited statement of all applicable Gross Revenues during the preceding fiscal year not later than ninety (90) days after the expiration of the Operator’s fiscal year. Such audited statement shall contain an unconditional opinion of an independent certified public accountant in accordance with generally accepted auditing standards.

     d.      The City shall have the right to inspect the Operator’s income records and the right to audit and to recompute any amounts determined to be payable under this Ordinance; provided however, that such audit shall take place within thirty-six (36) months following the close of each of the Operator’ fiscal years. The City shall give written notice to the Operator of any additional amount due within six (6) months after completion of the audit. Any additional amount due to the City as a result of the audit shall be paid within thirty (30) days following written notice to the Operator by the City which notice shall include a copy of the audit report, provided however, that Operator shall have the right to present such additional evidence as it may have to the City to contest such audit findings within thirty (30) days thereafter.

     In the event the additional evidence is insufficient to eliminate or acceptably reduce any amounts determined by the audit to be due and which remain in dispute, the City and Operator, by mutual agreement (both as to whether to hire and whom to hire) may, by mutual agreement, employ the services of technical, financial, or legal consultants as mediators, the costs of which shall be borne equally by the City and the Operator. With regard to the City’s right to audit and recompute any amounts determined to be payable under this Franchise Agreement, the City will bear the cost of any such audit; provided, however, that if such audit indicates a Franchise Fee underpayment of ten percent (10%) or more of the amount due, Operator shall assume all reasonable costs of such audit and pay such costs at such time as any proceedings contesting the City’s audit are completed. Any additional amount due the City as a result of the audit or a final mediation determination shall be paid within thirty (30) days following presentation of the City’s audit report or completion of a mediation proceeding in favor of the City.

 

Section 10. Required Services And Facilities
     a.      The Cable system presently has, and shall at all times maintain, a capacity of sixty (60) channels available for immediate use. By December 31, 2000, the Cable system shall have a city-wide available channel capacity of one hundred (100) channels which corresponds to an upper operating frequency of Seven Hundred Fifty Megahertz (750 MHZ).

     b.      The Cable System authorized pursuant to the provisions of this Ordinance shall provide not less than the following for non-commercial public, educational and governmental access (“PEG Access Programming”) pursuant to the provisions of 47 USC 531 to Subscribers in the City:

     1)      three (3) downstream video PEG Access Programming channels to be programmed by the City or an agent named by the City, provided the Operator may program said channels at times not utilized by the City.

     c)      A third site as designated by the City

     The Operator will provide up to two (2) additional cable channels at the City’s request for PEG Access Programming use. However, the City may not submit such a request for additional PEG channels unless all three (3) of the PEG channels already being utilized each are cablecasting at least seventy-five percent (75%) of the prime hours daily between 9:00 a.m. and 9:00 p.m. with unduplicated video programming, not including programming provided by a character generator.

     c.       The Operator shall make available the equipment specified in Exhibit B attached hereto for use in the local production and presentation of PEG Access Programming. At such time that the equipment listed in Exhibit B is installed and operational, it shall become the property of the City and repair and maintenance shall become the City’s responsibility, provided that Operator shall provide reasonable training and basic trouble-shooting assistance.

     d.      The Operator shall incorporate into its Cable system such capacity as is necessary to permit the City in times of emergency, to override by remote control, the audio of all channels simultaneously. The Operator shall designate a channel which will be used for emergency broadcasts of both audio and video. The Operator shall cooperate with the City in the use and operation of the emergency alert override system.

     e.       The Operator may be required to interconnect its System with other broadband communication facilities. Such interconnection, if agreed to by the City and the Operator, shall be made within the time limit established by the City. The interconnect shall, at the City’s discretion, be accomplished according to the method and technical standards determined by the City and generally accepted industry practices. “Broadband communication facility”, as used herein, means any network of cable, optical, electrical or electronic equipment, including Cable Systems, used for the purpose of transmitting telecommunications signals.

     f.       At all times during the term of this Franchise, the Operator shall provide one (1) free “Subscriber drop” connection and one (1) free outlet of Basic Service Tier service (as that term is defined by the FCC) to each school, whether public or private (from kindergarten through 12th grade), within the boundaries of the City which has an average daily enrollment of one hundred (100) or more students (“Schools”). As to new schools coming into existence in the Franchise Area after the date hereof, the Operator’s obligation to provide such service shall arise ninety (90) days after notification by the City to the Operator of the existence of the school. At such a time as any part of the System is capable of providing high speed data delivery via Cable Modem and makes same commercially available to subscribers or Users within the City, free installation and free service of one (1) Cable Modem shall be provided to each school and library.

 

Section 11. Use Of Streets
     a.      Operator is hereby authorized to place wire, conduits, and appurtenances for the Cable System along or across public streets, highways, alleys, public properties, or public easements of the City in such manner and places as shall be authorized by the City by prior permit.

     c.       In case of disturbance of any street or paved area the Operator shall, at its own cost and expense and in a manner approved by the City by prior permit, immediately replace and restore such street or paved area in as good a condition as immediately before the work involving such disturbance was done.

     d.      If at any time during the period of the Franchise the City shall lawfully elect to alter or change the grade of any street, the Operator, upon reasonable notice by the City, shall remove, relay, replace, and relocate its poles, wires, cables, underground conduits, manholes, and other appurtenances at its own expense.

     e.       Any poles or other fixtures placed in or adjacent to any street by the Operator shall be placed in such manner as to comply with all requirements of the City.

     f.       The Operator shall, at the request of any person holding a moving permit issued by the City, temporarily raise or lower its wires to permit the moving of buildings.

     h.      In all sections of the City where the cables, wires, or other like facilities of public utilities are required to be placed underground as of the time at which Operator is building or substantially rebuilding that portion of its plan, the Operator shall place its cables, wires or other like facilities underground pursuant to Section 6 above.

     At the expiration of the term for which the Franchise is granted, or upon its termination and cancellation, as provided for herein, the City shall have the right to require the Operator to remove, at its own expense, all portions of the Cable System from all Streets within the City.

 

Section 12. Indemnification And Insurance
     a.      It shall be expressly understood and agreed by and between the City and any Operator hereunder that the Operator shall indemnify, defend and save the City and its officers, agents and employees free and harmless from and against all claims, damages, losses, and expenses, including reasonable attorney’s fees sustained by the City on account of any suit, judgment, execution, claim or demand whatsoever arising out of Operator’s actions or omissions in the installation, operation or maintenance of the Cable System authorized herein, including but not limited to copyright infringements and/or any and all other damages, whether or not any act or omission complained of is authorized, allowed or prohibited by this Ordinance and this Franchise, provided that the Operator shall not be required to indemnify City for damages which have theretofore been finally determined by a court of competent jurisdiction to have occurred solely and completely by reason of the negligence of City and entirely separate and apart from any action or conduct whatsoever by Operator and/or any third party.

     b.      Operator shall at all times carry on all operations hereunder, Worker’s Compensation Insurance covering all of its employees, Public Liability and Property Damage Insurance, and Automotive Public Liability and Property Damage Insurance, including liability coverage for (a. all operations; b. subcontract work; c. contractual obligations; d. completed operations; e. all owned vehicles; f. non-owned vehicles) in an amount which shall not be less than two million dollars ($2 million) single liability coverage underwritten by admitted California insurance companies satisfactory to the City. The City shall be named as an additional insured under all such policies.

     c.       The insurance policy obtained by the Operator in compliance with this section must be approved by the City Attorney and such insurance policy, along with written evidence of payment of required premiums, shall be filed and maintained with the City Clerk during the term of the Franchise, and the limits thereof may be increased from time to time at the request of the City to reflect changing liability exposure. The Operator shall immediately advise City Attorney of any litigation that may develop that would affect this insurance.

     d.      Neither the provisions of this section nor any damages recovered by the City thereunder, shall be construed to or limit the liability of the Operator under any Franchise issued hereunder or for damages.

     e.       All insurance policies maintained pursuant to this Franchise shall contain the following endorsement (or an equivalent provision approved by the Insurance Service Office):

“It is hereby understood and agreed that this insurance policy may not be canceled by the surety nor the intention not to renew be stated by the insurer until thirty (30) days after receipt by the City, by certified mail, of written notice or such intention to cancel or not to renew.”

 

Section 13. Deposit Or Letter Of Credit
     a.      Within ten (10) days after the acceptance of this Franchise, the Operator shall deposit with the City a cash deposit, or in the discretion of the Operator an irrevocable letter of credit from a financial institution authorized to issue such instruments, in the amount of not less than Fifty Thousand ($50,000) Dollars, provided that during the pendency of any rebuild of the Cable System, said sum shall be increased to One Hundred Thousand ($100,000) Dollars or such other reasonable amount as may be established by the City. The form and content of such irrevocable letter of credit shall be approved by the City Attorney. The irrevocable letter of credit shall be used to insure the faithful performance by the Operator of all provisions of this Franchise; and compliance with all orders, permits and directions of any agency, commission, board, department, division or office of the City having jurisdiction over its acts or defaults under this Franchise, and/or the payment by the Operator of any claims, liens and taxes due the City which arise by reason of the construction, operation or maintenance of the System.

     b.      The irrevocable letter of credit, if such is utilized by the Operator, shall be maintained in full force and effect at all times during the entire term of this Franchise. If amounts are withdrawn from the cash deposit by the City pursuant to the terms, provisions and conditions of this Franchise, or if the irrevocable letter of credit is presented for payment by the City, the Operator shall promptly deposit an amount with the City sufficient to raise the total case deposit in possession of the City to the applicable total sum set forth in subsection (a) of this Section. Any sum on deposit with the City shall earn interest for the Operator at the same rate earned by the City on its own general demand funds.

     c.       If the Operator fails to pay to the City any compensation within the time fixed herein; or, fails, after ten (10) days’ notice to pay to the City any taxes due and unpaid; or fails to repay the City within ten (10) days, any damages, costs or expenses which the City is compelled to pay by reason of any act or default of the Operator in connection with this Franchise; or, fails, after thirty (30) days’ written notice by the City to comply with any provision of this Franchise which the City reasonably determines can be remedied by demand and presentation of the irrevocable letter of credit, the City may immediately present the irrevocable letter of credit and demand payment of the amount thereof, with interest at the applicable legal rate and any penalties. Upon such presentation and demand for payment, the City shall notify the Operator of the amount and date thereof.

     d.      The rights reserved to the City with respect to the cash deposit and/or irrevocable letter of credit are in addition to all other rights of the City, whether reserved by this Franchise or authorized by law, and no action, proceeding or exercise of a right with respect to such cash deposit and/or irrevocable letter of credit shall affect or limit any other right the City may have.

     e.       The irrevocable letter of credit shall contain the following endorsement:

 

    “It is hereby understood and agreed that this letter of credit may not be canceled by the issuer nor the intention not to renew be stated by the issuer until sixty (60) days after receipt by the City, by certified mail, of written notice from the issuer of such intention to cancel or not to renew.”

 

     f.       In the event the irrevocable letter of credit is canceled or not renewed, it shall be replaced forthwith with a new letter of credit as approved by the City Attorney or with a cash deposit as set forth hereinabove.

 

Section 14. Service Standards
     a.      The Operator shall put, keep, and maintain all parts of the System in good condition throughout the entire Franchise period. Unless the Subscriber shall have agreed in writing in advance of installation to allow the Operator to retain ownership of Cable Wiring as defined herein, Cable Wiring shall be and remain the Subscriber’s property under the law of fixtures in the State of California. Unless the Subscriber shall have agreed in writing in advance of installation to allow the Operator to retain ownership of Cable Wiring as defined herein, the Operator shall not have the right to remove said wiring or to demand payment for such wiring upon termination of service.

     b.      If the Subscriber shall have agreed in writing in advance of installation to allow the Operator to retain ownership of Cable Wiring, upon termination of service the Operator must give the customer the option of purchasing the Cable Wiring.

     (1)     Prior to removing the Cable Wiring, the Operator shall first give the Subscriber the option of purchasing the Cable Wiring at the per foot replacement cost of the wiring installed in the premises, without labor charges or other costs or overheads.

     (2)     Should the Subscriber elect not to purchase the Cable Wiring, the Operator may (i) remove within ten (10) days and at times reasonably convenient to the Subscriber all Cable Wiring installed by the Operator or its contractor in connection with the original installation, including without limitation all wires extending onto private property from the public right-of-way (commonly known as service drops), and the Operator shall repair all damage caused by such removal, or (ii) leave all Cable Wiring in place and undisturbed, provided that the Operator shall have the right to disable the service drops at the joinder of the public right-of-way (and at no other place) in order forestall diversion of service.

     c.       The City may hereafter from time to time enact, and the Operator shall comply with, Customer Service Regulations not otherwise pre-empted by state or federal law. [The City acknowledges that, under current rate regulatory rules of the Federal Communications Commission all costs incurred by the Operator to comply with Customer Service Regulations which are in excess of federal and/or state customer service standards may be separately cumulated and treated as a “pass-through” in accordance with presently applicable federal law.

     d.      In the event that the Operator should assert its ownership of Cable Wiring upon the premises of Subscribers and/or former Subscribers, the Operator shall thereupon and annually thereafter report in writing to the County Assessor, with written confirmation of said report to the City, the addresses and Assessor’s Parcel Numbers of all locations within the City as to which the Operator purports to retain ownership of the Cable Wiring upon such premises.

 

Section 15. Continuity Of Service Mandatory
     a.      It shall be the right of all Subscribers to receive service insofar as their financial and other obligations to the Operator are honored. In the event that the Operator elects to overbuild, rebuild, modify, or sell the System, or the City gives notice of intent to terminate or fails to renew this Franchise, the Operator shall act as to ensure that all Subscribers receive continuous, uninterrupted service regardless of the circumstances subject to force majeure and performance of the Subscriber’s financial and other obligations to the Operator.

     In the event of a change of Franchisee, or in the event a new operator acquires the system, the Operator shall cooperate with the City, and the new franchisee or operator in maintaining continuity of service to all Subscribers. During such period, the Operator shall be entitled to the revenues for any period during which it operates the System.

     b.      In the event Operator fails to operate the System for ninety-six (96) consecutive hours without prior approval of the City and in the absence of circumstances falling within the provisions of Section 19b below, the City may, at its option, operate the System or designate an operator until such time as Operator restores service. If the City is required to fulfill this obligation for the Operator, the Operator shall reimburse the City for all reasonable costs or damages in excess of revenues from the System received by the City that are the result of the Operator’s failure to perform.

     The Operator shall not allow its cable or other operations to interfere with television reception of persons not served by the Operator, nor shall the System interfere with, obstruct or hinder in any manner, the operation of the various utilities serving the residents of the City.

 

Section 16. Books And Records
     Operator shall maintain its books and records in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, consistently applied, and in conformance with applicable FCC rules. The audited statement of applicable Gross Revenues set forth in Section 9c shall include certification by the Operator’s independent Certified Public Accountant that franchise fees paid to the City for the subject calendar year are in accordance with the provisions of this franchise. In the event that such independent Certified Public Accountant is unable to render such certification, or the City’s auditor is unable to substantiate the certification due to the nature of the Operator’s records or accounting system, Operator shall make adjustments as are required to carry out respective certification/ confirmation responsibilities.

     Operator shall fully cooperate in making available at reasonable times, and the City Manager and/or his/her designee shall have the right to inspect on not less than three (3) business days notice, the books, records, maps, plans and other like materials of the Operator necessary for the City to carry out its regulatory responsibilities at any time during normal business hours; provided that where volume and convenience necessitate, the Operator may require inspection to take place on the Operator’s premises.

 

Section 17. Other Petitions And Applications
     Upon request, copies of any petitions, applications, communications and reports submitted by the Operator to the Federal Communications Commission, Securities and Exchange Commission, or any other federal or state regulatory commission or agency having jurisdiction in respect to any matters affecting the Cable System authorized pursuant to the terms, provisions and conditions of this Franchise in the City and not otherwise available without charge to the City upon the Internet, shall be provided without charge to the City. Operator shall in good faith provide City with prompt written notice of the nature and substance of any such actions which have the potential to significantly affect the City’s interest under this Franchise or the operation thereof by Operator.

 

Section 18. Fiscal Reports
     In addition to the certified Statement of Gross Receipts and payment of applicable franchise fees set forth in Section 9c and Section 16, there shall be submitted along with such report, such other reasonable information as the City Manager shall request with respect to the Operator’s properties and expenses related to its Cable System operations within the City which are necessary, in the reasonable judgment of City, for the City to carry out its regulatory responsibilities.

 

Section 19. Forfeiture And Termination
     a.      In addition to all of the rights and powers retained by the City under this Franchise or otherwise, the City reserves the right, subject to the provisions of this Section 19, to forfeit and terminate the Franchise and all rights and privileges of the Operator hereunder in the event of a substantial breach, beyond any applicable cure period otherwise made expressly applicable by law, of its terms and conditions. A substantial breach by Operator shall include, but shall not be limited to the following:

     (1)     Violation by the Operator of any material provision of the Franchise or any material rule, order, regulation or determination of the City made pursuant to the Franchise including without limitation the Customer Service Regulations of the City;

     (2)     Attempt by the Operator to dispose of any of the facilities or property of its Cable System to prevent the City from purchasing it, as provided for herein;

     (3)     Evasion by the Operator of any material provision of the Franchise or practice by the Operator of any fraud or deceit upon the City or its Subscribers;

     (4)     Failure by the Operator to begin or complete System construction or System extension as provided under the Franchise;

     (5)     Failure by the Operator to provide the types of services promised herein;

     (6)     Failure by the Operator to restore service after ninety-six (96) consecutive hours of interrupted service, except when approval of such interruption is obtained from the City; or

     (7)     Material misrepresentation of fact by the Operator in the application for or negotiation of the Franchise; or

     (8)     The appointment of a receiver to take possession of all, or substantially all, of the assets of Operator; or

     (9)     A general assignment by Operator for the benefit of creditors; or

     (10)  An action taken or suffered by Operator under any insolvency or bankruptcy act; or

     (11)  The Operator’s vacation or abandonment of the Cable System within the City or dispossession by process of law; or

     (12)  The cessation of the operation of the Cable System within the City for a consecutive period of ninety-six (96) consecutive hours without prior approval of the City or without just cause, which shall be presumed to be an abandonment and vacation of the System.

     This paragraph shall not be construed to limit any other provisions of this Franchise.

     b.      Except as hereinafter provided, violation by the Operator of any of the terms, provisions and conditions of this Franchise caused by circumstances beyond the control of the Operator shall constitute good and sufficient excuse and justification for such violations precluding the Operator from being in breach of said terms, provisions and conditions. The following are examples of acts or omissions by an Operator or circumstances which shall be deemed not to be beyond the control of the Operator and which shall not constitute excuses or justifications for violations:

     (1)     The failure at any time by an Operator or its officers, agents or employees to exercise diligence in planning, organizing, arranging for or prosecuting the work of construction and installation, or in taking any other action necessary to permit or facilitate the work of construction and installation;

     (2)     Unanticipated cost increases or insufficiency of capital with which to take actions necessary to comply or facilitate compliance with any of the terms, provisions and conditions of this Franchise;

     (3)     Considerations relating to economy or cost efficiency, as respects acts or omissions by the Operator;

     (4)     Delays occasioned by the failure of the Operator to diligently apply for and prosecute any request for a required certificate, approval or consent from the FCC;

     (5)     Delays occasioned by seasonal changes in weather or climatic conditions, such as rain (exclusive of catastrophic conditions in the nature of “Acts of God”). (Rain delay shall not constitute an excuse or justification for violation except with respect to measurable precipitation occurring on more than fifty-nine (59) days during any period commencing July 1 and ending the next following June 30; and only if such is the proximate cause of the violation.);

     (6)     Delays occasioned by the customary and usual time required to obtain approval to attach lines to poles owned by private or public utilities or in the attaching of cable to the poles; provided that if an Operator submits all plans and documentation required by private or public utility in connection with the approval to attach lines to poles, any time consumed by such approval process which is longer than ninety (90) calendar days following the submission of all necessary plans and documentation shall be deemed to excuse the Operator from any violations which are proximately caused by such delay in excess of ninety (90) calendar days.

     (7)     Delay occasioned by the customary and usual time required to process and secure approvals under zoning ordinances of the City for the location of components of the Cable System and other installations associated therewith, given the nature of the approval required and magnitude of the project; provided that if an Operator submits specific sites and plans for all headends, towers and transmitters to the City and requests the City to perform a single environmental analysis upon all such facilities as the lead agency, any time consumed by such environmental analysis which is longer than sixty (60) calendar days during a period subsequent to the filing of the certificate of acceptance of the Franchise shall be deemed to excuse the Operator from any violations which are proximately caused by such delay in excess of sixty (60) calendar days.

     The Operator shall not be excused from any violation of the terms, provisions and conditions of this Franchise, except for causes which are beyond the control of the Operator and except with respect to violations which have not been contributed to or aggravated by acts or omissions by the Operator.

     Except as otherwise provided above, violations caused exclusively by acts or omissions by the City or its officers, agents or employees shall constitute an excuse and justification for failure of an Operator to comply with the terms, provisions and conditions of this Franchise, precluding a determination that the Operator is in breach. However, violations as a result of such exclusive causes shall not be deemed to excuse the Operator from other unrelated violations, shield the Operator from a determination that it is in breach for such other unrelated violations, or bar any relief for damages or otherwise as a result of such other unrelated breach.

     Examples of circumstances beyond the control of an Operator which will excuse an Operator from violation and being in breach of the terms, provisions and conditions of this Franchise, when such violations are caused thereby, include the following: strikes; acts of public enemies; orders by military authority; insurrections; riots; epidemics; landslides; lightning; earthquakes; fires; floods; civil disturbances; explosions; partial or entire failure or utilities or unforeseeable lack of access to utility facilities; and Acts of God, being defined for this purpose as an act occasioned by the direct, immediate, and exclusive operation of the forces of nature, uncontrolled and uninfluenced by the power of man, and without human intervention, and is of such a character that it could not have been prevented or escaped by any amount of foresight or prudence, or by any reasonable degree of care or diligence, or by the aid of any appliances which the situation of the party might reasonably require him to use.

     c.       The City shall make a written demand that the Operator comply with any such provision, rule, order, or determination under or pursuant to this Franchise. If the violation by the Operator continues for a period of thirty (30) days following such written demand without written proof that the corrective action has been taken or is being diligently and expeditiously pursued the City may place the issue of termination of the Franchise before the City Council. The City shall cause to be served upon Operator, at least twenty (20) days prior to the date of such a City Council meeting, a written notice of intent to request such termination and the time and place of the meeting. Public notice shall be given of the meeting and issue which the City Council is to consider.

     d.      The City Council shall hear and consider the issue and shall hear any person interested therein, and shall determine in its discretion, whether or not any violation by the Operator has occurred.

     e.       If the City Council shall determine the violation by the Operator was the fault of Operator and within its control, the City Council may, by resolution, declare that the Franchise of the Operator shall be forfeited and terminated, or it may make termination conditional subject to compliance within such period as the City Council may fix, such period not be less than sixty (60) days.

     f.       The issue of forfeiture and termination shall automatically be placed upon the City Council agenda at the expiration of the time set by it for compliance. The City Council then may terminate the Franchise forthwith upon finding that the Operator has failed to achieve compliance or may further extend the period, in its discretion.

 

Section 20. Liquidated Damages
     At the time of issuance of this Franchise, it is impractical to reasonably ascertain the total extent of damages which may be incurred as a result of the breach by the Operator of its obligations under the Franchise. Accordingly, the provisions of this section, shall apply in the event of breach as liquidated damages therefor. Factors relating to the impracticability of ascertaining damages include, but are not limited to, the following:

     a.      The fact that: (i) the primary damage resulting from breaches by the Operator of the schedules for construction and extension of the Cable System and provision of services and of the duties prescribed by the terms, provisions and conditions of this Franchise will be to members of the public who are denied services or denied quality or reliable services; (ii) such breaches cause inconvenience, anxiety, frustration and deprivation of the benefits of the Franchise to individual members of the general public in subjective ways and in varying degrees of intensity which are incapable of measurement in precise monetary terms; (iii) that services might be available through the Cable System which are both necessary and available at a substantially lower cost than alternative services, and the monetary loss resulting from denial of services or denial of quality or reliable services is impossible to calculate in precise monetary terms; and (iv) termination of a franchise for such breaches and other remedies are, at best, a means of future correction, and not remedies which make the public whole for past breaches;

     b.      The fact that the failure of the Operator to make timely reports identifying its progress in installing its Cable System will make it difficult in ways which are not measurable for the City to administer the construction schedule, delay initiation of enforcement proceedings, and impede compliance with the period allowed for construction; and

     c.       The fact that the failure of an Operator to file timely annual reports will deny information necessary to enable the City to expeditiously, effectively and efficiently, administer the Franchise and exercise its regulatory powers in relation thereto for the promotion and protection of the public convenience, health, safety and welfare.

     Without the provisions relating to the imposition of liquidated damages below, the actual damages for which an Operator would be liable could greatly exceed the specified amount of liquidated damages. Therefore, these provisions are of great benefit to the Operator.

     In its sole discretion, the City Council may assess the Operator and the Operator shall be liable for liquidated damages in the amount of up to one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each calendar day on which Operator is in breach and for each breach of any of the terms, provisions and conditions of this Franchise or such other provisions of any subsequent rule, order, regulation or determination of the City made pursuant to the Franchise as shall expressly refer to this provision. Said liquidated damage sum shall be separately applicable to each calendar day of delay in complying with any of the terms, provisions and conditions of this Franchise. Said liquidated damage amount shall be separately applicable to each instance for each calendar day of delay in extending lines to additional Dwelling Units; provided that if more than one Dwelling Unit is subject to a particular extension, the total liquidated damages shall not exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000) for each calendar day of delay. Nothing in the foregoing shall be deemed to preclude the City from imposing such lesser sum of liquidated damages as in its sole and exclusive discretion it shall deem fair and just.

     The foregoing liquidated damages shall not be deemed to be the exclusive remedy for the types of breaches above. Neither the right to assess liquidated damages nor the assessment of liquidated damages shall be deemed to bar or otherwise limit the right of the City to obtain judicial enforcement of the Operator’s obligations by means of specific performance, injunctive relief, mandate or other remedies at law or in equity other than monetary damages.

 

Section 21. Rights Of Individuals
     a.      The Operator, and its officers, agents, employees, contractors and subcontractors, shall respect, refrain from invading, and take affirmative action to prevent violation of the privacy of subscribers served by the Cable System and others.

     (1)     Neither the Operator nor any other person, agency, or entity shall tap, or arrange for the tapping or monitoring of any cable, line, signal input device, or subscriber outlet or receiver for any purpose whatsoever except that the Operator may conduct tests of the functioning of the System where necessary in order to ensure proper maintenance of the System and to collect performance data for agencies regulating the quality of signals, and the Operator may conduct System wide or individually addressed “sweeps” for the sole purpose of verifying system integrity (including individual security system integrity, controlling return path transmissions, billing for pay services, or collecting aggregate data on viewing patterns by channel. “Tapping” shall mean observing a communications signal exchange where the observer is neither of the communicating parties, whether the exchange is observed by visual, aural or electronic means, for any purpose whatsoever. The provision of Interactive Services shall not be construed to be “tapping” or “monitoring” under this Subparagraph.

     (2)     The Operator shall not place in any private residence or in any institution any equipment capable of two-way communications without the written consent of the Subscriber, and shall not utilize the two-way communications capability of the System for Subscriber surveillance of any kind without the written consent of the Subscriber specifying how the data collected will be used and by whom. Tenants who occupy premises connected by the System shall be deemed to be Subscribers within the meaning of this Subparagraph regardless of who actually pays for the service. The written consents shall be, and shall show on their face that they are, revocable by the Subscriber at any time by written communication mailed by the Subscriber to the Operator. No penalty shall be invoked for a Subscriber’s failure to provide a written consent or for his or her revocation thereof, and all written consents shall so state on their face. The Operator shall not make such written consent a condition precedent to receipt by a Subscriber of non-interactive service. The provisions of this subparagraph shall not be deemed to require consent as a condition precedent to System-wide or individually addressed “sweeps” for the sole purpose of verifying System integrity, controlling aggregate data on viewing patterns by channel.

     (3)     No cable, line, wire, amplifier, converter, or other piece of equipment associated with Cable System services shall be attached to any residence or other property of a citizen (except within Streets) without first securing the written permission of the owner or tenant of the property. If such permission is later lawfully revoked, whether by the original or subsequent owner or tenant, the Operator shall remove forthwith all of the equipment and promptly restore the property to its original condition. The Operator shall perform all installations in a workmanlike manner and shall be responsible for any damage to residences or other property caused by the installation.

     (4)     No Operator or officer, agent or employee thereof shall sell, or otherwise make available, lists of the names and addresses of its Subscribers, or any list which identifies, by name or otherwise individual subscriber viewing habits, to any person, agency, or entity for any purpose whatsoever except that the Operator shall, upon request, provide lists of names and addresses of its subscribers to authorized representatives of the City, to the extent permissible by law, when the City deems such information necessary for performance of the regulatory functions of the Commission. Names and address of Subscribers within the possession of the City shall not be subject to public inspection or review.

     (5)     The Operator may release the number of Subscribers but only as a total number and as a percentage of the potential Subscribers within the Franchise Area. When indicating the number of Subscribers viewing a particular channel, the Operator shall indicate only the total number of Subscribers viewing during the relevant time and, the percentage of all Subscribers which they represent, but not the identity of any Subscriber.

     (6)     No polls or other two-way responses of Subscribers shall be conducted whether for commercial purposes, in connection with Community use, or otherwise unless the program of which the poll is a part contains an explicit disclosure of the nature, purpose, and prospective use of the results of the poll. The Operator shall supervise and monitor all polls in which responses are received through the Cable System, and shall adopt and enforce measures which ensure that personally identifiable information concerning a Subscriber, including his or her viewing habits and response or responses to the inquiry or inquiries, is not received by any third party, including the party sponsoring the poll.

     (7)     The Operator shall not tabulate any test results, nor permit the use of the System of such tabulation, which would reveal the commercial product preferences or opinions of individual Subscribers, members of their families or their invitees or employees, without advance written authorization by the Subscriber.

     b.      The Operator shall not deny service, deny access, or otherwise discriminate against subscribers, channel users, or general citizens on the basis of race, color, religion, national origin, or sex. The Operator shall comply at all times with all other applicable federal, state and local laws and regulations, and all executive and administrative orders relating to nondiscrimination which are hereby incorporated and made part of this ordinance by reference.

     c.       The Operator shall strictly adhere to the equal employment opportunity requirements of federal, state and local regulations, and as amended from time to time.

 

Section 22. Purchase Of Cable System By City
     In the event the Operator forfeits or City revokes this Franchise pursuant to provisions of this ordinance, City shall have the right, directly or as an intermediary, to purchase the Cable System at fair market value as a going concern, subject to and in accordance with applicable law.

 

Section 23. Performance Evaluation Sessions
     a.      The City and the Operator may hold scheduled performance evaluation sessions within thirty (30) days of the third, sixth, ninth, and twelfth anniversary dates of the Operator’s award of the Franchise and as may be required by federal and state law. All such evaluation sessions shall be open to the public.

     b.      Special evaluation sessions may be held at any time during the term of the Franchise at the request of the City or the Operator.

     c.       All evaluation sessions shall be open to the public and announced in a newspaper of general circulation or posted in accordance with legal notice requirements of the City. The Operator shall notify its subscribers of all evaluation sessions by announcement on at least two (2) channels of its System between the hours of 7:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m., for five (5) consecutive days preceding each session.

     d.      Topics which may be discussed at any scheduled or special evaluation sessions may include, but not be limited to, basic service rate structures; Franchise Fee; penalties; application of new technologies; System performance; services provided; programming offered; customer complaints; privacy; amendments to this ordinance; judicial and FCC rulings; line extension policies; and the Operator or City rules.

     e.       Members of the general public may add topics either by submitting through the Operator or the City, or by presenting a petition. If such a petition bears the valid signatures of fifty (50) or more residents of the City, the proposed topic or topics shall be added to the list of topics to be discussed at the evaluation sessions.

 

Section 24. Effect Of Annexations
     In the event any new territory shall become annexed to the City, the Operator shall forthwith extend its Cable System to all Dwelling Units within that annexed portion of the City subject to the density provision of Section 5(e) hereof.

     a.      It shall be unlawful for any person, firm or corporation to make any unauthorized connection, whether physically, electrically, acoustically, inductively or otherwise, with any part of a franchised Cable System within this City for the purpose of enabling himself or others to receive any Cable Service, without payment, to the owner of said System.

Section 29. Severability
     If any Section or provision of this franchise Agreement or any ordinance, law, or document incorporated herein by reference is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be invalid, unconstitutional or unenforceable, such holding shall be confined in its operation to the Section or provision directly involved in the controversy in which such holding shall have been rendered and shall not in any way affect the validity of any other Section or provision hereof. Under such a circumstance, the Operator shall, upon the City’s request, or the City shall, upon the Operator’s request, meet and confer to consider amendments to the Franchise Agreement to meet the original intent of the parties, as the circumstances warrant and unless prohibited by law, provided, however, that the Operator, in its sole and exclusive discretion, is not required to enter an agreement with the City concerning such an amendment. Both the City and the Operator agree to be bound by all terms and conditions of this Franchise except as may be finally determined to be unenforceable by a Court of competent and appropriate jurisdiction with proper venue over this Franchise, provided that the City or the Operator need not comply with any term or condition of this Franchise Agreement which it is contesting in good faith by appropriate proceedings.
