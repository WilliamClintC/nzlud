§152.01 USE CATEGORIES
(A) General
(1) Basis for classification
Use categories classify land uses and activities based on similar functional, product,
or physical characteristics. Characteristics include the type and amount of activity,
the type of customers or residents, how goods or services are sold or delivered,
likely impact on surrounding properties and site conditions. The use categories
provide a systematic basis for assigning land uses to appropriate zoning districts.
(2) Principal use characteristics
A principal use is assigned to the use category that most closely corresponds to its
nature as described in the “Characteristics” section of each use category.
(B) Accessory Uses
Accessory uses are allowed by right, but only in conjunction with a principal use, unless
otherwise stated elsewhere in this Chapter. Unless otherwise stated, accessory uses are
subject to the same regulations as the principal use. Common accessory uses are listed as
examples in the use category descriptions.
(C) Use of Examples
The “Examples” section of each use category lists uses common to that use category.
(1) The examples provided are not all-inclusive, but describe the types of uses that are
common to that category. Similar uses may also be permitted upon determination
by the Zoning Administrator that they are appropriate for that use category.
(2) The names of these sample uses are generic and are based on common meanings,
not on what a specific use may call itself. For example, a use that calls itself
“Wholesale Warehouse,” but sells mostly to retail consumers, is included in the
Retail Sales and Service category rather than the Wholesale Trade category.
(D) Uses Not Included
The “Uses Not Included” section provides cross-references to uses that may appear to be
part of a particular category, but which are explicitly handled in a different use category.
(E) Use Categories
The following tables describe the characteristics of categories of uses, examples from each
category, common accessory uses and uses that are not part of a given use category. These
Chapter §152 USE REGULATIONS TITLE XV. TITLE 15.
Zoning Ordinance

tables are descriptive and the examples listed are not all-inclusive. Determination of the
appropriate category for a proposed principal use or accessory not specifically listed will be
made by the Town Clerk or the Clerk’s designee.

§154.01. STATUTORY AUTHORIZATION, FINDINGS OF FACT, PURPOSE AND
OBJECTIVES.
(A) Statutory Authorization
The Indiana Legislature has in IC 36-1-4-11 granted the power to local government units to control
land use within their jurisdictions. Therefore, the Town Council of the Town of Brownstown does
hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations. (Ord. 2014-1 Adopted October 6,
2014, effective November 19, 2014).
(B) Findings of Fact
(1) The flood hazard areas of Brownstown are subject to periodic inundation which
results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of
commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood
protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect
the public health, safety, and general welfare.
(2) These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in
floodplains causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy
in flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands
which are inadequately elevated, flood-proofed, or otherwise unprotected from
flood damages. (Ord. 2014-1 Adopted October 6, 2014, effective November 19,
2014).
(C) Purpose
It is the purpose of this ordinance to promote the public health, safety, and general
welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific
areas by provisions designed to:
(1) Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property
due to water or erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in erosion
or in flood heights or velocities.
(2) Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such
uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction.
(3) Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural
protective barriers which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters.
Chapter §154 floodplain regulations TITLE XV. TITLE 15.
Zoning Ordinance
Town of Brownstown, Indiana 55
(4) Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase
erosion or flood damage.
(5) Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally
divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands.
(6) Make federal flood insurance available for structures and their contents in the
Town by fulfilling the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program.
(D) Objectives.
The objectives of this ordinance are:
(1) To protect human life and health.
(2) To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects.
(3) To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and
generally undertaken at the expense of the general public.
(4) To minimize prolonged business interruptions.
(5) To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains,
electric, telephone, and sewer lines, streets, and bridges located in floodplains.
(6) To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development
of flood prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas.
§154.02. DEFINITIONS
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this ordinance shall be interpreted so as to give
them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this ordinance its most reasonable application.
A zone means portions of the SFHA in which the principal source of flooding is runoff from rainfall,
snowmelt, or a combination of both. In A zones, floodwaters may move slowly or rapidly, but waves are
usually not a significant threat to buildings. These areas are labeled as Zone A, Zone AE, Zones A1-A30, Zone
AO, Zone AH, Zone AR and Zone A99 on a FIRM. The definitions are presented below:
Zone A: Areas subject to inundation by the one-percent annual chance flood event. Because
detailed hydraulic analyses have not been performed, no base flood elevation or depths are shown.
Zone AE and A 1-A30: Areas subject to inundation by the one-percent annual chance flood event
determined by detailed methods. Base flood elevations are shown within these zones. (Zone AE is
on new and revised maps in place of Zones A1-A30.)
Chapter §154 floodplain regulations TITLE XV. TITLE 15.
Zoning Ordinance
Town of Brownstown, Indiana 56
Zone AO: Areas subject to inundation by one-percent annual chance shallow flooding (usually sheet
flow on sloping terrain) where average depths are between one and three feet. Average flood
depths derived from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone.
Zone AH: Areas subject to inundation by one-percent annual chance shallow flooding (usually areas
of ponding) where average depths are between one and three feet. Average flood depths derived
from detailed hydraulic analyses are shown within this zone.
Zone AR: Areas that result from the decertification of a previously accredited flood protection
system that is determined to be in the process of being restored to provide base flood protection.
Zone A99: Areas subject to inundation by the one-percent annual chance flood event, but which
will ultimately be protected upon completion of an under-construction Federal flood protection
system. These are areas of special flood hazard where enough progress has been made on the
construction of a protection system, such as dikes, dams, and levees, to consider it complete for
insurance rating purposes. Zone A99 may only be used when the flood protection system has
reached specified statutory progress toward completion. No base flood elevations or depths are
shown.
Accessory structure (appurtenant structure) means a structure with a floor area 400 square feet or less
that is located on the same parcel of property as the principal structure and the use of which is incidental to
the use of the principal structure. Accessory structures should constitute a minimal initial investment, may
not be used for human habitation, and be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of
accessory structures are detached garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds.
Addition (to an existing structure) means any walled and roofed expansion to the perimeter of a structure
in which the addition is connected by a common load-bearing wall other than a firewall. Any walled and
roofed addition, which is connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter load-bearing
walls, is new construction.
Appeal means a request for a review of the floodplain administrator's interpretation of any provision of this
ordinance.
Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO or AH Zone on the community's Flood Insurance Rate
Map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not exist,
where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be evident.
Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow.
Base Flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year.
Base Flood Elevation (BFE) means the elevation of the one-percent annual chance flood.
Basement means that portion of a structure having its floor sub-grade (below ground level) on all sides.
Boundary River means the part of the Ohio River that forms the boundary between Kentucky and Indiana.
Boundary River Floodway means the floodway of a boundary river.

facilities include, but are not limited to, schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire, and emergency
response installations, installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials or hazardous waste.
D Zone means unstudied areas where flood hazards are undetermined, but flooding is possible. Flood
insurance is available in participating communities but is not required by regulation in this zone.

limited to:
(1) construction, reconstruction, or placement of a structure or any addition to a structure;
(2) installing a manufactured home on a site, preparing a site for a manufactured home or

(6) construction and/or reconstruction of bridges or culverts;
(7) storage of materials; or
(8) any other activity that might change the direction, height, or velocity of flood or surface
waters.
"Development" does not include activities such as the maintenance of existing structures and
facilities such as painting, re-roofing; resurfacing roads; or gardening, plowing, and similar
agricultural practices that do not involve filling, grading, excavation, or the construction of
permanent structures.
Elevated structure means a non-basement structure built to have the lowest floor elevated above the
ground level by means of fill, solid foundation perimeter walls, filled stem wall foundations (also called
chain walls), pilings, or columns (posts and piers).

Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures
for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the
floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain
management regulations, and open space plans.
Floodplain management regulations means this ordinance and other zoning ordinances, subdivision

regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances, and other applications of police
power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state, or local
regulations in any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and
damage. Floodplain management regulations are also referred to as floodplain regulations, floodplain
ordinance, flood damage prevention ordinance, and floodplain management requirements.
Floodproofing (dry flood proofing) is a method of protecting a structure that ensures that the structure,
together with attendant utilities and sanitary facilities, is watertight to the flood proofed design elevation
with walls that are substantially impermeable to the passage of water. All structural components of these
walls are capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic flood forces, including the effects of buoyancy,
and anticipated debris impact forces.
Floodproofing certificate is a form used to certify compliance for non-residential structures as an
alternative to elevating structures to or above the FPG. This certification must be by a Registered
Professional Engineer or Architect.
Floodway is the channel of a river or stream and those portions of the floodplains adjoining the channel
which are reasonably required to efficiently carry and discharge the peak flood flow of the regulatory flood
of any river or stream.
Freeboard means a factor of safety, usually expressed in feet above the BFE, which is applied for the
purposes of floodplain management. It is used to compensate for the many unknown factors that could
contribute to flood heights greater than those calculated for the base flood.
Fringe is those portions of the floodplain lying outside the floodway.
Hardship (as related to variances of this ordinance) means the exceptional hardship that would result from
a failure to grant the requested variance. The Town Council requires that the variance is exceptional,
unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is NOT
exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the
disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these
problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more
expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than
originally intended.
Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to the start of
construction, next to the proposed walls of a structure.
Historic structures means any structures individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the
Indiana State Register of Historic Sites and Structures.
Increased Cost of Compliance (ICC) means the cost to repair a substantially damaged structure that
exceeds the minimal repair cost and that is required to bring a substantially damaged structure into
compliance with the local flood damage prevention ordinance. Acceptable mitigation measures are
elevation, relocation, demolition, or any combination thereof. All renewal and new business flood
insurance policies with effective dates on or after June 1, 1997, will include ICC coverage.

Letter of Final Determination (LFD) means a letter issued by FEMA during the mapping update process
which establishes final elevations and provides the new flood map and flood study to the community. The
LFD initiates the six-month adoption period. The community must adopt or amend its floodplain
management regulations during this six-month period unless the community has previously incorporated
an automatic adoption clause.
Letter of Map Change (LOMC) is a general term used to refer to the several types of revisions and
amendments to FEMA maps that can be accomplished by letter. They include Letter of Map Amendment

are presented below:
Letter of Map Amendment (LOMA) means an amendment by letter to the currently effective FEMA
map that establishes that a property IS not located in a SFHA through the submittal of property
specific elevation data. A LOMA is only issued by FEMA.
Letter of Map Revision (LOMR) means an official revision to the currently effective FEMA map. It is
issued by FEMA and changes flood zones, delineations, and elevations.
Letter of Map Revision Based on Fill (LOMR-F) means an official revision by letter to an effective
NFIP map. A LOMR-F provides FEMA's determination concerning whether a structure or parcel has
been elevated on fill above the BFE and excluded from the SFHA.
Lowest adjacent grade means the lowest elevation, after completion of construction, of the ground,
sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement entryway immediately next to the structure.
Lowest floor means the lowest elevation described among the following:
(1) The top of the lowest level of the structure.
(2) The top of the basement floor.
(3) The top of the garage floor, if the garage is the lowest level of the structure.
(4) The top of the first floor of a structure elevated on pilings or pillars.
(5) The top of the floor level of any enclosure, other than a basement, below an elevated
structure where the walls of the enclosure provide any resistance to the flow of flood waters
unless:
a) the walls are designed to automatically equalize the hydrostatic flood forces on the walls
by allowing for the entry and exit of flood waters by providing a minimum of two
openings (in addition to doorways and windows) in a minimum of two exterior walls; if a
structure has more than one enclosed area, each shall have openings on exterior walls;
b) the total net area of all openings shall be at least one (1) square inch for everyone square
foot of enclosed area; the bottom of all such openings shall be no higher than one (1)
foot above the exterior grade or the interior grade immediately beneath each opening,
whichever is higher; and,
c) such enclosed space shall be usable solely for the parking of vehicles and building access.

independent certified appraisal, replacement cost depreciated by age of building (actual cash value), or
adjusted assessed values.
Mitigation means sustained actions taken to reduce or eliminate long-term risk to people and property
from hazards and their effects. The purpose of mitigation is twofold: to protect people and structures, and
to minimize the cost of disaster response and recovery.
National Flood Insurance Program (NFIP) is the federal program that makes flood insurance available to
owners of property in participating communities nationwide through the cooperative efforts of the Federal
Government and the private insurance industry.
National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as a
reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain.
New construction means any structure for which the "start of construction" commenced after the effective
date of the community's first floodplain ordinance.
New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which
the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed
(including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading
or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of the community's first
floodplain ordinance.
Non-boundary river floodway means the floodway of any river or stream other than a boundary river.
North American Vertical Datum of 1988 (NAVD 88) as adopted in 1993 is a vertical control datum used as a

alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water; or due to its location, its
propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried
downstream.
One-percent annual chance flood is the flood that has a one percent (1 %) chance of being equaled or
exceeded in any given year. Any flood zone that begins with the letter A is subject to the one-percent
annual chance flood. See "Regulatory Flood".

Town of Brownstown, Indiana 62
Physical Map Revision (PMR) is an official republication of a community's FEMA map to effect changes to
base (1-percent annual chance) flood elevations, floodplain boundary delineations, regulatory floodways,
and planimetric features. These changes typically occur as a result of structural works or improvements,
annexations resulting in additional flood hazard areas, or correction to base flood elevations or SFHAs.
Public safety and nuisance means anything which is injurious to the safety or health of an entire
community, neighborhood or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage

a light duty truck; and (4) designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling, but as quarters for
recreational camping, travel, or seasonal use.
Regular program means the phase of the community's participation in the NFIP where more
comprehensive floodplain management requirements are imposed and higher amounts of insurance are
available based upon risk zones and elevations determined in a FIS.
Regulatory flood means the flood having a one percent (1 %) chance of being equaled or exceeded in any
given year as calculated by a method and procedure that is acceptable to and approved by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. The regulatory flood
elevation at any location is as defined in Article 3 (B) of this ordinance. The "Regulatory Flood" is also
known by the term "Base Flood", "One-Percent Annual Chance Flood", and "100-Year Flood".
Repetitive loss means flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a
10-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such flood event, on the average, equaled
or exceeded 25% of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.
Section 1316 is that section of the National Flood Insurance Act of 1968, as amended, which states that no
new flood insurance coverage shall be provided for any property that the Administrator finds has been
declared by a duly constituted state or local zoning authority or other authorized public body to be in
violation of state or local laws, regulations, or ordinances that intended to discourage or otherwise restrict
land development or occupancy in flood-prone areas.
Special Flood Hazard Area (SFHA) means those lands within the jurisdiction of the Town subject to
inundation by the regulatory flood. The SFHAs of the Town of Brownstown are generally identified as such
on the Jackson County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map dated November 19,
2014 as well as any future updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by the Federal Emergency
Management Agency with the most recent date. (These areas are shown on a FIRM as Zone A, AE, A1- A30,
AH, AR, A99, or AO).
Start of construction includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building permit was
issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was within 180
days of the permit date. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a
structure on a site, such as the pouring of a slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of
columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a
foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading and filling;
nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a
Chapter §154 floodplain regulations TITLE XV. TITLE 15.
Zoning Ordinance
Town of Brownstown, Indiana 63
basement, footings, piers, foundations, or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the
installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units

structure to it's before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the
structure before the damage occurred.
Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a
structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the
"start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures that have incurred "repetitive
loss" or "substantial damage" regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not include
improvements of structures to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code
requirements or any alteration of a "historic structure", provided that the alteration will not preclude the
structures continued designation as a "historic structure".
Suspension means the removal of a participating community from the NFIP because the community has not
enacted and/or enforced the proper floodplain management regulations required for participation in the
NFIP.
Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this ordinance, which permits construction in a
manner otherwise prohibited by this ordinance where specific enforcement would result in unnecessary
hardship.
Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this ordinance. A
structure or other development without the elevation, other certification, or other evidence of compliance
required in this ordinance is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.
Watercourse means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other topographic feature on or over
which waters flow at least periodically. Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which
substantial flood damage may occur.
X zone means the area where the flood hazard is less than that in the SFHA. Shaded X zones shown on
recent FIRMs (B zones on older FIRMs) designate areas subject to inundation by the flood with a 0.2
percent chance of being equaled or exceeded (the 500-year flood). Unshaded X zones (C zones on older
FIRMs) designate areas where the annual exceedance probability of flooding is less than 0.2 percent.
Zone means a geographical area shown on a FIRM that reflects the severity or type of flooding in the area.

Zone B, C, and X means areas identified in the community as areas of moderate or minimal hazard from the
principal source of flood in the area. However, buildings in these zones could be flooded by severe,
concentrated rainfall coupled with inadequate local drainage systems. Flood insurance is available in
participating communities but is not required by regulation in these zones. (Zone X is used on new and
revised maps in place of Zones B and C.)
§154.03. General Provisions.
Lands to Which This Ordinance Applies.
This ordinance shall apply to all SFHAs and known flood prone areas within the jurisdiction
of the Town of Brownstown. Basis for Establishing Regulatory Flood Data.
This ordinance's protection standard is the regulatory flood. The best available regulatory
flood data is listed below.
(1) The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for the studied SFHAs
within the jurisdiction of the Town of Brownstown shall be as delineated on the onepercent
annual chance flood profiles in the Flood Insurance Study of Jackson County,
Indiana and Incorporated Areas and the corresponding Flood Insurance Rate Map dated
November 19, 2014 as well as any future updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most recent date.
(2) The regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits for each of the SFHAs
within the jurisdiction of the Town of Brownstown, delineated as an "A Zone" on the
Jackson County, Indiana and Incorporated Areas Flood Insurance Rate Map dated
November 19, 2014 as well as any future updates, amendments, or revisions, prepared by
the Federal Emergency Management Agency with the most recent date, shall be according
to the best data available as provided by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources;
provided the upstream drainage area from the subject site is greater than one square mile.
Whenever a party disagrees with the best available data, the party needs to replace
existing data with better data that meets current engineering standards. To be considered,
this data must be submitted to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for review
and subsequently approved.
(3) In the absence of a published FEMA map, or absence of identification on a FEMA
map, the regulatory flood elevation, floodway, and fringe limits of any watercourse in the
community's known flood prone areas shall be according to the best data available as
provided by the Indiana Department of Natural Resources; provided the upstream drainage
area from the subject site is greater than one square mile.
(4) Upon issuance of a Letter of Final Determination (LFD), any more restrictive data in
the new (not yet effective) mapping/study shall be utilized for permitting and construction
(development) purposes, replacing all previously effective less restrictive flood hazard data
provided by FEMA.

Zoning Ordinance
Town of Brownstown, Indiana 65
(A) Establishment of Floodplain Development Permit
A Floodplain Development Permit shall be required in conformance with the provisions of
this ordinance prior to the commencement of any development activities in areas of special
flood hazard.
(B) Compliance
No structure shall hereafter be located, extended, converted or structurally altered within
the SFHA without full compliance with the terms of this ordinance and other applicable
regulations. No land or stream within the SFHA shall hereafter be altered without full
compliance with the terms of this ordinance and other applicable regulations.
(C) Abrogation and Greater Restrictions
This ordinance is not intended to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements,
covenants, or deed restrictions. However, where this ordinance and another conflict or
overlap, whichever imposes the more
stringent restrictions shall prevail.
(D) Discrepancy between Mapped Floodplain and Actual Ground Elevations
(1) In cases where there is a discrepancy between the mapped floodplain (SFHA) on
the FIRM and the actual ground elevations, the elevation provided on the profiles
shall govern.
(2) If the elevation of the site in question is below the base flood elevation, that site
shall be included in the SFHA and regulated accordingly.
(3) If the elevation (natural grade) of the site in question is above the base flood
elevation and not located within the floodway, that site shall be considered outside
the SFHA and the floodplain regulations will not be applied. The property owner
shall be advised to apply for a LOMA.
(E) Interpretation
In the interpretation and application of this ordinance all provisions shall be:
(1) Considered as minimum requirements.
(2) Liberally construed in favor of the governing body.
(3) Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes.
(F) Warning and Disclaimer of Liability
The degree of flood protection required by this ordinance is considered reasonable for
regulatory purposes and is based on available information derived from engineering and
scientific methods of study. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Therefore,
this ordinance does not create any liability on the part of the Town of Brownstown, the
Indiana Department of Natural Resources, or the State of Indiana, for any flood damage
that results from reliance on this ordinance or any administrative decision made lawfully
thereunder.

deemed to be a violation of this ordinance. All violations shall be considered a common
nuisance and shall be punishable by a fine not exceeding $2,500.00.
(1) A separate offense shall be deemed to occur for each day the violation continues to
exist.
(2) The Floodplain Administrator shall inform the owner that any such violation is
considered a willful act to increase flood damages and therefore may cause
coverage by a Standard Flood Insurance Policy to be suspended.
(3) Nothing herein shall prevent the Town from taking such other lawful action to
prevent or remedy any violations. All costs connected therewith shall accrue to the
person or persons responsible.

Located within SFHAs, established in Article 3, Section B, are areas designated as floodways.
The floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters, which
carry debris, potential projectiles, and has erosion potential. If the site is in an identified
floodway, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to forward the
application, along with all pertinent plans and specifications, to the Indiana Department of
Natural Resources and apply for a permit for construction in a floodway. Under the
provisions of IC 14-28-1 a permit for construction in a floodway from the Indiana
Chapter §154 floodplain regulations TITLE XV. TITLE 15.
Zoning Ordinance
Town of Brownstown, Indiana 74
Department of Natural Resources is required prior to the issuance of a local building permit
for any excavation, deposit, construction, or obstruction activity located in the floodway.
This includes land preparation activities such as filling, grading, clearing and paving etc.
undertaken before the actual start of construction of the structure. However, it does
exclude non-substantial additions/improvements to existing (lawful) residences in a nonboundary
river floodway. (IC 14-28-1-26 allows construction of a non-substantial addition/
improvement to a residence in a non-boundary river floodway without obtaining a permit
for construction in the floodway from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. Please
note that if fill is needed to elevate an addition above the existing grade, prior approval for
the fill is required from the Indiana Department of Natural Resources. )
No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until a permit or letter of
authorization (when applicable) has been issued by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources granting approval for construction in the floodway. Once a permit for
construction in a floodway or letter of authorization has been issued by the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local
Floodplain Development Permit, provided the provisions contained in Article 5 of this
ordinance have been met. The Floodplain Development Permit cannot be less restrictive
than the permit for construction in a floodway issued by the Indiana Department of Natural
Resources. However, a community's more restrictive regulations (if any) shall take
precedence.
No development shall be allowed, which acting alone or in combination with existing or
future development, that will adversely affect the efficiency of, or unduly restrict the
capacity of the floodway. This adverse affect is defined as an increase in the elevation of
the regulatory flood of at least fifteen-hundredths (0.15) of a foot as determined by
comparing the regulatory flood elevation under the project condition to that under the
natural or pre-floodway condition as proven with hydraulic analyses.
For all projects involving channel modifications or fill (including levees) the Town shall
submit the data and request that the Federal Emergency Management Agency revise the
regulatory flood data per mapping standard regulations found at 44 CFR § 65.12.
(F) Standards for Identified Fringe
If the site is located in an identified fringe, then the Floodplain Administrator may issue the
local Floodplain Development Permit provided the provisions contained in Article 5 of this
ordinance have been met. The key provision is that the top of the lowest floor of any new
or substantially improved structure shall be at or above the FPG.
(G) Standards for SFHAs without Esablished Base Flood Elevation and/or
Floodways/Fringes
(1) Drainage area upstream of the site is greater than one square mile:
If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the floodway and fringe
have not yet been determined, and the drainage area upstream of the site is
greater than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the
applicant to forward the application, along with all pertinent plans and
Chapter §154 floodplain regulations TITLE XV. TITLE 15.
Zoning Ordinance
Town of Brownstown, Indiana 75
specifications, to the Indiana Department of Natural Resources for review and
comment.
No action shall be taken by the Floodplain Administrator until either a permit for
construction in a floodway (including letters of authorization) or a floodplain
analysis/regulatory assessment citing the one-percent annual chance flood
elevation and the recommended Flood Protection Grade has been received from
the Indiana Department of Natural Resources.
Once the Floodplain Administrator has received the proper permit for construction
in a floodway (including letters of authorization) or floodplain analysis/regulatory
assessment approving the proposed development, a Floodplain Development
Permit may be issued provided the conditions of the Floodplain Development
Permit are not less restrictive than the conditions received from the Indiana
Department of Natural Resources and the provisions contained in Article 5 of this
ordinance have been met.
(2) Drainage area upstream of the site is less than one square mile:
If the site is in an identified floodplain where the limits of the floodway and fringe
have not yet been determined and the drainage area upstream of the site is less
than one square mile, the Floodplain Administrator shall require the applicant to
provide an engineering analysis showing the limits of the floodplain and onepercent
annual chance flood elevation for the site.
Upon receipt, the Floodplain Administrator may issue the local Floodplain
Development Permit, provided the provisions contained in Article 5 of this
ordinance have been met.
(3) The total cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all
other existing and anticipated development, shall not increase the regulatory flood
more than 0.14 of one foot and shall not increase flood damages or potential flood
damages.
(H) Standards and Flood Prone Areas
All development in known flood prone areas not identified on FEMA maps, or where no FEMA
published map is available, shall meet applicable standards as required per Article 5.

(5) Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the
minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief.
(6) Variances may be granted for the reconstruction or restoration of any structure
individually listed on the National Register of Historic Places or the Indiana State
Register of Historic Sites and Structures.
(7) Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice specifying
the difference between the Flood Protection Grade and the elevation to which the
lowest floor is to be built and stating that the cost of the flood insurance will be
commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced lowest floor
elevation (See Article 6, Section E).
(8) The Floodplain Administrator shall maintain the records of appeal actions and report any variances
to the Federal Emergency Management Agency or the Indiana Department of Natural Resources upon
request (See Article 6, Section E).
(E) Variance Notification
Any applicant to whom a variance is granted that allows the lowest floor of a structure to
be built below the flood protection grade shall be given written notice over the signature of
a community official that:
(1) The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the flood protection
grade will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as
high as $25 for $100 of insurance coverage; and;
(2) Such construction below the flood protection grade increases risks to life and
property. A copy of the notice shall be recorded by the Floodplain Administrator in

§157.02. NONCONFORMING LOTS .................................................................................................................... 94
§157.01. NONCONFORMING STATUS
(A) General
(1) Within the districts established by this ordinance there exist lots, structures, uses of
land and structures, use of structures, and signs which were lawful, but which
would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this ordinance. It
is the intent hereof to provide for the elimination of certain nonconformities, to
permit some nonconformities to conditionally continue, and to ensure that
nonconformities shall not be horizontally or vertically enlarged, increased,
expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses
prohibited elsewhere in the same district.
(2) Nonconforming uses are declared by this ordinance to be incompatible with
permitted uses in the districts involved. A nonconforming use of a structure and
land in combination shall not be enlarged, increased, expanded or extended by the
addition of other uses prohibited generally in the district involved.
(3) Nothing in this ordinance shall be deemed to require a change in the plans,
construction, or designated use of any building on which actual construction was
lawfully begun but not completed prior to the effective date hereof and upon
which actual building construction has been carried on diligently. Actual
construction is hereby defined to include the placing of construction materials in
permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner. Where excavation or
demolition or removal of an existing building has been substantially begun
preparatory to rebuilding, such excavation or demolition or removal shall be
deemed to be actual construction, provided that work shall be carried on diligently.
(B) Construction of Article
Any lot, structure, use, sign or combination thereof which was lawfully established after
January 1, 2015, but which does not conform with any aspects of this ordinance shall
remain a lawful nonconforming lot, structure, use, sign or combination thereof.
(C) Special and Nonconforming Uses Distinguished
Special uses and nonconforming uses are distinguishable. A nonconforming use means the
use of a building or premises that does not comply with the regulations and restrictions of
the district in which it is located. A special use is one which is controlled and conditionally
permissible in a given zone. It is granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals only after a public
hearing, upon a finding that conditions of the zoning provisions of this Code are satisfied.

of lots with continuous frontage in single ownership are of record in the form of a
deed or plat on the effective date hereof, and if all or part of the lots do not meet
the requirements established for lot width and area, the land involved shall be
considered to be an undivided parcel for the purpose of this ordinance, and no
portion of said parcel shall be used or sold in a manner which creates
noncompliance with lot width and area requirements established by this ordinance,
nor shall any voluntary division of any parcel be made which creates a lot with
width or area below requirements stated in this ordinance.
(B) NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES
Where a structure exists on the effective date of this ordinance, that could not be built

altered in a way which increases the nonconforming floor area, or moved in a way
which increases its nonconformity.

remodeling or addition or the use thereof, will not create a violation of any
provisions of this ordinance.

rendered unusable, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the
provisions of this ordinance or with action taken by the Board of Zoning Appeals.

regulations specified by this ordinance for the district in which such land is located.

nonconforming use is more appropriate to the district than the existing
nonconforming use. In permitting such changes, the Town Council may establish
and require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accord with the provisions of
this ordinance. Any such conditions shall be imposed in the form of “commitments”
as provided in Ind. Code §36-7-4-1015.

time by a permitted use, or in the event the same shall be discontinued or
abandoned for a period of six consecutive months, or for at least 18 intermittent
months of any consecutive 36 month period, the same shall not, after the

structure containing a nonconforming use, may be done.
