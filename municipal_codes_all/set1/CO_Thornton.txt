PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete republication of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of Thornton, Colorado. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of this republication were the 1996 Code, as supplemented through March 22, 2011, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the City Council. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1975 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant State law have been included. A table listing the State law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of Chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of Chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between Sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes: 
CHARTER CHT:1 CHARTER COMPARATIVE TABLE CHTCT:1 CODE CD1:1 CODE COMPARATIVE TABLES CCT:1 STATE LAW REFERENCE TABLE SLT:1 CHARTER INDEX CHTi:1 CODE INDEX CDi:1  
Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

(3)  A deferred prosecution; or 
(4)  A deferred judgment and sentence.

The City shall also have all powers that now or hereafter may be granted to municipalities by the laws of the State of Colorado, and the enumeration of particular powers in this Charter is not exclusive of others. All such powers shall be exercised in the manner prescribed in this Charter or, if not provided for herein, in such manner as shall be provided by ordinance of the Council of the City.

CHAPTER III. - ELECTIONS 

3.1. - Regular municipal elections. 
    Regular municipal elections shall be held on the first Tuesday in November in the odd-numbered years.

3.4. - Recall from office. 
(a)  Any person holding elective office may be recalled at any time after six months in office pursuant to the procedures set forth in this Charter, in those State statutes, as from time to time amended, which do not conflict with this Charter and which establish procedures for the recall of municipal elective officers, and in those City ordinances which do not conflict with the Charter or those State statutes. 
(b)  A recall petition must be signed by registered electors of the City numbering at least twenty-five percent of the entire vote cast at the last preceding election for all candidates for the office which the incumbent sought to be recalled occupies. For the purpose of this Section, the "last preceding election" shall be the last preceding election at which the person sought to be recalled was elected to office, unless the person sought to be recalled was appointed to fill a vacancy, in which event it shall be the last preceding election at which the person who created the vacancy was elected to office. 
(c)  No signature on a recall petition shall be valid if signed on a date more than sixty days prior to the date the signed petition is filed with the City Clerk. 
(d)  No recall election shall be held if the person sought to be recalled occupies one of the offices to be filled at a regular election which is scheduled within ninety days after submission of the recall petition. 
(e)  After one recall petition and election, no further petition shall be filed against the same person during the term for which such person was elected or appointed, unless the signers number at least fifty percent of the votes cast at the last preceding election for all candidates for the office held by such person, the number to be determined in the manner described in this Section.

Failure to obey the order of Court shall be punishable as a contempt of court. 
(h)  Except as to requirements contained in this Charter, in the State statutes, as from time to time amended, applicable to the recall of municipal elective officers, and in City ordinances, the form, content, approval and other petition requirements in the municipal initiative statutes, as from time to time amended, shall apply as nearly as practicable to recall petitions. 
(i)  If a regular Municipal election is scheduled to be held within ninety (90) days after submission of the recall petition, even though that election is not the one at which the office held by the person sought to be recalled would otherwise be filled, the recall election shall be held at the same time as that regular Municipal election. 
(j)  If a general statewide election is scheduled to be held within ninety (90) days after submission of the recall petition, the recall election shall be held at the same time as that statewide election. 
(k)  A recall petition may be withdrawn at any time prior to thirty (30) days preceding the day scheduled for a vote, by filing with the City Clerk a written request for withdrawal signed by a majority of the persons who are designated in the petition as representing the signers on matters affecting the petition.

CHAPTER IV. - CITY COUNCIL-MEETINGS 

4.1. - City Council. 
    The City Council shall consist of nine (9) members, one of whom shall serve as Mayor. The City Council shall constitute the legislative and governing body of the City and shall have power and authority, except as otherwise provided in this Charter, to exercise all powers conferred upon or possessed by the City, and shall have the power and authority to adopt such laws, ordinances and resolutions as it shall deem proper in the exercise thereof. The Council shall also have all legislative powers and functions of municipal government conferred by general law, except as otherwise provided in this Charter. 
4.2. - Wards. 
(a)  The City is hereby divided into four (4) wards. The Council shall change the boundaries of such wards to reflect population shifts at least once every ten (10) years. Changes in the boundaries of wards shall be made by ordinance adopted by the City Council, which changes shall be made at least one hundred eighty (180) days prior to any regular municipal election, except that territory added to the City shall become a part of the ward or wards as determined by ordinance even if the addition is effective within the one hundred and eighty day period. Wards shall be contiguous and compact, and, as far as practical, shall have approximately the same number of residents. 
(b)  No change in the boundary of any ward shall operate to exclude any Councilmember from office before the expiration of the term for which the incumbent was elected or appointed. 
4.3. - Terms. 
(a)  The terms of office of the Councilmembers hereafter to be elected in accordance with the provisions of this Charter shall be for four (4) years commencing on the first Council meeting, regular or special, following their election and shall continue during the term for which they shall have been elected until their successors shall have been elected and qualified. Every two (2) years at the regular municipal election one Councilmember shall be elected from each ward for a four (4) year term. 
(b)  A Mayor shall be elected at-large for a term of four (4) years, the term of the Mayor commencing at the same time as herein provided for Councilmembers.

In addition to these requirements no person shall be eligible for the office of Councilmember unless the person is and has been a resident of the ward for the time period required by the Colorado Municipal Election Code. Any person who is a resident of the City or of any area annexed to or consolidated with the City for the required length of time, as herein provided, shall be deemed to meet the resident requirements of this Section.

4.5. - Vacancy. 
A.  If a vacancy occurs in the office of Mayor, the Mayor Pro-Tem shall become the Acting Mayor immediately. The Acting Mayor shall serve until the next regular election and then the Acting Mayor shall resume the duties as Councilmember for the remainder of that Councilmember's unexpired term of office. The term of office for Mayor at a regular election following a vacancy in that office shall be for four years. 
B.  If a vacancy occurs in the office of Councilmember, the Council shall appoint an eligible person to fill such vacancy to serve the remainder of the term of office that was vacated. Such appointment shall be by a majority of the members of the Council in office at the time. 
C.  A vacancy shall exist when an elective officer fails to qualify, dies, resigns, is removed from office, moves from the City, moves from the ward from which elected, is incapacitated or is absent continuously therefrom for more than three (3) months, is convicted of a felony, or is judicially declared mentally incompetent. That such cause of vacancy exists shall be established by competent evidence thereof and placed on record in the Council minutes. The Council shall determine the validity of the evidence and, based on its determination, decide when a vacancy exists. 
(Ord. No. 2679, § 2, 9-10-01, approved at the Regular Municipal Election 11-6-01; Ord. No. 3262, § 2, 8-27-13, approved at the Regular Municipal Election 11-5-13; Ord. No. 3345, § 2, 8-25-15, approved at the Regular Municipal Election 11-3-15) 
4.6. - Compensation of Mayor and Councilmembers. 
    The members of the Council shall receive such compensation as the Council shall by ordinance prescribe; but such compensation may increase or decrease only on the date of the first regular or special Council meeting following any regular election and only if the increase or decrease was adopted prior to the date of the election. The Mayor and Councilmembers may, upon order of the Council, be paid such necessary bona fide expenses incurred in service in behalf of the City as are authorized and itemized. 
4.7. - Oath of office. 
    Every elective and appointive officer of the City, before entering upon the duties of the office, shall take the oath or affirmation of office prescribed by Section 8 of Article XII of the Constitution of the State, together with an oath or affirmation to support this Charter and the ordinances of the City and to faithfully perform the duties of the office. In case of failure to comply with the provisions of this Section within ten (10) days from the date of appointment, or within ten (10) days from the date prescribed in this Charter to take office, such officer shall be deemed to have declined the office and such office shall thereupon become vacant unless the Council shall, by resolution, extend the time in which such officer may qualify as above set forth. 
4.8. - Mayor. 
(a)  The Mayor shall preside over meetings of the Council, shall have the right to speak and vote therein as any other member, shall be recognized as head of the City government for all ceremonial purposes, and shall execute and authenticate legal instruments requiring the signature of the Mayor. 
(b)  The Mayor shall be a conservator of the peace, and in emergencies may exercise within the City the powers conferred by the Governor of the State of Colorado for purposes of military law, and shall have authority to command the assistance of all able-bodied citizens to aid in the enforcement of the ordinances of the City and to suppress riot and disorder. Except as may be required by statute, the Mayor shall exercise only such power as specifically conferred by this Charter or the Council. For the purposes of this Section 4.8, "emergencies" means existing conditions actually arising from unforeseen contingencies which immediately endanger public property, health, peace, or safety. 
4.9. - Mayor-Pro Tem. 
    The Council shall, during the first Council meeting, regular or special, following each regular election, elect one of its members to serve as Mayor-Pro Tem for a term of two (2) years. In the event of absence or disability of the Mayor, the Mayor-Pro Tem shall serve as Mayor. Such election shall be by written ballot and by majority of the members of the council in office at the time. In the event of absence or disability of both the Mayor and the Mayor-Pro Tem, the Council may designate another of its members to serve as Acting Mayor during such absence or disability. The Mayor-Pro Tem and Acting Mayor, when serving as Mayor, shall have all the power, duties, responsibility and authority of the Mayor. 
4.10. - Regular meetings. 
    The Council shall provide by ordinance for the time and number of regular Council meeting or meetings each month provided the Council may, by resolution, change the time and place of any particular regular meeting.

    Special meetings of the Council shall be called by the Clerk on the written request of the Mayor, or by any three members of the Council on at least twenty-four (24) hours written notice to each member of the Council, served personally, left at the member's usual place of residence, or delivered electronically or by other technology to the member's residence; but a special meeting may be held on shorter notice if all members of the Council are present or have waived notice thereof in writing. 
(Ord. No. 2383, § 1b, 8-28-95; approved at the Regular Municipal Election 11-7-95) 
4.12. - Business of special meetings. 
    No business shall be transacted at any special meeting of the Council unless the same has been stated in the notice of such meeting. However, any business which may lawfully come before a regular meeting may be transacted at a special meeting if all the members of the Council present consent thereto and all the members absent file their written consent. 
4.13. - Meetings to be public. 
    All regular and special meetings of the Council shall be open to the public and citizens shall have a reasonable opportunity to be heard under such rules and regulations as the Council may prescribe. The Council may hold executive sessions as the Council may determine and may exclude from said meetings the public and citizens, provided however, no formal and legally binding action by the Council for the City shall be taken at any such executive sessions. 
4.14. - Quorum. 
    A majority of the members of the Council in office at the time shall be a quorum for the transaction of business at all council meetings.

(d)  The Council shall follow Robert's Rules of Order, newly revised, as from time to time amended, except to the extent otherwise provided by this Charter or by ordinance. 
(e)  The Council shall, by ordinance, adopt procedures relating to its organization and operation, including attendance at meetings, which are consistent with this Charter, and shall compile its procedures which are of a general and permanent nature in a procedures handbook. 
4.16. - Board of Health. 
    The council shall see that provision is made for the public peace and health, and for the safety of persons and property. The Council shall constitute the Board of Health of the City, and it and its officers shall possess all powers, privileges and immunities granted to boards of health by statute. The Council may by ordinance designate and appoint an existing area-wide health department as the City Health Department. 
4.17. - Power to make contracts. 
(a)  The Council may enter into contracts and leases on behalf of the City and may, by ordinance, delegate such power to officers or employees of the City subject to limits specified within the ordinance.

All written contracts to which the City is a party shall be reviewed as to substance by the City Manager before final approval. 
(b)  The Council may make contracts or spend money for capital improvements including those financed in whole or in part by issuance of bonds, and may make contracts or leases or contracts for services for a period exceeding the budget year in which such contract or lease is made, if otherwise not prohibited under this Charter.

(c)  Except for contracts issued for acquiring water and rights thereto, or for acquiring, improving, or extending a municipal water system and except for long term rentals and leaseholds entered into pursuant to Section 11.7, any contract which is made for a period exceeding the budget year in which it is made and which contains an express statement that the full faith and credit of the City is pledged for its payment shall be subject to the election requirement of Section 11.2(a) and the debt limitation of Section 11.3. 
(Ord. No. 3345, § 2, 8-25-15, approved at the Regular Municipal Election 11-3-15) 
4.18. - Contracts with other governmental bodies. 
    In addition to any authority granted by state statute or constitution, the Council by resolution may enter into contracts with other governmental bodies to furnish governmental services and make charges for such services, or enter into cooperative or joint activities with other governmental bodies. 
4.19. - Appointments by Council. 
    The Council shall appoint the officers and all members of the boards and commissions as provided in this Charter. Except as otherwise provided herein, such persons shall serve at the pleasure of Council and may be removed at any time, with or without cause. 
4.20. - Conflict of interest. 
    No member of the Council shall be interested directly in any contract with the City. No member of the Council shall vote on any question in which the member has a financial interest, other than the common public interest, or on any question concerning the member's own conduct. 
4.21. - Elective officers not to be employed for two years. 
    No elective officer, under this Charter, may be appointed to any City office or be employed by the City during the term of office for which elected or for two (2) years thereafter, provided that after the expiration of that term of office, the officer may be appointed as a member of an independent board or commission or fill a vacancy in the position of Councilmember.

Wherein such employee feels that the employee has been dealt with in an unfair or capricious manner in violation of the employee's rights as an employee, the employee may resort to the grievance procedure hereinafter provided. 
(2)  A grievance procedure is necessary to resolve grievances as quickly as possible, to correct the causes and prevent future similar complaints, to assure fair and equitable treatment of all levels of employees.

    Approval by the electors of any Charter Amendment which repeals any section or portion of this Charter shall not be construed to be a limitation, denial, or suspension of any power of the City of Thornton, or any power of its elected City Council otherwise vested in or authorized to the City or the City Council by the constitution or the statutes of the State of Colorado; except as expressly provided by new language, such amendments shall be construed to the end that repealers or deletions eliminate obsolete, unnecessary and limiting language in the original Charter Document which previously served to restrict the powers of the City and the elected City Council. 
CHAPTER XVIII - COLLECTIVE BARGAINING FOR FIRE FIGHTERS AND POLICE OFFICERS 

18.1. - Statement of policy. 
    The protection of the public health, safety and welfare demand that fire fighters and police officers not be accorded the right to strike or engage in any work stoppage, slowdown or mass absenteeism. This necessary prohibition does not, however, require the denial to such employees of the City other well-recognized rights of employees, such as the right to organize, be represented by an employee organization of their choice, and the right to bargain collectively concerning wages, rates of pay, hours, grievance procedure, working conditions, and other terms and conditions of employment. 
    It is hereby declared to be the policy of the City of Thornton to accord to fire fighters and police officers all the rights of labor other than the right to strike or organize any work stoppage, slowdown or mass absenteeism. To provide for the exercise of these rights, a method of resolution of disputes is hereby established in lieu of the right to strike. The establishment of this method of dispute resolution shall be deemed to be a recognition of the necessity to provide an alternative mode of settling disputes where employees such as fire fighters and police officers, as a matter of public policy, must be denied the right to strike.

(b)  (i)  In the event the City or the fire fighter bargaining agent or police officer bargaining agent is unwilling to enter into a collective bargaining agreement containing the recommendations of the fact finders, the corporate authorities shall cause the recommendations of the fact finders to be referred to a vote of the people not less than thirty (30) nor more than sixty (60) days from the date of the fact finders' recommendations. The final offer concerning those issues still in dispute of the party or parties rejecting the fact finders' recommendations shall also be placed on the ballot. The only issues that will be submitted to such an election will be economic issues or issues that change the rights of fire fighters contained in the fire fighter collective bargaining agreement or change the rights of police officers contained in the police officer collective bargaining agreement in effect at the time of the adoption of this Chapter or issues that the parties to the negotiations agree in the applicable fire fighter collective bargaining agreement or police officer collective bargaining agreement may be placed on the ballot.

The proposal receiving approval by a majority of those voting on the proposal(s) shall be deemed approved and be binding upon the parties. If no proposal receives a majority vote, the two proposals receiving the most votes will be placed on a run-off election ballot within forty (40) days.

In the event both parties to a particular fact finding proceeding refuse to implement the recommendations of the fact finders, the parties shall share equally the cost of conducting an election conducted pursuant to Section 18.11.

(b)  Any person who pleads guilty or no contest to or who, after trial, is found guilty of violating any municipal ordinance which is subject to this subsection shall be incarcerated for a period not to exceed a year or fined in an amount not to exceed the maximum amount authorized by state law for municipal courts, or both such fine and imprisonment, except as may be otherwise imposed within the context of a specific section, subsection, ordinance or applicable City Charter provision. 
(c)  In the absence of provisions to the contrary, violations of municipal ordinances are punishable as provided in subsection (b) of this section. 
(d)  The municipal court is empowered in its discretion to assess costs against any defendant who pleads no contest, who pleads guilty, or who is found guilty at trial of any ordinance violation or against whom a default judgment is entered pursuant to Section 14-7. Such costs shall be fixed by resolution or ordinance by the city council in accordance with Charter Section 6.2. 
(e)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this Code, no person under the age of 18 years as of the date of the offense for which such person is convicted shall be subject to incarceration except as set forth in Section 14-16.

(1)  Probation; 
(2)  The suspension of a sentence; 
(3)  A deferred prosecution; or 
(4)  A deferred judgment and sentence. 
(g)  In any case where the victim has suffered pecuniary loss and the defendant pleads guilty, no contest or is found guilty, the court shall require a restitution hearing, and when found to be appropriate at such hearing, the court shall order restitution in an amount determined at the restitution hearing as a condition of any sentence imposed. The restitution hearing shall be set by the court at the time the defendant is found guilty, enters a plea of guilty or no contest, or when the defendant's plea bargain is accepted by the court. 
(h)  For purposes of this section, a victim shall be the party immediately and directly aggrieved by a defendant who is convicted of a criminal act. An act shall be deemed criminal if it is punishable by imprisonment under this Code. 
(i)  For purposes of this section, the amount of restitution shall be based on the actual, pecuniary damages sustained by the victim, the ability of the defendant to pay, and the defendant's obligations to support such defendant's dependents and to meet other family obligations. 
(j)  For purposes of this section, compensable losses for which restitution may be ordered include, but are not limited to, the following: 
(1)  Reasonable medical and hospital expenses and expenses incurred for dentures, eyeglasses, hearing aids, or other prosthetic or medically necessary devices. 
(2)  Loss of earnings. 
(3)  Outpatient care. 
(4)  Property damage. 
(5)  Mental health counseling. 
(6)  Payment of the deductible amount on an insurance policy. 
(k)  At the restitution hearing, the court may consider any competent evidence establishing the monetary loss sustained by the victim. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply to any restitution hearing. The standard of proof at such hearings shall be a preponderance of the evidence. The issue to be decided by the court is the amount of reasonable restitution that should be paid by the defendant. Once the amount of restitution is established, the court shall order such restitution be paid by the defendant to the victim as part of any sentence imposed by the court.

Sec. 2-266. - Purpose and objectives. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this article is to provide procedures by which the city can more precisely manage the placement of structures and/or facilities in the rights-of-way and to authorize construction activity, excavation, encroachments and similar activities within or upon any rights-of-way or land to be dedicated to the city as rights-of-way, so as to protect the integrity of the rights-of-way and safety of the public. To achieve these purposes, it is necessary to require users or occupiers of the rights-of-way, to obtain permission from the city to locate such structures and/or facilities in rights-of-way and to require persons engaging in construction activity in or affecting the rights-of-way to obtain permission and meet requirements of and operate consistent with the requirements of this article. 
(b)  Objectives. The use of rights-of-way for location of structures and facilities employed in the provision of public utility services, cable services, information services, any type of communication services and/or telecommunication services will, in the interests of the general welfare, be accommodated; however, the city must ensure that the integrity of rights-of-way are adequately maintained for all purposes. In addition, the value of other pre-existing installations, roadways, structures, facilities and properties should be protected, competing uses must be reconciled, and the public safety preserved. This article is intended to strike a balance between the public need for efficient, safe transportation routes and the use and occupation of rights-of-way for location of structures and facilities by various entities for the provision of public services. The article thus has several objectives: 
(1)  To manage rights-of-way so that the public safety is maintained and that public inconvenience is minimized. 
(2)  To protect the city's infrastructure investment by establishing repair and maintenance standards for pavement, structures and facilities, and property in the rights-of-way, when work is undertaken in rights-of-way. 
(3)  To facilitate placement of structures and facilities and other construction activity work conducted within the rights-of-way or affecting land to be dedicated to the city as rights-of-way through the standardization of regulations. 
(4)  To establish efficient, effective and competitively neutral procedures for granting permission to users and occupiers of rights-of-way consistent with the evolving federal and state regulatory policies and thus promote competition for businesses supplying public services, including all types of utility services, telecommunication services, communication or information services, cable services and other technological development and advancements that utilize rights-of-way for the provision of services. 
(5)  To conserve and fairly apportion the limited physical capacity of the rights-of-way held in public trust by the city for its citizens. 
(6)  To promote cooperation and coordination among various users of the rights-of-way and the city and any work undertaken therein, in order to: 
a.  Eliminate duplication that is wasteful, unsightly, or destructive of public property or facilities; 
b.  Lower the user's and the city's costs of providing services to the public; and 
c.  Minimize street cuts or other types of construction directly or indirectly related to uses within the rights-of-way. 
(7)  To obtain fair and reasonable compensation for commercial use of rights-of-way, consistent with applicable law, so as to assure that the city can continue to fairly and responsibly protect the public health, safety, and welfare.

h.  Proposed hours for each day of the project; 
i.  A plan for storage of equipment and materials for the duration of the project; and 
j.  Itemization of the estimated total cost of the project including restoration costs anticipated to be needed for the project, as required to establish a performance bond, letter of credit, or other form of performance guaranty required to obtain a construction permit. 
k.  To the extent the information required in this subsection (a)(1) is for a person or entity which is also a franchisee, or the information required by this subsection (a)(1) is required to be regularly provided by another agreement or arrangement with the city, this subsection (a)(1), shall not apply. 
(2)  The applicant may be required to include evidence that all orders issued by the city to the applicant, requiring the applicant to correct deficiencies under previous permits issued under city ordinance have been satisfied and the applicant is in compliance with all city rules regarding rights-of-way. Failure to provide this information may result in the issuance of a permit being delayed or denied. 
(3)  Attach copies of all other permits or licenses (including required insurance, deposits, bonding, and warranties) required for the proposed project in the city including any required document or agreement evidencing permission to use the city's ROW, unless permission has already been granted by a franchise or other form of agreement, if licenses or permits are required under the laws of the United States, the state of Colorado, or the ordinances or regulations of the city. 
(4)  Include a statement indicating any proposed joint use or ownership of the facility, any existing facility or permit of the applicant at this location; any known existing facility of others with which the proposed installations might conflict; and the name, address and telephone number of a representative of the applicant available to review proposed locations at the site. 
(5)  Pay the construction permit fees prescribed by this article. Permittee may request the city allow the establishment of an escrow account to cover charges for permits, which request will not be unreasonably withheld. 
(6)  Applicants shall update any new information on construction permit applications within ten days after any material change occurs. 
(b)  Applications/ROW. 
(1)  Any person desiring to perform any work, within the city ROW, shall obtain from the city infrastructure department a ROW use agreement which shall, at minimum, meet the requirements of this article for issuance of a construction permit, and which shall be signed by the responsible party or agent thereof. 
(2)  Any person submitting any type of application for a construction permit, as provided by this article, shall concomitantly with such application meet all additional requirements for issuance of a construction permit as set forth in the city standards and specifications. Development projects that do not involve construction activity in or related to the ROW or public improvements shall be governed by the Development Code and the Standards and Specifications, as applicable. 
(c)  Joint applications. 
(1)  Applicants for a construction permit may apply jointly for such permit that is to occur at the same time and place. Applicants who apply jointly for construction permits may share in the payment of the permit fee. Provided however, each applicant shall be jointly and severally responsible for performance pursuant to any type of performance guaranty. Applicants must agree among themselves as to the portion each shall pay. The fee for individual and joint permits shall be the same for one application. 
(2)  Applicants who submit joint applications must each establish permission to place and use structures and facilities in the ROW. 
(d)  Construction permit fees. 
(1)  Amount of fee. Before a construction permit is issued pursuant to this article, a construction permit fee shall be paid, which shall be determined in accordance with a fee schedule adopted by resolution of the city council. Construction permit fees will be reasonably related to the costs inherent in managing the ROW or affecting any public improvements. These costs include, but are not necessarily limited to, administering the requirements of this article, the costs of permitting, verifying, and mapping ROW occupations and public improvement projects, inspecting job sites and ROW and public improvement restorations, and costs relating to the degradation of the ROW; i.e., the cost to achieve a level of restoration as determined by the city at the time the permit is issued to the extent authorized by law. 
(2)  Reduction in degradation costs. The portion of the construction permit fee relating to degradation costs shall be reduced in cases where the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the director that the excavation proposed will be used by three or more entities, legally and financially unrelated, for the installation, maintenance or repair of structures or facilities. The degradation cost portion of the construction permit fee shall be further reduced in cases where the applicant demonstrates to the satisfaction of the director that the excavation to be made will be commenced and completed during the 24-month period immediately prior to the scheduled repaving or resurfacing of a street, as indicated in the most recent edition of the city's repaving plan. There are no degradation costs for construction activity which excludes excavation and that does not involve material disturbance of public improvements in the right-of-way. 
(3)  Requirements for permits, applicable fees, deposits, or bonds herein described shall not apply to city departments performing any construction activity or public improvements within city-owned property, ROW, or public easements. 
(e)  Permit restrictions. 
(1)  Construction, excavation or work area. No construction activity, excavation, or work shall be performed in an area larger or at a location different, or for a longer period of time than specified in the construction permit. If, after a project is commenced under an approved construction permit, it becomes necessary to perform construction activity, excavation or work in a larger or different area than originally requested or for a longer period of time, the permittee shall notify the director immediately, and within 24 hours (excluding holidays and weekends) shall file a request for a supplementary construction permit for an expanded project, and the permittee shall be billed for the additional amount owed. 
(2)  Permit transferability or assignability. Any permittee may subcontract a project or portion thereof under a construction permit provided that the permittee shall be and remain responsible for the full performance under the construction permit and all insurance and financial security as required. Construction permits are transferable and assignable if the transferee or assignee posts all required security pursuant to this article and agrees to be bound by all requirements of the construction permit assigned or transferred. 
(3)  Developer ownership of public improvements. In the city, the physical construction of public improvements in new developments is the responsibility of the developer of the land. Ownership of the public improvements remains with the developer of the land until initial acceptance by the city. Any developer of land where the project includes construction of or affects existing public improvements that are within the ROW, but prior to acceptance by the city, shall obtain a construction permit pursuant to this article. The city will not initially accept public improvements, where such public improvements are not in accordance with applicable Standards and Specifications and applicable provisions of this article. 
(4)  Operating without a permit. Any person found to be conducting any construction activity, work, or excavation activity without having first obtained any type of construction permit or other required permit(s), except for service connections or service lateral connections for new or existing subscribers, and/or unless otherwise specified by the conditions set forth in Section 2-281 shall immediately cease all activity (exclusive of actions required to stabilize the area), and be required to obtain all applicable permits before the project may be restarted. An additional surcharge shall be required in addition to all applicable permit fees. The amount of the surcharge shall be set by resolution of the city council. Any entity with facilities in the ROW may undertake routine maintenance on existing facilities without obtaining written permission of the director if it meets the conditions set forth in Section 2-276(c). 
(5)  Time of completion. All activity covered by the construction permit shall be completed by the date stated on the construction permit application. Permits shall be void if activity has not commenced as required by the construction permit, unless an extension has been granted by the director. Performance bonds, letters of credit or letters of responsibility deposited as a performance/warranty guarantee for individual construction permits will be returned if voided, with administrative and any other city costs deducted. 
(6)  Public safety. The permittee shall maintain a safe environment for the project, free of safety hazards. The city may make any repairs necessary to eliminate any safety hazards not performed as directed after permittee has been given an opportunity, upon at least 24 hours written or verbal notice, to repair the hazard. Any such repairs performed by the city shall be completed and billed to the permittee at applicable rates. The permittee shall pay all such charges within 30 days of the statement date. If the permittee fails to pay such charges within the prescribed time period, the city may, in addition to taking other collection remedies, seek reimbursement through the warranty guarantee. Furthermore, the permittee may be barred from performing any further work and, under no circumstances will the city issue any further permits of any kind to said permittee, until all outstanding charges have been paid in full. 
(f)  Revocation of construction permits and stop work orders. 
(1)  Permit revocation or suspension. Any type of construction permit may be revoked or suspended by the director or designee or as prescribed by the Standards and Specifications, upon at least 24-hour written notice of the basis for the city's action and after the permittee has had a reasonable opportunity to cure, for: 
a.  Violation of any material condition of the construction permit or of any provision of this article or any violation of the Standards and Specifications; 
b.  Violation of any provision of any other ordinance, rule, or regulation of the city or state law relating to the activity or project authorized by the construction permit; and 
c.  The existence of any condition or the performance of any act which the city determines constitutes or causes a condition that may endanger persons or may constitute a threat of damage to the public health or property. 
(2)  Stop work orders. A stop work order is hereby authorized to be issued by the director and/or as prescribed by the Standards and Specifications to any permittee under circumstances set forth in this subsection: 
a.  Criteria for issuance of stop work orders are: 
1.  Operations without a permit, except for routine maintenance or emergency repairs to existing structures or facilities as provided for in this article. 
2.  Operating in violation of any provision or requirement of this section, or any other ordinance, rule or regulation of the city, or state law relating to the activity authorized by the construction permit, after having been given a reasonable opportunity to cure the violation; and 
3.  Performing any act, which city determines constitutes or causes a condition that endangers either life or property. 
b.  Effective immediately. Stop work orders issued by the director shall take effect immediately upon written notice to the permittee by mail and upon service of the stop work order to any person employed by or under contract with the permittee at the job site, for issuance by mail the permittee's last known address is sufficient. Upon receipt of the stop work order, all activity is to cease except for those activities that are necessary to make the work area safe, or to end the disruption to traffic, or to protect people or property and upon request of the permittee, if approved by the director. Provided however, the permittee may continue to work so long as such work is in an effort to immediately cure the violation or conditions that caused the stop work order. If the condition that precipitated the stop work order is cured to the satisfaction of the city, the stop work order will be immediately lifted. 
c.  Appealing a suspension, revocation, or stop work order. Any suspension or revocation or stop work order may be appealed by the permittee to the city building code advisory board by filing a written notice of appeal within 30 days of the action. 
(3)  Performance bond/letter of credit. 
a.  Performance guaranty. 
1.  No construction permit shall be issued for excavation, construction activity, or work within the city ROW until the applicant therefore shall first deposit, unless otherwise agreed upon between the city and the permittee by agreement or contract, with the city a cash escrow or letter of credit acceptable to the city in an amount determined by the city engineer utilizing the cost data manual as published by the state department of transportation, latest revision or other generally accepted engineering methodology to establish estimated costs, to be sufficient to cover the entire value of the project as specified under the conditions of the ROW construction permit. 
2.  No construction permit shall be issued for construction activity, excavation or work activity within the city in connection with a commercial or residential development project unless the applicant shall first deposit, unless otherwise agreed upon between the city and the permittee by agreement or contract, with the city a cash escrow or other form of performance guaranty acceptable to the city in an amount determined by the development engineering manager utilizing the cost data manual as published by the state department of transportation, latest revision, or other generally accepted engineering methodology to establish estimated costs to be sufficient to cover the entire expense of replacing any materials removed or damaged during construction as specified under the conditions of the site construction permit. 
3.  The performance guaranty provided for in either subsection 1. or 2. of this section shall be conditioned upon the permittee's faithful performance of the duties prescribed in this section, all provisions of city ordinances, rules and regulations, and upon payment of all judgments and costs rendered against the applicant for any material violation of city ordinances or state statutes that may be recovered against the applicant by any person for damages arising out of any negligent or wrongful acts of the applicant in the performance of activity authorized by the construction permit. If the performance guaranty is in the form of a performance bond, the city may bring an action on the performance bond or letter of credit on its own behalf or on behalf of any person so aggrieved as beneficiary. The performance bond or letter of credit must be approved by the city as to form and as to the responsibility of the surety thereon prior to the issuance of the construction permit. 
4.  If the security deposited with the permit application is at any time deemed to be insufficient, the permittee shall, within ten days after receiving notice of such deficiency from the city, deposit with the city such additional security as the city engineer or development engineering manager considers necessary to correct the deficiency. Failure to deposit such funds within the prescribed time allotted shall result in the revocation of any applicable permits until at such time as all security deposit conditions have been satisfied. 
5.  The city shall refund to the permittee 85 percent of any applicable deposits or guarantees within 60 days of the initial acceptance of any construction activity, with the exception of any such activity relating to a specific street cut into an existing street, in which case 100 percent of any applicable deposit or guaranty shall be retained until the final acceptance, as defined in this chapter. 
6.  Any remaining deposit or type of performance guaranty which has not been refunded by the city, as specified in subsection 3. of this section, shall be held in escrow until at such time as the conditions of any warranty periods have been satisfied. The development engineering manager shall then cause the remainder of any such deposit or other form of guaranty to be released. In the event the permittee fails to perform any replacement/repair work within 60 days following written notification of work deficiencies, the director shall utilize the proceeds of the deposit or other guaranty to cause the replacement/repair work to be completed. 
7.  Any deposit, escrow, or other means of performance guaranty which has been retained by the city until the satisfactory completion of the final acceptance or warranty period which has been deemed refundable to the permittee, shall be returned within 60 days following the end of the one-year warranty period. In the event that such funds remain unclaimed, provisions pursuant to Article II of Chapter 26 shall apply, unless as otherwise stated in this chapter. 
b.  Letter of responsibility. A letter of responsibility in a form acceptable to the city, which may include a letter of credit, will be accepted in lieu of a performance guaranty from all public utilities, all franchised entities or telecommunications service providers owning and operating facilities in the ROW within the city. 
(g)  Inspections of activity authorized by construction permits. The city shall have the right to make inspections at any time, to reject any work or materials which are defective or do not materially conform to the requirements of this Code, the approved plans, or Standards and Specifications. 
(1)  Upon review of the application for a construction permit, the director shall determine how many inspections, if any, may be required. For most construction permits, the inspection procedure will entail the following: 
a.  The city may conduct a pre-construction inspection, to determine any necessary conditions for the construction permit; however, issuance of a construction permit is not conditioned upon a pre-construction inspection. 
b.  The permittee shall notify the city before the project begins and the city shall conduct periodic inspections as operations are completed. 
c.  The city shall inspect the completed project within 21 days of the city's receipt of the permittee's written and dated request for initial acceptance. Initial acceptance will be given if activity authorized meets city and construction permit standards. 
d.  Approximately 30 days prior to the expiration of the two-year guaranty, the city shall conduct a final acceptance inspection of the completed work. If the work is still satisfactory the bond or letter of credit shall be returned or allowed to expire, with a letter of final acceptance, less any amounts needed to complete specified activity not completed by permittee. 
(2)  For any activity that does not involve material disturbance in the ROW, the director may waive the final acceptance inspection and any type of performance guaranty. 
(h)  Traffic control. 
(1)  Traffic control plan. When it is necessary to obstruct traffic, a traffic control plan shall be submitted to the city prior to starting any installation, repair, construction or excavation, except as provided in applicable provisions of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices or any successor publication thereto shall be used as a guide for all maintenance and construction signing. The permittee shall illustrate on the construction permit the warning and control devices proposed for use. At the direction of the director, such warning and control devices shall be modified. No construction permit will be issued until the plan is approved by the city which approval shall not be unreasonably withheld or denied. The permittee shall use extra care so as to minimize disruption to adjacent property and drives and to provide access to parking areas during the project. If access to private property must be blocked, then the permittee shall develop an access maintenance plan in coordination with and based on all reasonable requirements of the affected property owners and tenants, and submit it to the city. No permittee shall block access to and from side streets, alleys, maintenance roads, walkways, driveways, sidewalks, bike paths, fire hydrants, fire stations, fire escapes, mail boxes, dumpsters, parked vehicles, water valves, underground vaults, valve housing structures, or any other vital equipment unless the permittee demonstrates to the city that he/she has worked with the owner or occupant of the facility to minimize potential impacts. 
(2)  Street closures. If a street closing is desired, the permittee will request the assistance and obtain the approval of the city. It shall be the responsibility of the permittee to develop a detour and signing plan, provide advance warning signs to advise drivers of the street closure and deliver notices to the affected properties a minimum of 48 hours prior to any street closure. The city may also require and the permittee shall agree to attend a public hearing regarding the street closure. It shall be the responsibility of the permittee to notify and coordinate all activity in the public way with police, fire, ambulance, other governmental entities, and transit organizations. 
(3)  Flag persons. When necessary for public safety, the permittee shall employ flag persons whose duties shall be to control traffic around or through the construction site. The use of flag persons may be required by the director. 
(4)  Acceptable hours of construction. Hours for all construction activity shall be performed in compliance with the traffic control permit for the flow of traffic on local, arterial or collector streets upon applicable conditions and restrictions. No construction activity shall be performed in the public way that involves activities that generate noise levels that constitute a public nuisance as defined in the noise control provisions of Section 38-441 without the approval of the director unless otherwise authorized by the city. 
(5)  Traffic control devices. Effective work area traffic control must be provided for all street installation, repair, construction, excavation and maintenance in order to provide for the safety of the workers, vehicular users, and pedestrians. The type of traffic control should be selected based upon the type of roadway, traffic conditions, duration of operation, physical constraints, and the proximity of the activity to traffic. All traffic control devices and advance warning signs used shall conform to the applicable specifications in Part VI of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices. Traffic control devices are to be supplied by the permittee. If used at night, they must be reflectorized and must be illuminated or have barricade warning lights. 
(6)  Prohibited methods of illumination. Oil flares or kerosene lanterns are not allowed as means of illumination. Nighttime work area flood lighting shall not be allowed to spill out of the construction area in such a way as to disturb, annoy, or endanger the comfort, health or peace of others. 
(7)  Maintenance and construction signing. The contractor shall be responsible for maintaining all area signing and barricading during construction operations as well as any signs and barricades that are needed to protect roadway users and pedestrians during non-work hours. During non-work hours, all construction area signs that are not appropriate shall be removed, covered, or turned around so that they do not face traffic. Any deficiencies noted by the city shall be corrected immediately by the contractor. If contractor is not available or cannot be found, the city may make such corrections and the contractor shall pay the actual costs plus a penalty of 50 percent of the amount thereof. 
(8)  Traffic control costs and responsibilities. All costs related to developing a project area traffic control plan, and implementing the traffic control plan, as well as maintaining the traffic control elements are the responsibility of the permittee.

b.  Any applicant for a franchise shall, before any construction is undertaken pursuant to a grant of a franchise, secure a construction permit pursuant to Section 2-272, as applicable. 
c.  In making any determination whether to approve the granting of a franchise, and to the extent permitted by applicable federal or state law, the city council may give due consideration to the broad categories of the services proposed; experience, character, background, and financial responsibility of any applicant, and its management and owners; technical and performance quality of equipment; customer service; willingness and ability to meet construction and physical requirements, and to abide by this article's limitations and requirements. 
(2)  Following a public hearing on any request for a franchise, the city council may award a franchise, and approve a franchise agreement which embodies the grant of a franchise, by ordinance. 
(3)  Contemporaneously with the city council's consideration of a request for a franchise, a franchise agreement will also be considered for approval, which agreement shall have been prepared and provided to the applicant for negotiation when an application is accepted. Such franchise agreement shall include provisions to address the following: 
a.  That the franchisee shall maintain its systems to meet the highest practicable level of quality and reliability, making repairs promptly and interrupting service only for good cause. Good cause shall mean when service interruptions are caused by the following circumstances: fire, flood, earthquakes, tornadoes, landslides, strikes, war, orders of military authority, or riots. Planned interruptions shall be preceded by timely notice given to customers and the city, except for cases of emergency outage repair. 
b.  That the franchisee shall operate and maintain its system in full compliance with applicable standards set forth by the appropriate jurisdictional regulator, such as the state public utilities commission, the Federal Communications Commission, or the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. 
c.  That except as otherwise specifically agreed or as required by the PUC, as applicable, the franchisee shall provide service, at the earliest practicable time, to any areas of the city where the boundaries are expanded by the city into the franchise service area during the term of the franchise agreement. 
d.  That to the extent such provisions may be required pursuant to applicable state or federal law, the franchisee shall provide the city with notice of any decision or any regulatory proposal to change its rates to customers for the services provided in the city, including where the filing for the rate change was made and the basis for the proposed rate change with supporting data.

(c)  Franchise restrictions. 
(1)  No franchise granted under this article shall become effective for any purpose unless and until the franchisee has filed written acceptance thereof with the city clerk. Written acceptance, which shall be in the form approved by the city attorney, shall also be and operate as an acceptance of each and every term and condition and limitation contained in this article and in the franchise agreement. 
(2)  In no event shall a franchise agreement be sold, transferred, subleased, assigned or disposed of, in whole or in part, either by forced or involuntary sale, or by voluntary sale, merger, consolidation, change in control by stock exchange, or otherwise, other than to a person controlling, controlled by or under common control with the franchisee, without proper consent of the city council and under such conditions as may be prescribed within such franchise agreement.

(3)  Each franchise agreement shall provide for a procedure for the city to make written demand that the franchisee comply with such requirement, limitation, term, condition, rule or regulation of this article. 
(4)  By adoption of the ordinance as contemplated by this article regarding approval of a franchise agreement pursuant to this article, the city assumes no liability whatsoever for any claims, damages, or causes of action whatsoever which may arise from the city's approval of any such franchise agreements. 
(e)  Additional requirements. The requirements of this section shall be required for a franchise agreement to be approved by the city in addition to all other applicable requirements of this article, as applicable. Nothing herein shall be construed to preclude the city from approving by ordinance a franchise agreement that exceeds the requirements of this article. 
(f)  Renewal. The application provision of this section shall not apply to renewal proceedings for a franchise providing cable services in existence at the time this article takes effect only to the extent the franchisee is renewing the franchise agreement for cable services in accordance with 47 U.S.C. § 521 et seq.

(Ord. No. 2804, § 1, 10-28-03; Ord. No. 3257, § 4, 8-27-13) 
Sec. 2-274. - Use of ROW-General provisions. 
(a)  ROW meetings. All persons granted a franchise or who have been issued any type of construction permit shall make reasonable efforts to attend and participate in meetings of the city, upon reasonable notice, regarding ROW issues that may impact facilities, or structures in the ROW. 
(b)  Minimal interference. The director shall have the authority to assign locations of new facilities and structures in the ROW for reasons related to public health, safety and welfare. Such authority shall include requiring alternative locations for such structures and facilities when space restrictions are evident or for any reason that involves public health or welfare, rather than the preferred locations proposed by persons wishing to use and/or occupy the ROW. All work in the ROW or near public or private property shall be done in a manner that causes the least interference with the rights and reasonable convenience of property owners and residents. All facilities and structures shall be constructed and maintained in such manner as not to interfere with sewers, water pipes, or any other property of the city, or with any other pipes, wires, conduits, pedestals, structures, or other facilities that may have been laid in the ROW by, or under, the city's authority. All public improvements wherein facilities and structures are installed shall be in accordance with applicable city Standards and Specifications. Ten feet minimum horizontal clearance and 18-inch minimum vertical clearance shall be provided between facilities and water and sewer mains. If the minimum horizontal and vertical clearances are not adhered to then the permittee assumes all risk of damage and loss arising out of failure to comply with required clearances. Facilities and structures shall be located, erected and maintained so as not to endanger or interfere with the lives of persons, or to interfere with planned improvements of the City, or to unnecessarily hinder or obstruct the free use of the ROW or other public property, and shall not unreasonably interfere with travel by the public and the use of public places during the construction, maintenance and repair, operation or removal thereof. 
(c)  Underground construction, use of poles. 
(1)  Unless otherwise provided herein, when required by general ordinances, resolutions, regulations or rules of the city or applicable state or federal law and unless otherwise prohibited by law, facilities shall be placed underground at no cost to the city. Where facilities are installed underground at the time of construction, or when all such facilities are subsequently placed underground, all facilities shall also be placed underground at no expense to the city unless funding is generally available for any such relocation to all users of the ROW. Placing facilities underground does not preclude the use of ground-mounted appurtenances; however, related equipment or structures, such as pedestals, must be placed in accordance with the city's applicable rules, Standards and Specifications, and code requirements. For purposes of this section, appurtenances shall mean transformers, switching boxes, gas regulator stations, terminal boxes, meter cabinets, pedestals, ducts, substations, system amplifiers, power supplies, optical nodes, pump stations, valves and valve housings, and other devices necessary to the function of underground electric, communications, cable television wiring, coaxial, fiber optic, water, sewer, natural gas, other utility lines, and street lighting circuits. 
(2)  In areas where existing facilities are aerial, unless otherwise required by the Development Code, aerial facilities may be installed. For above-ground facilities, existing poles should be utilized wherever possible, although attachment to ornamental poles is prohibited. 
(d)  Shared use by city. 
(1)  Any provider granted permission to construct in, or place in and use facilities or structures in and thereby occupy the ROW shall allow the city to place its facilities in the trenches and bores for city purposes, provided the city gives notice of its intent to share trenches and boring before such trenching and boring begins and city agrees to pay any additional costs. Should the city desire to install ducts or conduit for placement of its facilities, then the permittee shall allow the city to place these facilities in the permittee's trenches and bores, for any city purpose, provided the city shares proportionally in the cost of trenching and boring. The city shall be responsible for maintaining its respective facilities buried in the permittee's trenches and bores under this paragraph. Joint trench or share bores or cuts shall be required in all instances where applicable and coordinated construction scheduling is required whenever it is possible and reasonably practicable so as to reduce so far as possible the number of ROW cuts within the city and the amount of time that pedestrian and vehicular traffic is obstructed or impeded. The city is solely responsible for obtaining any additional permits that may be needed in advance. If the city fails to obtain other applicable necessary permits in a timely manner, permittee has no obligations under this subsection. city shall be responsible for all damages related to its use of the right-of-way. 
(2)  The city may install or affix and maintain its own facilities for city purposes in or upon any and all of the ducts, conduits or equipment or other facilities in the ROW, at a charge to be negotiated between the parties, to the extent space therein or thereon is reasonably available, and pursuant to all applicable city ordinances or requirements so long as the city purposes are not in competition with permittee when using permittee's ducts, conduits or equipment. For the purposes of this subsection, "city purposes" includes, but is not limited to, the use of the structures and installations for city fire, police, traffic, water, telephone, and/or signal systems. 
(3)  Common users. 
a.  The ROW has a finite capacity for containing facilities or structures. Therefore, whenever the city determines it is impracticable to permit construction of an underground conduit system by any other entity which may at the time have authority to construct or maintain conduits or ducts in the ROW, but excluding entities providing services in competition with other entities, and unless otherwise prohibited by federal or state law or regulations, the city may require any provider to afford to such entity the right to use surplus ducts or conduits in common with other entities provided space is available, pursuant to the terms and conditions of an agreement for use of surplus ducts or conduits entered into and between other entities. Nothing herein shall require such an agreement if, upon reasonable determination, such an agreement could compromise the integrity of entity's facilities. 
b.  Any provider granted permission to construct in, or place in and use facilities or structures in and thereby occupy the ROW shall give a common user, pursuant to this section, a minimum of 120 days notice of its need to occupy a conduit and shall propose that the common user take the first feasible action as follows: 
1.  Pay revised conduit rent designed to recover the cost of retrofitting the conduit with space-saving technology sufficient to meet the current occupier's space needs; 
2.  Pay revised conduit rent based on the cost of new conduit constructed to meet current occupier's space needs; 
3.  Vacate the needed ducts or conduit; or 
4.  Construct and maintain sufficient new conduit to meet current occupier's space needs. 
c.  When two or more common users occupy a section of conduit facility, the last user to occupy the conduit facility shall be the first to vacate or construct new conduit. When conduit rent is revised because of retrofitting, space-saving technology or construction of new conduit, all common users shall bear the increased cost. 
(e)  Requirements. All structures and facilities in the ROW shall meet any applicable local, state, and federal clearance and other safety requirements including the city's Standards and Specifications, be adequately grounded and anchored, and meet the provisions of contracts executed between the current occupier and the other common users. A current occupier may, at its option, correct any attachment deficiencies and charge the common user for its costs. Each common provider shall pay for any fines, fees, damages or other costs directly related to the common provider's attachments.

Sec. 2-275. - Coordination of excavations: Joint planning and construction. 
(a)  Reduction of disruption and interference. Excavations in city ROW disrupt and interfere with the public use of city streets and damage the pavement and landscaping. The purpose of this section is to reduce this disruption, interference and damage by promoting better coordination among all entities making excavations in city ROW and the city. Better coordination will assist in minimizing the number of excavations being made wherever feasible, and will ensure the excavations in city ROW are, to the maximum extent possible, performed before, rather than after, the resurfacing of the streets by the city. 
(b)  Excavation master plan. Any provider owning, operating or installing facilities or structures that wish to place facilities in or occupy the ROW, by providing water, sewer, gas, electric, cable, video or other utility, or informational or wireless communication services, shall meet annually with the director, at the city manager's or designee's request to discuss the provider's excavation master plan. At such meeting, to the extent not already in possession of the city, provider shall submit documentation, in a form required by the director including as built drawings, digital and software compatible GIS formats, showing all locations of the provider's existing facilities in the city ROW. Provider shall discuss with the director, its excavation master plan, and identify planned major excavation work in the city known at that time. The director may make his own record on a map, drawing or other documentation, of each provider's planned major excavation work in the city; provided, however, that no such document prepared by the director shall identify a particular entity, or the planned major excavation work of that particular entity. The provider shall meet with the director to discuss an initial excavation master plan no later than 60 days after submitting a construction permit application. Thereafter, each provider shall submit annually, on the first regular business day of January, a revised and updated excavation master plan. As used in this subsection, the term "planned major excavation work" refers to any future excavations planned by the provider when the excavation master plan or update is submitted that will affect any city ROW for more than five days at any given location, provided that the provider shall not be required to identify future major excavations planned to occur more than two years after the date that the provider's master plan or update is discussed. Between the annual meetings to discuss planned major excavation work, provider shall use its best efforts to inform the director of any substantial changes in the planned major excavation work discussed at the annual meeting. 
(c)  Repaving plan. The director shall prepare a repaving plan showing the street resurfacing planned by the city. For purposes of this section, the repaving plan shall include a landscaping or other ROW improvement plan. The repaving plan shall be revised and updated on an annual basis after meeting to discuss the provider's and the city's master plans and updates. The director shall make the city's repaving plan available for public inspection. In addition, after determining the street resurfacing work that is proposed for each year, the director shall send a notice of the proposed work to all providers that have had an annual meeting with the director. 
(d)  Coordination with repaving plan. Prior to applying for a construction permit, any permittee planning to excavate in the city's ROW shall review the city's repaving plan on file with the director and shall coordinate, to the extent practicable, with the utility and street work shown on such plans to minimize damage to, and avoid undue disruption and interference with the public use of such ROW. 
(e)  Locating facilities. In performing locates of facilities in the ROW in preparation for construction, a provider shall compile all information obtained regarding its or any other facilities in the ROW related to a particular permit to the best of permittee's knowledge, and shall make that information available to the city in a written and verified format pursuant to written city policy. 
(f)  Documentation of location of provider's facilities. Prior to undertaking any work in the ROW the city may notify all providers of a city project involving work to be performed in the ROW. Upon such notification, all users or their designated locate service providers shall, within seven days, locate their facilities in the ROW in which the work will be performed, and provide documentation in a format pursuant to written city policy of the provider's facilities in that ROW. If the provider fails to provide the locate information requested by the city, the city may obtain this information and charge the provider the actual costs for obtaining the information.

(Ord. No. 3407, § 1, 9-27-16) 
Sec. 6-9. - Impoundment of animals at large. 
(a)  Impoundment. Any animal found running at large may be taken up by any person or by an animal control officer and impounded at the animal shelter by such person or officer. As soon as practicable after impoundment, a bona fide effort shall be made to give notice of impoundment to the owner. If, after a bona fide effort to locate the owner, he or she cannot be identified and the animal is not claimed within five days, the animal shelter may dispose of the animal. If the owner is identified and the impounded animal is not claimed by its owner within five days, the animal may be disposed of by sale, adoption, donation, or destruction at the sole discretion of the animal shelter. 
(b)  Claiming impounded animals. Any animal impounded pursuant to this section shall be released to the owner upon payment of the impound fee, boarding fee, veterinary care charges, and any other costs associated with the impoundment.

Sec. 6-10. - Impoundment of animals habitually at large. 
    Any animal found running at large on three or more occasions in any 12-month period shall be impounded by an animal control officer or police officer at the animal shelter.

Any such animal shall be held until a fact-finding dispositional hearing ("dispositional hearing") can be held in municipal court to determine its proper disposition. This dispositional hearing can take place notwithstanding any court action against any person who has been charged with a violation of Section 6-7(b), and any statement made by any person at such a dispositional hearing shall not be used as evidence in the prosecution's case-in-chief in any trial procedure. 
(Ord. No. 3407, § 1, 9-27-16) 
Sec. 6-11. - Fact-finding dispositional hearing for animals habitually at large. 
    When any animal has been impounded pursuant to Section 6-7(b), the owner shall be entitled to a fact-finding dispositional hearing ("dispositional hearing") within ten days of such impoundment. The owner of the animal shall be given written notice by the police department, animal control officer, or the court, if the owner is known. Such notice may be personally served upon the owner of the animal, or sent via a certificate of mailing, at least 72 hours before said hearing. The dispositional hearing shall be conducted as an administrative hearing, and the formal rules of evidence shall not apply. However, such rules of evidence may be used as a guide for the introduction of evidence. The court shall allow the parties to present evidence, witnesses, and have the right to cross-examination. Any and all documentary evidence and other data deemed relevant by the municipal judge shall be received in evidence. The owner shall have all rights possessed by defendants in judicial proceedings, including the right to be represented by counsel, and the right to compel attendance of witnesses. At the dispositional hearing, the court shall determine whether or not the owner has proven, by preponderance of the evidence, that the owner has put in place sufficient confinement measures, which secure the animal to avoid future at large violations. The court shall have the power to determine that the animal be further confined and to order that the owner take specific steps to prevent the animal from running at large. The court may order that any confinement or security measures be inspected by animal control. Upon a showing of proof of sufficient confinement measures, which secure the animal to avoid future at large violations, the court shall order the animal released to the owner upon the payment of the impound fee, boarding fee, veterinary care charges, and any other costs associated with the impoundment. The owner shall bear the costs of impounding the animal regardless of the results of any municipal charges.

Sec. 6-14. - Quarantine of animals. 
(a)  An animal which is known to have bitten any person, or any animal which, in the opinion of a member of the police department, an animal control officer, or of any licensed veterinarian of the state, is exhibiting signs or symptoms consistent with rabies shall be closely confined by its owner in accordance with the directions of a member of the police department or an animal control officer or shall be impounded by animal control, at the election of the police department or an animal control officer, for a period of not less than ten days. It is unlawful for any person to knowingly dispose of an animal that has bitten someone, without the approval of an animal control officer or the police department. No person shall fail to prevent such animal from being closely confined in accordance with the directions of the police department or an animal control officer. 
(b)  It shall be unlawful for any owner of an animal subject to examination and quarantine under this section to fail to produce the animal, on demand of any animal control officer or police officer, for examination and quarantine. If the owner of any such animal refuses to produce the animal, the owner shall be subject to immediate arrest if there shall be probable cause to believe that the animal has bitten any person and that the owner is keeping or harboring the animal upon such a demand, and the owner may be charged with a violation of this section by failing to produce such an animal. If the owner of any such animal shall willfully or knowingly secrete or refuse to produce such animal, such act shall constitute a separate and individual violation of this section. 
(c)  If the owner of a quarantined animal is not determined or located, the police department or an animal control officer may order the animal to be destroyed; if, however, the owner of a quarantined animal is located, the owner shall be responsible to the city for all costs incurred for the confinement and treatment of the animal under this section. 
(d)  If the animal is inoculated for rabies during the ten-day quarantine, an additional ten days of quarantine is required. Total quarantine, if so inoculated, shall be 20 days, or as dictated in the most recent version of the Colorado Rabies Compendium.

Regardless of when any work authorized by a building permit has started or without regard to any inspection of work, a building permit shall expire one year from the date of issuance. No refund of the building permit fee shall be issued for expired building permits. Before work may be commenced or resumed for work authorized by an expired building permit, a new building permit fee shall be paid in an amount as established by the schedule of fees adopted by resolution, provided that no changes have been made in the original drawings and specifications for such work.

Sec. 10-62. - Valuation of structures for building permit purposes; fees. 
(a)  Fee established. For purposes of this section, a building permit fee shall be established based upon valuation. The determination of value or valuation under any of the provisions of this Building Code shall be based upon the reproduction cost new, without depreciation and without regard to any loss occasioned from fire or other causes. The valuation of buildings or structures and each of the utilities shall be made independently. 
(b)  Determination of value. 
(1)  The final determination of value or valuation under any of the provisions of this Building Code for all building permits shall be made by the building official. The valuation to be used in computing the building permit fees shall be the total value of all labor, materials and equipment that constitute the work for which the permit is issued, including but not limited to, roofing, electrical, plumbing, heating, air conditioning, elevators, fire-extinguishing systems and any other installation of permanent equipment. 
(2)  The minimum valuation for new commercial, commercial remodel, commercial addition, new residential, and residential addition permits is calculated on the project's gross floor area (square feet) multiplied by the applicable cost per square foot from the "Building Valuation Data" table published by the International Code Council and established by the building official. For the purposes of this section total replacement shall be considered new construction and is defined as more than 50 percent of replacement of the building or structure, based on the estimated current replacement cost to replace the building or structure in kind. 
(3)  The minimum valuation for plumbing, electric and mechanical permits shall be the signed contract amount with the general contractor.

(c)  Building permit fees. Fees for building permits are hereby imposed based upon valuation, as set forth herein, and as set forth in the schedule of fees adopted by resolution. Fees for supplementary building permits to cover additional valuation not included in the original building permit are hereby imposed in an amount as established and set forth in the schedule of fees adopted by resolution. All fees established or imposed herein must be paid to the city prior to issuance of the permit. 
(d)  Plan review fees. When submittal of documents are required by section 10-63, a plan review fee shall be imposed in the amount of 65 percent of the building permit fee, as set forth in the schedule of fees adopted by resolution. The plan review fee may be required to be paid at the time plans are submitted, as determined by the building official, otherwise the plan review fee will be paid when a building permit is issued. If a building permit is not issued the plan review fees are due and payable upon expiration of the plan review and application. 
(1)  Plan review fees specified in this section are in addition to the building permit fees specified in Section 10-62(c). 
(2)  When submittal documents are incomplete or change so as to require additional plan review or when the project involves deferred submittal items as defined by this Building Code, an additional plan review fee shall be imposed in an amount as established in the schedule of fees adopted by resolution.

The government of the United States, the state and its political subdivisions and the city and all agencies and departments thereto shall be exempt from the payment of fees for work performed on buildings, structures or utilities owned wholly by such agencies or departments and devoted exclusively to governmental use. 
(f)  Additional fees. The fee for a supplementary building permit to cover any additional valuation not included in the original building permit shall be the difference between the fee originally paid and the fee which would have been required had the original building permit included the entire valuation. 
(g)  Investigation fees: Work without a building permit. 
(1)  Whenever it is discovered that any work for which a building permit is required by this Building Code has been commenced without first having obtained a building permit, a special investigation is hereby imposed before a building permit may be issued for such work. 
(2)  The investigative fee, is in addition to the building permit fee, and shall be imposed whether or not a building permit is issued. The investigation fee shall be paid upon completion of the investigation. The investigation fee shall be equal to the amount of the building permit fee as determined and set forth in the schedule of fees adopted by resolution.

The assessment may be paid any time prior to the assessment being turned over to the County Treasurer. Payments must be made directly to the City's Finance Director.

The Building Official shall carry the burden of establishing that a violation existed and that costs for abatement represented in the special assessment were reasonable under the facts and circumstances of the particular case.

This decision will be reached after both the landowner and the Building Official have presented their cases. The decision will be deemed effective three days from the date the decision is mailed to the owner/lessee and will be a final decision.

Such order shall be final and conclusive. 
(c)  Out of presence of court. When it appears to the municipal court, by motion supported by affidavit, that a contempt has been committed out of the presence of the municipal court, it may ex parte order a citation to issue to the person so charged to appear and show cause at a time designated why such person should not be punished therefor. If such person fails to appear at the time so designated or if the municipal court so orders when the citation is issued or thereafter, a warrant for the arrest of such person may issue to a duly authorized law enforcement officer. The municipal court shall direct, by endorsement thereon, the amount of the bail required, and such person shall be discharged upon delivery to and approval by a duly authorized law enforcement officer or clerk of a written undertaking executed by two or more sufficient sureties or a corporate surety company, to the effect that such person will appear before the municipal court upon the date ordered by such court and at any time thereafter to which the hearing may be continued or pay the sum specified. If such person fails to appear at the time designated or at any time to which the hearing may be continued, the undertaking may be forfeited, and the amount thereof, to the extent of the damages suffered by the contempt, shall be paid to the aggrieved party. If the person so charged fails to make bond, a duly authorized law enforcement officer shall keep such person in custody subject to the order of the court. 
(d)  Trial and punishment .

A fine may be imposed not exceeding the damages suffered by the contempt, plus costs of the contempt proceeding, plus reasonable attorney's fees in connection with the contempt proceeding, payable to the person damaged. If the contempt consists of the failure to perform an act in the power of the person to perform, such person may be imprisoned until its performance. In addition thereto, to vindicate the dignity of the court, if the citation so states, a fine or imprisonment may be imposed. If any such fine is not paid, the court may order the contemner imprisoned until payment thereof. The maximum fine that may be assessed for contempt of court shall be the maximum fine authorized by Section 1-8, plus costs and fees, and the maximum period of imprisonment one year. A child found in contempt of the municipal court and sentenced to imprisonment therefor shall be confined in a jail, lockup or other place in accordance with the provisions of C.R.S. § 42-4-1504.5.

ARTICLE III. - ALTERNATIVE SENTENCING PROGRAM[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Cross reference- General penalty for ordinance violations, § 1-8. 

Sec. 14-91. - Title. 
    This article shall be titled and known as the Thornton Alternative Sentencing Program Ordinance. 
(Code 1975, § 5B-1; Ord. No. 1284, 12-12-83) 
Sec. 14-92. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this article is to bring together certain needs in the community for the performance of what are essentially public service tasks with that group of people who are about to be sentenced following conviction in the municipal court. The purpose is further to permit the community to gain a benefit, to permit a convicted person to pay such person's debt in a meaningful way and to foster a heightened sense of appreciation for the skills of our citizens and the services provided by our local city government. 
(Code 1975, § 5B-2; Ord. No. 1284, 12-12-83) 
Sec. 14-93. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Alternative sentencing administrator means that person designated by the presiding judge of the municipal court, and whose duties and responsibilities shall include assigning the specific task or piece of work to the convicted person. The duties of the alternative sentencing administrator shall also include making a determination concerning whether the alternative sentencing project has been completed satisfactorily in the case of each individual volunteer. This person shall also oversee the program generally and shall be responsible for keeping any necessary records. The alternative sentencing administrator shall provide to the presiding judge monthly such statistical information as requested by the presiding judge, including: 
(1)  The number of people then involved in the alternative sentencing program. 
(2)  The number of people who have completed the program within the previous month. 
(3)  Information concerning any injuries to a person or damage to property which occurred as a result of activities by a person participating in the alternative sentencing program. 
    Alternative sentencing program means that program pursuant to which convicted applicants may be allowed to perform a variety of community service tasks in order to satisfy an obligation to the municipal court, which obligation could otherwise consist of a jail term and/or monetary fine. The amount of time required to be spent in service in such program shall be determined by the sentencing judge, who may rely on advice from the alternative sentencing coordinator. 
    Convicted applicant means any person who, having become a convicted person, then states such person's desire to the court to participate in the alternative sentencing program. Although any person shall have a right to become a convicted applicant, only those persons accepted by the sentencing judge shall be permitted to participate in the program. 
    Convicted person means any person who has been found guilty of the commission of an offense in the municipal court, whether on a plea of guilty, not guilty or nolo contendere and whether a trial to a judge or jury was held or not. The procedure by which the determination of guilt is reached shall not affect a person's eligibility for participation in the program. 
(Code 1975, § 5B-3; Ord. No. 1284, 12-12-83) 
Cross reference- Definitions generally, § 1-2. 
Sec. 14-94. - Intent. 
(a)  The intent of the alternative sentencing program shall consist of two complimentary goals. The first goal is to provide an alternative method for satisfying the requirements of jail sentences and monetary fines imposed following conviction in the municipal court. The second goal is to provide a properly motivated labor pool consisting of various skills and available to serve various identifiable needs of the community at no direct costs to the beneficiaries. 
(b)  This program is not intended for everyone. In the case of many of those convicted of so-called minor traffic offenses, the administrative costs of placing a person in the program will not justify allowing participation. From the viewpoint of the convicted applicant, participation in the program may require additional trips to the civic center in order to be screened and placed. The time spent in this administrative coordination shall not be credited against the amount of time required to be served in the program. Also, the subjective factor involving the attitude of the convicted applicant is to be considered in light of what is stated by the city council to be the underlying caution in this program: that no person be injured in any manner and that no property suffer any negligent or intentional damage as a result of an act or omission by a program participant. The accident-free completion of meaningful projects shall serve as an indicator of the need to expand upon or cut back the number of persons permitted to serve in this program. 
(Code 1975, § 5B-4; Ord. No. 1284, 12-12-83; Ord. No. 1580, 7-28-86) 
Sec. 14-95. - Procedure. 
(a)  Under this article, prior to the imposition of sentence, a convicted person desiring to do so may become a convicted applicant by stating such desire to the court. The court may then conduct such examination as it wishes, including any written application form the court may require to be completed and submitted by such convicted applicant. 
(b)  Upon a determination by the sentencing judge that a convicted applicant may serve in the alternative sentencing program, that person shall be referred to the program administrator for assignment and monitoring. The sentencing judge shall indicate to the program administrator the number of hours of service required of each applicant so accepted. The sentencing judge shall also indicate to the accepted applicant the amount of the fine and/or the number of days required to be served in jail. This fine and/or jail sentence may be suspended pending the receipt by the court of a certification by the program administrator that the applicant has successfully completed the program. Partial participation short of completion shall not satisfy the conditions of suspension of the sentence, and in such case, the otherwise suspended sentence shall, at least in part, be imposed.

Sec. 14-96. - Determination of eligibility by judge. 
(a)  In determining the eligibility of any convicted applicant for participation in the alternative sentencing program, the sentencing judge may consider the ability of the convicted applicant to satisfy the goals of this program as stated in Section 14-94. If the sentencing judge shall so determine, the convicted applicant may be denied participation in the alternative sentencing program based on the judge's decision that the convicted applicant's abilities and/or level of motivation is not consistent with the stated goals of the program. Upon making such determination, the judge may simply refer to this as a "Section 6 denial" and shall not be required to provide any additional explanation. 
(b)  In addition to those factors stated in subsection (a) of this section, the sentencing judge shall also consider: 
(1)  The occupation or other skills of the convicted applicant. 
(2)  The current needs of the community, including the needs of the various departments of the city and any seasonal needs which the community may experience. 
(3)  The benefit to be gained, both by the city and by the convicted applicant, from participation in the specific activity under consideration. 
(4)  The likelihood or possibility of injury to any person or damage to any property during the course of the activity being considered. 
(5)  Those statements made by the convicted applicant in support of the applicant's sincere desire to participate in the program. 
(Code 1975, § 5B-6; Ord. No. 1284, 12-12-83) 
Sec. 14-97. - Insurance for participants. 
    The city shall initiate and maintain insurance coverage for injuries which might occur to participants in the alternative sentencing program. With respect to any injuries which may occur to third persons, all alternative sentencing program participants are declared to be volunteers and specifically are neither the agents nor employees of the city.

DIVISION 2. - BLIGHTED PROPERTY REHABILITATION 

Sec. 18-16. - Purpose. 
(a)  The city council finds and declares that certain real property in the city may be or may become blighted, as defined in this division, with the consequential impairment of taxable values upon which, in part, municipal revenues depend. Such blighted real property is detrimental or inimical to the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens and to the economic welfare of the city. In order to improve and maintain the general character of the city, it is necessary to rehabilitate such blighted real property. The purposes of this division are to rehabilitate such real property by eliminating blight and blighting factors within such areas for the protection of the health, safety, and general welfare of the municipality, to preserve the existing property values of other real properties within or adjacent to such areas, and to preserve the taxable value of the real property in the city; and the necessity in the public interest for provisions herein set forth is declared as a matter of legislative determination to be a public purpose. 
(b)  For the purposes of the blighted property rehabilitation regulations, the terms "zoned for residential use" and "residentially zoned" shall include: 
(1)  All property zoned with a categorical residential zone district listed in Section 18-70(a); and 
(2)  All properties in the original Town of Eastlake that contain a residential use, subject to the provisions of subsection (b)(4) below; and 
(3)  All property zoned PD Residential; and 
(4)  For property developed with a mix of residential and nonresidential uses, the portion of the development occupied by residential uses. When a building is designed for occupancy by both residential and nonresidential uses, the residential provisions shall apply. 
(Ord. No. 2788, § 1, 7-22-03; Ord. No. 3115, § 52, 10-13-09; Ord. No. 3165, § 1, 4-12-11) 
Sec. 18-17. - Causes of blight or blighting factors. 
    It is hereby determined that the following uses, activities, structures and items of personal property are causes of blight or blighting factors which, if allowed to exist, will tend to result in blighted and undesirable communities. It shall be unlawful for any person, occupant or owner of real property to maintain or permit to be maintained on any real property within the city, any of the following causes of blight or blighting factors: 
(1)  Building materials. In any area zoned for residential use, the outside, uncovered storage upon any real property of building materials, as defined herein, unless there is in force a valid building permit issued by the city for construction of a new, or modification of an existing, structure upon said real property and said materials are intended for use in connection with such construction or modification. Building materials may be stored inside an enclosed building on the real property, or may be stacked and covered in the rear of any residentially zoned real property, out of view from any adjoining street, whether or not a building permit is in force. Building materials are defined to include, but shall not be limited to lumber, bricks, concrete or cinderblocks, plumbing materials, electrical wiring or equipment, heating ducts or equipment, shingles, mortar, concrete or cement, sand, gravel, dirt, rocks, nails, screws or any other materials used or the debris from such materials that have been used in construction or modifying any building, structure on the real property, or used to enhance or create landscaping improvements to such real property. 
(2)  Outside storage. In any area zoned for residential use, the outside storage or accumulation of dilapidated, damaged, or unusable merchandise, as defined herein, of any kind. The term unusable merchandise shall mean and include, parts of machinery or motor vehicles, appliances of any kind that can no longer be used for their intended purposes, remnants of wood, metal, plastic or any other material or cast off material of any kind, whether or not same could be put to some reasonable use, and/or any item of merchandise that is so dilapidated or deteriorated that it cannot be reasonably used for its intended purpose. 
(3)  Accumulation of trash. 
a.  In any area zoned for residential use, the outside storage and/or accumulation of trash, rubbish, garbage, refuse of any kind or litter upon or around any part of the yard or any area of ground immediately surrounding the building or structure located on the real property, including porches or landings of such buildings. In areas zoned for multifamily use, the common areas, parking areas and streets must also be kept clear of trash, garbage, rubbish and refuse, except for common trash enclosure areas. 
b.  In areas zoned for commercial use, the proprietor, landlord or management agency, shall be responsible for seeing to it that the premises of a commercial center, commercial establishment, or complex, including the parking lot and specifically including that part of any street right-of-way adjoining the premises and outside the curb line are kept free of trash, rubbish, garbage, discarded merchandise, discarded goods or materials or any other kind of junk or refuse of any kind. The proprietor, landlord or management agency, shall see to it that the premises are cleaned of such garbage and refuse at least each day and take all reasonable steps to provide containers for discards and to order his employees and tenants to use them. 
(4)  Landscaping. A person in possession, the owner, or occupant shall maintain any and all landscaping on real property, in such a manner to ensure that all lawns are mowed regularly, all shrubs are adequately trimmed, noxious weeds are eliminated and dead or diseased plantings removed and replaced as required by Section 18-556 of the Code. Any weeds or noxious weeds cannot exceed the height restrictions for such weeds or noxious weeds as set forth in Section 38-444 of this Code. 
(5)  Motor vehicles. In any area zoned for residential use, the owner or occupant of real property shall maintain any and all areas of said real property free and clear of inoperable, unsafe, unlawful and/or abandoned motor vehicles, motor homes or recreational vehicles as defined in Section 38-386 of the Code or any unlicensed or inoperable trailer. In lieu of the requirements of Section 38-424 of the Code, notice and enforcement pursuant to this division may be used for any of the aforementioned vehicles or trailers. By enactment of this Section 18-17(5), and in addition to the authority to impound conferred by Section 38-422, code compliance officers have the authority to impound any inoperable, unsafe, unlawful and/or abandoned motor vehicles, motor homes, recreational vehicles or trailers found in or upon any property zoned for residential use within the city. 
(6)  Items requiring a temporary permit. In any case, where the use of real property requires the issuance of a temporary use permit, the owner of such property shall ensure that the use permit is obtained and that the person or entity issued such permit remains in compliance with the Code. By enacting this Section 18-17(6), code compliance officers have the authority to impound any unpermitted materials, equipment, or other items of personal property found upon any real property within the city when a temporary use permit is required for said materials, equipment or other items of personal property. 
(7)  Exceptions . The causes of blight or blighting factors set forth in subsections (1)-(6) above, as applicable to areas zoned for residential and/or commercial uses, are hereby determined to be causes of blight or blighting factors and subject to the prohibitions of this division. Provided, however, in areas zoned for commercial uses, if such uses of the property are incidental to and necessary for the carrying out of any business or occupation lawfully being carried on upon the property in question and are expressly permitted in the applicable zoning district, the prohibitions in subsection (1), (2), or (5) above shall not apply. 
(Ord. No. 2788, § 1, 7-22-03; Ord. No. 2965, § 1, 10-10-06, eff. 11-1-06; Ord. No. 3165, § 1, 4-12-11; Ord. No. 3432, § 1, 5-9-17) 
Sec. 18-18. - Notice and administrative hearing. 
(a)  Notwithstanding the commencement of any criminal prosecution alleging a violation of the Code or the lack of such criminal prosecution, if the owner or occupant of any real property located within the city, upon receiving a notice from a code compliance officer that a violation of the Code exists upon such real property and the owner or occupant fails or refuses to remove or eliminate the causes of blight or blighting factors as required by the notice, the code compliance officer shall give the owner or occupier a written notice to show cause. The notice to show cause shall indicate that a hearing shall be held on a specified date to show cause why the causes of blight or blighting factors located on the owner or occupant's real property shall not be removed or eliminated by the city in accordance with this division. If the property owner or occupant has been issued a violation notice by a code compliance officer in the past twelve months for the same violation, the property owner or occupant may be immediately issued a notice to show cause. If it reasonably appears to the code compliance officer that the property is abandoned or unoccupied or if the property is posted as being subject to a foreclosure proceeding, the code compliance officer may immediately issue a notice to show cause. 
(b)  The notice to show cause referred to in subsection (a), above, shall be specific as to the causes of blight or blighting factors, shall state that the owner or occupant of the real property may be subject to assessment for all costs associated with a removal or elimination by the city of the causes of blight or the blighting factors, and shall be served upon the owner and the occupant of the real property, if different from the owner, by personal service. If diligent efforts to serve the notice to show cause personally are unsuccessful, it shall be deemed sufficient notice if the written notice to show cause is mailed by first class mail to the owner of the real property, as shown by the Adams County Assessor's Office, and to the occupant at the real property address. For property owners who do not reside in Colorado, notice will also be sent by certified mail. If notice is mailed, a copy of the notice to show cause shall also be posted in a conspicuous place on the premises where the blight or blighting factors are found to exist. No further notice shall be necessary. 
(c)  Hearing. 
(1)  At the hearing referred to in subsections (a) and (b) the city manager, or a designee, shall hear such statements and consider such evidence as the code compliance officer, the owner or occupant, or any other witness shall offer relative to the existence of and removal or elimination of the causes of blight or blighting factors. The burden of proof is upon the city to establish that blight or blighting factors exist on the real property by a preponderance of the evidence. If the city is seeking a continuing order, as authorized by subsection (2) herein, evidence shall be presented establishing the public necessity for such order which evidence may include, but not be limited to, that the property subject to the order is vacant property, foreclosed property, abandoned property or property where the owner has demonstrated a pattern of repeatedly failing to comply with administrative orders. The hearing shall be an administrative hearing where the strict rules of evidence shall not be adhered to and hearsay shall be admitted. However, any decision with regard to blight or blighting factors existing on the property shall not be based solely on hearsay evidence. 
(2)  The city manager or a designee shall issue an order based on the findings of fact made pursuant to the hearing, either relieving the owner or occupant of any responsibility by finding that no blight or blighting factors exist on the real property, or commanding the owner or occupant to remove or eliminate the causes of blight or blighting factors within a reasonable time and thereby rehabilitate the real property. In cases where the basis of the violation is noncompliance with Section 38-444 of the Code, the city may request, and an order authorized by this section may be issued, denoted as a continuing order. Any continuing order issued shall remain in effect for one year from the date of such order requiring the owner of the property to maintain the property in compliance with the specific requirements identified in the continuing order. 
(d)  The order of the city manager, or a designee, made pursuant to subsection (c)(2) above, shall be a final decision and may be appealed to the district court pursuant to Colorado Rule of Civil Procedure 106(a)(4). Failure of an owner or occupant to appeal said order constitutes a knowing waiver of any right to contest the city's order and consequential authority to eliminate or remove the causes of blight or blighting factors from the owner's property, and charge the resulting costs to the real property owner. 
(e)  If any order issued by the city manager, or a designee, pursuant to subsection (c)(2) above has not been complied with within the designated time frame contained in the order, the city at the direction of the city manager, or a designee, may cause the elimination or removal of the causes of blight or blighting factors as specifically identified in the order and any continuing order issued may authorize the city to eliminate such conditions so long as the order is in effect and so long as the property is owned by the same owner identified in the order. Any materials, equipment, or other items of personal property determined to be a blighting factor in accordance with Section 18-17 and that is removed pursuant to this subsection will be held by the city for 30 days from the date of the impound. After 30 days, the city may sell or dispose of this property. 
(f)  Any such owner or occupant who fails to comply with an order issued by the city manager, or a designee, pursuant to subsection (c)(2) above, shall be charged with all administrative costs and expenses incurred in the eradication and/or removal of the causes of blight or blighting factors. Such administrative costs shall include the cost of said removal or elimination of the blight or blighting factors, inspection fees, postal charges, legal expenses, impoundment fees, storage fees, and other expenses as related to the enforcement of the order and of this division. 
(g)  Once the costs for eradication are determined pursuant to subsection (f) above, the city shall send out a notice of payment due ("notice") for such costs to the owner or occupant, if different than the owner, of the real property upon which the eradication occurred advising of those costs and that payment needs to be made within 30 days from the date of the notice. Failure to pay in accordance with the notice will result in enforcement pursuant to the assessment policy contained in this division and collection of such costs may be by an assessment lien against the real property. 
(Ord. No. 2788, § 1, 7-22-03; Ord. No. 2965, § 2, 10-10-06, eff. 11-1-06; Ord. No. 3011, §§ 1, 2, 10-9-07; Ord. No. 3165, § 1, 4-12-11; Ord. No. 3432, § 2, 5-9-17) 
Sec. 18-19. - Assessment policy. 
(a)  Upon completing rehabilitation of any real property by elimination of the blight or blighting factors and if an owner and/or occupant of the real property does not pay in accordance with the notice, all such costs incurred by the city in removing or eliminating causes of blight or blighting factors, shall be assessed against the property on which the causes of blight or blighting factors exist. The city may also recover these costs by seeking legal recourse in court against the owner, occupant, and/or lessee of the property or by the filing of an assessment lien. 
(b)  If the city manager, or a designee, determines to assess costs against the property, an assessment enumerating all such costs to be assessed shall be prepared and shall be recorded against the property as an assessment lien in favor of the city, in the Adams County Clerk and Recorder's Office. 
(c)  A copy of the assessment lien shall be sent to the real property owner's address as shown on the Adams County Assessor's Office, and a copy shall be mailed to the real property address. 
(Ord. No. 2788, § 1, 7-22-03; Ord. No. 3165, § 1, 4-12-11) 
Sec. 18-20. - Application. 
(a)  The requirements of this division shall apply to all residential or commercial property located within the city. Enforcement of this division shall be with due consideration of the privacy interest of citizens and businesses located within the city. Upon an order of the city manager or designee pursuant to Section 18-18, the code compliance officers or contractors of the city shall have the right to enter any blighted property and take corrective action to rehabilitate the blight or blighted factors, and cause any and all costs of rehabilitation to be assessed against the property owner. 
(b)  The enforcement and remedies under this division are cumulative and are not exclusive. Enforcement pursuant to this division shall not preclude any other enforcement activity under this Code.

Sec. 18-48. - Development permit review. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of development permit review is to ensure: 
(1)  Compliance with zoning and other development regulations; 
(2)  Performance criteria and standards adopted by the council; and 
(3)  The achievement of quality development through review of site, landscape, and architectural plans prior to the issuance of a building permit. 
    A development permit is not the master plan, the official map, the zoning plan, a plan for the clearing and removing of slum districts and blighted areas, or a plan for the replanning, improvement, and redevelopment of neighborhoods. 
(b)  When development permit required. 
(1)  A development permit is required before a building permit may be issued for the following: 
a.  New construction within the city, except for the following:

b.  Renovation of an existing building which increases existing building height, floor area, or changes nonpermeable coverage of the site by more than five percent; 
c.  Renovation intended to accommodate a change in the use of an existing building when such change in use requires significant modifications to the exterior elevations or modification of the site on which the existing building is located; or 
d.  Renovation of an existing building which significantly changes the architectural character of the building. Significant changes to architectural character include but are not limited to significant changes in exterior building materials, increasing or decreasing the openings in the building's façade by more than ten percent, and significant changes to the cornice line or slope of the roof. 
(2)  A development permit is required before a certificate of occupancy may be issued for a use requiring an SUP. 
(3)  Typically a development permit is applied for on subdivided lots. In those cases where the development process requires application for a development permit on an unsubdivided property, the applicant may combine the application for a subdivision plat with the application for a development permit. Duplicate submittal materials are not required and the review and approval process may proceed on the same schedule. 
(4)  In those cases where a development permit is applied for on subdivided lots, but which do not have the assurances of completion in place as required in Section 18-687, such assurances shall be submitted and approved prior to the issuance of a development permit. 
(5)  For any development permit that involves any on- or off-site improvements which in the opinion of the city require assurance of completion, the procedures and requirements in Section 18-687 shall be used. 
(6)  A development permit is required for the installation of an electric substation or gas transmission regulation station. A development permit is required for an addition or expansion of an electric substation where the expansion requires the perimeter wall or fence to be increased. A development permit is required for the installation of new electric transmission lines and poles. A development permit is also required for modification of existing electric transmission lines which increases the voltage of the lines. Finally, a development permit is required for any new or replacement tower or pole supporting electric transmission lines where such new tower or pole requires a permanent increase in the width of the existing easement or right-of-way, and then only the location of the new or replacement tower or pole is required to be reviewed.

The application for a development permit shall include all information listed as a requirement within the current development permit application checklist issued by the department, and any other reasonable and pertinent information that the director determines to be necessary for development permit review. 
a.  If the applicant is not the owner of the lot, the applicant shall submit a letter from the owner authorizing the applicant to act on the owner's behalf. However, the Secretary of the Thornton Development Authority may submit an application without an owner letter if the property is in the Thornton Development Authority Area and has been designated as a project by the authority. 
b.  The director may waive one or more submission requirements of a site plan, landscape plan, or architectural plan if the submission requirement is not applicable given the nature of the development permit being requested. 
(2)  In addition to the materials listed in subsection (c)(1) of this section, an application for a development permit shall include evidence of good faith attempts to relocate any prairie dog colonies found to be existing on the real property to be developed in accordance with Section 6-21 of the Code.

1.  Each applicant for a telecommunication facility shall provide to the department a narrative and map description of the applicant's existing or then current land use applications for proposed telecommunication towers within a two-mile radius of the proposed site regardless of the city's boundary. This provision is not intended to require that the applicant submit its business plan, propriety information, or make commitments regarding the location of towers within the city. Rather, it is an attempt to provide a mechanism for the city and all applicants for telecommunication facilities to share general information, assist in the city's comprehensive planning process, and promote co-location by identifying areas in which telecommunication towers might be appropriately constructed for multiple users. 
2.  The department may share such information with other applicants applying for administrative approvals or special use permits or other organizations seeking to locate antennae within the jurisdiction of the city. The city may only share this information provided that the department is not in any way representing or warranting that such sites are available or suitable unless a more stringent compliance schedule is mandated by the controlling federal agency. 
b.  Justification for new commercial towers. No new commercial towers shall be permitted unless the applicant demonstrates to the reasonable satisfaction of the city that existing commercial towers or attachments to existing structures cannot accommodate the applicant's needs. Evidence of this condition may consist of the following: 
1.  Proof that no existing telecommunication facilities or structures within a 1,000-foot radius of the proposed site are suitable to meet the applicant's technical requirements; 
2.  Proof that existing freestanding telecommunication facilities or structures do not have sufficient structural strength to support the applicant's proposed antenna and related equipment; 
3.  Proof that the applicant's proposed antenna would cause electromagnetic interference with the antennae on the existing towers or structures, or the antennae on the existing towers or structures would cause interference with the applicant's proposed antenna; or 
4.  An affirmative demonstration that there are other limiting factors rendering existing towers and structures unsuitable. 
c.  Plot plan. When the proposed wireless telecommunication facility is to include a new commercial tower, a plot plan at a scale of not less than one inch equal to 100 feet shall be submitted. This plot plan shall indicate all building uses within 300 feet of the proposed facility. Aerial photos and/or renderings may be required by the director to augment the plot plan. 
d.  Legal access. Evidence of legal access to the tower site and the ability to maintain this access regardless of other developments that may take place on the site. 
e.  Interference. The applicant shall provide a written statement from a qualified radio frequency engineer, certifying that a technical evaluation of existing and proposed facilities indicates no potential interference problems. 
f.  Compliance with FCC requirements. A letter from the applicant stating that the proposed facility will meet all requirements established by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). 
g.  Submittal of FCC license. If the proposed facility requires a FCC license, a copy of a valid FCC license, if available, or a letter from the applicant stating that they will submit to the department a copy of the FCC license when issued.

(4)  For an eligible facilities request, if the application is complete and meets the requirements of an eligible facilities request the Director shall approve the application within 60 days of the date of the application. If the application is determined to be incomplete, the Director shall notify the applicant within 30 days. 
a.  Timeframe for review.

The board shall hold a public hearing to allow proponents and opponents of an application for a major development permit to present their views. Notwithstanding the authority of the board to review and approve a major development permit, following a review of the completed application the director shall have the discretion to transmit any development permit application directly to the city council for review upon a determination that the public interest would best be served by doing so. City council's review shall follow the public hearing process and application evaluation prescribed herein.

Sec. 18-51. - Development permit administration. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to: 
(1)  Regulate site plan, landscape, and architectural requirements as set forth in an approved valid development permit after building permits have been issued. 
(2)  Continue the development standards for existing development and planned developments (PDs) transferred with the adoption of the original zoning district map. 
(b)  Validity of approved development permit. 
(1)  Approved development permits shall be valid for a period of three years from the date of director or board action or, in the case of appeals, from the date of council action. Once a certificate of occupancy has been issued for a lot with a development permit, the development permit shall be valid in perpetuity. 
(2)  Applications for building permits may be made at any time within the three-year period. A completed application for a building permit submitted prior to the expiration of the three years shall be processed based on the approved development permit. If the three years expires before a completed application for a building permit is submitted, a new development permit is required. 
(3)  When development permits are approved for a phased project, the entire development permit is void if no building permit is applied for within the three-year period. If one phase is completed which accounts for at least 30 percent of the total project, the development permit for the remaining phases shall be valid for an additional three years from the date of completion of the first phase. The issuance of a certificate of occupancy for the last building constructed in a phase shall mark the completion of that phase. Only one such extension shall be granted for multiphased projects. 
(4)  In the event that the applicant requests a vested property right for the project for which a development permit has been requested, all applicable requirements and procedures of Section 18-56 shall apply, including approval of construction plans in accordance with applicable city requirements. 
(5)  If an applicant has not built a structure that has received design review approval or development permit approval from the board or the director within three years of the next requested building permit to construct the same structure, a new development permit for the structure is required. 
(c)  Development permits by transfer. 
(1)  Development permits by transfer shall mean development permits created by the city for a planned unit development (PUD) or a planned development (PD) transferred to a categorical zoning district. 
(2)  Unless otherwise specified within a development permit, development permits by transfer have no expiration date. 
(3)  Development permits by transfer shall contain the development standards of the previous PUD or PD zoning district. In the event that the transfer development permit does not contain a standard, the development standards within the zoning district shown on the official map shall apply. 
(4)  All requirements that relate to the PUD or PD zoning district, improvement, or maintenance of real property, including private covenants, shall be made a part of the development permit by transfer. 
(5)  All development permits by transfer shall be recorded with the county clerk and recorder of the county in which the property is located. 
(Code 1975, § 58-2.703; Ord. No. 2223, § 1(L), 12-28-92; Ord. No. 2279, §§ 90-92, 8-9-93; Ord. No. 2815, § 9, 2-24-04; Ord. No. 3165, § 1, 4-12-11) 
Sec. 18-52. - Specific use permit (SUP). 
(a)  General provisions. 
(1)  The SUP provides a means for developing certain uses in a manner in which the specific use will be compatible with adjacent property and consistent with the character of the neighborhood. It is used when there are some locations within a zoning district where the specific use is appropriate and some locations where the specific use would not be appropriate. 
(2)  No use requiring an SUP shall be granted until a development permit is approved except for uses on city-owned property which are exempt from the development permit requirements of Section 18-48. 
(3)  The use regulations in Section 18-160 state whether an SUP is required for a use to be permitted in a zoning district. The SUP requirement for a use in a district does not constitute an authorization or an assurance that the use will be permitted. Each SUP shall be evaluated as to its probable effect on the adjacent property and the community welfare and may be approved or denied as the findings indicate appropriate. Each SUP shall be approved as part of the development permit review process by the board. Notwithstanding the authority of the board to review and approve an SUP, following a review of the completed application the director shall have the discretion to transmit any SUP application directly to the city council for review upon a determination that the public interest would best be served by doing so. City council's review shall follow the public hearing process and application evaluation prescribed herein. 
(4)  The board shall not grant an SUP for a use except upon a finding that the use will: 
a.  Complement or be compatible with the surrounding uses and community facilities; 
b.  Contribute to, enhance, or promote the welfare of the area of request and adjacent properties; 
c.  Not be detrimental to the public health, safety, or general welfare; 
d.  Conform in all other respects to all applicable zoning regulations and standards; and 
e.  Be in conformance with the Comprehensive Plan. 
(5)  The granting of an SUP has no effect on the uses permitted by right and does not waive the regulations of the underlying zoning district. 
(6)  The board may impose reasonable conditions upon the granting of an SUP consistent with the Comprehensive Plan, other stated development goals and objectives of the city, and the requirements of other city regulations. 
(7)  An SUP runs with the land, a new owner is not required to reapply for an SUP unless a time limit that has been established runs out. 
(b)  Procedures for granting. 
(1)  A person who desires to develop a use allowed by SUP only shall identify the use and request an SUP as part of the application for development permit review. 
(2)  Information, in addition to that normally required for a development permit, may be required for the evaluation of an SUP. The director shall be responsible for notifying applicants when additional information is needed. 
(3)  A time limit for the duration of the SUP may be imposed as a condition upon the granting of an SUP. If a time limit has been imposed, the SUP automatically terminates when the time limit expires. The applicant shall be responsible for renewing the SUP through the development permit review process prior to the expiration of the time limit. 
(Code 1975, § 58-2.216; Ord. No. 2183, § 1, 8-10-92; Ord. No. 2815, § 12, 2-24-04; Ord. No. 2995, § 4, 6-19-07; Ord. No. 3165, § 1, 4-12-11; Ord. No. 3310, § 2, 9-9-14) 
Sec. 18-53. - Temporary use permit (TUP). 
(a)  General provisions. 
(1)  All land use, development and improvements of any type funded by the city and constructed on property owned by the city shall be exempt from the TUP requirements of this section. 
(2)  The TUP provides a means for allowing certain uses in locations where they would not be appropriate on a permanent basis, to provide for those uses that are temporary in nature, and to provide for development standards appropriate for such temporary uses. 
(3)  No use requiring a TUP shall be granted until a development permit is approved. 
(4)  The use regulations in Section 18-160 identify those uses for which a TUP is required. The TUP requirement for a use in a district does not constitute an authorization or an assurance that the use will be permitted. Each TUP shall be evaluated as to its probable effect on the adjacent property and the community welfare and may be approved or denied as the findings indicate appropriate. Each TUP shall be approved as part of the development permit review process. 
(5)  A TUP shall not be granted for a use except upon a finding that the use will, during the time it is in existence: 
a.  Complement or be compatible with the surrounding uses and community facilities; 
b.  Contribute to, enhance, or promote the welfare of the area of request and adjacent properties; 
c.  Not be detrimental to the public health, safety, or general welfare; and 
d.  Conform in all other respects to all applicable zoning regulations and standards. 
(6)  A TUP shall not be granted for a use except upon a finding that the site following the temporary use will be able to be restored to a satisfactory condition. The applicant granted a TUP shall be responsible for seeing that the site is restored to an acceptable condition following the end of the temporary use. A financial guarantee, in a form acceptable to the city and in an amount sufficient to cover the cost of restoring the site, may be required as a condition of approval. 
(7)  The granting of a TUP has no effect on the uses permitted as of right and does not waive the regulations of the underlying zoning district, except as specifically modified for the temporary use during the time it is permitted. 
(8)  Reasonable conditions may be imposed upon the granting of a TUP consistent with the Comprehensive Plan, other stated development goals and objectives of the city, and the requirements of other city regulations. 
(b)  Procedures for granting. 
(1)  A person who desires to develop a use allowed by TUP only shall identify the use and request a TUP as part of the application for development permit review. 
(2)  Information, in addition to that normally required for a development permit, may be required for the evaluation of a TUP. The director shall be responsible for notifying applicants when additional information is needed. 
(3)  A time limit shall be imposed as a condition upon the granting of a TUP. The TUP automatically terminates when the time limit expires. If an extension is desired, the applicant shall be responsible for renewing the TUP through the development permit review process prior to the expiration of the time limit. 
(Code 1975, § 58-2.217; Ord. No. 2183, § 1, 8-10-92; Ord. No. 2995, § 5, 6-19-07; Ord. No. 3165, § 1, 4-12-11) 
Secs. 18-54, 18-55. - Reserved. 
Sec. 18-56. - Vested property rights. 
(a)  Purpose; declaration of home rule authority. 
(1)  C.R.S. § 24-68-101 et seq. establishes certain vested property rights, attaching upon the approval or conditional approval of a site specific development plan by local government to remain vested for a period of three years from the date of such approval. The city is a home rule municipality organized pursuant to Article XX of the State Constitution, whose citizens have adopted a Charter bestowing upon the city all powers of home rule possible to have and securing the fundamental reservation of initiative and referendum to the people in such municipal matters. The council asserts that the zoning and regulation of real property within the territorial jurisdiction of the city is found to be and constitutes a matter inextricably bound to the concept of home rule and that the vested property rights legislation impermissibly burdens the municipal authority. Moreover, pursuant to C.R.S. § 24-68-105(1), the imposition of "all costs and expenses incurred . . . " by a landowner upon the successful exercise by the people of the fundamental right of initiative is found to impose an intolerable burden upon such reserved powers of the people and to unnecessarily chill such intervention essential to secure government of, by and for the benefit of the people. 
(2)  Nevertheless, the enactment of this section is made in recognition of the general assembly's declaration that the vested property rights measure is a matter of state-wide concern, however, with the reservation by the city of all rights, powers and prerogatives granted and reserved by the Constitution of the state and the Charter and ordinances of the city to the polity and citizens of the city. 
(b)  Application . 
(1)  Every application or request for city approval of any document in which the creation of vested property rights is desired shall clearly and conspicuously state that "this is an application for a site specific development plan in which vested rights are being requested." Failure of the landowner or the landowner's legal representative to conspicuously and clearly provide this statement on the face of the application and on the request for approval of the site specific development plan shall be deemed to constitute a waiver of any and all vested property rights as allowed pursuant to this section or pursuant to C.R.S. § 24-68-101 et seq., as amended. 
(2)  For a property right to be vested, in addition to strict compliance with the provisions of this section, the landowner or the landowner's legal representative shall fully comply with all other applicable requirements, procedures and conditions for submittals and approvals provided by ordinance or resolution. 
(c)  Notice and hearing. No site specific development plan shall be approved nor shall the time for vested rights begin or be extended until after a public hearing before the council preceded by written notice of such hearing. Such written notice shall be published at the time and in the manner required by Section 8.6 of the Charter, and such written notice may be integrated with other legal notices required by the city. The written notice shall describe generally the type and intensity of the proposed use, the specific parcel of property affected and shall contain a statement in the title of the ordinance that a site specific development plan and a vested property right is being created. At such public hearing, owners of the property described in the site specific development plan, their representatives, citizens and city staff shall have an opportunity to be heard. After the public hearing and council adoption of the ordinance approving site specific development plan, the city shall provide a subsequent publication of notice of the approval as set forth in Section 8.6 of the Charter. 
(d)  Effect on other provisions . Approval of a site specific development plan shall not be deemed to constitute an exemption from or waiver of any other provisions of this Code pertaining to the development and use of property or pertaining to the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city. As of June 28, 1999, there are no properties with vested property rights in the city. On and after June 28, 1999, all applicants for a vested property right shall be subject to growth limitations including moratoriums, tap limitations, building permit limitations, or other growth management requirements as well as payment of impact fees and development charges, concurrency management requirements, design standards and any other development regulation in effect at the time of application. Application or approval of a vested property right does not grant any right to utility taps or building permits. 
(e)  Limitations.

Sec. 18-97. - Mixed Use (MU) District. 
(a)  Purpose. The Mixed Use District is intended to accommodate the development of a compatible mix, rather than separation, of uses that can include commercial, office, institutional and higher-density residential uses in locations consistent with the Comprehensive Plan. Uses catering to automobiles, such as drive-in and drive-through restaurants and similar uses, are limited in this district to foster a pedestrian environment and encourage the use of public transportation. The district is intended to create a planned and integrated land use development with common landscaping, architectural and design elements, rather than a fragmented development that responds to fluctuating market conditions. The higher density and pedestrian orientation of this district promotes the public health, safety and welfare by encouraging fitness through walking and minimizing the environmental impacts associated with less-compact, automobile-oriented development. 
(b)  Additional provisions . 
(1)  Mix of uses. Mixed use developments shall contain uses in two or more of the following use categories, with the combined floor area of all uses in each category having at least 15 percent of the total floor area of the project: 
a.  Institutional and community service uses. 
b.  Lodging uses. 
c.  Office uses. 
d.  Recreation uses. 
e.  Residential uses. 
f.  Retail and service uses. 
(2)  Residential uses . Inclusion of a residential use in mixed use developments is encouraged. Where provided, residential uses shall be higher density attached or multifamily types of housing. 
(3)  Other uses . The city council may approve a use that is not listed above and is not already defined as a main use in this Development Code. The council should consider the following criteria when approving the proposed use: 
a.  The proposed use is compatible with existing and planned development. 
b.  The proposed use will not create any adverse impacts on the public health, safety and welfare. 
c.  Development standards are also proposed that will mitigate any significant, adverse effects on the surrounding area. 
d.  The proposed use is unique or unlikely to be located within a standard development elsewhere in the area. 
(4)  Integration . A mixed use development shall be designed as a unified project that projects a unique and identifiable sense of place. These projects need to include significant functional and physical integration of project components, including but not limited to the uses, architecture, and structural and site design. 
(5)  Pedestrian friendly . All portions of the development need to be accessible by a direct, convenient, attractive, safe, and comfortable system of pedestrian facilities and the development needs to provide appropriate pedestrian amenities. In addition, mixed use projects need to exhibit integration of the pedestrian scale into the design of the development. Pedestrian friendly environments help reduce the demand for motorized transportation while also providing attractive living and working environments. 
(6)  Phasing . A mixed use development may be constructed in phases as long as each phase meets the intent and requirements of this section and the application is signed by or on behalf of all of the owners of the properties involved. 
(7)  Mixed use development design standards and requirements . 
a.  Sustainable and "green" practices should be used through all phases of site planning and building design for the purpose of reducing energy consumption, waste, natural resource use, and overall building impacts on human health and the environment. Developments should consider practices outlined by the U.S. Green Building Council for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification. Practices shall comply with Thornton city Code and Colorado State law. 
b.  Residential portions of the development shall follow the design standards set forth in Part 1 and Part 2 of Division 2 of Article V of this chapter. 
c.  Nonresidential portions of the development shall follow the design standards set forth in Parts 1, 3, 4 and 5 of Division 2 of Article V of this chapter. 
d.  In order to accommodate the integration of differing uses, the developer may propose alternative design standards that create distinctive, high quality development that ensures consistency in style and materials. These standards shall be submitted with the application for the conceptual site plan. The development shall meet all other requirements of the Development Code. 
(8)  Mixed use buildings . 
a.  Buildings with a mix of uses that include a residential use shall provide at least one separate building entrance for building residents. 
b.  Buildings with a mix of uses shall be appropriately attenuated for noise between residential and nonresidential uses, including airborne and impact noise and vibration. 
(9)  Parking for multiple building sites . When a mixed use development consists of multiple building sites, its off-street parking and loading requirements are calculated by combining the sites and treating them as a single building site. Shared parking is encouraged.

Sec. 18-98. - Transit Oriented Development (TOD) District. 
(a)  Purpose. The "TOD" district is a mixed-use category which requires a diverse mix of uses generally within one-half mile of transit stations in the city in locations consistent with the Comprehensive Plan. There are two types of subdistricts that will be defined for each TOD district, the Core Subdistrict, which extends approximately one-fourth mile from the transit station, and the Transition Subdistrict, which extends another one-fourth mile beyond the Core Subdistrict. The TOD district encourages residential development patterns with sufficient density to support transit use and neighborhoods for residents, as well as commercial and retail uses to serve the shopping and service needs of TOD district residents, employees, and commuters. The TOD district is characterized by retail, office, restaurant, civic and entertainment uses on the street level, with mostly residential and office uses on the upper floors. Uses catering to automobiles, such as drive-in and drive-through businesses and similar uses, are prohibited in the TOD district in order to foster a pedestrian-oriented environment which provides settings for social interaction and active community life, as well as encouraging the use of public transportation and promoting public health, safety and welfare by encouraging fitness through walking and minimizing the environmental impacts associated with less-compact, automobile-oriented development. The TOD district emphasizes the vertical mix of components, but can also incorporate a horizontal mix of development. 
(b)  Additional provisions . 
(1)  Subdistricts. Subdistricts shall be defined in each TOD with the CSP. Subdistricts will have varying levels of intensity of development and mixes of uses. The most intense areas shall be close by the transit station with a reduction in intensity toward the edge of the TOD district in order to transition to an intensity which is compatible with adjacent development. The size and number of subdistricts will be determined with the CSP based on considerations including but not limited to the size and configuration of the site, proposed land uses, and the adjacent existing or proposed land uses. 
a.  Core Subdistrict. This subdistrict will typically be adjacent to the transit station. This is a dense, mixed use pedestrian-oriented area to encourage activity near the transit station. This subdistrict generally includes the area within 1/4 mile of the transit station. 
b.  Transition Subdistrict. This subdistrict contains mixed use development, is often but not always residential, and provides a transition of density between existing development outside the TOD district and the higher-density development closer to the core of the TOD. Development at the edge of this subdistrict has a scale that is complementary to adjacent development, and will typically include residential uses fronting the street and commercial uses at major intersections. 
(2)  Mix of uses . 
a.  TOD developments identified as being within the Core Subdistrict shall: 
1.  Contain at least 50 percent residential uses unless otherwise authorized by the city with the CSP. Single-family detached and attached products are prohibited in the core area unless otherwise authorized by the city.

Sec. 18-125. - North Washington Subarea Overlay (NWO) District. 
(a)  Purpose. The purpose of this overlay district is to provide land use restrictions within the North Washington Subarea because this area of the city has development potential which will require unusually complex coordination of urban land uses with transportation and open space. This area also will have a strong role in the overall urban form for the city. 
(b)  General provisions. The reviews, procedures, submittal requirements, recording requirements, and other requirements of Chapter 18 of the Code shall apply to all properties designated as lying within the North Washington Subarea Overlay District except as modified herein. 
(c)  Boundaries. The boundaries of the North Washington Subarea Overlay District shall be identical to the boundaries of the North Washington Subarea Plan. 
(d)  Relationship to underlying zoning district. The provisions of the North Washington Subarea Overlay District are in addition to the requirements of the underlying zoning district for a subject property and may supersede the zoning district requirements. 
(e)  Design requirements. The following requirements shall apply to all development within the North Washington Subarea Overlay District. In addition to these, each zone category's requirements shall also apply. The following subarea design standards support the overall subarea vision. They are intended to assist private developers, public agencies and service providers in bringing about orderly and desirable growth of the area by providing a common thread of elements. These elements will serve to visually unify the subarea while allowing each development proposal to identify its own theme. 
(1)  Landscaping. Overall the landscaping improvements should announce a community of quality. At prominent locations throughout the subarea the landscaping should include features such as public art, plazas or fountains. Prominent intersections may also feature monuments to identify the subarea. 
(2)  Bridges and culverts: 
a.  The 136th Avenue bridge serves as the primary design basis for all other bridges and culverts in the subarea. As such, components of the bridge can be used in the design of smaller, secondary bridge structures. Depending on the location, whether a roadway bridge or a trail crossing, each bridge and culvert should reflect the same general form and use of materials as the primary bridge structure. Key materials of the 136th Avenue bridge include metal and masonville buff sandstone veneer. 
b.  Other features that should be incorporated include: 
1.  Curvilinear features (arches and railings) maintain the theme while vertical elements support primary gateway concept. 
2.  Underpasses should incorporate daylighting elements and public art/murals to promote an inviting passageway. 
3.  Rail details should relate to common visual forms while maintaining functionality. 
(3)  Hardscape treatments: 
a.  The common areas within the subarea should be based on a repetition of paving, site furnishing and public art to provide visual connectivity throughout. Landscape and hardscape treatments may vary in material from zoning district to zoning district but should complement the overall visual theme of brick pavers, concrete pavers, site furnishing and public art. The use of brick, stone and variations of concrete are recommended for sidewalks and plaza areas. Seating areas, entryways and special gathering places should be highlighted with accent paving. General walkways should consider natural concrete to reduce overall cost and bring greater emphasis to special paved areas. 
b.  Other features that should be incorporated include: 
1.  Concrete paving with colorant and form liner gives a flagstone appearance at entry locations. The use of tree grates or dry laid stone is encouraged to promote healthier plant growth. 
2.  Brick and concrete paving can be combined to reinforce a formal appearance. Concrete pavers add pattern and texture to a site. 
3.  Brick paving emphasizes pedestrian zones. 
4.  Public art is appropriate in these areas as well as in private common areas and on private sites that are visible to the public. 
(4)  Site furnishings: 
a.  The site furnishings selected for common areas are intended to promote a visually attractive, versatile and coordinated environment. Major site furnishings include street lights and poles, pedestrian level lighting, bollards, benches, bus shelters, drinking fountains and trash receptacles. 
b.  Other features that should be incorporated include: 
1.  Site furnishings should match in color and style for consistency. 
2.  Minor elements, such as trash receptacles, should maintain a simplified form within the overall visual theme. 
(5)  Building materials: 
a.  Building materials within the subarea should consist of any combination of brick, stone, wood, metal and glass. While this represents a broad cross-section of materials, the actual architectural form will dictate the overall vision theme for each zoning district. 
b.  Other features that shall be incorporated include: 
1.  Glass shall be used in all office buildings. 
2.  Steel accents should be used throughout the subarea. 
3.  Accent lighting shall be used in retail and pedestrian areas. 
4.  A variety of bold and dynamic colors are required in retail districts. 
c.  Prohibited materials: 
1.  Façade:

(1)  The vertical plane extending through the boundary line of the site of origination; and 
(2)  The grade of the restricted building or structure. 
(c)  Angle of projection. The angle of projection of the residential proximity slope depends on the zoning category of the site of origination as follows: 
Zoning District of Site of Origination Angle of Projection A, RE, SFD, SFA 11.3° (1 to 5 slope) MF 18.4° (1 to 3 slope)  
(d)  Calculation of height restriction. The horizontal distances used to calculate the height restriction imposed by the residential proximity slope may be determined by using the dimensions shown on the official plat or zoning maps of the city, or by scale measurement of the distances on such official maps. All dimensions and methodology used in determining the distance measurement are subject to the approval of the board in the development permit review process.

DIVISION 2. - DESIGN STANDARDS 
Part 1. - Generally 

Sec. 18-463. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this division is to provide for uniform performance standards and criteria for the design of buildings within the city in recognition that quality and compatibility of building design directly impact the health, safety and welfare of the citizenry and stimulate economic stability through orderly growth and enhancement of the tax base essential to the generation of funds adequate to address the increasing demands for municipal services. These purposes are achieved through: 
(1)  The enhancement of the physical character of the community and quality of life of its citizens through the coordinated control of the built environment created by development; 
(2)  The balancing of aesthetic design qualities with functional development and utility resulting in a community offering benefits as a place to live, recreate, and work; 
(3)  The preservation and enhancement of the physical character, integrity, and quality of community areas, particularly those areas having a discernible character or special historic, or other significance; 
(4)  The enhancement and protection of the property values, occupancies of uses of the surrounding areas in furtherance of the Comprehensive Plan and other development goals and objectives of the city; 
(5)  The stimulation of improvements and maintenance of surrounding properties, thereby preventing and reversing the effects of urban blight and deterioration; and 
(6)  The heightening of community expectations and awareness concerning the design quality of the built environment and its positive influence on the citizens of the city.

(Code 1975, § 58-8.102; Ord. No. 2183, § 1, 8-10-92; Ord. No. 2573, § 2, 10-25-99; Ord. No. 3165, § 1, 4-12-11; Ord. No. 3382, § 1, 5-24-16) 
Sec. 18-473. - Remodeling, new construction of accessory structures. 
    Design review criteria for remodeling and new construction of accessory structures are as follows: 
(1)  Visual appeal. 
a.  Additions, renovations and new accessory structures should be designed to provide variety and visual interest while creating a unified overall image. Strategies to achieve this include, but are not limited to: 
1.  Using sufficient design details. 
2.  Providing sufficient relief in building façades by using a variety of comparable materials and complementary colors or by using materials with textures or depth such as brick or stone. 
3.  Using simple lines and good proportions. 
4.  Using consistent and/or complementary façade treatments for different façades of a structure, especially those façades which are visible from the street. 
b.  Additions or separate components should be designed as an integral part of the building design so that they are integrated with the existing structure and do not appear to be tacked on. Strategies to achieve this include, but are not limited to: 
1.  Using similar roof pitches and types. 
2.  Using complementary or consistent materials and colors. 
3.  Screening appurtenances or designing them as an integral part of the building design. 
c.  Accessory structures should be designed to be consistent and/or complementary with the principal structures within a development. Strategies to achieve this include, but are not limited to: 
Using complementary or consistent materials, colors, or details. 
(2)  Massing and scale. A balance should be provided between the various parts and forms of a structure. Strategies to achieve this include, but are not limited to designing a structure so that elements that are visually more massive or heavier are below elements which are visually less massive or lighter. For example, a second story addition to a house should be designed so that it does not appear heavier than the portion of the building that supports it. 
(3)  Compatibility. Where the character of an area is identifiable, additions, renovations and new accessory structures should be designed to maintain that character. In areas where the character is not identifiable, additions, renovations and new accessory structures should be designed to be complementary or consistent with the characteristics of the surrounding area in a way that contributes to the establishment of a positive character for the area. Strategies to achieve this include, but are not limited to: 
a.  Using similar or complementary materials, colors or design details. 
b.  Using similar or complementary building shapes and/or forms. 
(Code 1975, § 58-8.102; Ord. No. 2183, § 1, 8-10-92; Ord. No. 2547, § 5, 6-28-99; Ord. No. 2815, § 35, 2-24-04; Ord. No. 3070, §§ 2, 3, 9-23-08; Ord. No. 3165, § 1, 4-12-11) 
Sec. 18-474. - Residential design review procedures. 
(a)  Requirements. After the effective date of this section, no building permit shall be issued for the construction of a residential structure until the applicant has produced evidence that the design of each unit for which a permit is being requested has been approved pursuant to the residential design standards in this Part 2 of Division 2 of this article. 
(b)  Application filing. Applications for design review approval shall be submitted to the director or designee. Such applications shall include an application form approved by the city, and one or more scale drawings of each elevation of each dwelling unit, or dwelling unit model, that is subject to design requirements pursuant to this ordinance. All application materials shall be in adequate detail to enable the director to determine whether each of the required standards has been met. 
(c)  Review and action. The director, or designee, shall review each application for design review approval and act to approve, approve with conditions or deny the application based on the approval criteria. 
(d)  Approval criteria. The director, or designee, determines that the proposed development will comply with the Comprehensive Plan, all applicable zoning and subdivision requirements, and all applicable requirements of Part 2 of Division 2 of this article. 
(e)  Approval language. 
(1)  The design review approval document shall state that: 
a.  All homes covered by the approval must be constructed as shown in the application documents except as such designs may have been amended by conditions attached to the approval; and 
b.  The design review approval will be valid for a period of three years from the date of design review approval. 
(2)  Design review approval shall be extended up to one year for a single phase project if at least 30 percent of the building permits have been issued. Only one such extension shall be granted. If design review has been approved for a phased project, the design review will be void if no building permit is applied for within the three-year period. If one phase is completed which accounts for at least 30 percent of the total project, the design review approval for the remaining phases shall be valid for an additional three years from the date of completion of the first phase. The issuance of a certificate of occupancy (CO) for the last building constructed in a phase shall mark the completion of that phase. Only one such extension shall be granted for multiphased projects. 
(f)  Notice of decision. Notice of the decision shall be mailed to the applicant. 
(g)  Appeal. Appeals of the decision of the director shall be to the board. 
(h)  Variances. If specific site conditions make it impossible or clearly impractical to construct the dwelling units as shown on the design review application or as required by the design standards, the applicant may request a variance from the terms of the design review approval through the city's standard zoning variance procedure. The variance process may not be used to vary the terms of a design review approval where the site conditions supporting the variance were caused by the applicant or known to the applicant at the time of the design review application. 
(i)  Amendments. Any design review approval granted pursuant to this section may be amended by filing a new application for design review, together with all supporting documents. 
(j)  Lapse of approval. The right to construct residential structures in accordance with a design review approval shall lapse and be of no further effect with respect to any homes for which a building permit has not been obtained within three years of the date of design review approval unless an extension has been granted under [subsection] (e) above. 
(k)  Enforcement. Any violation of this section, including without limitation, construction of any new single-family detached or duplex dwelling unit without first obtaining design review approval, or filing false or misleading information on design review application, shall be a violation of the Thornton Zoning Ordinance, and shall be subject to all the enforcement provisions of that ordinance. Without limiting the generality of the previous sentence, this section may be enforced by withholding residential building permits, suspending or revoking building permits previously granted, or issuing stop work orders effective until violations of this section have been corrected. 
(l)  Building permits. No building permit relating to any non-exempt residential development shall be issued until the applicant has received a design review approval pursuant to the terms of this section. 
(Ord. No. 2547, § 3, 6-28-99; Ord. No. 2687, § 11, 10-22-01; Ord. No. 2815, § 36, 2-24-04; Ord. No. 3165, § 1, 4-12-11) 
Secs. 18-475-18-484. - Reserved. 
Part 3. - Commercial Design Standards for Projects of Five Acres and Larger 

Sec. 18-485. - General provisions. 
(a)  Applicability. Regulations in this Part 3 of Division 2 of this article apply to all commercial development of five acres or larger, in the Neighborhood Service, Community Retail, Regional Commercial and City Center zoning districts, as well as Planned Development zoning districts that are commercial in nature, which are submitted for review after the adoption of these standards. 
(b)  Purpose. These standards implement the Thornton Comprehensive Plan and promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the residents of the City of Thornton by encouraging high quality in the siting, organization, and construction of new commercial developments in Thornton and, more specifically, by: 
(1)  Promoting new commercial development that is distinctive, has character, and relates and connects to established Thornton developments; 
(2)  Encouraging site planning that responds to the existing natural and built environment on and adjacent to the site, including preservation of existing trees, vegetation, wildlife habitat, stream corridors, wetlands, and manmade cultural resources such as agricultural buildings and irrigation ditches; 
(3)  Encouraging organization of new commercial development into cohesive developments that are safe and pedestrian friendly; 
(4)  Encouraging vehicular and pedestrian connections within and between new commercial development and adjacent and surrounding residential and commercial land uses, and parks and open space/trail systems; and 
(5)  Providing variety in commercial design and type in order to reduce the adverse visual monotony of commercial design often associated with large-scale commercial development. 
(c)  Conflicting provisions and relationship with other regulations. In addition to the requirements in this Part 3 of Division 2 of this article, an applicant shall comply with all other applicable city land development regulations, ordinances, and requirements. When the provisions of these commercial design standards are inconsistent with one another, or when the provisions of these commercial design standards conflict with provisions found in other parts of Chapter 18 of the City Code, or in any other city ordinance or regulation, the more restrictive provision, and that which more specifically applies to a given situation, shall govern unless otherwise determined by the director. Except as otherwise provided herein, the director's decision regarding issues pertaining to the administration of these regulations shall be final. 
(d)  Green design practices. The City of Thornton encourages sustainable and "green" practices through all phases of site planning and building design for the purpose of reducing energy consumption, waste, natural resource use, and overall building impacts on human health and the environment. Commercial developments should consider practices outlined by the U.S. Green Building Council for Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design (LEED) certification. Practices shall comply with Thornton City Code and Colorado State law and may include: 
(1)  Utilization of energy efficient materials and technology. 
(2)  Utilization of renewable resources and sustainable materials. 
(3)  Utilization of non-toxic materials. 
(4)  Design consideration of the resource consumption and pollution emissions over the building's complete life cycle. 
(Ord. No. 3070, § 4, 9-23-08; Ord. No. 3095, § 1, 4-28-09; Ord. No. 3165, § 1, 4-12-11) 
Sec. 18-486. - Reserved. 
Sec. 18-487. - Commercial site planning and site design standards. 
(a)  General. Site planning is the design process for the development of land; it considers the relationship of off-site and on-site compatibility, and the purpose for which land is to be used. In general, buildings should be located so as to be visible from major roadways and entries, to provide clear orientation and access for vehicular and pedestrian traffic alike. Likewise, structures should be located in consideration of the existing built context, the location of adjoining uses, and the location of major roadways. For development projects on sites that are 15 acres or larger, appropriately located pedestrian courtyards, common gathering areas and accessible, well-landscaped environments that encourage pedestrian movement both within the new commercial development and among adjacent land uses are encouraged. 
(b)  Site orientation. 
(1)  Site planning must take into consideration the existing grade and slope of the site as well as existing grades and building elevations off-site. Grading of property must be sensitive and compatible with surrounding properties and public streets. Commercial properties adjacent to existing or future residential properties will be restricted in raising the elevation of the commercial site unless approved by the city. Site planning shall consider the relationship of buildings and detention areas to natural grades and visibility from adjacent roads and properties. Final grades within landscaped areas cannot exceed 25 percent (4:1). The use of terraced parking lots, stepped building pads, retaining walls and larger setbacks may be necessary. The use of landscaped, sloped areas is preferable to retaining walls. Retaining wall heights are limited to a maximum height of four feet measured from the highest point of grade, unless otherwise authorized by the director. 
(2)  Natural site amenities such as mature trees, creeks, riparian corridors and other features unique to the site shall be identified and considered for preservation. All wetlands shall be identified as determined by a qualified wetland consultant. The Corps of Engineers shall approve the delineation of federally mandated wetlands. Any impact to a federally mandated wetland shall be mitigated in accordance with the Corps of Engineers regulations. 
(3)  Flood corridors are located within the 100-year floodplain, and should remain undeveloped to prevent flood damage and to preserve the riparian habitat and wildlife associated with the area. The filling in of flood plains will generally be prohibited. 
(4)  All endangered or threatened species of plants or animals shall be identified and the habitat of such species should be considered for preservation as determined by the Colorado Division of Wildlife, United States Fish and Game Service or other appropriate agencies. This is the responsibility of the property owner. 
(5)  Site planning shall provide for the fire department/emergency access, and such access shall be labeled on the development permit as "Fire Lane." 
(6)  Existing and planned bus stops shall be shown on the development permit. 
(c)  General layout and design. 
(1)  General commercial development projects and buildings must be designed in a manner to create the impression of a unified project and overall sense of a unique or identifiable place. 
(2)  Linear "strip" development is discouraged, particularly on sites 15 acres or larger. This type of development is characterized by uses that are only one store deep and buildings are arranged in a linear fashion rather than clustered. 
(3)  Any planned freestanding pad sites should not be developed until construction has begun on the principle portion of the property. Construction phasing must be indicated in the developer's agreement. The timing of construction of pad sites or individual lots may be subject to further restrictions. 
(4)  A sense of entry or arrival must be created at primary entryways into the development. Building placement, landscaping, gates, entry monuments, specialty lighting and other design elements can be used to create this design effect. 
(5)  The development area immediately adjacent to the intersection of two arterial streets should generally be free from a building location in order to maintain public views into the development from the intersection. This area must be enhanced with landscaping; however some parking may be acceptable. For development projects on sites that are 15 acres or larger, this area is generally the average size of adjacent pad sites and the length along each stretch of arterial street frontage should be about equal. The design approach to creating open space and maintaining views at the corner will be evaluated on a site-by-site basis. 
(6)  Pavement grades should not exceed five percent longitudinal slope within a parking area and seven percent longitudinal slope in drive aisles that do not have parking stalls along the aisles. Site entry/exit aisles shall not exceed four percent longitudinal slope from the public street to 50-feet into the site. The 50-feet shall be measured from the property line. Sidewalk cross slopes shall not exceed two percent. Sidewalk longitudinal slopes shall comply with the Americans with Disabilities Act requirements. Handicapped accessible routes must be accessible to, but separated from, parking areas as shown in Figure 487.1. The slope may be no greater than 1:12. 

Figure 487.1
(7)  An exterior lighting plan indicating site and building light fixtures and lighting levels shall be prepared by a qualified consultant and submitted to the city for review and approval in conjunction with the development permit. Parking lots should be illuminated with energy efficient lighting such as high pressure sodium (HPS) fixtures. Off-site glare onto adjacent properties or right-of-way is not permitted. Over-lighting areas and high contrast between properties should be avoided. Concealment of the light source must be a design consideration. Parking lot lights shall not exceed 35-feet in height. Refer to Section 18-491 for exterior lighting regulations. 
(d)  Pedestrian amenities. 
(1)  The following criteria apply to development projects on sites that are 15 acres or larger: 
a.  Amenities such as courtyards or plazas, as shown in Figure 487.2, shall be included within the overall and individual site plans, and shall be functional and designed as part of the overall project, as opposed to being relegated to "ancillary" spaces unsuitable for other uses. 

Figure 487.2
b.  Pedestrian open spaces should be furnished with benches, landscaping, fountains, play areas and other amenities designed to create a sense of enclosure. Where feasible, establish some areas that will be useable throughout the year (e.g., buffered from the elements, open to sunshine). 
c.  Public art should be integrated into the design of buildings and public spaces to expand the public experience through enhancement of the aesthetic environment. Such art may include paintings, sculptures, stained glass, statues, bas reliefs, engravings, carvings, frescoes, mobiles, murals, collages, mosaics, drawings, and monuments. 
d.  Areas devoted to pedestrian use should be delineated through the use of accent paving (maximum 0.25-inch groove depth), landscaping, lighting, and outdoor furniture. 
e.  Pedestrian open spaces should be located to take advantage of existing landmarks, natural land forms or activities. 
f.  All such amenities shall be owned and maintained by the property owner or property owner association. 
(2)  These criteria are encouraged for development projects on sites less than 15 acres. 
(e)  Site coverage. 
(1)  No more than 70 percent within each parcel and for the entire commercial development shall be covered with buildings, parking and driveways. 
(2)  No less than 30 percent within each parcel and for a commercial development as a whole shall be open space. Such spaces, at the discretion of the city, may include pedestrian areas, such as sidewalks, plazas and other areas designed for pedestrian activity. 
(f)  General landscape guidelines. 
(1)  The landscaping shall have a consistency of design and landscape material throughout the entire site. A small palette of high impact plants should be chosen from the overall plant palette as "signature plants" to be woven throughout the site or to be used on every lot or pad site. 
(2)  The overall plant palette should incorporate a wide variety of plants to create a diversity of seasonal interest. The landscape should be designed with regard to layering and be comprised of three levels: the canopy level; consisting of large shade and evergreen trees, the understory level; consisting of ornamental trees specialty evergreens and large shrubs and the ground plane level; consisting of low shrubs, ornamental grasses, perennials and spreading groundcovers. Plant massing for visual effect or to punctuate a theme is encouraged. 
(3)  Outside seating areas should be designed to take advantage of view corridors such as the mountain vistas or oriented towards internal landscape areas wherever possible. 
(4)  Detention, retention and water quality ponds shall be integrated physically, functionally, and aesthetically into the adjacent landscape design. 
(5)  Water wise landscape principles and water conserving irrigation methods shall be implemented into the landscape design. 
(Ord. No. 3070, § 4, 9-23-08; Ord. No. 3095, § 1, 4-28-09; Ord. No. 3165, § 1, 4-12-11) 
Sec. 18-488. - Vehicular and pedestrian circulation. 
(a)  General. The City of Thornton encourages the design of safe vehicular and pedestrian circulation systems, through the minimal use of access points to private property from public roadways. Where applicable, a clear and carefully planned hierarchy must be demonstrated for the vehicular and pedestrian design systems, and must be expressed in all street and landscape designs. Pedestrian routes within the development should be integrated to provide a comprehensive circulation system offering convenient, safe and visually attractive accesses to all areas of the development. 
(b)  Site access points and driveways. 
(1)  Where applicable, maintain a consistent design treatment of roadways and intersections along major roadways within each commercial development in order to establish visual continuity, and facilitate convenient and safe circulation. 
(2)  Access points along major routes should be limited in number and location; driveways should be planned and shared between properties, and access easements noted on the subdivision plat. See Figure 488.1. 

Figure 488.1
(3)  Entrances into commercial developments along arterial and collector streets should be enhanced through the design of signs, hardscape elements and upgraded landscaping and/or lighting. Design elements should be visually interesting and consistent with other arterial streetscapes used within the overall development. 
(4)  Access drives of 500 feet or longer must incorporate design elements, such as a traffic circle, angle/offset, or other form of speed deterrent approved by the director. 
(c)  Vehicular circulation. 
(1)  The internal vehicular circulation should interconnect in an obvious and consistent manner. 
(2)  Commercial developments should be linked to surrounding areas through the extension of existing or planned streets and sidewalks through the development, as shown in Figure 488.2. 

Figure 488.2
(3)  Parking aisles should be separated from vehicular circulation routes and entry drives. 
(4)  Drive-thru uses must be designed with dedicated drive-thru lanes that allow for the stacking of no less than five vehicles measured at 18 feet per vehicle, and must be sufficient to prevent "spill over" into adjacent parking areas, circulation aisles or streets. Such lanes must not block access to parking stalls or pedestrian access to the building. 
(d)  Pedestrian access and circulation. 
(1)  Site planning must provide for a separation of pedestrian from vehicular circulation. Pedestrian circulation must be provided from the perimeter of the site, and connect to all buildings within the site in an obvious and consistent manner. Parking stall overhang into any sidewalk or landscape area shall require an increase in the minimum sidewalk or landscape area by the depth of the overhang. 
(2)  For development projects on sites that are 15 acres or larger, pedestrian crosswalks within the development must be distinguished from the driving surface by the use of bricks, integrally colored and scored concrete, (maximum 0.25-inch groove depth) or other methods approved through the development permit process, as shown in Figure 488.3. 

Figure 488.3
(3)  For development projects on sites that are 15 acres or larger, sidewalk areas in front of buildings shall be designed to accommodate pedestrian activity. Restaurants with patios should have a wider sidewalk to allow pedestrians to pass. Landscaping must occur within or adjacent to these areas. This landscaping should consist of, but not be limited to, raised planters, trees in grates, large pots of seasonal interest plant material and other hardscape accents to create "topography" and pedestrian seating areas. 
a.  Sidewalks in front of or adjacent to buildings of less than 10,000 square feet must not be less than eight feet in width (exclusive of auto overhang); 
b.  Sidewalks in front or adjacent to buildings of more than 10,000 square feet must not be less than 15 feet in width. 
(4)  For development projects on sites that are 15 acres or larger, passenger drop-off areas should be incorporated within the design of commercial development projects, and should include a clear separation between vehicular traffic within the drop-off and parking/circulation areas. See Figure 488.4. 

Figure 488.4
a.  Drop-off lanes should be designed to avoid obstructing the flow of traffic. 
b.  The use of textured paving, or other easily-distinguishable raised surface (maximum 0.25-inch groove depth), should be used to delineate drop-off areas. 
c.  Appropriate signage should be used to indicate the location and time limitations for drop-off areas. 
(Ord. No. 3070, § 4, 9-23-08; Ord. No. 3095, § 1, 4-28-09; Ord. No. 3165, § 1, 4-12-11) 
Sec. 18-489. - Parking and public transportation. 
(a)  General. Parking areas shall be established in such a manner that they clearly meet the location and quantity requirements of their specific uses, without detracting from either the effectiveness of other forms of transportation, or the pedestrian environment. The use of parking structures should be considered within large commercial developments due to their economies of space; they should, however clearly relate to the structures served, as well as enhance the overall character of the development. If developed in phases, the location and size requirements for future parking shall be anticipated. The amount of parking required per development shall be calculated based on the current parking regulations of the City of Thornton. Parking for bicycles shall be included within the parking plan. 
(b)  Surface parking. 
(1)  Parking areas for development projects on sites that are 15 acres or larger should be divided into a series of smaller, interconnected lots. Parking aisles in long, straight configurations that facilitate speeding shall be avoided. See Figure 489.1. 

Figure 489.1
(2)  Parking areas should be separated from buildings by raised concrete walkways (with design features), landscaped strips, or both. Parking spaces, other than those providing access for handicapped drivers, should not directly abut structures. 
(3)  Dead-end aisles are not allowed, unless adequate space for an unimpeded turn-around is provided. 
(4)  Parking aisles should be located perpendicular to buildings, so that pedestrians walk parallel to moving vehicles. See Figure 489.2. 

Figure 489.2
(5)  A landscaped island shall be provided for every 18 parking spaces. 
(6)  Landscaped islands should be used at the end of each parking aisle, and may include handicapped access ramps. These end islands shall not contain any shrubs, ornamental grasses or perennials that grow higher than 30 inches or any trees with canopies that are lower than eight feet to maintain adequate visibility for drivers. 
(7)  Parking lot wheel stops are prohibited in surface lots unless used to protect structures or pedestrian areas. 
(8)  Handicapped parking spaces and accessible routes shall be provided consistent with ADA standards. 
(c)  Parking requirements. 
(1)  Minimum parking requirements per parcel or use within the commercial development shall meet the requirements of the Code and shall be incorporated within the overall design. 
(2)  For development projects on sites that are 15 acres or larger, the maximum number of parking spaces shall not exceed 125 percent of the number of spaces required by Code. 
(d)  Parking structures. 
(1)  The Architectural Design Standards Section 18-493 shall apply to the design of all parking structures, the ground level of which shall be designed so as to complement the overall architectural theme of the development, while providing a visually engaging environment for the pedestrian.

(1)  Locations for bicycle parking shall be easily accessible to building entrances for both customers and employees, to maximize their ease of use and visibility. 
(2)  Avoid positioning of racks where they will obstruct building entrances, or the flow of pedestrian traffic. 
(3)  Consider the use of shelters to provide protection from the elements, and coordinate their design with adjacent buildings or street furniture. 
(4)  Select bicycle racks that provide options for use by a range of bicycle types, and for a variety of security devices. 
(5)  Coordinate the location of bicycle parking spaces with public transportation stops. 
(g)  Shared parking among multiple buildings or lots. Shared parking among adjacent uses, especially those with staggered peak parking demands is encouraged. If approved through the development permit process, a reduction in the total number of required parking spaces may be considered (up to a maximum of 80 percent of any recommended reduction), based upon an approved parking study conducted at the owner's expense. For example, an approved parking study indicating that adjacent uses might effectively share parking facilities, and which suggests a reduction of 100 spaces in the overall number of combined spaces required under subsection (c) of these regulations, may be considered for a maximum reduction of 80 spaces (80 percent of the study-recommended 100 space reduction). 
(h)  Provisions for future parking. Multi-phase projects shall anticipate the size requirements for future parking, and reserve adequate space for that purpose, as well as taking into consideration the possibility of changes in use of the buildings within the development. 
(i)  Public transportation facilities. 
(1)  General. Commercial developments shall accommodate facilities for public transportation if located along transit routes. Access points and bus stop/shelter locations serving commercial developments should be designed in such a manner that their use is convenient for those patronizing the development.

Sec. 18-490. - Signage. 
(a)  General. All signage shall conform to the Code, and should serve to inform, identify, direct; each structure within the development shall be clearly identifiable, and the overall development shall demonstrate a uniform and comprehensive sign design package. All signage should contribute to the aesthetic appeal of the development, yet remain secondary to architectural and landscape design elements. A comprehensive sign plan shall be submitted with the development permit as required in Article VII. A permit shall be required for all signs. 
(b)  Coordination of design. All signage shall be coordinated throughout all phases of the development, so as to give the appearance of a unified, cohesive development as well as to contribute to the overall design theme of the development. 
(c)  Location/placement. 
(1)  Monument signs shall not be placed within the sight triangle of any intersection or access drive with a public right-of-way or private drive. 
(2)  Monument signs should be located in a planter setting within a landscaped area. 
(3)  Signage on the back/rear elevations of structures abutting residentially-zoned properties shall not exceed four square feet in size and shall not be illuminated. 
(4)  Signs shall not be placed on roof slopes. 
(5)  All elevated signs, whether freestanding or building-mounted, shall be mounted at least seven feet from grade, or otherwise provide adequate overhead clearance so as to not endanger pedestrian, bicycle or vehicular traffic.

(Ord. No. 3070, § 4, 9-23-08; Ord. No. 3095, § 1, 4-28-09; Ord. No. 3165, § 1, 4-12-11) 
Sec. 18-492. - Walls and fencing. 
(a)  General. Fences and walls should be decorative in nature, and generally contribute to the visual quality of the project or development, while being by design as unobtrusive as possible. A combination of fencing and landscaping should be incorporated wherever practicable. A permit shall be required for all walls and fences. 
(b)  Requirements. 
(1)  For development projects on sites that are 15 acres or larger, screening for loading docks and service areas shall be a minimum of six feet high and constructed of materials and finishes that are compatible with, and complementary of, the main building. This standard is encouraged for projects under 15 acres as well. 
(2)  All authorized outside storage shall be screened. 
(3)  Screen all utility equipment, meters and transformers from view with fencing, walls, landscaping, or a combination of the three. 
(4)  A screening wall must have staggered sections and columns, or other visual relief, every 50 feet, as shown in Figure 492.1. 

Figure 492.1
(c)  Design and materials. Walls and fencing shall be constructed of materials and finishes that are compatible with, and complementary of, the adjacent building architecture. 
(1)  Retaining wall heights are limited to a maximum height of four feet measured from the highest point of grade, unless otherwise authorized by the director. 
(2)  Perimeter fences and walls (those 42 inches in height or greater) shall be of two-sided construction. 
(3)  Chain-link and related fencing shall not be used unless approved through the Development process. 
(4)  For development projects on sites that are 15 acres or larger, fences and walls should be constructed from durable material such as stone, brick, metal having a dark finish (e.g., wrought iron), or any combination approved through the development permit process. Other fencing materials may be considered for development projects on sites that are less than 15 acres. 
(5)  Concrete walls are permitted only when faced with masonry or stone, or if the surface is scored or textured. 
(Ord. No. 3070, § 4, 9-23-08; Ord. No. 3095, § 1, 4-28-09; Ord. No. 3165, § 1, 4-12-11) 
Sec. 18-493. - Architectural design. 
(a)  General. The architectural design of commercial structures shall consider and accommodate the overall desire of the city to create and enhance the livability and ambience of the community, while creating or contributing to a unique sense of place. In areas with existing structures, the architectural design of new projects should serve to enhance, rather than detract from, any existing design. 
(b)  Setbacks. Building setbacks should contribute to the creation of an aesthetically pleasing, well-landscaped and pedestrian-friendly environment along major streets and within commercial development projects. For development projects on sites that are 15 acres or larger, the surrounding of buildings or wrapping of project perimeters with parking lots is strongly discouraged. 
(1)  Building and parking lot setbacks are measured from property lines after dedication of all required future rights-of-way. 
(2)  For development projects on sites that are 15 acres or larger, building setbacks are based on a maximum building height of 35 feet as determined by the Code; buildings approved with heights in excess of 35 feet may be accompanied by additional setback requirements. 
(3)  For development projects on sites that are 15 acres or larger, unless waived or otherwise amended through the development permit process, the following building and parking lot setbacks shall apply: 
Category Building 
Setback 
in feet Parking 
Setback 
in feet Arterial and collector streets 25 25 Local streets 25 25 Internal access drives a 20 0 Interior property within the commercial development 0/15 0 Property line adjacent to Nonresidential property 0/15 0 Property line adjacent to Residential or Public Property b, c 50 25  
a. Primary, private, access drives that connect to public streets. Sidewalks may be situated within these setbacks (measurement from the face of the nearest curb along the drive.) 
b. No wall of any drive-thru business, car wash or automobile service station is permitted within 100 feet of any residential district boundary. 
c. At minimum, a masonry wall of no less than eight feet in height is required within the setback area adjacent to residential or public property, and shall include points of pedestrian access between the commercial and adjacent residential developments. Additional buffering, such as increased wall height and intensive landscaping may be required. Vinyl fencing may also be considered in limited applications, in conjunction with berming, increased setback and intensive landscaping. 
(c)  Coordination of design. Unless otherwise approved through the development permit process, the use of "360-degree" architecture shall be required for all commercial structures; all sides of all structures shall be subject to the same architectural style, materials, and details as the front elevation. 
(1)  Unless otherwise approved through a conceptual site plan, all structures within a development, shall maintain a consistent style/architectural theme; this includes all "pads" within a retail development, as well as gasoline pump canopies and/or other accessory structures. 
(2)  In general, buildings in development projects on sites that are 15 acres or larger should be oriented in relation to one another so as to create meaningful pedestrian plazas or corridors, as shown in Figure 493.1. 

Figure 493.1
(d)  Building height and massing. Building heights should be minimized and of compatible scale with existing or planned development; the base of each building should appear to be "weightier" or "anchored" closely to the ground through the use of heavier, larger or darker building materials, although actual building heights are expected to vary, in particular adjacent to major public roadways and, possibly, along the perimeter of the development. Buildings shall provide visual interest at the scale of the pedestrian, which appear to both reduce mass and relate to local architectural character. Buildings shall relate to geographical features and one another in their massing and forms; "box-like" structures comprised of large or plain unarticulated vertical surfaces shall not be acceptable. 
(1)  The maximum height of any commercial building shall be consistent with that described within the appropriate zoning district, contained within the Code. 
a.  Architectural elements (e.g., domes, towers, spires, crosses) may exceed the maximum height limit for the district, when specifically approved through the development permit process. 
b.  New development should relate to adjacent landscaped areas and be compatible with, and transition from, the height of adjacent existing or planned development, as shown in Figure 493.2. 

Figure 493.2
(2)  Façades in excess of 50 feet in length must incorporate architectural features or treatments to diminish apparent building mass. 
(3)  Similarly, other techniques shall be incorporated for the purpose of reducing the apparent massing and scale of buildings. The following techniques should be used to accomplish this requirement; additional techniques proposed by the applicant may be considered: 
a.  Variations in façade color, texture, or both. 
b.  Variations in roof forms and heights of roof elements. 
c.  Compositions that emphasize floor lines, or otherwise express rhythms and patterns of windows, columns, and other architectural features. 
d.  Express the position of each floor in the external design. Terracing, articulated structural elements, a change in materials, or the use of belt courses or similar horizontal trimbands of contrasting color and/or materials can be used to define floor lines. 
e.  Use windows, trellises, wall articulation, arcades, material changes, awnings or other features to avoid blank walls at ground floor levels. 
f.  The use of materials relatable to human proportions, such as brick, tile, modular stone, stucco, glass and decorative tiles. 
g.  Columns, pilasters, canopies, porticos, awnings, brackets, arches or other such architectural features. 
h.  Windows revealing or accentuating indoor amenities and activities. 
(e)  Roof forms and materials. Three-dimensional rooftops are encouraged, and a variation in roofline is suggested to assist in reducing the scale of large buildings. Likewise, rooftops should contribute to the overall unified appearance of the development, and consideration should be made regarding their appearance from multiple angles (in particular, higher areas, ground level and roadways). 
(1)  Rooflines without variation, such as shown in Figure 493.3, in excess of 50 feet should be avoided. 

Figure 493.3
(2)  Flat roofs are prohibited, unless concealed through the use of parapets, or other features. 
(3)  Each building should have a defined top, which can be accomplished with the use of cornices, caps, parapets, or other features. See Figure 493.4. 

Figure 493.4
(4)  Roof forms should be designed so as to denote building elements and functions such as pedestrian entrances, arcades and porches; overhanging eaves, sloped roofs and three or more roof planes may be required. 
(5)  Roof forms should relate to adjacent buildings or developments. 
(6)  Flat canopies (e.g., convenience stores, gasoline sales) must be designed so as to create a strong architectural association with the principal associated building. Columns must be constructed so as to provide a visual appearance of substance. 
(7)  Roof top mechanical units shall be screened from view, using architecturally integrated screening units, roof parapets or sloped roof forms that appear as integral elements of the overall building design. See Figure 493.5. 

Figure 493.5
a.  If anticipated to be visible from any existing or future surrounding building, property or street, all rooftop equipment must be painted to match the surrounding rooftop colors. 
b.  Solar panels are exempt from roof top screening requirements. 
(8)  Sloped roofs and canopies shall be covered with high quality roofing materials such as natural clay tiles, slate, concrete tiles (having natural texture and color), high quality standing seam metal roofing, or high profile, three-dimensional asphalt/fiberglass shingles. Metal roofs shall have a low gloss finish to reduce glare. 
(f)  Building materials and colors. Exterior materials and colors shall be aesthetically pleasing, of a high quality and compatible with the materials and colors of adjacent or nearby structures; the color and intensity of color of all building materials shall be approved through the development permit process. 
(1)  Building materials. 
a.  Exterior wall materials must be muted, and the use of brick, masonry, stone, fluted or split-faced block and stucco (including EIFS) as primary building materials shall be required, unless otherwise determined by the city. 
b.  Materials for use in conjunction with brick, masonry, stone and stucco include: 
1.  Pre-cast concrete which must have integral color, contain other materials embedded within and be articulated with design detailing, or have application of other building materials to create detailed design interest. 
2.  Tilt-up concrete panels with brick or stone facing. 
3.  Wood siding may be considered for use in limited applications, but not as a primary building material. 
c.  Highly reflective materials, such as bright aluminum and glass, are not permitted as the primary building material, in particular at the pedestrian level. 
d.  Large blank, featureless or uniform surfaces are prohibited. 
e.  The use of heavier materials, such as natural stone and masonry materials, on the lower three to five feet of buildings to help visually anchor them to the ground is encouraged. 
f.  High quality, low-maintenance materials are encouraged, as are durable building materials that will age well. 
(2)  Building colors. 
a.  In general, subdued colors typical of the muted native grasses, wood, rocks and soil of the high Colorado plains and the city's natural setting are to be used as primary colors. The use of warm and darker tones, with low reflectivity is recommended, although alternate color schemes may be approved through the development permit process. 
b.  Accent and trim colors shall complement and enhance the effect of the primary building color. 
c.  Roof colors shall be muted or otherwise be compatible with the dominant building color. 
d.  Use of bright colors (including bright white) that may streak, fade or generate glare is generally discouraged. 
e.  A bright or primary color used for accent elements such as door and window frames, and architectural details may be considered when incorporated into a set of overall design guidelines. 
f.  Unless otherwise approved through the development permit process, colors or accents considered by the city to be bold, brash, intense, fluorescent, black or metallic shall not be used. 
(g)  Prohibited or restricted elements. The following examples of prohibited or restricted elements are to be considered an inclusive, but not exhaustive list of such elements. Where there is a dispute regarding these regulations, the decision of the director shall be considered final, unless otherwise approved through the development permit process. 
(1)  The use of smooth-faced concrete block, tilt-up concrete panels (unless textured or having integral color), metal siding, and large expanses of unarticulated stucco shall be prohibited as a predominant exterior building material. 
(2)  Building or design elements that may function as signage. 
(3)  Roof lights. 
(4)  Translucent, plexiglass, glossy metal, or backlit vinyl awnings or illumination of such awnings. 
(5)  Reflective or mirrored glass at pedestrian levels. 
(h)  Architectural details. 
(1)  Building entrances. 
a.  Building entrances should be easily identified through the use of design and detailing, as well as relate to the human scale. 
b.  Locate main entrances to be clearly identifiable from primary driveways and drop-offs. Incorporate clearly defined, highly visible customer entrances for principal building within a development. Although encouraged for all development, each entrance for development projects on sites that are 15 acres or larger shall be enhanced with at least three of the following features: 
1.  Canopies or porticos; 
2.  Overhangs; 
3.  Recesses/projections; 
4.  Arcades; 
5.  Raised corniced parapets over the door; 
6.  Peaked roof forms; 
7.  Arches; 
8.  Outdoor patios; 
9.  Display windows; 
10.  Architectural details such as tile work and moldings that are integrated into the building structure and design; and 
11.  Integral planters or wing walls that incorporate landscaped areas and/or places for sitting. 
c.  Primary entrances should be designed to be accessible to handicapped users without having to utilize complex ramp systems to comply with ADA landing requirements. 
d.  All entrances shall be effectively lit. 
e.  The use of entranceways as transitions from the building to the ground, through the use of walls, terraces, grading and plant materials should be considered. 
f.  The use of terraces or porticos to define entrances should be considered. 
(2)  Windows/glass. 
a.  The use of highly reflective or glare-producing glass with a reflective factor of 0.25 or greater is prohibited. 
b.  Clear or tinted glass shall be used for storefronts, windows and doors. 
c.  For development projects on sites that are 15 acres or larger, the use of windows is required in areas where there exists significant pedestrian activity, or to assist in breaking up the appearance of blank and/or unarticulated walls.

a.  Providing visual appeal to all buildings when viewed from any side. All sides of all buildings shall be treated with the same degree of architectural style and detail as the front elevation of the building. This shall include items such as architectural lighting, decorative features and building materials. 
b.  Canopy. 
1.  The design of the canopy shall not rely on flat, blank surfaces. The canopy shall include details such as beveling, fascia and/or cornice treatments to enhance the visual appeal of the canopy. No more than two colors shall be used on the area of the fascia not used in sign area. 
2.  The columns that support the canopy shall be designed in a manner that is compatible with the other features on the site. Close attention should be given to column size, color and materials. Elements used on buildings such as brick, stone and decorative bonds shall also be used on the columns. 
c.  Using roof types such as gable and hip. Where flat roofs are used, canopies, cornice treatments and other design features shall be used to provide visual relief and avoid the appearance of plain, box-like buildings. 
d.  Using high quality roofing materials such as clay tile and metal seam. 
(2)  A consistent design and color theme shall be used throughout a development. Buildings such as car washes, canopies and accessory structures are to be designed to be consistent with or complementary to the main building within the development. Strategies to achieve this include, but are not limited to: 
a.  Using complementary or consistent details, shapes, materials and colors on all buildings and structures on the site. 
b.  Using complementary roof styles on all buildings and structures. 
c.  Installing screen fences and trash enclosures with design and materials consistent with buildings on the site. 
d.  Constructing monument signs with high quality materials such as brick or stone which are compatible with the other buildings on the site. 
e.  Utilizing signage in which the colors, lettering, placement and materials follow a coordinated design theme for the site. 
f.  Providing similar architectural lighting on all buildings on the site. 
g.  Using a color scheme with a limited number of well-matched colors that is consistent on all buildings. 
(3)  Buildings should be designed so that there is sufficient relief in building façades, especially those viewed from the street. Use of large flat and unbroken planes shall be avoided. Strategies to achieve this include, but are not limited to: 
a.  Using materials and colors to provide contrast and accents. 
b.  Using stone, brick and masonry materials having rough, irregular surfaces and sunken or beveled joints. 
c.  Providing relief of exterior masonry walls through the use of patterns or bonds to increase their visual appeal. 
d.  Using window and door openings to break up the façade into identifiable visual elements. 
e.  Using architectural lighting to provide visual relief during night time hours. 
(c)  Massing and scale. 
(1)  The bulk of buildings shall be broken up into smaller areas. Box-like designs are to be avoided. Strategies to achieve this include, but are not limited to: 
a.  Using a variety of shapes and forms including roof overhangs, varied roof lines, pitched roofs, towers and other architectural features as well as color accents. 
b.  Breaking up large expanses of walls through the use of windows, materials and color variations. 
c.  Using the appropriate proportions for each structure on the site. Transitions should be made between buildings of different sizes through the use of grading, roof pitches and materials. 
d.  Utilizing architectural lighting including ornamental armatures, fixtures, etc. 
(2)  The arrangement of the buildings and their relative proportion to one another shall be logical and well organized. Strategies to achieve this include, but are not limited to: 
a.  Designing the roof of the retail building so that it is at least equal in height to the canopy and is the more prominent visual element on the site. This can be accomplished through a variety of techniques including lowering the fueling area through grading relative to the street and lowering the canopy height to the minimum allowed by the Building Code. 
b.  Designing the canopy and the columns that support the canopy so that the two elements are in balance. The size of the columns shall not be out-of-proportion to the size of the canopy. 
c.  Minimizing the bulk of the canopy through the use of colors. Attention must be given to the impact that color has on the canopy. 
(d)  Compatibility. 
(1)  Where the character of the area surrounding a proposed motor vehicle fueling station is identifiable and is of high quality, development of a new motor vehicle fueling station shall maintain that character. In areas where the character is not identifiable or is of low quality, new motor vehicle fueling stations shall be designed so they contribute to the establishment of a positive character for the area. Motor vehicle fueling stations shall also be designed so that the potential negative impacts associated with these facilities are minimized. Strategies to achieve this include, but are not limited to: 
a.  Using similar or complementary materials, colors or design details to those used in surrounding development. 
b.  Using similar or complementary building shapes and/or forms to those used in surrounding development. 
(2)  Pedestrian and bicyclist connections shall be provided into the site from the surrounding sidewalk, trail and street system and, whenever possible, from neighboring developments. Strategies to achieve this include, but are not limited to: 
a.  Providing sidewalks that connect the retail building to the adjacent public sidewalk and any trail system. 
b.  Providing safe pedestrian access through the fueling area by the use of pavement striping and/or signage. 
(3)  Amenities for bicyclists should be provided. Strategies to achieve this include, but are not limited to: 
a.  Providing bike racks in close proximity to the retail building. 
b.  Providing free compressed air for bicyclist.

Sec. 18-534. - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this division is to provide for minimum uniform requirements and criteria for the development, cultivation and maintenance of landscaping within the city in recognition that: 
(1)  Landscaping can improve the livability of residential neighborhoods and enhance the appearance and customer draw of commercial areas and streetscapes, increase property values, improve the compatibility of adjacent land uses, screen undesirable views, and contribute to the image and appeal of the overall community; 
(2)  Landscape design that is consistent with the climatic and soil conditions of this region will be the most successful and sustainable; 
(3)  In order to enable the city to provide an adequate supply of water to its water customers and those users under the city system, the city must conserve and protect its water resources; 
(4)  Protecting the public from situations in which landscaping, if not properly situated, can obscure the vision of motorists or interfere with official traffic control devices and the orderly movement of traffic; 
(5)  A reasonable balance between the rights of individuals to develop and maintain their property in a manner they prefer and the right of community residents to live, work, shop, and recreate in pleasant and attractive surroundings contributes to the general welfare; 
(6)  Landscaping contributes to the overall quality of the natural environment upon which humans are dependent; 
(7)  The city considers irrigation ditches and the trees and wildlife they support to be community assets that should be preserved to enhance the city's sense of place; and 
(8)  Standards and Specifications describe how specific landscape portions of public projects shall be designed, installed, cultivated and maintained. 
(Code 1975, § 58-7.101; Ord. No. 2183, § 1, 8-10-92; Ord. No. 2279, § 166, 8-9-93; Ord. No. 2765, § 3, 5-13-03; Ord. No. 3165, § 1, 4-12-11) 
Sec. 18-535. - General provisions. 
(a)  Landscaping required or installed in rights-of-way and other public and pedestrian areas shall not be permitted to intrude onto or over the roadway or sidewalk in such a manner as to impact or obstruct pedestrian or vehicular traffic. 
(b)  When not specified in this Code, the director will specify the landscape development requirements. 
(c)  Once a landscape plan has been approved through the development permit process, specific provisions contained within that approved plan shall have control over similar provisions within this division. Any requirement in this division not specifically changed in the approved landscape plan remains in effect. 
(d)  Site requirements within landscape areas are cumulative and may not be proposed to meet the minimum requirements of other landscape areas except as specifically provided in the development permit process. 
(Code 1975, § 58-7.101; Ord. No. 2183, § 1, 8-10-92; Ord. No. 3165, § 1, 4-12-11) 
Sec. 18-536. - Water-wise landscaping. 
(a)  Water-wise landscaping is required on all development, private or public, in recognition of our semi-arid climate and limited amount of water available for outdoor uses. This approach to landscaping shall be done by incorporating water-wise landscape principles into development permit landscape requirements. 
(b)  Water-wise landscape principles include: 
(1)  Promoting the use of low water-demand turf and plants and a balance of landscape materials. 
(2)  Promoting practical turf areas by limiting the use of high water-demand turf and plants to areas of high visibility or functional needs. 
(3)  Grouping plants with similar water and environmental requirements together on the same irrigation zone. 
(4)  Use of efficient irrigation systems. 
(5)  Use of soil amendments and mulches, generally organic and biodegradable. 
(c)  No person, organization, or association may create or impose restrictive covenants, conditions, restrictions, deed clauses or other agreements between the parties that prevent the use of water-wise landscaping.

Sec. 18-537. - Existing plant material. 
(a)  Existing plant material in good health shall be saved and incorporated into development of a property with priority given to preserving significant plant material that provides screening, buffering, wildlife habitat and/or linkages to wildlife habitat. Plant material classified as noxious weeds is exempt from this requirement. 
(b)  Prior to approval of any subdivision plat or development permit, the applicant shall inventory and graphically depict, by species, all existing deciduous trees over two inches in caliper, all existing evergreen trees six feet in height or taller, and all shrub masses over 100 square feet ("inventoried plant material"). Plant materials on the property may be removed only after a mitigation plan has been approved by the city. 
(c)  Inventoried plant material removed in the process of developing a property shall require the installation of new trees and shrubs in sufficient number and size to equal the plant material removed. Deciduous trees over two inches in caliper shall be replaced caliper inch for caliper inch. Evergreen trees over six feet tall shall be replaced foot for foot in height removed. Shrub masses shall be matched by one tree equivalent per 100 square feet shrub mass or fraction thereof in width removed. All such replacement trees and shrubs shall be in addition to those tree equivalents required by other provisions of this chapter. 
(d)  Existing plant material in good health that meets the size requirements in subsection (a) above and that is incorporated into the development of the property shall be credited toward required landscaping at 100 percent of the size of the existing tree or shrub mass. For example, an existing 16-inch caliper deciduous tree equals eight two-inch caliper required deciduous trees; an existing 24-foot-high evergreen tree equals four six-foot-high required evergreen trees; an existing 200 square feet shrub mass equals two required tree equivalents or 40 No. 5 container size required shrubs. 
(e)  Existing plant material to be preserved on a property shall be protected during construction work. 
(f)  Notwithstanding the credit given for trees saved in the development of the property, the city shall require additional landscaping to be provided in order to meet the design requirements for landscaping of, or adjacent to, street rights-of-way, for buffering and screening areas of a particular property from adjacent uses, and for landscaping parks, detention areas and drainage channels.

The TPQ for these chemicals is either 500 pounds or the TPQ listed (whichever is lower) for extremely hazardous chemicals listed under 40 CFR §§ 302 (2010) and subsequent amendments; or 10,000 pounds for any other chemical. Specific exemptions to this category include: 
i.  Finished consumer products within retail centers and households containing hazardous materials intended for household use, and agricultural products intended for agricultural use. 
ii.  Buildings and other structures containing hazardous materials for which it can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of the local authority having jurisdiction by hazard assessment and certification by a qualified professional (as determined by the local jurisdiction having land use authority) that a release of the subject hazardous material does not pose a major threat to the public. 
iii.  Pharmaceutical sales, use, storage, and distribution centers that do not manufacture pharmaceutical products. 
iv.  These exemptions shall not apply to buildings or other structures that also function as critical facilities under another category outlined in this article. 
6.  At-risk population facilities include medical care, congregate care, and schools. These facilities may include; 
i.  Elder care (nursing homes); 
ii.  Congregate care serving 12 or more individuals (day care and assisted living); 
iii.  Public and private schools (pre-schools, K-12 schools), before-school and after-school care serving 12 or more children); 
7.  Facilities vital to restoring normal services including government operations. These facilities may include; 
i.  Essential government operations (public records, courts, jails, building permitting and inspection services, community administration and management, maintenance and equipment centers); 
ii.  Essential structures for public colleges and universities (dormitories, offices, and classrooms only). 
iii.  These facilities may be exempted if it is demonstrated to the city that the facility is an element of a redundant system for which service will not be interrupted during a flood. At a minimum, it shall be demonstrated that redundant facilities are available (either owned by the same entity or available through an intergovernmental agreement or other contract), the alternative facilities are either located outside of the 100-year floodplain or are compliant with this article, and an operations plan is in effect that states how redundant facilities will provide service to the affected area in the event of a flood. Evidence of ongoing redundancy shall be provided to the city on an as-needed basis upon request. 
b.  Protection for critical facilities. All new and substantially improved critical facilities and new additions to critical facilities located within the SFHA shall be regulated to a higher standard than structures not determined to be critical facilities. For the purposes of this article, protection shall include one of the following: 
1.  Location outside the SFHA; or 
2.  Elevation or flood proofing of the structure to at least two feet above the base flood elevation. 
c.  Ingress and egress for new critical facilities. New critical facilities shall, when practicable as determined by the city, have continuous non-inundated access (ingress and egress for evacuation and emergency services) during a 100-year flood event.

Number of 
proposed 
dwelling 
units × Number of 
projected 
persons per 
dwelling 
unit ÷ 1000 
residents × 10 acres = Acres 
to be 
dedicated  
_____ 
b.  Nonresidential developments shall dedicate eight percent of the subdivision's gross land area for parks, open spaces, and trails. 
c.  Developments with a combination of residential and nonresidential uses shall:

i.  The percentage of land within the development that is occupied or intended to be occupied by a residential use multiplied by the land amount calculated in subsection (1)a above; and 
ii.  The percentage of land within the development that is occupied or intended to be occupied by a nonresidential use multiplied by the land amount calculated in subsection (1)b above. 
2.  Instead of land dedication, a cash in-lieu land payment meeting the criteria of this section shall be paid to the city at the time of the subdivision plat or development. 
(2)  The dedication shall result in a park, open space or trail site that is at least five acres in size or, in combination with existing or future dedications, will total five acres. In the event that a park, open space or trail site of less than five acres in size will result from the dedication, the city may elect to accept the land offered for dedication or require cash-in-lieu of dedication pursuant to this section. 
(3)  The land to be dedicated shall be of a size, character and location consistent with the policies of the Comprehensive Plan. 
(4)  Land areas dedicated to the city to satisfy land dedication requirements for parks, open space and trails shall be suitable for development of recreational areas.

b.  Trails to be dedicated that are not within the floodway, but are within the 100-year floodplain, or which are part of irrigation ditches or storm water detention areas shall be credited at 50 percent of land dedication requirements. No other land dedicated in a floodplain shall receive any credit. 
(c)  Improvement of dedicated land. Park, open space, and trail areas required to be dedicated pursuant to this section shall be improved in accordance with the landscape regulations of this chapter and other applicable city Standards and Specifications. 
(d)  Cash-in-lieu requirements of land dedication and improvement. 
(1)  The city shall require the developer to pay to the city a sum of money based on a schedule adopted by resolution of the city council, in place of all or a portion of the park, open space, and trail acreage requirements set forth in this section, if the city finds: 
a.  The dedication and improvement of land for a park, open space or trail within the subdivision is inconsistent with the Comprehensive Plan; or 
b.  The acreage proposed for dedication is less than the amount required to provide a usable park, open space or trail site. 
(2)  The council shall establish the cash-in-lieu schedule for land dedication and improvement for parks, open spaces, and trails, based on the following:

b.  The average cost per acre to improve land as a park in accordance with Division 3 of Article V of this chapter and other applicable city Standards and Specifications. 
(3)  Cash-in-lieu monies shall be deposited in a city account to be used solely for the purchase and improvement of parks, open space, and trails within the city. 
(e)  Waivers. The city may waive the land dedication, improvement and cash-in-lieu requirements of this section when: 
(1)  The project has already been developed; or 
(2)  The development does not result in an increase in demand for park, open space, or trail facilities.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 

Sec. 18-700. - Title. 
    This article shall be known and cited as the Sign Code of the City of Thornton. 
(Ord. No. 3439, § 1(Exh. A), 6-13-17) 
Sec. 18-701. - Authority. 
    The city council finds and declares that: 
(1)  The city has the authority to regulate signs under the United States Constitution, the Constitution and Statutes of the State of Colorado, and the Charter of the City of Thornton; 
(2)  This article advances important and substantial government interests; 
(3)  The purpose of this article is to provide the minimum control of signs necessary to promote the health, safety, and general welfare of the citizens of Thornton; 
(4)  This article is not intended to regulate government signs; 
(5)  Any incidental restriction on the freedom of speech is no greater than is essential to the furtherance of the interests protected by this article; 
(6)  Certain types of speech are not protected by the First Amendment due to the harm that they cause to individuals or the community, and speech that is harmful to minors may be prohibited in places that are accessible to minors; and 
(7)  The city does not intend to regulate any sign content or message in any manner not permitted by law, and the provisions of this article should be interpreted to achieve that result. 
(Ord. No. 3439, § 1(Exh. A), 6-13-17) 
Sec. 18-702. - Purpose. 
(a)  Generally. The purpose of this article is to set out regulations for the erection and maintenance of signs while preserving the right of free speech and expression. 
(b)  Objectives. The objective of the regulations in this article is to provide a balanced and fair legal framework for the design, construction and placement of signs that: 
(1)  Promotes the safety of persons and property by ensuring that signs do not create a hazard by: 
a.  Collapsing, catching fire, or otherwise decaying; 
b.  Confusing or distracting vehicle, bicycle or pedestrian traffic; or 
c.  Impairing drivers' ability to see pedestrians, bicyclists, obstacles or other vehicles, or to read traffic signs; 
(2)  Promotes the efficient communication of messages, and ensures that persons exposed to signs: 
a.  Are not overwhelmed by the number of messages presented; and 
b.  Are able to exercise freedom of choice to observe or ignore said messages; 
(3)  Protects the public welfare and enhances the appearance and economic value of the landscape by protecting scenic views and avoiding sign clutter that can compromise the character, quality, and viability of commercial corridors; 
(4)  Ensures that signs are compatible with their surroundings, and prevents the construction of signs that are a nuisance to occupants of adjacent and contiguous property due to brightness, reflectivity, bulk, movement, or height; 
(5)  Promotes the use of signs that are aesthetically pleasing, of appropriate scale, and integrated with the built environment through architecture, landscaping and other features, in order to meet the city's objectives related to the quality and character of development as identified in the Comprehensive Plan; 
(6)  Enhances property values and business opportunities; 
(7)  Assists in way-finding; and 
(8)  Provides fair and consistent permitting and enforcement. 
(c)  General findings of fact. The city council finds and declares that: 
(1)  Signs of reasonable size and dimensions are a useful means of visual display for the convenience of the public and for the efficient communications of commercial and noncommercial speech; 
(2)  Signs are vital to the health and sustainability of many businesses, and the display of signs with noncommercial messages is a traditional forum of speech, but the constitutional guarantee of free speech may be limited by appropriate and constrained regulation that is unrelated to the message itself; 
(3)  The city has an important and substantial interest in protecting the public from signs which obscure the vision of motorists or interfere with official traffic control devices because the orderly movement of traffic contributes to the public health and safety; 
(4)  The city has an important and substantial interest in preventing sign clutter because sign clutter degrades the character of the community, makes the community a less attractive place for commerce and private investment, and dilutes or obscures messages by creating visual confusion and aesthetic blight; 
(5)  A reasonable balance between the interests of visual signage and the interest of the city to secure for its citizens the opportunity to enjoy pleasant and attractive surroundings protected from visual discord and clutter that may result from unrestricted proliferation and placement of signs contributes to the general welfare; 
(6)  Regulations that balance the legitimate needs of individual property owners to convey their commercial and noncommercial messages against the comparable needs of adjacent and nearby property owners and the interest of the community as a whole are necessary to preserve and enhance the aesthetic quality of life in the community; 
(7)  The uncontrolled use of off-premises outdoor advertising signs and their location, density, size, shape, motion, illumination and demand for attention can be injurious to the purposes of this article, and destructive to community character and property values, and that, as such, restrictions on the display of off-premises commercial messages are necessary and desirable; 
(8)  Signs that are not properly maintained or repaired degrade the aesthetics of the community; and 
(9)  Reasonable regulations are necessary to conserve the character and economic value of property and neighborhoods. 
(Code 1975, § 58-5.101; Ord. No. 2183, § 1, 8-10-92; Ord. No. 2416, § 1 (58-5.101), 4-22-96; Ord. No. 3165, § 1, 4-12-11; Ord. No. 3168, § 1(Exh. A), 6-28-11; Ord. No. 3439, § 1(Exh. A), 6-13-17) 
Sec. 18-703. - Applicability. 
(a)  This article applies to signs on private property and does not abrogate, override, limit, modify or nullify any easements, covenants, leases or other existing private agreements that are more restrictive than this article. 
(b)  This article does not regulate signs that are displayed on public streets, public alleyways, public sidewalks, public rights-of-way, public trail tracts, public trail easements, public parks and other public spaces. Those matters are regulated in Article I of Chapter 70 of this Code. 
(Ord. No. 3439, § 1(Exh. A), 6-13-17) 
Sec. 18-704. - General provisions. 
(a)  Compliance required. All construction, relocation, enlargement, alteration, and modification of signs within the city shall conform to the requirements of this article, all state and federal regulations concerning signs and advertising, and the building code adopted in Chapter 10 of this Code. 
(b)  Responsibility for compliance. The responsibility for compliance with this chapter rests jointly and severally upon the sign owner, the sign operator (if different from the sign owner), all parties holding the present right of possession and control of the property whereon a sign is located, mounted or installed, and the legal owner of the lot or parcel, even if the sign was mounted, installed, erected or displayed without the consent of the owner and/or parties holding the legal right to immediate possession and control. 
(c)  Violations. When a sign is displayed in violation of this article or chapter, or in violation of other applicable laws, rules, regulations, or policies regarding signs, each day the sign is displayed is a separate violation. 
(d)  Interpretations. The director shall interpret this article as the need for interpretation arises, including for application to specific issues and proposed signs. Such interpretations may be appealed in accordance with the procedures in Section 18-34. 
(e)  Message neutrality. It is the city's policy and intent to regulate signs in a manner consistent with the United States and Colorado Constitutions and all applicable law, and which is content-neutral as to protected speech. 
(f)  Message substitution. 
(1)  A protected commercial or noncommercial message of any type may be substituted, in whole or in part, for the message displayed on any sign for which the sign structure or mounting device is legal without consideration of message content. Such substitution of message may be made without any additional approval, permitting, registration or notice to the city. The purpose of this provision is to prevent any inadvertent favoring of commercial speech over noncommercial speech, or favoring of any particular noncommercial message over any other noncommercial message. 
(2)  This message substitution provision does not: 
a.  Create a right to increase the total amount of signage on a parcel, lot or land use; 
b.  Affect the requirement that a sign structure or mounting device be properly permitted; 
c.  Allow a change in the physical structure of a sign, its mounting device, or the technology used to present the message; or 
d.  Authorize the substitution of an off-site commercial message in place of an on-site commercial message or in place of a noncommercial message. 
(g)  Discretionary approvals. 
(1)  Whenever any sign permit, variance, specific use permit, temporary use permit, large development signage plan, or other sign-related decision is made by any exercise of official discretion, such discretion shall be limited to the noncommunicative aspects of the sign, the architectural similarity of the proposed sign with other structures or signs in the surrounding area, and other factors listed in this article and in the Development Code. 
(2)  When discretion is authorized, it may be exercised regarding the following factors, as applicable: 
a.  Construction materials and details of structural design; 
b.  The number and spacing of signs in the area; 
c.  The sign's display area, height, and location in relation to its proposed use; 
d.  The sign's relationship with other nearby signs, other elements of street and site furniture and adjacent structures; 
e.  Form, proportion, and scale; 
f.  Potential effect of the proposed sign on driver, bicyclist and pedestrian safety; 
g.  Potential blocking of view, in whole or in part, of a structure or façade or public view of historical, cultural or architectural significance; and 
h.  Potential obstruction of views of users of adjacent buildings to side yards, front yards, open space, or parks. 
(3)  Discretion may not be exercised as to the message content of the sign. 
(h)  Prospective regulation. 
(1)  This article applies to signs that may be proposed or erected in the future. It also applies to existing signs that are not legal under prior law. 
(2)  All existing legal signs may continue in use, but any change must comply with this article. Any nonconforming sign for a business shall be immediately brought into conformance with this article or removed if any one of the following conditions occurs: 
a.  When the sign becomes damaged to the extent of 50 percent or more of its total replacement value, regardless of the cause of the damage; 
b.  When the sign becomes an imminent danger to public health or safety; 
c.  When there is a request to obtain a building permit to alter, enlarge, expand, or increase the structural support of the sign or any part of the sign; 
d.  When there is a request to obtain a building permit to make improvements to the facade of a building on a property on which a nonconforming sign is located; or 
e.  If the use or activity that the sign refers to has been discontinued or the property on which an on-site sign is located has been vacant for a period of six months or more. 
(3)  Any sign in existence on the effective date of this article which does not conform to its provisions, but for which the board has previously granted a variance, shall be considered a legal nonconforming sign. 
(4)  In the event the regulations contained in this article are amended, any temporary sign that is not in compliance with the new regulations shall be removed immediately. Nonconforming temporary signs are not permitted. 
(i)  Noncommunicative aspects. All applicable regulations concerning the noncommunicative aspects of signs, as defined in Article XI, stand enforceable independently of any permit or approval process. 
(j)  Owner's consent. No sign may be placed on private property without the consent of the legal owner of the property and all persons holding the present right of possession and control of signage. The city may require evidence of consent when enforcing the requirements of this article. 
(k)  Signs accessory to main use. Unless otherwise provided in this article, permanent structure signs shall be accessory to another main use on the same parcel. 
(l)  Materials. Materials selected for signs shall be durable and capable of withstanding weathering, with reasonable maintenance, over the life of the sign. 
(m)  Zoning. 
(1)  Any sign located in the zoning districts of Planned Development (PD) District, Preservation Revitalization (P/R) District (residential and/or commercial) or Mineral Conservation (MC) District, unless otherwise specified in the ordinance creating the district, shall be erected in accordance with the requirements for the categorical zoning districts of this chapter, based upon the use of the site that the sign is located on, as determined by the director or designee. 
(2)  In any zoning district where both residential and nonresidential land uses are allowed, the sign-related rights and responsibilities applicable to any particular parcel or land use shall be determined as follows: 
a.  Residential uses shall be treated as if they were located in the lowest intensity zone where a use of that type would be allowed as a matter of right; and 
b.  Nonresidential uses shall be treated as if they were located in the lowest intensity zone where that particular use would be allowed, either as a matter of right or subject to a specific use permit or a temporary use permit. 
(n)  Maintenance and alterations. 
(1)  It shall be unlawful to fail to maintain or keep in good repair any sign, including without limitation the repairing of glass, plastic, or other sign face material which is missing, broken, damaged, or deteriorated and the repairing of any pole, frame, support or similar structure which is broken, damaged, or deteriorated. 
(2)  A permit is not required when only the sign face or copy is changed and the resulting sign complies with the requirements of this article. 
(3)  A permit is required for structural alteration or enlargement of the sign area. 
(4)  The maintenance, renovation, or repair of a sign without the alteration of noncommunicative aspects shall not require a new sign permit, but may require a building permit under the building code of the city. 
(5)  Whenever the use of a sign frame or sign supporting structure, has been discontinued for a period of six months or more, such sign, sign frame, or sign supporting structure shall be removed immediately.

Sec. 18-717. - Interpretations for sign area. 
    Sign area shall be measured for all types of signs as follows: 
(1)  Signs with backing. Signs with backing shall include, but not be limited to, cabinet signs or signs that are outlined or framed. The area of a cabinet sign or a sign enclosed by a box, outlined or framed, shall be measured by determining the smallest possible area of any rectilinear geometric shape that utilizes eight or fewer lines that join each other at right angles that enclose the extreme limits of the display surface or face of the sign; including all frames, backing, face plates, nonstructural trim or other component parts not otherwise used for support. 
(2)  Signs without backing. If the sign is composed of individual letters or symbols that are mounted against a surface that has not been painted, textured or otherwise altered to provide a distinctive background for the sign copy, the area of the sign shall be measured by determining the area of the smallest possible area of a rectilinear geometric shape that utilizes eight or fewer lines that join each other at right angles that enclose the extreme limits of each message. See Figures 717.1 to 717.5. 

Figure 717.1

Figure 717.2

Figure 717.3

Figure 717.4

Figure 717.5
(3)  Multi-faced signs. Sign area for signs which have two parallel sign faces assembled in such a way that the faces cannot be viewed from any one point at the same time shall be calculated using only the larger of the two sign faces. Sign area for signs which have multiple sign faces not being parallel, which can be viewed from any one point at the same time, such a v-shaped, triangles or cubes, shall be calculated using the total of all faces. 
(4)  Other forms. 
a.  When a sign is spherical, free form, sculptural and/or other nonplanar form, the sign area is measured as the sum of the area of the four vertical sides of the smallest polyhedron that will encompass the sign structure. See Figure 717.6. 

Figure 717.6
b.  Works of art, wall graphics, and architectural features shall be interpreted to constitute a sign, and the area shall be included in the calculation for determining the allowable sign area unless the applicant obtains any required approval from the Thornton Arts, Sciences and Humanities Council (TASHCO) pursuant to Division 7 of this article, or is exempted from the requirements of that division. 
(5)  Exceptions. 
a.  An illuminated canopy, awning, or architectural feature of a building is not considered a distinctive background for the purposes of measuring the sign area. 
b.  A decorative neon band or other outdoor building illumination which does not identify or convey information is not considered in the calculation of sign area. 
(Code 1975, § 58-5.102; Ord. No. 2183, § 1, 8-10-92; Ord. No. 3165, § 1, 4-12-11; Ord. No. 3168, § 1(Exh. A), 6-28-11; Ord. No. 3439, § 1(Exh. A), 6-13-17) 
Sec. 18-718. - Appeals, variances and adjustments. 
(a)  Appeals. 
(1)  Appeals from a decision of the director or designee are available by the submission of a written request, on a form supplied by the department, to the board. The request shall specify the basis for the appeal. The board may overturn a decision of the director for two reasons: 
a.  The board finds the director erred in the interpretation of the applicable regulation as provided in this article; or 
b.  The board finds a variance is in order due to an extraordinary hardship not induced by the appellant. 
(2)  The board shall make its determination only on the merits of each appeal brought before it. 
(3)  The board shall make a decision on the appeal within 45 days after receiving a complete application for appeal. 
(4)  Applications for a hearing for a variance or appeal before the board shall be processed in accordance with the rules, regulations and procedures governing actions of the board and contained in Section 18-34. 
(b)  Variances. 
(1)  In considering a variance to the sign regulations in this article, the board shall consider the following noncommunicative aspects of the proposed sign with and without the variance in making its determinations: 
a.  Whether the physical conditions are such that strict compliance with these regulations will create extreme, continuing, and undue hardship or harm. 
b.  Whether physical conditions are such that strict compliance with these regulations will unreasonably restrict the effectiveness of a sign and the absence of alternative means and locations available which would be in compliance with this article. 
c.  Whether the variance, if granted, will adversely affect an adjacent property or neighborhood. 
d.  Whether the variance, if granted, will comply with the overall intent of this article to secure the public health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the city. 
e.  Whether the variance, if granted, is limited to the extent absolutely necessary to afford relief. 
(2)  Any variance granted by the board shall not be subject to any assignment or other permanent or temporary transfer by the variance recipient and shall terminate and become null and void upon discontinuance of the use or activity underlying the variance when granted. 
(3)  The board shall, in order to best satisfy the review criteria and standards set forth in subsection (b)(1) of this section, have the discretion to limit the time of the variance granted, subject the matter to periodic review, or impose other terms and conditions on the granting of the variance. 
(c)  Appeals to the director for minor adjustments. 
(1)  Applicants may seek approval from the director to allow for minor adjustments from the sign code on a form supplied by the department for this purpose in response to unanticipated sign location issues or unusual physical site conditions, which may cause the need for some minor adjustments to be made to the allowable sign area or sign height. The director may authorize minor adjustments to the sign code that do one of the following: 
a.  Allow for sign heights to be increased up to a maximum of two feet in height; or 
b.  Allow the maximum sign face area or sign dimensions of an individual sign to be increased up to a maximum of ten percent of the area or dimension otherwise provided; or 
c.  Allow the sign to encroach into a required property line setback up to a maximum of 20 percent of the required setback if such encroachment will not create a threat to public health or safety; or 
d.  Allow the sign to be located closer to another sign by reducing a required separation distance between the signs by up to 20 percent if such reduction will not create a threat to the public health or safety. 
(2)  The director shall consider the criteria in Section 18-704(g) regarding discretionary approvals when making a decision. 
(3)  The director shall make a written decision within ten days of the request being made to the department. 
(4)  Appeals from the decision of the director are to be made to the board within ten days of the receipt of the letter concerning the action taken on the request.

Such factors include: structural and operational characteristics of the applicant's commercial satellite system that require clear and free space path to space orbiting satellites; topography and physical characteristics and the elevation, size and location of the property upon which the proposed commercial satellite dish is; and that of the surrounding property; 
(6)  The applicant has done everything reasonable in designing and locating the proposed commercial satellite dish to minimize the impact it will have on use and development of surrounding land. However, the fact that an alternate design or location may require additional capital does not necessarily establish that the applicant's failure to select that alternate design or location is reasonable; 
(7)  Issuance of the permit is consistent with reasonable use and enjoyment of surrounding property, excluding landscaping considerations. Issuance of the permit will be presumed not to be consistent with reasonable use and enjoyment of surrounding property if issuance would prevent any affected property owner from erecting, consistent with legal requirements, a structure of a size, character, and usefulness reasonably typical of those in existence on similar lots subject to the same zoning requirements located within 1,000 feet of the focal point of the commercial satellite dish in question. However, nothing in this section prohibits issuance of a permit if it would impose requirements on a surrounding property that are more restrictive than the height requirements that would otherwise apply, and the reasonable use and enjoyment of such is preserved; and 
(8)  Issuance of the permit is consistent with reasonable landscaping of surrounding property. In determining consistency the board shall consider the need for any additional landscaping in the future. 
(e)  The board may grant permits subject to such terms and conditions as it finds reasonable, and shall be limited to the commercial satellite dish specified in the application. No other operation shall be conducted without a new application being reviewed and a permit approved. 
(f)  The city shall maintain complete records of all approved commercial satellite access permits and shall make them readily available for public inspection.

A Thornton business will be granted this local preference if it maintains an office, manufacturing, training, retail or repair facility with the City of Thornton, holds a valid Thornton business license and is current in all taxes, utility payments, and any other obligations to the City of Thornton. If the lowest bids received and discounted are for the same total amount or unit price, all bid criteria being equal, the contract shall be awarded to a Thornton business; but if two or more Thornton business discounted bids are for the same total amount or none of the tie bidders meets the local preference requirements as described above, the city may negotiate with one or more tie bidders for a reduction of price in the best interest of the city. In the event all bids exceed available funds, the city manager is authorized, in situations where time or economic considerations preclude resolicitation of work of a reduced scope, to negotiate an adjustment of the bid price, including changes in bid requirements, with the low responsive and responsible bidder in order to bring the bid within the amount of available funds. The local preference does not apply to cooperative procurements, procurements funded in whole or in part with federal funds or when prohibited by law.

Sec. 26-355. - Property tax refund. 
(a)  If the applicant under this article lived in the applicant's own home or rented a single-family home during the full calendar year preceding the year in which the application is submitted and has met all requirements of Section 26-354, the city shall refund to the applicant that portion of the total property taxes which will be levied on that residence by the city, but not to exceed the amount the applicant actually paid, utilizing the following procedure: 
(1)  The assessed valuation per home in the city shall be multiplied by the mill levy of the city to ascertain the amount to be refunded. Both the assessed valuation and the mill levy are those figures used during the year preceding the year in which the application is submitted to the city. 
(2)  For example: 
Application accepted prior to October 31, 1995, for the refund of 1994 taxes. 
The 1994 assessed valuation for a single-family residence = $7,500.00. 
1994 mill levy = 10.21 mills. 
$7,500.00 × 0.01021 = $76.58 refund to the qualified applicant. 
(b)  If the applicant rented an apartment dwelling unit in which the applicant lived during the full calendar year preceding the year in which the application is submitted and has met all requirements of Section 26-354, the city shall refund to the applicant a sum equivalent to that percentage of the average monthly rental which is attributable to the city's property tax on that dwelling unit. The amount to be refunded is to be determined as follows: 
(1)  The average assessed valuation per dwelling unit shall be multiplied by the mill levy of the city. Both the average assessed valuation and the mill levy are those figures used during the year preceding the year in which the application is submitted to the city. 
(2)  For example: 
Application accepted prior to October 31, 1995, for the refund of 1994 taxes. 
The 1994 average assessed valuation for an apartment dwelling unit = $4,000.00 
1994 mill levy = 10.21 mills. 
$4,000.00 × 0.01021 = $40.84 refund to the qualified applicant. 
(c)  If the applicant owned or rented a mobile home that the applicant lived in during the full calendar year preceding the year in which the application is submitted and the applicant has met all requirements of Section 26-354, the city shall refund to the applicant an amount equivalent to that percentage of the average monthly space rental which is deemed to be attributable to the city's property tax, calculated as follows, and the amount of the assessed valuation of the mobile home multiplied by the mill levy of the city. The amount to be refunded shall be determined as follows: 
(1)  The average assessed valuation per mobile home space to be multiplied by the mill levy of the city added to the amount of the assessed valuation of the mobile home multiplied by the mill levy of the city. 
(2)  For example: Application accepted prior to October 31, 1995, for the refund of 1994 taxes. 
a.  The 1994 average assessed valuation per mobile home space = $1,000.00. 
1994 mill levy = 10.21 mills. 
$1,000.00 × 0.01021 = $10.21. 
b.  Plus 1994 assessed valuation of mobile home = $3,000.00. 
1994 mill levy = 10.21 mills. 
$3,000.00 × 0.01021 = $30.63. 
Total refund to the qualified applicant = $40.84. 
(d)  If, during the full year preceding the year in which the application is submitted, the applicant owned and lived in two or more homes or rented and lived in two or more dwelling units or owned and lived in a home for a portion of the preceding year and rented and lived in a dwelling unit for the remaining portion of the year, all within the city, the city shall refund to the applicant a sum in accordance with subsections (a), (b) and (c) of this section based on the number of months the applicant lived in each home or dwelling unit.

    The amount of food sales tax to be refunded shall be based on an assumed average sum of $800.00 per member of a household that will be expended during the year on food and grocery items. The city shall refund that portion of the sum of $800.00 that is collected by the city as sales tax. The following procedure shall be applied to determine the amount to be refunded to every qualified applicant: 
(1)  The average sum of $800.00 per individual per year on food items shall be multiplied by the city's sales tax in effect during the previous year. 
(2)  For example: 
Application accepted prior to October 31, 1995. 
1994 sales tax = 3.5 percent. 
Allowance = Average sum of $800.00 
$800.00 × 0.035 = $28.00 refund to the qualified applicant. 
$28.00 × the number of persons eligible in the qualified household.

An anticipated cash discount to be allowed for payment on or before a given date is not an allowable adjustment to the selling price in determining gross taxable sales on any vendor's return prior to the date when the customer actually receives the discount. Any adjustments in sale price such as allowable discounts, rebates and credits cannot be anticipated, and the tax must be based upon the original price, unless such adjustments have actually been made prior to the filing of the return wherein such sale is reported, provided that, if the price upon which the tax was computed and paid to the city by the vendor is subsequently readjusted, prior to the payment of the tax by the purchaser, a proper credit may be taken against the tax due on the next subsequent return.

d.  Before the vendor may grant an exemption from the tax on the sale of any tangible personal property or taxable service, the vendor must be furnished with and must record the state exempt license number of the institution or organization seeking such a tax-free purchase.

(n)  Special accounting for alcoholic beverage sales by the drink, vending machine sales of tangible personal property, recreation services, cover or door charges, or admission ticket sales.

This subsection shall not be construed to include terms upon which the tax is imposed on the full purchase price, as defined in Section 26-388, nor shall it be construed as an allowance for the vendor to fail to itemize to the customer the taxable and nontaxable portions of the bill.

Every retailer or vendor engaged in business in this city, as such is defined in Section 26-388, and making sales, even though not maintaining an office in this city, of tangible personal property or taxable services subject to the sales tax must, in accordance with this Code, collect and remit the sales tax on such sales in like manner as a retailer or vendor maintaining an office in this city. If the nonresident vendor petitions the city treasurer, stating that the imposition of the tax on an individual sales basis will impose an unnecessary hardship, and if the type and occasion of sale so warrants, the city treasurer may accept payment of that vendor's tax liability on regularly audited and reasonable estimated payment basis. This estimated payment will be based on a calculation of the city sales tax liability as it bears to the vendor's aggregate gross sales and service.

Failure to provide the required supplemental report with each tax return may result in revocation of this privilege. 
(3)  Reporting periods. If the accounting methods regularly employed by the vendor or licensed consumer in the transaction of business or other conditions are such that the returns made on a calendar month basis will impose unnecessary hardship, the city treasurer may, upon request of the vendor or licensed consumer, accept returns at such intervals as will, in the city treasurer's opinion, better suit the convenience of the taxpayer and will not jeopardize the collection of the tax. The city treasurer may, by rule, permit a vendor or licensed consumer whose monthly tax collected is less than $40.00 to make returns and pay taxes at intervals not greater than three months or as approved by the city treasurer. 
(r)  Sales and use tax business license.

The applicant may appeal a denial by submitting a written request to the city treasurer within 20 days of the notice of denial. The city treasurer will consider the appeal and provide the applicant with a written final decision. 
(2)  Licensing of each retail establishment.

(3)  Form of license; transferability. Each license shall be numbered and shall show the name, business address and nature of business of the licensee and shall be posted in a conspicuous location in the place of business for which it is issued. No license shall be transferable. 
(4)  Revocation by city treasurer. The city treasurer may, upon written notice and after providing the taxpayer an opportunity to request a hearing revoke the license of any person found by the city treasurer to have violated any provision of this Code or any city ordinance. After revocation of the license, no further business, as defined in this Code, may be conducted within the city, and the city attorney shall institute such legal action as may be necessary to preclude such conduct of a business. 
(5)  Appeal from revocation. Any finding and order of the city treasurer revoking the license of any person may be appealed. If appealed, the revocation shall be subject to judicial review in accordance with Rule 106(a)(4) of the Colorado Rules of Civil Procedure. 
(6)  Sale or transfer of business. Any sale, transfer or purchase of an interest in a business enterprise by any person, where the respective interest of the person purchasing or selling, as a result of the transaction, has changed in any degree, requires, the issuance of a new license.

(a)  Request for hearing; protest. A taxpayer may request a hearing when the city asserts that taxes and any penalties or interest under Section 26-393 are due, as stated in a notice of final determination, assessment and demand for payment sent to the taxpayer by the city or when the city denies a taxpayer's claim for refund. The hearing request shall be in writing and shall set forth in detail the factual and legal basis for the taxpayer's assertion that the assessment or denial of refund is incorrect. The hearing request shall be received by the city treasurer within 30 calendar days after the date of the notice of final determination, assessment and demand for payment or of a notice of a denial of refund. Failure of the request to conform to the requirements stated herein shall result in the request being rejected and returned to the taxpayer. A taxpayer's failure to timely or properly submit a request for a hearing shall constitute a failure to exhaust local remedies. Any unprotested tax, penalty and interest shall be paid in full within the 30-day period specified in this subsection. 
(b)  Informal conferences. Upon receipt of a request for hearing, the city may contact the taxpayer or the taxpayer's authorized representative to schedule an informal conference to discuss the procedure to be followed in the administrative hearing, to clarify the relevant issues and facts, and, if possible, to settle the matters in dispute. Participation in the informal conference does not waive any of the taxpayer's or the city's rights under this section. 
(c)  Hearing time and place.

A final decision thereon shall be issued and the results mailed to the taxpayer within 180 days after the date of the taxpayer's request for a hearing, or within such further time as the taxpayer and local government may agree upon in writing. 
(d)  Procedures. Hearings before the city treasurer shall be conducted in an informal manner. Formal rules of evidence shall not apply and transcripts or filing of briefs will not be required. However, the city will supply the taxpayer or representative a procedure booklet entitled "Rules Governing Hearings before the City Treasurer," which outlines the procedural rules that shall be followed at the hearing. Such rules and procedures may be amended periodically by the city treasurer. 
(e)  Exhaustion of local remedies. If an administrative hearing is scheduled by the city treasurer and the taxpayer fails to appear for the hearing, such failure shall constitute a failure by the taxpayer to exhaust local remedies. Once a taxpayer has protested a notice of final determination, assessment and demand for payment but elects to pay the assessment in lieu of proceeding to a protest hearing, such taxpayer shall be deemed to have exhausted local remedies and cannot subsequently submit an application for a refund of amounts paid under the notice of final determination. 
(f)  Conduct of hearing. The hearing shall be held before the city treasurer. The city treasurer is authorized to appoint a hearing officer to serve in place of the city treasurer to take testimony and render a decision.

If the taxpayer elects to file a brief, the city treasurer may also elect to file a brief. 
(g)  Request for hearing; time limitation. Upon the expiration of 30 calendar days after the date of the notice of final determination, assessment and demand for payment or denial of refund, if the tax has not been paid and if no request for hearing has been timely filed, the notice of final determination, assessment and demand for payment shall constitute a final assessment of the amount of the tax specified, together with interest and penalties, or shall constitute a final denial of refund. The assessed amount is due and payable immediately upon the expiration of 30 calendar days after the date of the notice unless appeal was timely filed pursuant to Section 26-398. 
(h)  Adjustment of tax under question. Based on the evidence presented at any hearing or filed in support of the taxpayer's contentions at any hearing, the city treasurer may modify or abate in full any tax, penalty and interest questioned at the hearing or may approve a refund or may uphold the original assessment. 
(i)  Determination notices. Upon rejection, in whole or in part, of a claim for refund, or upon a finding by the city treasurer or the appointed hearing officer that a valid sales or use tax assessment, in whole or in part, has been made against the taxpayer, the city treasurer or the appointed hearing officer shall send a final determination notice to the taxpayer setting forth the amount of the claim for refund that is denied or the amount of sales and use taxes found still due and owing, stating the grounds for such determination. Unless an appeal is taken as provided in Section 26-398, the taxes, together with interest thereon and penalties, if any, shall be paid within 30 days after the date of the final determination notice. 
(j)  License revocation. A hearing on the revocation of a city sales and use tax license shall be held upon reasonable notice to the taxpayer by the city treasurer. The hearing shall be before the city treasurer or the appointed hearing officer. The final determination made by the city treasurer or the appointed hearing officer pursuant to the hearing shall be subject to appeal as prescribed in Section 26-398.

(c)  Review of proceedings. The district court of the county shall have original jurisdiction to review the proceedings, such review being conducted after the final determination by the city treasurer in accordance with Rule 106(a)(4) of the Colorado Rules of Civil Procedure. 
(d)  Filing of bond. Within 15 days after filing of the notice of appeal, the taxpayer shall file with the district court a bond in twice the amount of the taxes, interest and other charges stated which are contested on appeal, provided that the taxpayer may at the taxpayer's option deposit the disputed amount with the city treasurer in lieu of posting bond. If such amount is so deposited, no further interest shall accrue on the deficiency contested during the pendency of the action. At the conclusion of the action or when the time for such appeal has expired, the funds deposited shall be, at the direction of the court, either retained by the city treasurer and applied against the deficiency or returned in whole or in part to the taxpayer, with interest calculated on the tax portion of the amount so deposited at the rate earned by the city's pooled investments during the time the deficiency was held in escrow by the city. No claim for refund of amount so deposited with the city treasurer need by made by the taxpayer in order for such amounts to be repaid in accordance with the direction of the court. 
(e)  Cases other than license revocation. In all cases other than license revocation, taxpayer may choose to appeal the hearing determination notice of the city treasurer pursuant to C.R.S. § 29-2-106.1.

The sales and use tax shall be a first and prior lien on the tangible personal property sold, purchased, stored, used, distributed or consumed, subject only to valid mortgage or other liens of record on and prior to the recording of notice as required by subsection (e) of this section, and when such tax is collected by retailers or agents, the sales or use tax imposed by sections under this Code shall be a first and prior lien upon the goods and business fixtures of or used by any retailer under lease, title retaining contract or other contract arrangement and shall take precedence on all such property over other liens or claims of whatever kind or nature. 
(b)  Effect of sale of business; purchases subject to lien. 
(1)  Sale of business. Any person who shall sell out a business or stock of goods or who shall quit business shall be required to make out the return as provided in this Code within ten days after the date the person sold the business or stock of goods or quit business, and such person's successor in business shall be required to withhold sufficient of the purchase money to cover the amount of taxes due and unpaid until such time as the former owner shall produce a receipt from the city treasurer showing that the taxes have been paid or a certificate that no taxes are due. 
(2)  Purchases subject to lien. If the purchaser of a business or stock or goods shall fail to withhold the purchase money as provided in subsection (b)(1) of this section and the taxes are unpaid after the ten-day period allowed, the purchaser, as well as the seller, shall be personally liable for the payment of the taxes unpaid by the former owner. Likewise, anyone who takes any stock of goods or business fixtures of or used by any person under lease, title retaining contract or other contract arrangement, by purchase, foreclosure sale or otherwise, takes such subject to the lien for any delinquent sales taxes owed by such person and shall be liable for the payment of all delinquent sales taxes of such prior owner, not, however, exceeding the value of the property so taken or acquired. 
(c)  Status of unpaid tax in bankruptcy and receivership. Whenever the business or property of any taxpayer subject to this Code shall be placed in receivership, bankruptcy or assignment for the benefit of creditors or seized under distraint for any taxes, all taxes, penalties and interest imposed by this Code and for which such retailer is in any way liable under the terms of this Code shall be a prior and preferred lien against all the property of such taxpayer, except as to preexisting claims or liens of a bona fide mortgagee, pledgee, judgment creditor or purchaser whose rights shall have attached prior to the filing of the notice as provided herein on the property of the taxpayer other than on the goods, stock-in-trade and business fixtures of such taxpayer. No sheriff, receiver, assignee or other officer shall sell the property of any person subject to this Code under process or order of any court without first ascertaining from the city treasurer the amount of any taxes due and payable under this Code, and if there are any such taxes due, owing or unpaid, it shall be the duty of such officer to first pay the amount of such taxes out of the proceeds of such sale before making payment of any monies to judgment creditor or other claims of whatever nature, except that the costs of the proceedings and other preexisting claims or liens as above provided. 
(d)  Construction improvements. 
(1)  Lien for unpaid taxes on personal property affixed to real property. The full amount of unpaid taxes arising from and required to be reported on personal property affixed to real property under this Code, together with interest and penalties as provided in this Code, shall be and constitute a first and prior lien, which lien shall have precedence over all other liens of whatever kind and nature, except as to liens for general taxes created by state law and except as to preexisting claims or liens of a bona fide mortgagee, pledgee, judgment creditor or purchaser whose rights shall have attached prior to the filing of the notice of tax lien on the property of the taxpayer other than on the goods, stock-in-trade and business fixtures of such taxpayer. 
(2)  Final inspection or certificate of occupancy denied unless tax paid. No final inspection shall be made by the city building inspector or no certificate of occupancy shall be issued unless all taxes due, as provided in this Code, on all lumber, fixtures and any other building materials and supplies used in or connected with the construction, reconstruction, alteration, expansion, modification or improvement of any building, dwelling or other structure or improvement to real property within the city have been paid or arrangements therefor made with the city treasurer. 
(e)  Notice of tax lien . If any taxes, penalty or interest imposed by this Code and shown due by returns filed by the taxpayer or as shown by assessments duly made as provided in this Code are not paid when due, the city may issue a notice of intent to file a tax lien to the taxpayer, setting forth the name of the taxpayer, the amount of the tax, penalties and interest, the date of the accrual thereof and that the city claims a first and prior lien therefor on the real and tangible personal property of the taxpayer except as to preexisting claims or liens of a bona fide mortgagee, pledgee, judgment creditor or purchaser whose rights shall have attached prior to the filing of the notice as provided in this subsection on property of the taxpayer other than on the goods, stock-in-trade and business fixtures of such taxpayer. 
(f)  Issuance of distraint warrant; filing of lien. Notice of lien shall be on forms prescribed by the city treasurer whose duties are the collection of such tax and may be filed in the office of the clerk and recorder of any county in the state in which the taxpayer owns real or tangible personal property, and the filing of such notice shall create such lien on such property in that county and constitute notice thereof. The city treasurer may issue a distraint warrant as provided in subsection (h) of this section at any time when taxes that are due remain unpaid, regardless of whether a notice of tax lien has been issued. 
(g)  Jeopardy assessment and distraint. 
(1)  Jeopardy enforcement. If the city treasurer finds that collection of the tax will be jeopardized by delay, in the city treasurer's discretion, the city treasurer may declare the taxable period immediately terminated, determine the tax and issue notice and demand for payment thereof, and having done so, the tax shall be due and payable forthwith, and the city treasurer may proceed immediately to collect such tax as provided in subsection (h) of this section. 
(2)  Immediate enforcement action. In any other case wherein it appears that the revenue is in jeopardy, the city treasurer may immediately issue demand for payment; and, regardless of the provisions of Sections 26-397 and 26-398, the tax shall be due and payable forthwith and, in the city treasurer's discretion, the city treasurer may proceed immediately to collect the tax as provided in subsection (h) of this section. 
(3)  Security for payment. Collection under either subsection (g)(1) or (g)(2) of this section may be stayed if the taxpayer gives such security for payment as shall be satisfactory to the city treasurer. 
(h)  Methods of enforcing collection. 
(1)  Issuance of distraint. The city treasurer may issue a warrant under the city treasurer's own hand directed to any employee, agent or representative of the city treasurer, sometimes referred to collectively in this section as "agent" or "revenue collector," or to any sheriff of any county of the state, commanding such person to distrain, seize cash and cash equivalents, and/or seize and sell the personal property of the taxpayer, except such personal property as is exempt from execution and sale by any statute of this state, for the payment of the tax due together with penalties and interest accrued thereon and cost of execution: 
a.  When any deficiency in tax is not paid within 30 calendar days after the date of the notice of final determination, assessment and demand for payment and no hearing has been requested and no appeal from such deficiency assessment has been docketed with any district court of this state within such period; 
b.  When any other amount of tax, penalty or interest is not paid within 30 calendar days after the date of the notice of final determination, assessment and demand for payment thereof; or 
c.  Immediately upon making of a jeopardy assessment or of the issuance of a demand for payment as provided in subsection (g) of this section. 
(2)  Distraint seizure; advertisement of sale. The agent charged with the seizure shall make or cause to be made an account of the goods or effects distrained, a copy of which, signed by the agent making such distraint, shall be left with the owner or possessor or at the owner's or possessor's usual place of abode with some member of the owner's or possessor's family over the age of 18 years. The account may also be left at the owner's or possessor's usual place of business with the owner's or possessor's stenographer, bookkeeper or chief clerk or, if the taxpayer is a corporation, shall be left with any officer, manager, general agent or agent for process, with a note of the sum demanded and the time and place of sale; and shall forthwith cause to be published a notice of the time and place of sale, together with a description of the property to be sold by any means of publication within the county wherein distraint is made, or, in lieu thereof and in the discretion of the city treasurer, the agent or sheriff shall cause such notice to be publicly posted at the courthouse of the county wherein such distraint is made, and copies thereof to be posted in at least two other public places within such county. The time fixed for the sale shall not be less than ten days nor more than 60 days from the date of such notification to the owner or possessor of the property and the publication or posting of such notices. The sale may be adjourned from time to time by such agent or sheriff if it is deemed advisable, but not for a time to exceed a total of 90 days from the date first fixed for the sale. When any personal property is advertised for sale under distraint, the agent or sheriff making the seizure shall proceed to sell such property at public auction, offering the property at not less than a fair minimum price, including the expenses of making the seizure and of advertising the sale, and if the amount bid for the property at the sale is not equal to the fair minimum price so fixed, the agent or sheriff conducting the sale may declare such to be purchased by such agent or sheriff for the city. The property so purchased may be sold by the agent or the sheriff under such regulations as may be prescribed by the city treasurer. In any case of distraint for the payment of taxes, the goods, chattels or effects so distrained shall be restored to the owner or possessor if, prior to the sale, the amount due is paid, together with the fees and other charges or may be redeemed by any person holding evidence satisfactory to the city treasurer of right of possession. 
(3)  Receipt of sale; evidence of purchase. In all cases of sale, the agent or sheriff making the sale shall issue a receipt of sale to each purchaser, and such receipt shall be prima facie evidence of the right of the agent or sheriff to make such sale and shall transfer to the purchaser all right, title and interest in and to the property sold; and where such property consists of certificates of stock in the possession of the agent or sheriff, the certificate of sale shall be notice, when received, to any corporation, company or association of the transfer, and the certificate of such sale shall be authority for such corporation, company or association to record the transfer on its books and records; and where the subject of sale is securities or other evidences of debt in the possession of the agent or sheriff, the certificate of sale shall be good and valid evidence of title in the person holding such as against any other person. Any surplus remaining above the taxes, penalties, interest, costs and expenses of making the seizure and of advertising the sale shall be returned to the owner or such other person having a legal right thereto, and, on demand, the city treasurer shall render an account in writing of the sale. 
(4)  Filing and release of lien. Any employee, agent or representative of the city treasurer to whom a distraint warrant has been directed may file with the person in possession of any personal property or right to property belonging to the taxpayer a notice of tax lien on such forms as the city treasurer may prescribe. The filing of such notice of lien shall operate from the date of such filing. The city treasurer may release the lien as to any part or all of the property or rights to property covered by any such lien upon such terms as the city treasurer may deem proper. 
(5)  Lien released. Any lien for taxes as shown on the records of the county clerk and recorder as provided in this section, upon payment of all taxes, penalties and interest covered thereby, shall be released by the city treasurer in the same manner as mortgages and judgments are released. 
(i)  Recovery of unpaid tax by action at law. 
(1)  Action at law. The city treasurer may also treat any such taxes, penalties or interest due and unpaid as a debt due the city from the taxpayer. In case of failure to pay the tax or any portion thereof or any penalty or interest thereon when due, the city treasurer may receive at law the amount of such taxes, penalties and interest in such county or district court of the county wherein the taxpayer resides or has a principal place of business having jurisdiction of the amounts sought to be collected. The return of the taxpayer or the assessment made by the city treasurer as provided in this Code shall be prima facie proof of the amount due. 
(2)  Writs of attachment. Such actions may be actions in attachment and writs of attachment may be issued to the sheriff, and in any such proceedings no bond shall be required of the city treasurer nor shall any sheriff require of the city treasurer an indemnifying bond for executing the writ of attachment or writ of execution upon any judgment entered in such proceedings, and the city treasurer may prosecute appeals or writs of error in such cases without the necessity of providing a bond. It shall be the duty of the city attorney, when requested by the city treasurer, to commence action for the recovery of taxes due under this Code, and this remedy shall be in addition to all other existing remedies or remedies provided in this Code. 
(3)  Civil action to enforce lien. In any case where there has been a refusal or neglect to pay any tax due the city and a statement or notice shall have been filed which, under law, creates a lien upon any real property for such tax, the city treasurer may cause a civil action to be filed in the district court of the county in which is situated any real property which is subject to such lien to enforce the lien of the city for such tax upon the real property situated in that county or in any other county in the state which may be subject to such lien or to subject any real property or any right, title or interest in real property to the payment of such tax. The court shall decree a sale of such real property and distribute the proceeds of such sale, according to the findings of such court in respect to the interest of the parties and the city the proceedings in such action, and the manner of sale, the period for and manner of redemption from such sale and the execution of deed of conveyance shall be in accordance with the law and practice relating to foreclosures of mortgages upon real property. In any such action, the court may appoint a receiver of the real property involved in such action if equity so requires. 
(j)  City as party defendant. In any action affecting the title to real estate or the ownership or rights to possession of personal property, the city may be made a party defendant for the purpose of obtaining in adjudication or determination of its lien upon the property involved therein, and in any such action service of summons upon the city treasurer or any other person permitted by law shall be sufficient service and binding upon the city. 
(k)  Certificate of discharge. 
(1)  Subject to lien. If any property, real or personal, under the law shall be subject to a lien for the non-payment of any tax due and if the city treasurer finds that the fair market value of that part of such property remaining subject to the lien is at least double the amount of the liability remaining unsatisfied in respect to such tax and the amount of all prior liens upon such property, the city treasurer may issue a certificate of discharge for any part of the property subject to the lien. 
(2)  Part of property. If any property, real or personal, under the law shall be subject to a lien for the non-payment of any tax due the city, the city treasurer may issue a certificate of discharge for any part of the property subject to the lien if there is paid over to the city treasurer an amount determined by the city treasurer which shall not be less than the value, as determined by the city treasurer, of the interest the city has in the part to be so discharged. 
(3)  Determination of values. In determining such values, the city treasurer shall give consideration to the fair market value of the part to be so discharged and to such liens thereon as have priority to the lien of the city. 
(4)  Certificate of release conclusive. A certificate of release or of partial discharge issued under subsection (l)(1) of this section shall be held conclusive in order that the lien of the city upon the property release therein is extinguished, but shall not extinguish nor release any portion of the lien nor property not specified in the release. 
(l)  Summons to court for violation of Code. The city treasurer may, at the discretion of the city treasurer, summon to municipal court any person who may be in violation of this Code as set forth in Section 26-394 or elsewhere in this Code. 
(m)  Closing agreements. 
(1)  Satisfaction of liability. For the purpose of facilitating the settlement and distribution of estates, trusts, receiverships, other fiduciary relationships or corporations in the process of dissolution or which have been dissolved, the city treasurer may agree with the fiduciary or director upon the amount of taxes due from the decedent, the decedent's estate, the trust, receivership or other fiduciary relationship or corporation for any of the fiduciary's or director's or its taxable periods under the provisions of the taxes covered by this Code and, except upon a showing of fraud, malfeasance or misrepresentation of a material fact, payment in accordance with such agreement shall be full satisfaction of the taxes for the taxable periods to which the agreement related. 
(2)  Personal liability. Except as provided in subsection (m)(4) of this section, any personal representative of a decedent or of the estate of a decedent or any trustee, receiver or other person acting in a fiduciary capacity or any director of a corporation in the process of dissolution or which has been dissolved who distributes the estate or fund in such person's control without having first paid any taxes covered by this Code due from such decedent's estate, trust estate, receivership or corporation covered by this Code and which may be assessed within the time limited by this Code shall be personally liable to the extent of the property so distributed, for any unpaid taxes of the decedent, decedent's estate, trust estate, receivership or corporation covered by this Code and which may be assessed within the time limited by this Code. 
(3)  In addition to the personal liability provided in subsection (m)(2) of this section, all officers of a corporation and all members of a partnership or a limited liability company required to collect, account for, and pay over any tax administered by this article who willfully fail to collect, account for, or pay over such tax or who willfully attempt in any manner to evade or defeat any such tax, or the payment thereof, and have been found to have violated Section 26-394, are subject to penalties as prescribed in Section 26-393(d) herein. An officer of a corporation or a member of a partnership or a limited liability company shall be deemed to be subject to this section if the corporation, partnership, or limited liability company is subject to filing returns or paying taxes administered by this article and if such officers of corporations or members of partnerships or limited liability companies voluntarily or at the direction of their superiors assume the duties or responsibilities of complying with the provisions of any tax administered by this article on behalf of the corporation, partnership, or limited liability company. 
(4)  Notification of liability. The distributee of a decedent's estate or a trust estate or fund or the stockholder of any dissolved corporation who receives any of the property of such decedent's estate, trust estate, fund or corporation shall be liable to the extent of the decedent, trust estate, fund or corporation covered by this Code and which may be assessed within the time limited by this Code. Notice to such distributee or stockholder shall be given in the same manner and within the time limit which would have been applicable had there been no distribution. 
(5)  Limitation of liability. 
a.  In case the tax imposed by this Code is due from a decedent or the decedent's estate or by a corporation, in order for personal liability under subsection (m)(2) of this section to remain in effect, determination of the tax due shall be made and a notice and demand shall issue within 18 months after written request for such determination, filed after the filing of the decedent's final return or filed after the filing of the return of the decedent's estate with respect to which such request is applicable by any personal representative of such decedent or by the corporation, filed after the filing of its return, but a request under this provision shall not extend the period of limitation otherwise applicable. 
b.  This subsection (m)(4) will not apply in the case of a corporation unless: 
1.  Such request notified the city treasurer that the corporation contemplates dissolution at or before the expiration of such 18-month period. 
2.  The dissolution is begun in good faith before the expiration of such 18-month period. 
3.  The dissolution is completed. 
c.  Upon the expiration of the 18-month period, without determination being made and notice and demand being issued, the personal representative or representatives of the decedent and the directors of the corporation no longer will be liable under the provisions of subsection (m)(2) of this section.

Sec. 26-401. - Coordinated audit. 
(a)  Any taxpayer licensed in this city pursuant to Section 26-391 and holding a similar sales tax license in at least four other state municipalities that administer their own sales tax collection may request a coordinated audit as provided in this section. 
(b)  Within 14 days of receipt of notice of an intended audit by any municipality that administers its own sales tax collection, the taxpayer may provide to the city finance director, by certified mail, return receipt requested, a written request for a coordinated audit indicating the municipality from which the notice of intended audit was received and the name of the official who issued such notice. Such request shall include a list of those state municipalities utilizing local collection of their sales tax in which the taxpayer holds a current sales tax license and a declaration that the taxpayer will sign a waiver of any passage-of-time based limitation upon this city's right to recover tax owed by the vendor for the audit period. 
(c)  Except as provided in subsection (g) of this section, any taxpayer who submits a complete request for a coordinated audit and promptly signs a waiver of limitation under Section 26-400 may be audited by this city during the 12 months after such request is submitted only through a coordinated audit involving all municipalities electing to participate in such an audit. 
(d)  If this city desires to participate in the audit of a taxpayer who submits a complete request for a coordinated audit pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, the finance director shall so notify the finance director of the municipality whose notice of audit prompted the taxpayer's request within ten days after receipt of the taxpayer's request for a coordinated audit. The finance director shall then cooperate with other participating municipalities in the development of arrangements for the coordinated audit, including arrangement of the time during which the coordinated audit will be conducted, the period of time to be covered by the audit, and a coordinated notice to the taxpayer of those records most likely to be required for completion of the coordinated audit. 
(e)  If the taxpayer's request for a coordinated audit was in response to a notice of audit issued by this city, this city's finance director shall facilitate arrangements between this city and other municipalities participating in the coordinated audit unless and until an official from some other participating municipality agrees to assume the responsibility. The finance director shall cooperate with other participating municipalities to, whenever practicable, minimize the number of auditors that will be present on the taxpayer's premises to conduct the coordinated audit on behalf of the participating municipalities. Information obtained by or on behalf of those municipalities participating in the coordinated audit may be shared only among such participating municipalities. 
(f)  If the taxpayer's request for a coordinated audit was in response to a notice of audit issued by this city, this city's finance director shall, once arrangements for the coordinated audit between the city and other participating municipalities are completed, provide written notice to the taxpayer of which municipalities will be participating, the period to be audited and the records most likely to be required by participating municipalities for completion of the coordinated audit. The finance director shall also propose a schedule for the coordinated audit. 
(g)  The coordinated audit procedure set forth in this section shall not apply: 
(1)  When the proposed audit is a jeopardy audit; 
(2)  To audits for which a notice of audit was given prior to the effective date of the ordinance from which this section derives; or 
(3)  When a taxpayer fails to provide a timely and complete request for a coordinated audit as provided in subsection (b) of this section.

Sec. 26-402. - Claims for recovery. 
(a)  The intent of this section is to streamline and standardize procedures related to situations where tax has been remitted to the incorrect municipality. It is not intended to reduce or eliminate the responsibilities of the taxpayer or vendor to correctly pay, collect, and remit sales and use taxes to the city. 
(b)  As used in this section, the term "claim for recovery" means a claim for reimbursement of sales and use taxes paid to the wrong taxing jurisdiction. 
(c)  When it is determined by the finance director that sales and use tax owed to the city has been reported and paid to another municipality, the city shall promptly notify the vendor that the taxes are being improperly collected and remitted, and that as of the date of the notice the vendor must cease improper tax collections and remittances. 
(d)  The city may make a written claim for recovery directly to the municipality that received tax and/or penalty and interest owed to the city or, in the alternative, may institute procedures for collection of the tax from the taxpayer or vendor. The decision to make a claim for recovery lies in the sole discretion of the city. Any claim for recovery shall include a properly executed release of claim from the taxpayer and/or vendor releasing its claim to the taxes paid to the wrong municipality, evidence to substantiate the claim, and a request that the municipality approve or deny, in whole or in part, the claim within 90 days of its receipt. The municipality to which the city submits a claim for recovery may, for good cause, request an extension of time to investigate the claim, and approval of such extension by the city shall not be unreasonably withheld. 
(e)  Within 90 days after receipt of a claim for recovery, the city shall verify to its satisfaction whether or not all or a portion of the tax claimed was improperly received and shall notify the municipality submitting the claim in writing that the claim is either approved or denied in whole or in part, including the reasons for the decision. If the claim is approved in whole or in part, the city shall remit the undisputed amount to the municipality submitting the claim within 30 days of approval. If a claim is submitted jointly by a municipality and a vendor or taxpayer, the check shall be made to the parties jointly. Denial of a claim for recovery may only be made for good cause. 
(f)  The city may deny a claim on the grounds that it has previously paid a claim for recovery arising out of an audit of the same taxpayer. 
(g)  The period subject to a claim for recovery shall be limited to the 36-month period prior to the date the municipality that was wrongly paid the tax receives the claim for recovery.

Any such sales tax credit may be granted to offset, in whole or in part, a public improvement fee, or similar fee, that is imposed on such taxable sales, provided that any such public improvement fees, or similar fees, that are imposed and collected on such taxable sales and that will be offset by any such sales tax credit will be applied to finance, construct, equip, or acquire improvements that will promote or enhance projects of economic significance or provide other economic development benefits to the city and its residents. Any such sales tax credit: (a) may be in such amount as set forth in such ordinance, (b) shall be granted in the form of a reduction in the applicable sales tax rate, and (c) shall attach to a particular transaction only to the extent that a corresponding public improvement fee, or similar fee, is imposed on such taxable sale, and collected and received by a collection agent for such transaction.

(b)  As soon as possible, but in no event later than three days after having towed a motor vehicle pursuant to the provisions of this article, excluding weekends and holidays observed by this city, the police department shall report the towing to the state department of motor vehicles by first class or certified mail or by personal delivery, as provided for in C.R.S. § 42-4-1804. 
(c)  The police department, upon receipt of a report from the state motor vehicle department on a towed motor vehicle, as provided for by C.R.S. § 42-4-1804, shall determine, from all available information and after reasonable inquiry, whether or not the towed motor vehicle has been reported stolen, and if so reported the police department shall recover and secure the motor vehicle and notify its rightful owner and terminate any further proceedings under this article.

Sec. 38-427. - Hearing regarding impoundment. 
(a)  A hearing concerning the legality of impounding or towing a motor vehicle shall be conducted before a judge or a hearing officer appointed by the presiding judge of the municipal court on the next available court date or within five days after the receipt of the request for the hearing, excluding weekends and city holidays. The applicant for the hearing may waive the requirement that the hearing be held on the next available court date or within five days. If a person requests a hearing on the impoundment of a motor vehicle and received a summons and complaint for a parking violation with regard to the same incident, the judge or hearing officer may schedule the hearing provided by this section to coincide with the trial of the infraction or may continue the hearing to such time. 
(b)  A person who requests a hearing pursuant to this article may obtain the release of the motor vehicle prior to the hearing by posting a bond in the amount of towing, storage charges and all other expenses incurred by the city as of the date of the request, plus administrative costs as established by resolution of the city council. The failure of such person to attend the hearing at the date and time scheduled shall constitute a waiver of such person's right to such hearing and a determination of all issues then existing as supporting the impoundment. The hearing request shall be dismissed with prejudice, and the bond amount shall be forfeited to the city. 
(c)  The court clerk's office, police department or a code compliance officer shall notify by telephone the person requesting the hearing and any record owner of any private property from which a vehicle was removed or impounded pursuant to this article or any known agent of such owner of the date, time and place of the hearing scheduled pursuant to this section. Notice to the person requesting the hearing constitutes notice to the record owner of the motor vehicle. 
(d)  The hearing officer shall conduct the hearing in an informal manner and shall not be bound by technical rules of evidence. The person demanding the hearing shall carry the burden of establishing that such person has the right to possession of the motor vehicle. A police officer or code compliance officer shall have the burden of establishing that at the time a tow decision is made there was probable cause to impound the vehicle in question. The standard of proof shall be a preponderance of the evidence. At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall prepare a written decision. The issue before the hearing officer shall be whether there was probable cause to impound the motor vehicle in question and whether the motor vehicle was removed and impounded in accordance with the provisions of this article. The term "probable cause to impound" shall mean such a state of facts as would lead a person of ordinary care and prudence to believe that there were adequate grounds for the removal of the motor vehicle under the provisions of this article. 
(e)  If the hearing officer finds the impoundment was valid as supported by probable cause when the tow decision is made, subject to subsection (f) of this Section 38-427, the officer may assess all costs of removal and impoundment and all other expenses incurred by the city plus administrative costs as established by resolution of the city council against the motor vehicle owner. If the hearing officer does not so find, the officer shall order the motor vehicle released immediately to the person entitled to possession and shall assess the costs of removal and impoundment against the city. 
(f)  The hearing officer has the discretion to consider any mitigating facts or circumstances the motor vehicle owner presents in determining whether to assess payment of all costs of removal and impound, and all other expenses against the motor vehicle owner and if the hearing officer finds, based upon any facts presented at the hearing, that the facts upon which the police officer or the code compliance officer relied to establish probable cause when making a decision to tow the vehicle were incomplete or inaccurate, the hearing officer may allocate costs of removal and impoundment and other expenses incurred by the city, including administrative costs, as deemed appropriate. 
(g)  A failure of any person to request an impoundment hearing or attend any such hearing constitutes a waiver of the right to such hearing and a determination of all issues then existing as supporting the impoundment. 
(h)  If the hearing officer orders the release of the motor vehicle to its owner or possessor and the possessor fails to present a copy of this order to the operator of the storage lot where the motor vehicle is impounded within 24 hours of its receipt, excluding weekends and city holidays, the owner or possessor shall assume liability for all subsequent storage charges. 
(i)  The provisions of this section shall not apply to removal of motor vehicles for any purpose other than those specified in this article. 
(Code 1975, § 34-23; Ord. No. 1623, 12-8-86; Ord. No. 1701, 8-24-87; Ord. No. 2666, § 18, 6-18-01; Ord. No. 2964, § 2, 10-10-06, eff. 11-1-06; Ord. No. 3200, § 1, 6-12-12) 
Sec. 38-428. - Foreclosure of lien for towing expenses. 
(a)  Any motor vehicle towed by the city pursuant to the provisions of this article shall be subject to a lien for all unpaid past, present and future charges incurred by this city or its towing carrier or storage lot operator up to the date of redemption. 
(b)  Any motor vehicle subject to this lien and not redeemed by the last known owner of record or lienholder after such owner or lienholder has been sent notice pursuant to this article shall be appraised and sold in accordance with this section. 
(c)  Prior to sale, the motor vehicle shall be appraised by a bona fide estimate of reasonable market value by a licensed motor vehicle dealer or a police department employee appointed pursuant to C.R.S. § 42-4-1802(1)(d). 
(d)  Towed motor vehicles to be sold shall be appraised and sold by the police department at a public or private sale held not less than 30 days or more than 60 days after the last notice required by this article was mailed or delivered. 
(e)  If the appraised value of the towed motor vehicle sold pursuant to this section is $200.00 or less, the sale shall be made only for the purpose of junking, scrapping or dismantling such motor vehicle. The police department shall cause to be executed and delivered a bill of sale, together with those reports required by C.R.S. § 42-4-1806, to the person purchasing such motor vehicle. The police department shall promptly submit a report of sale with a copy of the bill of sale to the state department of motor vehicles and shall deliver a copy of such report of sale to the purchaser of the motor vehicle. 
(f)  If the appraised value of an abandoned motor vehicle sold pursuant to this section is more than $200.00, the sale may be made for any intended use by the purchaser thereof. The purchasing agent shall cause to be executed and delivered a bill of sale, together with a copy of the report required by C.R.S. § 42-4-1804 and an application for a state certificate of title to the person purchasing such motor vehicle. 
(g)  Proceeds of sale of the motor vehicle shall be distributed pursuant to the provisions of C.R.S. § 42-4-1810.

Cross reference- Environment, Ch. 22. 

Sec. 38-440. - Purpose. 
(a)  The purpose of this Division 3 is to provide for uniform environmental regulations for the control of noise, humidity and heat, glare, vibration, dust, weeds and brush in recognition that: 
(1)  The quality of life in a community is enhanced when free from the nuisances created by these environmental conditions; 
(2)  The excessive exposure to these environmental conditions can adversely affect the health and safety of the citizens of the city; and 
(3)  The establishment and enforcement of reasonable standards is more effective than waiting until individual citizens have to complain of adverse impacts and therefore contributes to the general welfare of the community. 
(4)  The noise regulations contained in Section 38-441 are intended to be comprehensive and shall take precedence over and supersede any existing ordinance, regulation, standard, condition or use restriction the application of which would render Section 38-441 of no force or effect or which is in conflict with it, and supersedes any hours of delivery that are specified in any other ordinance or resolution. 
(b)  Any city project that the city manager determines is necessary to maintain or protect public amenities, facilities or infrastructure and thereby promote the public health, safety, and welfare shall be exempt from the environmental regulation contained in Sections 38-441 through 38-444. 
(Ord. No. 2550, § 6, 7-12-99; Ord. No. 2766, § 1, 3-25-03; Ord. No. 2953, § 4, 8-8-06)

(a)  General provisions. 
(1)  It shall be unlawful for any person or entity to knowingly, willfully or recklessly make, permit, cause to be made, or continue any noise from whatever source which noise is projected in such a manner that by its sound level and duration constitutes an unreasonable noise within the city. For purposes of this Section 38-441, code compliance officers and police officers shall apply but need not be limited to applying, the following factors to determine whether a noise constitutes a violation of this section, as follows: 
a.  The time of day; 
b.  The size of any gathering of persons creating or contributing to the noise; 
c.  The presence or absence of noise or sound amplification equipment; 
d.  Sound pressure levels measured on a sound level meter of standard design and operation on the A network, which indicate the noise level is in violation of the sound level standards contained in subsection (c), Table A, herein; and 
e.  Any other factors tending to show the magnitude and/or disruptive effect of the noise. 
(2)  It shall be unlawful for any person or entity to knowingly, willfully, or recklessly cause or permit or to continue any noise when: 
a.  The noise is plainly audible at a distance of more than 25 feet from a vehicle in any right-of-way; or 
b.  The noise is plainly audible more than 25 feet from its source including, but not limited to, any vehicle within any public place during the hours when businesses are open to the public; 
c.  The noise is plainly audible within any public right-of-way more than 25 feet from its source. 
Such circumstances and such facts presented shall constitute prima facie evidence and shall be deemed a per-se violation of this section. 
(3)  In addition to subsection (a)(1), the following are declared to be noises or sounds which by their sound level and duration disturb, or tend to disturb, the repose of the community and which shall constitute a violation of this subsection (a)(3); provided, however, that the following list is not a limitation of subsection (a)(1) of this section and is not inclusive: 
a.  Bells and chimes or any device for the production or reproduction of the sound of bells or chimes operated between the hours of 10:00 p.m. of one day and 7:00 a.m. of the following day and is in violation of the sound level standards contained in subsection (c), Table A herein. 
b.  The use or operation of any type of audio or video system, noisemaker or loudspeaker or public address system operated or used on public or private property for any purposes including, but not limited to, vending, advertising, announcements or notifications, or any device used for transmitting music or for giving instructions, talks or lectures to any assembly of persons which results in a noise which is plainly audible across the property line of any property used for residential purposes, unless otherwise permitted by subsection (c)(10) herein. 
c.  Any noise that is plainly audible through a common wall, ceiling or floor of a mixed-use building or multi-dwelling building. 
d.  Any animal or bird which by frequent or habitual howling, barking, yelping, meowing, squawking, squealing or other noise, creates a plainly audible sound. 
e.  Any steam engine, stationary internal combustion engine, air compressor, motorboat, motor vehicle or other power device which is not equipped with a muffler in good working order that is in constant operation and properly maintained and which use is in violation of the sound level standards contained in subsection (c), Table A, except as provided in subsection (b)(7) herein. No such muffler or exhaust system shall be modified or used with a cutoff, bypass, or similar device.

(2)  For the purpose of this Section 38-453, property owner shall include renters, lessees, occupants or persons in possession of the property. 
(3)  The property owner has 30 days from the date the notice of assessment is mailed or if notice is returned, from the date the property is posted to pay the assessment. Failure to pay within the time allotted will cause the assessment to be recorded against the property. The assessment will constitute a continuing lien against such property. 
(4)  The amount of the assessment will include, in addition to all contractors' charges, impoundment fees, storage fees, inspection costs, attorneys' fees, court costs, and all other associated costs. The assessment may be paid any time prior to the assessment being turned over to the county treasurer. Payments must be made directly to the city's finance director.

(6)  A property owner may object to such assessment within 30 days from the date the notice of assessment was mailed or if the notice is returned, from the date the property is posted. The objection must be in writing and mailed to and received by the municipal court within the 30-day period. The objection must include a phone number and address of the objecting party, and must state the basis for the objection. Upon receipt of such objection, the city manager will appoint a hearing officer. Such hearing officer will then set a hearing date, which hearing shall be within 30 days from receipt of the objection. Notice of this date will be mailed to the person making the objection. Failure to include an address in the objection will constitute a waiver of the right to file an objection. 
(7)  The property owner who requests the hearing will be charged an additional administrative cost, established by resolution of the city council, should the hearing officer find in favor of the city. Failure of such person to attend the hearing at the date and time scheduled shall constitute a waiver of such right to a hearing and a determination of all issues regarding the assessment. 
(8)  The hearing officer shall conduct the hearing in an informal manner and shall not be bound by technical rules of evidence. The city shall carry the burden of establishing there was probable cause to cite for a violation and that a violation did occur. The standard of proof shall be by a preponderance of the evidence. A written decision will be prepared at the end of the hearing. This decision will be reached after both the landowner and the city have presented their cases. The decision will be deemed effective three days from the date the decision is mailed to the property owner as provided in subsection (b)(1).

Sec. 38-495. - All-way stops on residential streets. 
(a)  Additional criteria for establishing. In addition to criteria established in Section 2B-6 of the Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices, the traffic engineer or official vested with responsibility for traffic control of this city may install all-way stops on residential streets when warranted after the performance of a point assessment study based upon the criteria established in this section. 
(b)  Point criteria. A point assessment study shall be performed by the traffic engineer or other official charged with the responsibility for traffic control at the intersection of the proposed all-way stop and the total of all points assessed will be compared with 500 points. If the intersection under study exceeds 500 points and is a residential or residential minor collector, the intersection has met the established criteria for the installation of an all-way stop. The points shall be assessed based upon the following standards: 
(1)  Street classification. The installation of all-way stops pursuant to this section shall be used only on streets classified by the traffic engineer or official vested with responsibility for traffic control as local residential or minor collectors in residential areas. 
(2)  Eighty-five-percent vehicle speed. Points will be assessed as follows based upon the highest average daily vehicle speed of 85 percent of all vehicle approaches of the intersection within a 24-hour period: 
MPH Points0 16-20 20 21-25 40 26-30 60 31-35 80 36-40 100 41 and over 120  
(3)  School pedestrians. At those school pedestrian crossing locations where there is no traffic signal or adult pedestrian crossing guard assigned by the school, points will be assessed during the morning or afternoon hour of highest pedestrian traffic: 
Points Each elementary school child 2 Each junior or middle school child 1  
Points will also be assessed for pedestrian crosswalks at intersections in close proximity to schools. The primary crossing shall be assessed 200 points and other adjacent crossings shall be assessed 100 points. 
Prior to the investigation for installation of all-way stop signs in close proximity to an elementary school, a pedestrian walk route plan shall be developed by the traffic engineer or other official charged with traffic control and reviewed by the school and parent/teacher organization prior to distribution by the school. 
(4)  School age pedestrians' midday periods at nonschool locations. Points will be assessed for the average midday hour of pedestrian traffic at nonschool locations as follows: 
Points Each elementary age school child 2 Each junior or middle school child 1  
Fifty points will be assessed for each pedestrian with a physical, visual or auditory disability. Physical disability shall mean those pedestrians utilizing wheelchairs, canes, crutches or other aids, or who walk at a speed of less than three feet per second. 
(5)  Intersection accident history. Based upon police department accident reports within the 12 months immediately preceding the point assessment study, each right angle collision and vehicle/pedestrian accident that occurred at that intersection shall be assessed 75 points. All other vehicle/vehicle accidents during that time period at that location shall each be assessed 20 points. 
(6)  Critical approach speed. Based upon the Critical Approach Speed Chart (CAS), of the Traffic Engineering Handbook, from the Institute of Transportation Engineers, 1965 edition, points will be assessed for the lowest CAS of approaching traffic. The CAS measures the sight distance for crossing intersecting streets and points shall be assessed as follows: 
Points Greater than 21 mph  0 From 11-20 mph 20 From 6-10 mph 50 Less than 5 mph 75  
(7)  Other potential hazards or conflicts. Points will be assessed as follows for the presence of one or more of the following conflicts or hazards at the intersection: 
Points Bridges or underpass within 800 feet of one of the intersecting streets 20 Within 300 feet of a grade railroad crossing 50 Within 300 feet of a curve or hill that obscures view of intersection 50  
(8)  Public facilities. Twenty-five points shall be assessed for each public facility such as a church, park, pool, bus stop, library, shopping center, or day care facility with ten or more children that is located within 300 feet of the intersection. 
(9)  Special concerns. Points shall be assessed for each of the following concerns located at the intersection: 
Points Street approach width is less than 22 feet 25 No street lighting within 300 feet 20 Curb other than six-inch vertical curb, per approach 15 On-street parking allowed within 50 feet, per approach 10 No sidewalk on either side, per approach 20  
(10)  Traffic volume. Points shall be assessed for the average hour of the highest eight hourly traffic volumes with one point for each vehicle. However if the average of the minor leg hourly volume is less than 160 vehicles per hour, the point assessment is reduced by the following: 
120-159 vehicles/hour, subtract 50 points. 
119-100 vehicles/hour, subtract 100 points. 
99-75 vehicles/hour, subtract 120 points. 
74-zero vehicles/hour, subtract 150 points. 
(11)  Adjacent traffic control. If the intersection is within 800 feet of another intersection controlled by an all-way stop or traffic signal, 100 points shall be subtracted from the point assessment. If any adjacent intersection controlled by a stop or yield sign on the major street of the intersection is within 800 feet of the intersection that is the subject of the point assessment study, 50 points shall be subtracted from the point assessment. If the intersection is adjacent to a school, no points are to be subtracted regardless of the criteria in this subsection. 
(c)  Point evaluation. If the total of all of the points assessed during the point assessment study performed based upon the criteria established in subsection (b) of this section is equal to or more than 500 points and the intersection is a residential street or a residential minor collector, the traffic engineer or other official charged with the responsibility for traffic control may install an all-way stop at that intersection.

Sec. 38-971. - Interference with radio or television reception. 
(a)  Interference prohibited. It shall be unlawful for any person to install, maintain, use or operate any apparatus or any device, whether electrical, mechanical or of any other kind whatsoever, so as to cause electrostatic or electromagnetic waves to radiate so as to interfere with radio, television including cable television and video playback equipment connected thereto, computer, telephone or audio tape, disk, or record player reception in the city.

DIVISION 2. - COMPLICITY OR ACCOMPLICE LIABILITY 

Sec. 38-991. - Parties to offenses. 
(a)  Accountability and complicity. 
(1)  A person is guilty of a municipal ordinance or code section violation as a complicitor if the violation is committed by another person or entity for which such person is legally accountable. 
(2)  A person is legally accountable for the behavior of another person as a complicitor if: 
a.  The person is made accountable for the conduct of another person by the language of the ordinance or code section describing the violation. 
b.  The person knowingly participates with another in the commission of a violation or aids, abets, attempts to commit or conspires to commit the violation with another. 
c.  The person fraudulently, forcibly or knowingly causes another person to commit a violation. 
d.  The person ratifies the commission of a violation by another person. (Example: A person who falsely claims to be the driver of an automobile, whose true driver committed a traffic violation, becomes guilty of that violation as a complicitor by ratification.) 
e.  The person knowingly renders assistance to another person who has committed a violation by hindering, delaying or preventing the discovery of the violation or the identification, apprehension, prosecution or conviction of another person for the commission of a violation. "Rendering assistance" includes harboring or concealing such person to avoid apprehension or discovery; warning such person of impending discovery or apprehension; providing such person with money, transportation, weapon, disguise or other thing to avoid discovery or apprehension; using deception to obstruct a law enforcement officer in the discovery, identification, apprehension or prosecution of the person who committed a violation; concealing, destroying or altering any evidence that would aid in the discovery, identification, apprehension, prosecution or conviction or another person. 
(3)  A person is legally accountable for conduct constituting an offense which that person performs or causes to occur in the name or in behalf of a corporation to the same extent as if that conduct were performed or caused by that person in that person's own name or behalf. Such accountability may occur not only by the committing of such violation but also by a violation consisting of an omission to discharge a specific duty of affirmative performance imposed on a corporation by ordinance or code section (e.g., a person who operates or manages a business owned by a corporation without the proper license is as guilty as the corporation of the violation; e.g., the officers of a corporation owning a retail business who fail to file returns or pay taxes as required by the tax code are as guilty as the corporation for such violations). 
(b)  Prosecution and defense. 
(1)  Under this Code, this section is not a separate and distinct violation of an ordinance or code section, and in order for a person to be held accountable, it is only necessary to specifically charge a person with the substantive violation. This section creates a theory by which the defendant becomes accountable for a violation committed by another. The penalty imposed for finding a defendant guilty of a violation in relation to this section is that penalty imposed on the substantive violation. 
(2)  In any prosecution for a violation which criminal liability is based upon this section, it is no defense that another person has not been prosecuted for or convicted of any violation based upon the behavior or incident in question or has been convicted of a different violation or degree or offense. 
(3)  This section shall be so interpreted and construed as to effectuate its general purpose of consolidating the legal concepts of complicity, conspiracy and accessory to a violation and shall apply to all prosecutions for municipal ordinance violations, including traffic matters.

A license issued pursuant to this section shall be transferable only pursuant to Section 42-586. 
(d)  Denial. 
(1)  The city clerk shall deny a request for issuance of a license for any of the following reasons: 
a.  An applicant is under 21 years of age; 
b.  In the case of renewal, if the applicant is overdue in payment to the city of taxes, fees, fines, or penalties assessed or imposed upon the sexually oriented business; 
c.  An applicant has failed to provide any information required by this division for the issuance of the license or has falsely answered a question on the application form or request for information;

f.  An applicant is found to be in violation of, or is not in compliance with, any relevant statutes, codes, ordinances, regulations or other laws in effect in the city;

h.  The applicant has had a license issued under this division which had been suspended or revoked within the previous 12 months; 
i.  An applicant has been convicted of a specified criminal act or acts for which: 
1.  Less than two years have elapsed since the date of conviction or the date of release from confinement, whichever is the later date, if the conviction is of a misdemeanor offense;

3.  Less than five years have elapsed since the date of conviction or the date of release from confinement, whichever is the later date, if the convictions are of two or more misdemeanors.

j.  The corporation for which a license has been issued or requested is not in good standing as required by the secretary of state of the state in which the corporation is incorporated; or 
k.  If an applicant has had a license issued under this division or any other similar sexually oriented business ordinance from another city or county denied, suspended, or revoked for cause within five years of the date of the application. 
(2)  In the event that the city clerk denies a request for issuance of a license, after having received and compiled information concerning the proposed business from all relevant sources, the city clerk shall make written findings of fact stating the reasons for the denial and will so notify the applicant within five days of such decision. An applicant shall be entitled to a hearing on a decision to deny before the city manager. A written request for such a hearing shall be made to the city manager within 30 days of the date of the city clerk's decision to deny a request for issuance of a license. This hearing shall follow all the relevant procedures set forth for a suspension or revocation of a license contained in Section 42-591(d). 
(3)  If, at the hearing referred to in subsection (d)(2) of this section, the city manager determines that the applicant is ineligible for a license pursuant to subsection (d)(1) of this section, the city manager shall issue an order affirming the city clerk's denial, within 30 days after the date of the hearing is concluded, based on the findings of fact advanced at the hearing. A copy of the order shall be mailed to, postage prepaid, or be served on the applicant at the address shown in the application. 
(4)  The order of the city manager made pursuant to subsection (d)(3) of this section shall be a final decision and may be appealed to the district court pursuant to Colorado Rules of Civil Procedure 106(a)(4). Failure of an applicant to timely appeal the city manager's decision constitutes a waiver by the applicant of any right to contest the decision. 
(5)  Notwithstanding any other time periods set forth in this division, no license shall be issued by the city clerk until the building in which the business is to be housed is ready for occupancy with such furniture, fixtures, and equipment in place as necessary to comply with the provisions of this article as well as any other requirements determined by the building inspection division, and then only after inspection of the premises has been made by the building inspection division to determine that the applicant has complied with the plans and specifications submitted upon application. If the licensed location has been inactive, or if the construction of the building has not commenced within one year after approval of the request for issuance of a license, the city clerk, at the city clerk's discretion, may revoke, suspend or elect not to issue or renew the license. Such discretion also exists if the building fails to be in operation within two years of granting approval for the issuance of a license.

(b)  In the event the city clerk determines that a license should be revoked, after having received information demonstrating or evidencing a violation of this section, the city clerk shall make written findings of fact stating the reasons for the revocation and will so notify the licensee within five days of such decision. A licensee shall be entitled to a hearing before the city manager if the city seeks to revoke a license under this section. A request for such hearing must be received by the city clerk within ten days of such request for a hearing. If the city clerk receives no request for a hearing within ten days of notification, the decision to revoke a license will be final. If the city clerk receives a request for a hearing by a licensee, the city manager will schedule such hearing within 14 days of receipt of the request and will so notify the licensee of the date and time of the hearing. The hearing shall follow all the relevant procedures set forth in subsection (d) of this section. 
(c)  When the city clerk has determined that a license should be revoked, the revocation shall continue for a period of two years. A licensee, owner or principal owner of a sexually oriented business who has had a license revoked shall be ineligible to apply for a license for two years from the date the revocation became effective. 
(d)  A licensee shall be entitled to a hearing before the city manager if the city clerk seeks to deny, suspend, or revoke a license issued pursuant to this division for reasons stated in this division, pursuant to the following procedure: 
(1)  The city manager shall hear statements and consider all evidence, including the city clerk's findings, from the police department or other enforcement officers, the licensee, the owner, or principal owner, or other affected department or that any other witness shall offer which is relevant to the violation of any statute, law, ordinance, or regulation alleged to have occurred. The hearing shall be an informal quasi-judicial hearing with the rules of evidence used as a guide for the presentation of evidence. All testimony by witnesses must be sworn testimony; the city manager shall swear in all witnesses. The city manager shall make findings of fact and issue an order from the statements, evidence and arguments offered. The burden of proof is on the city to show that a violation of any statute, law, ordinance or regulation occurred or that actions constituting grounds for denial, suspension or revocation occurred by a preponderance of the evidence. If the city manager determines that such a violation occurred or that any grounds exist for denial, suspension or revocation, the city manager shall issue an order either reaffirming the city clerk's findings or an order denying, suspending or revoking the license. The order shall be prepared within 30 calendar days after the hearing is concluded. A copy of the order shall be mailed, postage prepaid, or served on the licensee or owner at the address shown on the license. 
(2)  The order of the city manager made pursuant to subsection (d)(1) of this section shall be a final decision and may be appealed to the district court pursuant to Colorado Rules of Civil Procedure 106(a)(4). Failure of a licensee, owner or principal owner to timely appeal the order constitutes a waiver by the licensee, owner or principal owner of any right that may otherwise be available to contest the denial, suspension or revocation of the license. 
(3)  The city manager shall have the power to administer oaths, issue subpoenas, and when necessary, grant continuances. Subpoenas may be issued to require the presence of persons and/or the production of papers, books, records or other documents necessary for a fair determination of any issue presented at the hearing. A subpoena shall be served in the same manner as a subpoena issued by the district court of the state. Upon failure of any witness to comply with such subpoena, the city attorney shall: 
a.  Petition any judge of the municipal court, setting forth that due notice has been given of the time and place of attendance of the witness and the service of the subpoena, that the court, after hearing evidence in support of or contrary to the petition, enter its order compelling the witness to attend and testify or produce books, records or other evidence, under penalty of punishment for contempt in case of willful failure to comply with such order of court; or 
b.  Petition district court in and for the county, setting forth that due notice has been given of the time and place of attendance of the witness and the service of the subpoena, that the court, after hearing evidence in support of or contrary to the petition, enter its order as in other civil actions, compelling the witness to attend and testify or produce books, records or other evidence, under penalty of punishment for contempt in case of willful failure to comply with such order of the court. 
(e)  In any such proceedings the city attorney may act on behalf of the city during the hearing. The licensee, owner or principal owner may be represented by counsel. 
(f)  All hearings held before the city manager regarding suspension or revocation of a license issued under this division shall be recorded stenographically or by electronic recording device. Any person requesting a transcript of such record shall post a deposit in the amount required by the city clerk and shall pay all costs of preparing such record. 
(g)  In the event of a denial, suspension or revocation of a license, or a cessation of business for any reason, no portion of the license fee shall be refunded. 
(h)  When the city manager affirms a decision by the city clerk to deny, suspend or revoke, pursuant to the applicable subsections of this section, the denial, suspension or revocation shall be for the same time period and upon the same conditions as specified by that subsection.

c.  If the authority finds, by preponderance of the evidence, that the community engagement plan does not meet the requirements of Section 42-716(d)(2), or that the community engagement plan is not consistent with the applicant's application and supplemental materials, and that additional conditions would not ensure that the proposed business will not adversely impact the health, welfare, or public safety of the neighborhood in which the store is proposed to be located, the authority may deny the license.

(1)  The licensee has not paid all applicable fees required by this article; 
(2)  The licensee has failed to file tax returns when due as required by the city, or the licensee is overdue on his or her payment to the city of taxes, fines, interest, or penalties assessed against or imposed upon such licensee in relation to the licensed business;

(8)  The renewal application fails to include the licensee's community engagement plan for the renewal term or does not meet the requirements stated in Section 42-716(d)(2); or

If the city clerk finds that the licensee has not taken any steps to meet one or more component of the approved community engagement plan, substantial compliance will not be found. If, in the opinion of the city clerk, the licensee has not made good faith effort in achieving substantial compliance with its approved community engagement plan, the city clerk may find a lack of substantial compliance, and must state with specificity, in writing, the grounds for such a finding, which shall appealable to the hearing officer. 
(e)  Upon receipt of a renewal application, the city clerk shall forward the application to the appropriate departments for review. If the licensee is in compliance with all city and state laws, rules and regulations, is in substantial compliance with its approved community engagement plan, if applicable, and is otherwise not prohibited from holding a marijuana establishment license, the license shall be renewed administratively. If the city clerk determines that there are grounds for denial of the renewal application, as stated above, the renewal application shall be referred to the hearing officer for a hearing. If, after hearing, the hearing officer determines that the licensee is prohibited by state or local law from holding a marijuana establishment license, the renewal application shall be denied. If, after hearing, the hearing officer determines that the licensee is not in compliance with all city and state laws and rules and regulations, the renewal application shall be denied. If, after hearing, the hearing officer determines that the licensee is not in substantial compliance with its approved community engagement plan, the hearing officer may deny the application, or may approve the application with conditions designed to ensure future compliance with the licensee's community engagement plan. Failure to abide by any of the terms or conditions as required by the hearing officer to achieve substantial compliance shall be grounds for a complaint against the licensee, and may result in the imposition of a civil penalty, or suspension or revocation of the license. 
(f)  After the hearing officer's decision, any party may appeal to the Marijuana Licensing Authority ("MLA") on the grounds that the hearing officer erred in a ruling of law or a procedural ruling or finding of fact, and only if the ruling or finding affected the outcome of the case. Upon receiving an appeal, the MLA will review (1) rulings of law de novo, (2) procedural rulings for abuse of discretion, and (3) a material finding of fact to determine if evidence supporting such finding was lacking or greatly outweighed by the record as a whole. An appeal to the MLA must be filed within ten business days of the hearing officer's decision, and the appeal will be limited to the issues raised in a timely manner. The MLA may affirm, reverse, modify or remand for further proceedings the hearing officer's decision. A timely filed appeal shall stay the hearing officer's decision until the appeal has been decided or dismissed; otherwise, the hearing officer's decision shall be the final decision of the city. 
(g)  Notwithstanding anything contained in this article, a licensee has no vested right to the renewal of a license, and no property right in the renewal of a license.

(10)  The licensee has knowingly permitted or encouraged, or has knowingly and unreasonably failed to prevent a public nuisance within the meaning of Chapter 38, Article 10 of this Code from occurring on or about the licensed premises;

(11)  The sentencing recommendation of the city attorney or any stipulation between the city attorney and the licensee. 
(e)  For purposes of imposing of a civil penalty, or suspending or revoking any license, the licensee shall be deemed to have permitted an act or condition if a reasonable licensee or permittee would have been aware of the act or condition and taken action to stop the act or eliminate the condition. 
(f)  Any act or omission committed by any employee, agent, or independent contractor that occurs in the course of his or her employment, agency, or contract with the licensee shall be imputed to the licensee or permittee for purposes of imposing any suspension, revocation, or other sanction on the licensee or permittee.

(i)  If the hearing officer finds that the license should be suspended or revoked, the licensee shall be provided written notice of such suspension or revocation and the reasons therefore within 20 days following the date of the hearing. 
(j)  The hearing officer's decision to suspend or revoke a license is a final decision reviewable in accordance with state law. The licensee's failure to timely appeal the decision is a waiver of the licensee's right to contest the suspension or revocation of the license. 
(k)  Whenever a decision of the hearing officer suspending a license becomes final, the licensee may, at the conclusion of the hearing, or at least three calendar days before the operative date of the suspension, petition for permission to pay a fine in lieu of having the license suspended for all or part of the suspension period, except the period of a mandatory suspension pursuant to the sentencing guidelines.

Upon the receipt of the petition, the hearing officer has sole discretion to stay the proposed suspension and cause any investigation to be made, and may grant the petition based upon the following factors: 
a.  The public welfare and morals would not be impaired by permitting the licensee to operate during the suspension and that payment of the fine will achieve the desired disciplinary purposes. 
b.  The books and records of the licensee are kept in such a manner that the loss of sales can be determined with reasonable accuracy therefrom; and 
c.  The licensee's record of compliance with all state and local marijuana licensing laws, regulations and ordinances.

(3)  Payment of any fine pursuant to the provisions of this subsection shall be in the form of cash, money order, or certified check or cashier's check made payable to the city.

Sec. 54-183. - Procedure for administering suspension, demotion or discharge actions. 
(a)  If there are reasonable grounds to believe that a certified employee may have violated the provisions of Section 54-182, the certified employee's department head shall notify the human resources director and shall set a date for a fact-finding meeting to determine if further action is appropriate. 
(b)  The fact-finding meeting shall be held after not less than two nor more than 30 days' written notice to the certified employee. Such written notice shall advise the employee of the nature of the allegations and that the employee will have the opportunity to present evidence on the employee's own behalf at the fact-finding meeting. 
(c)  The department head shall preside at the fact-finding meeting and, after a statement of the allegations has been read, shall consider any relevant evidence that the certified employee wishes to present through testimony or documents. The human resources director and city attorney may attend such meeting. The department head shall then consider such additional evidence as is appropriate. Strict rules of procedure and rules of evidence shall not be applicable during this meeting. The certified employee may obtain legal representation at the employee's expense. 
(d)  If the department head concludes that no violation of Section 54-182 has been established, no further action shall be taken against the affected certified employee and any reference to the proceedings shall be removed from the certified employee's personnel file. 
(e)  If the department head concludes that one or more violations of Section 54-182 have been established based on the evidence presented at the fact-finding meeting, and any other information available to the department head, the department head shall submit to the appointing authority written findings and recommendations as to the nature of the disciplinary action, if any, to be administered. 
(f)  The appointing authority shall review the record of the fact-finding meeting, the written findings and recommendations of the department head, and may elect to consider such additional evidence as the appointing authority deems appropriate. 
(g)  After review of the findings and recommendations of the department head and consideration of any additional evidence presented to the appointing authority, the appointing authority shall determine if one or more violations of Section 54-182 have been established based on the evidence presented at the fact-finding meeting, and any other information available to the department head. 
(h)  If the appointing authority concludes that no such violation has been established based on the evidence presented at the fact-finding meeting, and any other information available to the department head, no further action shall be taken with regard to these allegations and any reference to the proceedings shall be removed from the affected certified employee's personnel file. 
(i)  If the appointing authority concludes that one or more violations of Section 54-182 have been established based on the evidence presented at the fact-finding meeting, and any other information available to the department head, the appointing authority shall notify the affected certified employee in writing of the appointing authority's findings, the specific suspension, demotion or discharge action being administered, and the effective date of such action. The certified employee shall also be notified of such employee's right to appeal such action to the hearing authority within ten days of the letter of notification from the appointing authority. 
(j)  A complaint instituted against a certified employee who has alleged to have violated a federal or state law or a county or municipal ordinance in the course of employment duties or to have committed a felony or a crime of moral turpitude shall be handled in accordance with the following: 
(1)  The disciplinary action and administration of punishment, if appropriate, may proceed notwithstanding criminal charges and the exercise or potential exercise of the employee's Fifth Amendment rights shall not serve as a basis for delaying the imposition of discipline or implementation of administrative appeal under this section. 
(2)  A certified employee who refuses to answer questions during the fact-finding meeting shall be subject to disciplinary action. Strict rules of procedure and rules of evidence shall not be applicable during this meeting. The certified employee may obtain legal representation at the employee's expense. 
(3)  If criminal charges for such a crime are still pending as of the date on which the appointing authority makes a determination on the disciplinary action and the appointing authority makes an initial determination that there is insufficient evidence on which to conclude that the certified employee committed such crime, the appointing authority shall continue the matter until such time as the criminal charges are resolved. During such period, if the employee had been suspended pursuant to Section 54-186(b), the certified employee shall be reinstated in the employee's former position unless it is the determination of the appointing authority that such reinstatement would not be in the best interests of the city, in which case the employee shall be suspended with pay until the criminal charges have been resolved, however, for a period not exceeding 180 days, or assign such employee to another position. Upon resolution of the criminal charges the appointing authority shall make a determination as to the disposition of the disciplinary action based on the record, any additional information presented to the appointing authority and any additional information regarding resolution of the criminal charges pursuant to the provisions of Section 54-184. 
(4)  If the appointing authority has, at the time of the determination of the disciplinary action, received proof that the certified employee has been convicted of such a crime, such evidence shall conclusively establish that the employee committed the crime. However, if the conviction is reversed on the basis of the insufficiency of the evidence, the affected certified employee may request reconsideration of the appointing authority's determination but in no event shall the certified employee be entitled to back wages or benefits as a result of such reconsideration.

(a)  A disciplinary action may include but is not limited to suspension, demotion, or discharge or such adjustments in status, pay or tenure as are permitted by law. The nature of the disciplinary action administered shall be commensurate with the nature of the violation, the adverse or potential adverse impact of the employee's actions on the welfare of other employees and persons, the effective operation of the city and a consideration of the employee's personnel record with the city. 
(b)  An employee shall not be reprimanded or disciplined more than once for a particular violation but may be subject to disciplinary action for any future violations whether or not of a similar nature. Evidence of prior reprimands or disciplinary actions may fully be considered in determining the knowledge or intent of an employee facing new charges, or in determining the severity of any disciplinary action to be administered. 
(Code 1975, § 55-55; Ord. No. 1988, § 2, 6-25-90) 
Sec. 54-185. - Appeals of suspension, demotion or discharge. 
(a)  [Procedure.] A certified employee who has been suspended, demoted, or discharged may appeal such action to the hearing authority by filing a written notice of appeal with the human resources director no later than ten calendar days after the date in which the employee was notified of such suspension, demotion or discharge by the appointing authority. Such notice shall be signed and dated upon receipt by the human resources director, and a copy of the notice given to the affected employee upon request. The notice of appeal shall state the reasons why the employee feels that the suspension, demotion or discharge was unjust and shall state with particularity the rights of the employee which were violated by the appointing authority as a result of such suspension, demotion or discharge. The employee shall select the form of hearing authority at the time of submitting the written appeal. If no selection is provided by the employee, then a hearing officer shall be used. The human resources director shall forward the written appeal to the hearing authority and provide the appointing authority a copy of the appeal. The human resources director shall ensure that any documents relevant to the notice of appeal shall be timely provided to the hearing authority. Whenever the appointing authority or the employee or the employee's designee furnishes the hearing authority with any documents, copies of such documents shall also be furnished to the other party in a timely fashion. 
(b)  Hearing. Within 45 calendar days of receipt of the notice of appeal, the hearing authority shall set a hearing on the appeal. The human resources director shall notify the appointing authority, and the employee of the date on which the hearing is scheduled to be held, in a timely manner. 
(c)  Conduct of hearing. The appointing authority and employee may each be represented by legal counsel if they so desire. If the employee retains legal counsel, it shall be at the employee's expense. Formal rules of evidence shall not be applicable. At such hearing, the employee, with or without the assistance of legal counsel or other representative, may call such witnesses and present such testimony and documentation as will be pertinent to the issue of whether the suspension, demotion or discharge action administered the employee was unjust. The appointing authority or legal representative may also provide such testimony, documentation or other evidence to the hearing authority as will be relevant to this issue. The appointing authority, employee and their representatives may cross examine the opposing party's witness. No ex parte material or representation of any kind shall be received or considered by the hearing authority. 
(d)  Standard of review. The authority of the hearing authority shall be restricted to determining whether the suspension, demotion, or discharge administered to the employee was unjust. In making such determination, the hearing authority shall determine whether the suspension, demotion, or discharge occurred in violation of this Code or applicable law. The hearing authority shall determine whether the appointing authority abused the discretion of the appointing authority by determining that the employee violated a provision of this Code. The standard of proof shall be a preponderance of the evidence. 
(e)  Decision of hearing authority. Within 30 calendar days after the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing authority shall provide the appointing authority, human resources director and employee with its written findings of fact and decision. If the findings of fact demonstrate that any of the ground(s) for suspension, demotion or discharge are present, the hearing authority shall affirm the action of the appointing authority. If the findings of fact demonstrate that none of the ground(s) for suspension, demotion or discharge are present, the hearing authority shall set aside the action. The decision of the hearing authority shall be final and binding on all parties. The hearing authority's decision is subject to judicial review which can be sought by either the employee or the city on the grounds that the findings of fact and decision were not supported by the record as a whole or that the hearing authority failed to follow the procedures in the Code or acted without authority specified in the Code. Any expenses incurred in a judicial review by the employee shall be paid by the employee, including the cost of a transcript. 
(f)  Stay of enforcement. Unless the appointing authority, in the appointing authority's sole discretion, determines that immediate action is necessary to ensure the safe and efficient administration of city business, enforcement of a suspension, demotion, or discharge shall be stayed pending expiration of the ten-day time period for filing a notice of appeal of suspension, demotion, or discharge, and, if the notice of appeal is filed within set time, during the pendency of such appeal before the hearing authority. 
(g)  Expungement of record. If the hearing authority reverses a suspension, demotion or discharge action, all documents and records pertaining to the action so rescinded or reversed shall be removed from the employee's personnel file and the employee shall be restored to the employee's position with no loss of pay or service credit imposed as a result of the action which has been so rescinded or reversed.

Sec. 54-186. - Summary suspension. 
(a)  Immediate suspension for protection of persons and property. 
(1)  Any employee against whom disciplinary proceedings have been or will be instituted where a reasonable basis is found that the employee would endanger persons or property or substantially interfere with the efficient operation of city government, should the employee be permitted to remain in the employee's present position during the pendency of such disciplinary procedures, shall be subject to immediate suspension by the appointing authority. 
(2)  Any summary suspension of an employee pursuant to the provisions of this subsection shall be with pay and fringe benefits except for automobile, uniform or tool allowances until such time as the disciplinary action is resolved pursuant to the provisions of Section 54-183, except that any summary suspension for failure to obtain and maintain a current license or certificate required as a condition of employment may be without pay. An employee may submit a written notification to the appointing authority requesting a review of this decision. 
(b)  Suspension of employee facing criminal charges. An employee who has been charged with a felony or crime of moral turpitude may be immediately suspended upon the filing of such charges and disciplinary proceedings may be instigated against such employee. The factors to consider to determine if suspension and disciplinary proceedings instigated against the employee are warranted are whether suspension and/or disciplinary proceedings are in the best interests of the city and if such charges against the employee relate to his or her employment. The suspension shall be with pay and fringe benefits except for automobile, uniform or tool allowances until such time as the disciplinary action is resolved pursuant to the provisions of Section 54-183. 
(c)  No right to appeal. Any employee who is summarily suspended pursuant to the provisions of this section shall have no right to appeal such suspension. However, the department head will notify the appointing authority of the expected time for completing the investigation into the problem.

(c)  In the event two employees are in positions of direct or indirect supervision through any departmental chain of command and establish a relationship by marriage, or otherwise by operation of law, or through lifestyle accommodations being the substantial equivalent of a family relationship, the appointing authority may transfer or demote one of the employees to a position removed from the supervisory control of the other if it is determined that such transfer will serve the best interests of the city and the employee is qualified for the new position. If such a transfer or demotion is unavailable or not in the best interests of the city, the appointing authority may terminate that employee whose discharge would best serve the interests of the city.

    The city shall have and exercise all powers capable for it to have as a home rule municipality pursuant to the Constitution and laws of the state, Article XII of the Charter and ordinances of the city to contract for, construct or install special or local improvements of every character within designated districts of the city and to assess the cost thereof, wholly or in part, upon the property specially benefited.

The purpose of this article is to establish the procedure applicable to the creation of special improvement districts, the construction or acquisition of such improvements, the assessment of all or part of the costs thereof, the issuance of special or local improvement bonds and matters thereto related. Pursuant to Article XX of the State Constitution and the Charter, all statutes of the state which might otherwise apply in connection with special assessments or special improvement districts and which are in conflict with the provisions of this article are superseded.

    District means a geographical division of the city and, in accordance with the provisions of C.R.S. Tit. 31, Art. 25, Pt. 5 (C.R.S. § 31-25-501 et seq.), the county in which the city is situated, for the purpose of assessing costs of any local improvement. When so declared by the city council, a district may include the entire municipal area. One or more noncontiguous parts or sections may be included in one district. 
    Owner means only a person in whom the record fee title is vested as shown by the records of the county assessor, regardless of whether the property is subject to recorded or unrecorded liens or encumbrances. 
    Property or land means all land within the city or otherwise as authorized by C.R.S. § 31-25-501(1), whether platted or unplatted, regardless of improvements thereon and regardless of ownership or lot or land lines.

Sec. 62-28. - Types of improvements; method of assessment. 
(a)  The improvements authorized by this article may constitute any special or local improvement, including construction, reconstruction, repair, replacement, renewal, extension and maintenance of the improvements, which confer a special benefit upon real property. Such improvements may, without limitation, but only for reference, include any public access or way, street, traffic safety fixtures, landscaping, open space and recreation, drainage and flood control, water, sewer and other municipal utility and public works improvements. Improvements enhancing community aesthetic qualities, amenities and the quality of life offered in the area are specifically authorized. 
(b)  Unless specified in the ordinance creating the district, all improvements authorized by this article shall be situated within public easements, rights-of-way or other public property. 
(c)  The city council may create a district for the purpose of constructing or acquiring improvements, or both such construction and acquisition. 
(d)  Whenever the costs of improvements are to be assessed, wholly or in part, upon property within a district, the costs shall be assessed in amounts not exceeding the special benefit conferred upon the assessed property. Such assessment may be based on frontage, area, zone, a combination of such factors or any other equitable basis, to fairly allocate the special benefits as may be determined by the council. If, upon adoption of the ordinance creating a district, any property within the district has or if there is planned all or some part of the proposed improvements conforming to the approved improvement plan for the district, readily accessible and capable of integration with improvements to be constructed or otherwise acquired in furtherance of the improvement plan, the existing improvement may be accepted, in whole or in part, as part of the improvement plan, and the owner of the property may, when the assessment is made, be credited with the amount saved by the acceptance of such improvement as determined by the council, which amount shall reflect an offset and reduction for any costs of adaptation, modification or completion required to fully conform the improvement to the plan. 
(Code 1975, § 60-3; Ord. No. 1893, 8-14-89) 
Sec. 62-29. - Initiation of district by petition.

(b)  Contents of petition shall be as follows: 
(1)  Every petition shall be in a form with content approved by the city manager and shall contain or have appended thereto the following: 
a.  A map of the proposed district and a description of the land to be included in the district and assessed for the costs of the improvements. Such description may be made by any method reasonably calculated to apprise persons of the property to be included, including, without limitation, parcel identification numbers generated by the county for property tax purposes. 
b.  A description of the type and location of improvements proposed, including a map depicting the location or area of the improvements. 
c.  The estimated maximum costs with supporting documents, which maximum cost estimation shall exclude the costs of collection of assessments, capitalized interests on any bonds, capitalized bond reserves, bond issuance costs and other related and incidental costs. 
d.  The proposed assessment method. 
e.  Preliminary construction plans and specifications for the proposed improvements. 
f.  The name and address of each owner signing the petition; a description of the land to be included in the district, which description may be made by any method reasonably calculated to apprise persons of the property to be included, including, without limitation, parcel identification numbers generated by the county for property tax purposes; and the proposed percentage of the entire costs which will be assessed against the land. 
g.  The name, mailing address and telephone number of any person designated in the petition as representative of the petitioning owners. 
h.  A waiver pursuant to Section 62-43. 
(2)  Any petition may waive the requirements of notice, publication and hearing as set forth in Section 62-31. 
(c)  The signature of any owner may be attached to a petition by the representative of the petitioners, and the signature may be made by the owner's attorney in fact authorizing the signature, with the power of attorney attached to the petition. No petitioner, the petitioner's heirs, successors, assigns or personal representative shall be permitted to withdraw from a petition after it has been filed with and accepted by the city. 
(d)  Petitions shall be accompanied by cash or certified check in a nonrefundable amount as established by resolution of the city council, which sum shall be used to pay the costs associated with determination of the sufficiency of the petition and with the creation of the district. Upon and in the event of the creation of the district pursuant to the petition, the council shall have the discretion to reimburse the person paying the deposit by full or partial cash refund, reduction of the assessment levied against the property owned by the paying petitioner or otherwise as established by the council. 
(e)  Petitions shall be filed with the city clerk. The city manager shall thereafter and within a reasonable time determine whether the requirements of this section have been satisfied. In the event of a finding of noncompliance or deficiency of the petition, the city manager may request of the petitioners or their representatives additional information or augmentive materials. Failure to provide such information within the time specified by the city manager, or within a reasonable time if not so specified, shall be grounds for rejecting the petition. The city manager shall have the discretion to make or cause to be made an independent determination of any matters set forth in the petition, including the estimated maximum costs of the proposed improvements and the allocation of assessment costs, notwithstanding the information set forth in the petition, and such determination shall be conclusive unless the city council, upon written application of the petitioners providing justification for such further consideration, wishes to examine the matter. If the city manager finds the petition to be insufficient or defective, the city manager shall provide written notice of the reason of such finding to one of the designated representatives of the petitioners. If a determination of sufficiency is made, notice of hearing pursuant to Section 62-31 shall be provided, unless the city manager determines that such notice and hearing have been waived, in which event an ordinance authorizing the creation of the district pursuant to Section 62-34 shall be duly presented for the council's consideration. Notwithstanding any other provision of this article, nothing in this subsection shall be construed to confer any right to the formation of a district pursuant to the filing of a sufficient petition. 
(f)  A petition may be submitted as set forth on one or more counterparts, all of which shall constitute a single petition.

(b)  Upon initiating a district, the city manager shall have authority to do all things necessary and incidental to the formation of a district, including preparation of a district map, securing costs estimates and preliminary construction plans and specifications.

The city clerk shall also mail such notice by United States mail, postage prepaid, to the owners of land situated within the proposed district on or about the date of such publication; however, legal publication shall be deemed good and sufficient, and the failure of receipt of written notice shall not cause the district formation proceedings to be legally defective.

(1)  A description of the general nature and location of the proposed improvements.

(b)  All protests and objections to the district, the improvements or any method of assessment proposed shall be in writing specifying the basis of protest or objection claimed and shall describe the land owned by the submitting party affected by the proposed district (objector); shall be signed and acknowledged by the objector or signed by legal counsel representing an objector; and must be filed with the city clerk at least three days prior to the hearing. All protests and objections shall be deemed waived unless made at the time and in the manner specified in this subsection. 
(Code 1975, § 60-7; Ord. No. 1893, 8-14-89) 
Sec. 62-33. - Procedure upon city construction or acquisition. 
(a)  If the city intends to construct or serve as the principal party contracting for the construction of proposed improvements, after the hearing conducted in compliance with Section 62-32 or waiver thereof as authorized by Section 62-31(c), the city manager shall cause the following to be prepared: 
(1)  A detailed cost estimate of each substantial improvement proposed, along with an inclusive cost estimate of all improvements, unless the city manager determines that the cost estimates prepared prior to the hearing are adequate. 
(2)  Comprehensive construction plans and specifications. 
(3)  A map depicting the land to be included within the district, unless the city manager determines that the map prepared prior to the hearing is adequate. 
(b)  If the proposed improvements are to be acquired by the city, after the hearing conducted in compliance with Section 62-32 or waiver thereof as authorized by Section 62-31(c) the city manager shall cause the following to be prepared: 
(1)  Detailed cost records or estimates for each substantial improvement proposed, which may be based on comprehensive design and construction plans, along with inclusive cost records or estimates for all improvements. 
(2)  A map depicting the land to be included within the district, unless the city manager determines that the map prepared prior to the hearing is adequate. 
(Code 1975, § 60-8; Ord. No. 1893, 8-14-89) 
Sec. 62-34. - Submission of ordinance; creation of district. 
(a)  If the city manager determines after considering the petition, if any, and any evidence presented at the public hearing, unless waived, that the public interest would be served by the improvements proposed and that a special benefit would be conferred upon the land included in the district, the city manager shall cause to be submitted to the city council an ordinance authorizing the creation of the district and the acquisition or construction of such improvements. 
(b)  The city council shall have plenary legislative authority to adopt or reject the ordinance as recommended by the city manager or to adopt the ordinance as amended. The improvements, property to be included in the district, estimated costs, method of assessment and any other matters concerning the district formation may be modified by the city council from the petition, if any, and any notice of hearing; provided, however, that no substantial modification shall be made unless notice and hearing, or waiver thereof is provided as set forth in this section. The council, however, may modify the ordinance without providing subsequent notice and hearing, upon a finding that such modification is not substantial. Modifications consisting of elimination of properties from a district shall not constitute substantial modifications for purposes of requiring such subsequent notice and hearing. 
(c)  In the event that substantial modifications to a proposed district are introduced before the council, prior to it adoption, the following alternative procedures shall be invoked at the discretion of the council: 
(1)  The council may reject the ordinance and refer the matter to the renewal of the initiation, notice and hearing provisions set forth in Sections 62-29 to 62-33. 
(2)  The council may postpone or continue the second reading to provide sufficient interim time to publish notice and conduct a hearing before the city manager pursuant to Sections 62-31 and 62-32. 
(3)  The city council may postpone or continue the second reading to provide sufficient interim time to publish notice and conduct a hearing as set forth in Sections 62-31 and 62-32, which hearing may be conducted before the council rather than the city manager and may be held in conjunction with the second reading as postponed or continued. 
(d)  The city council shall have the authority and discretion to require, in connection with the construction or acquisition of improvements within a district, any proponent of a district to provide audited financial statements, appraisals or other financial information. The council may further require a letter of credit or other financial pledge, guaranty or other security acceptable to the council for the purpose of ascertaining or ensuring the owners' ability to pay the assessments when due. 
(e)  The finding, by ordinance or resolution of the council, that any improvements were duly authorized after notice duly given and after hearing duly held, when such notice and hearing are required; that a petition was presented and duly subscribed by all owners requisite to the formation of the district; and that otherwise there has been compliance with the standards of this article shall be conclusive of the facts so stated for all purposes. 
(Code 1975, § 60-9; Ord. No. 1893, 8-14-89) 
Sec. 62-35. - Preparation of assessment roll; assessable costs. 
(a)  When the total or partial cost of any improvements can be reasonably ascertained, whether prior, during or subsequent to construction or acquisition, the city manager shall cause an assessment roll to be prepared which shall set forth: 
(1)  The total cost or part thereof ascertained by the city manager. 
(2)  The portion of such total cost or part thereof to be paid by the city or otherwise not to be assessed to property within the district. 
(3)  The allocation of such total cost or part thereof among the properties subject to assessment, showing the amount of the assessment applicable to each parcel of property. Parcels of property may be described by any method reasonably calculated to apprise persons of the property to be assessed, including, without limitation, parcel identification numbers generated by the county for property tax purposes. 
(b)  The total cost or any part thereof of improvements subject to assessment and inclusion in the assessment roll may include all direct and incidental costs, whether incurred or to be incurred, with respect to the creation and administration of the district, acquisition or construction of improvements, levying and collection of assessments, issuance of bonds and all other matters required or permitted by the ordinances and Charter or otherwise by applicable law or regulation. Such costs may include, for purposes of illustration and not limitation, costs of initiating and creating a district; publishing or posting notices; printing; conducting meetings and hearings; designing, constructing or acquiring improvements, including the cost of acquiring and condemning interests in property and easements and other property rights; relocation costs; contingencies and reserves; inspection, collection, issuing and securing bonds, including capitalized interest for such period as the city council may deem necessary or appropriate; capitalized bond reserves and credit enhancements; and costs of levying and collecting assessments, legal, engineering, appraisal, financial and other professional fees and expenses connected with any of such, including the costs of confirming, proving or defending the validity or objectives of any district, bond or assessment, administrative costs, equipment and other incidental costs. 
(c)  Any costs for improvements included in the assessment roll shall not be limited by any estimates contained or presented in conjunction with any petition, communication, ordinance, resolution or other document or representation concerning such improvement. 
(Code 1975, § 60-10; Ord. No. 1893, 8-14-89) 
Sec. 62-36. - Notice of hearing on assessment roll; hearing. 
(a)  Unless excused pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, the city clerk shall give notice of hearing on the assessment roll by one publication, pursuant to Section 2-1, at least 15 consecutive days prior to the date of hearing. The city clerk shall also mail such notice by United States mail, postage prepaid, to the owners of land to be assessed for the costs of improvements situated within the district on or about the date of such publication; however, publication shall be deemed good and sufficient, and the failure of receipt of mailed notice shall not cause the hearing on assessment roll to be legally deficient. Ownerships shall be deemed properly determined if taken from the records of the county assessor within 30 days prior to such mailing. 
(b)  The notice of hearing on the assessment roll shall include the following: 
(1)  The assessment roll, as prepared by the city manager. 
(2)  The date, time and place of the hearing. 
(3)  A statement that all protests and objections to the assessment roll must be filed in writing with the city clerk at least three days prior to the date of hearing before the city council and that, unless timely filed, all protests and objections shall be conclusively deemed waived. 
(c)  If an instrument is presented containing the signatures of all of the owners of land to be assessed, duly acknowledged, which contains a waiver of notice and hearing along with a stipulation that the total costs of the improvements identified in the assessment roll and the allocation of the costs among properties to be assessed and included in the district are consented to, the notice, publication and hearing on the assessment roll shall be waived if the council, in its discretion, determines the public interest would be served by such waiver. 
(Code 1975, § 60-11; Ord. No. 1893, 8-14-89; Ord. No. 3392, § 19, 8-9-16; Ord. No. 3476, §§ 19, 7-10-18) 
Sec. 62-37. - Hearing on assessment roll. 
(a)  The city council shall conduct a public hearing pursuant to the notice published for the purpose of hearing protests and objections to the assessment roll and for the purpose of hearing evidence supporting the assessments, unless such hearing is waived. 
(b)  All protests and objections to the assessment roll shall be in writing specifying the basis of the protest or objections claimed, shall describe the land owned by the submitting party (objector) affected by the assessment roll and shall be signed and acknowledged by the objector or signed by legal counsel representing an objector and filed with the city clerk at least three days prior to the scheduled hearing before the council, or such objections shall be conclusively deemed waived. 
(c)  The city council may postpone or continue such hearing or relocate the hearing by announcing such postponement, continuance or relocation at the time and place originally set for the hearing or by then posting notice thereof. No further or additional notice shall be required. 
(d)  Compliance with rules of evidence shall not be required in connection with the hearing on the assessment roll. The council may impose reasonable rules of conduct in connection with such hearing. 
(Code 1975, § 60-12; Ord. No. 1893, 8-14-89) 
Sec. 62-38. - Ordinance imposing assessments; recordation. 
(a)  Upon completion of the assessment roll hearing, and based upon the evidence and presentations made, the council shall consider an ordinance providing for the levy and collection of the assessments, which ordinance may confirm the assessment roll as originally proposed or may amend the assessment roll in furtherance of the findings of the council; provided, however, that no substantial increases shall be made unless the notice and hearing process set forth in Sections 62-36 and 62-37 is repeated with respect to such substantial increases or waived. Any increase in the amount of any assessment not exceeding five percent of the amount thereof as stated in the notice of assessment hearing shall be deemed insubstantial for purposes of this section. 
(b)  As to any parcel of property for which no protest or objection was filed pursuant to Section 62-37, passage of the assessment ordinance shall conclusively establish special benefit at least equal to the amount of the assessment. As to any properties for which such protest or objection was filed, passage of the assessment ordinance shall constitute prima facie evidence of special benefit at least equal to the amount of the assessment and that the assessments have been made in accordance with applicable law. 
(c)  In the event that the council determines that the assessments may be paid in installments, the terms of such payment shall be set forth in the assessment ordinance, including number, amounts, schedule of payment of the principal amount and interest thereon, the date from which interest will accrue, the location of payment and the discount, if any, for advance payment. 
(d)  The council may direct that the assessment ordinance shall be filed by the city clerk with the county clerk and recorder's office. 
(Code 1975, § 60-13; Ord. No. 1893, 8-14-89) 
Sec. 62-39. - Assessments to be a lien; subdivisions. 
(a)  Except as may be otherwise provided with respect to property of the city, the state or other political subdivisions thereof or the United States or agencies or instrumentalities thereof, all assessments made pursuant to this article, together with all applicable interest, penalties for default and all costs of collecting the assessments, including reasonable legal fees incurred by the city, shall be and constitute, from the effective date of the assessment ordinance, a perpetual lien in the several amounts assessed or charged against each lot, tract or other parcel of property assessed, which lien shall continue until full and final payment and shall be superior to and have priority over all other liens and encumbrances, except general tax liens. 
(b)  In the event that property is subdivided subsequent to the attachment of the assessment lien, such lien may, in the discretion of the council, be apportioned by the council on such basis as the council may determine to fairly and equitably allocate the burden of the lien among the subdivided parcels. The council may, in the assessment ordinance or in other proceedings relating to a district, provide for a method for such apportionment of liens or may provide that no such apportionments will be made. 
(c)  No substantive or procedural irregularities in any act or proceeding, including delays and errors, whether mandatory or permissive, done pursuant to this article shall cause invalidity of or prejudice or detriment to any final assessment or assessment lien. Any such defect may be remedied by subsequent corrective measures, whether by subsequent filings, amending acts or proceedings, as the case may require, which remedy shall relate back to and become effective as of the date of the act or proceeding corrected. 
(d)  The lien created by this section shall not be impaired by any failure or omission of or any error in any recording or filing procedures set forth at Section 62-38(d). 
(Code 1975, § 60-14; Ord. No. 1893, 8-14-89) 
Sec. 62-40. - Assessment record. 
    Upon adoption of the assessment ordinance, the city manager shall cause to be prepared an assessment record, providing suitable reference, for each property assessed, which may be described in the same manner provided in Section 62-35 with respect to the assessment roll, to the total assessment and, if applicable, installments payable thereon in principal and interest. The assessment record shall also set forth all costs, penalties and other charges upon the assessed property which constitute a lien upon the property pursuant to Section 62-39. The assessment record shall be submitted to the finance director for collection. 
(Code 1975, § 60-15; Ord. No. 1893, 8-14-89) 
Sec. 62-41. - Payment of assessments; penalty for nonpayment. 
(a)  All assessments are due and payable without further notice or demand within 30 days after adoption of the assessment ordinance or such longer time as may be provided in the assessment ordinance. The council may, however, provide in the assessment ordinance that, at the election of the owner, the assessments may be paid in installments of principal with interest. 
(b)  Payment of the assessment may be made to the finance director at any time within 30 days following adoption of the assessment ordinance or such longer time as may be provided in the assessment ordinance. If installment payments are permitted, failure to pay the whole assessment within the 30-day period shall constitute an election and waiver as set forth in Section 62-43(c). The finance director shall collect all payments made within such 30-day period. At the expiration of the 30-day period or at such other times as may be specified by the assessment ordinance, the finance director shall return the assessment record to the city manager, with an accounting of the amounts and dates of payment, if any. The city manager shall cause such assessment record to be delivered to the county treasurer or returned to the finance director for collection of the assessment. 
(c)  If the assessment record is delivered to the county treasurer, all assessments, penalties, costs and other amounts constituting a lien pursuant to Section 62-39 shall be payable to and collected by the county treasurer, who shall remit such moneys to the finance director, all as provided by C.R.S. §§ 31-25-526 and 31-25-531, applicable at the time of collection, except to the extent otherwise provided in the assessment ordinance or by other applicable ordinance of the city. Additionally, the city shall have the authority to invoke the sale or to purchase the property on default of payment of any special assessment as set forth in C.R.S. §§ 31-25-531 and 31-25-532, in effect at the time of the exercise of such authority, except to the extent otherwise provided in the assessment ordinance or by other applicable ordinances of the city. 
(d)  Upon failure to pay any installment, whether of principal or interest when due, or upon bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership or other similar event with respect to the record owner, or upon such other events as may be specified as events of default in the assessment ordinance, the city may declare the whole of the unpaid principal and accrued interest to be due and collectible immediately upon such event, and the whole amount of the unpaid principal and accrued interest shall thereafter draw penalty interest at the rate established pursuant to the assessment ordinance, until the day of sale; but at any time prior to the day of sale, the owner may pay the amount of all unpaid installments, with interest at the penalty rate set by the assessing ordinance, and all penalties and costs of collection accrued, including legal fees incurred by the city, and shall thereupon be restored to the right thereafter to pay installments in the same manner as if default had not been suffered. Nothing in this article shall limit or restrict the city's power to specify in the assessment ordinance events of default relating to assessments or to pursue any remedy as to any such event of default which is contemplated by statute or by the assessment ordinance or which would otherwise be available to the city at law or inequity. 
(e)  The owner of any property not in default as to any installment or payment may, at any time, pay the whole of the unpaid principal with interest accruing to such time as may be provided by the assessment ordinance. 
(Code 1975, § 60-16; Ord. No. 1893, 8-14-89) 
Sec. 62-42. - Issuance and payment of bonds. 
(a)  For the purpose of paying all or such portion of the cost of any improvement constructed or acquired pursuant to this article as may be assessed against the property specially benefited, special assessment bonds of the city may be issued, on such terms and in such form as may be prescribed by the city council, payable in a sufficient period of years after date of issuance to cover the period of payment provided for installments of assessments. Such bonds shall be payable out of all or a portion of the moneys collected from the assessments made for such improvements and may also be additionally secured as provided in Article XII of the Charter, as amended from time to time. 
(b)  Special assessment bonds, with or without such additional security, shall not be subject to any debt limitation or encumber, restrict or exhaust the city's debt incurring power, nor shall such bonds be subject to the requirement of authorization at any election. Additionally, such bonds shall not constitute a prohibited pledge or lending of credit or donation, or operate to violate any constitutional, statutory or Charter limitation or restriction. 
(Code 1975, § 60-17; Ord. No. 1893, 8-14-89) 
Sec. 62-43. - Legal proceedings. 
(a)  No action or proceeding, at law or in equity, to review any acts or proceedings, or to question the validity or enjoin the performance of any act or the issue or collection of any bonds, or the levy or collection of any assessments, authorized by the Charter, or for any other relief against any acts or proceedings done or had under this article or of the city, with reference thereto, whether based upon irregularities or jurisdictional defects, shall be maintained, unless commenced within 30 days after the performance of the act or the effective date of the resolution or ordinance complained of, or else thereafter perpetually barred. No condition, disability or infirmity shall cause such response to be tolled, it being the intent of the city council to ensure the integrity of its securities issued to finance the construction and acquisition of improvements and of its other commitments in connection therewith. 
(b)  If any final assessment is set aside for any reason whatsoever, the city council, upon such notice as required in the making of an original assessment or waiver thereof, may make a new assessment in accordance with the provisions of this article. 
(c)  Failure to pay any assessment within the 30-day period provided in Section 62-42 shall conclusively be deemed an election on the part of all interested persons, whether under disability or otherwise, to pay in such installments. Additionally, such election shall conclusively operate to manifest a consent to the improvements, a waiver of any legal challenge to the authority or jurisdiction of the city to acquire or construct the improvements and approval of the quality of the work, the regularity or sufficiency of the proceedings and the validity and correctness of the assessments and lien thereof. Any interested person may preserve the right to contest an assessment by making payment under protest of the whole assessment, within the 30-day period prescribed by Section 62-41(a), to the finance director, or into the registry of any court having jurisdiction over such contest, or in such other manner as may be agreed between such person and the city or as may be ordered by such court. 
(d)  All persons signing any petition pursuant to Section 62-29 shall conclusively be deemed to have waived any challenge to any actions taken by or on behalf of the city pursuant to such petition. 
(e)  No defect in or invalidity of a petition shall constitute a basis to challenge any act or proceedings taken pursuant to this article, and such defect or invalidity shall not constitute a basis or grounds in support of any legal challenge. 
(f)  Objections to any notice of hearing given pursuant to Section 62-31 shall be conclusively deemed waived unless perfected in the manner set forth in Section 62-32. Objections to the assessments or the lien thereof shall be conclusively deemed waived unless perfected in the manner set forth in Section 62-37. 
(g)  Attendance by any person or by any representative of such person at any hearing held pursuant to this article shall conclusively be deemed to constitute a waiver of all challenges based on defects, errors or irregularities in the notice of such hearing or the manner in which it was given. 
(Code 1975, § 60-18; Ord. No. 1893, 8-14-89) 
Sec. 62-44. - Reassessments. 
(a)  If any assessment made or assessed upon property within a special improvement district, whether pursuant to this article as enacted or amended or by authority of the ordinances of the city relating to such districts repealed and superseded by this article, or any predecessors to this article, is void or unenforceable for any cause, including but not limited to an assessment which has been extinguished or eliminated by the foreclosure of any tax judgment or other lien or which has been adversely affected by bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership or other similar events or by virtue of the operation of any state or federal laws or regulations, the city manager may order the making and issuing of a reassessment covering the deficiency so caused in the original assessment, which reassessment shall have priority over all other liens except general tax liens as contemplated at Section 62-39. Any such reassessment may be made upon all or any portion of the property with respect to which the original assessment is void or unenforceable. 
(b)  The reassessment need not be in any prescribed form, but shall set forth a description of the property to be reassessed, which description may be made by any method reasonably calculated to apprise persons of the property to be reassessed, including, without limitation, parcel identification numbers generated by the county for property tax purposes; the original assessment as set forth in the assessment ordinance; and the amount to be reassessed against the property. In determining such amount, the city council may consider the outstanding principal amount of the original assessment, as well as the accrued interest, penalties and costs of collection, including legal fees incurred by the city, due and payable thereon. The reassessment shall be collectible, payable and enforced with the same lien priority as provided for the original assessment. 
(c)  Passage of the reassessment ordinance shall be prima facie evidence of the fact that such reassessment has been lawfully made. The city council may direct that the reassessment ordinance be filed with the county clerk and recorder for recording on the records of each lot, tract or parcel of property reassessed, but the lien of the reassessment shall not be impaired by any failure or omission of or any error in any such filing or recording. 
(Code 1975, § 60-19; Ord. No. 1893, 8-14-89) 
Sec. 62-45. - Miscellaneous provisions. 
(a)  The city manager and the city council may designate and utilize the services of such city officials and agents or private persons and entities as they may deem necessary or appropriate to carry out the purposes of this article. 
(b)  Nothing in this article shall affect, limit or impair the power of the city to construct, exact or otherwise acquire public or local improvements by other law or legal authority, ordinance or Charter provision, and no other law or legal authority, ordinance or Charter provision shall affect, limit or impair the power of the city to construct or acquire local improvements pursuant to the authority of this article. 
(c)  As used in this article, the term "benefited property" or words and phrases of similar import shall mean the property located within a district which derives special benefit from the subject improvements within the district. 
(d)  This article shall apply to all special improvement districts, the creation of which are initiated after the effective date of this article. This article shall not apply to special improvement districts, the creation of which was initiated prior to the effective date of this article, except that the provisions of Section 62-44 with respect to reassessments shall apply to such districts. The city council finds and determines that the reassessment provisions of Section 62-44 are concerned with remedial matters as to which property owners have no reasonable expectation of any vested right or interest, and that the applicability of such provisions to special improvement districts, the creation of which was initiated prior to the effective date of this article, is therefore not detrimental or prejudicial to any owners of property assessed therein. 
(e)  The city council may, in any ordinance adopted pursuant to this chapter, commit that the city will exercise or will not exercise, generally or in any particular manner, any right or power which would otherwise be permissive or within the discretion of the council or other city officers. 
(Code 1975, § 60-20; Ord. No. 1893, 8-14-89) 
Secs. 62-46-62-59. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE III. - REIMBURSEMENT PROCEDURE 

Sec. 62-60. - Definitions. 
    The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
    Application fee means a non-refundable fee payable to the city by the initial developer for each category of infrastructure for which reimbursement is requested, which amount represents the reasonable costs incurred by the city in developing the reimbursement agreement. The application fee shall be as established in the fee resolution. 
    Collection fee means a fee the city collects from the connector and represents the reasonable costs incurred by the city in collecting and disbursing the funds as set forth herein. The collection fee shall be as established in the fee resolution. 
    Connection means a physical connection of any kind to the city infrastructure, except that connection of an existing property entrance to new street infrastructure constructed by an initial developer that is eligible for reimbursement shall not be considered a connection for the purposes of reimbursement until such time as the property use changes or improvements to the entrance are required as a result of development of the property as determined by the development engineering director. 
    Connector means a party seeking to connect to the city infrastructure and who benefits from the infrastructure constructed by an initial developer that is eligible for the reimbursement procedure set forth in this section under criteria established by the city. 
    Connector capacity means the capacity that the development engineering director, at his or her sole discretion, determines is required by the connector requesting connection to the infrastructure based on the typical demands as stated in the city's Standards and Specifications for the Design and Construction of Public Improvements as amended from time to time, the most current infrastructure master plans, and the final plat densities of the connecting properties. 
    Construction cost means all costs associated directly and solely with the design and construction of the infrastructure which includes the costs of engineering, surveying, and testing, cost of permits and cash in lieu payments, costs of any rights-of-way (ROW) or easement acquisitions necessary for construction of the infrastructure, and costs of reasonable and necessary construction change orders. Administrative costs, which will include costs incurred by the initial developer for construction management including bidding, home office overhead, attorney's fees and all other expenses other than those direct expenses identified herein, shall not exceed five percent of the total direct construction costs for the infrastructure, all as detailed in a sworn affidavit from the initial developer. 
    Drainage infrastructure includes, but is not limited to, collection system pipelines, inlets, box culverts, combination box culvert and pedestrian underpass, regional detention ponds, improved open channel conveyances and other appurtenances designed and constructed by the initial developer which are off site and, in the judgment of the development engineering director, are improvements that a connector would have been required to construct at the time of development of connector's property. 
    Inflation factor means the amount the construction cost shall be adjusted for inflation for building costs in the Denver, Colorado, metropolitan area from the base period to the month of collection as determined by reference to the Construction Cost Index (CCI) for Denver, Colorado, published in the Engineering News Record. The base period CCI shall be the CCI most recently published prior to or on the date of initial acceptance of a project eligible for reimbursement. The CCI at time of collection shall be the CCI most recently published prior to or on the date of collection. Construction cost shall be adjusted by utilizing the base period CCI and the CCI at time of collection. The calculation is as follows: 
Inflation Factor = [CCI for date of collection]/[Base Period CCI] 
    Initial developer means the party constructing or contracting for construction of infrastructure required by the city to provide service to a development. 
    Property means lands which fall within the reimbursement agreement boundaries and which are owned or controlled by the subsequent connector which may include individual properties or subdivisions or as otherwise determined by the development engineering director. 
    Street infrastructure includes, but is not limited to, pavement, subbase, overexcavation, backfill, soil stabilization, recompaction, right-of-way costs, curbs, gutters, medians, landscaping, sidewalks, pedestrian underpasses, combination pedestrian underpass and box culvert, traffic signals, street lighting, bus pads, deceleration lanes, and other appurtenances as determined by the development engineering director, which are designed and constructed by the initial developer in accordance with the city's most current infrastructure master plans and the Standards and Specifications for the Design and Construction of Public Improvements, as amended from time to time, and which are adjacent to the property that would derive benefit from use of or connection to the street infrastructure upon development of the property. 
    Time of connection shall be when new infrastructure making a physical connection to the infrastructure receives initial acceptance from the city, or as otherwise determined by the development engineering director. 
    Total capacity means the total capacity of the infrastructure as solely determined by the development engineering director and detailed in the initial developer's reimbursement application and incorporated into the reimbursement agreement. 
    Wastewater infrastructure includes, but is not limited to, wastewater gravity systems, lift stations, force mains, and appurtenances designed and constructed by the initial developer which at the time of completion of construction by the initial developer could provide service to connectors. To qualify for reimbursement under this section, a lift station shall have been constructed to a capacity which the development engineering director determines is in excess of that reasonably required by the initial developer. 
    Water infrastructure includes but is not limited to water transmission and distribution lines, all other water lines and related appurtenances larger than eight inches in diameter, and pressure reducing valves and booster pump stations which are sized to a capacity which the development engineering director determines is in excess of that required by the initial developer. Notwithstanding the above, the cost of constructing a booster pump station shall not be eligible for reimbursement when the development engineering director requires that a booster pump station be constructed to a capacity which is the minimum required by the Standards and Specifications for the Design and Construction of Public Improvements, as amended from time to time. 
(Ord. No. 2922, § 1, 10-25-05) 
Sec. 62-61. - Initial installation. 
    The total cost of design and construction of any infrastructure shall be the responsibility of the initial developer whose development necessitates the initial installation of the infrastructure as required by City Code. Construction cost or portions thereof may be recovered by the initial developer pursuant to the reimbursement procedure described in this section. 
(Ord. No. 2922, § 1, 10-25-05) 
Sec. 62-62. - Reimbursable costs for water infrastructure. 
    The initial developer shall be reimbursed by connectors for water infrastructure construction cost, as modified by the inflation factor, on the following basis: 
(1)  Water infrastructure constructed by the initial developer shall be eligible for reimbursement by connectors based on the ratio of the connector's linear front footage to the total linear footage of the infrastructure. If the connector's property is fronting or contiguous on only one side of the infrastructure, the connector shall pay 50 percent of the construction cost, as modified by the inflation factor, for that front footage. If the connector's property is fronting or contiguous on both sides of the infrastructure, the connector shall pay 100 percent of the construction cost, as modified by the inflation factor, for that front footage. 
(2)  Water infrastructure shall be deemed to be contiguous to a connector's property where the water infrastructure is located within a public right-of-way or easement, which in turn abuts the connector's property, or where the water infrastructure crosses or touches any boundary of the connector's property, or which benefits the connector's property as determined by the development engineering director. Linear footage of the water infrastructure fronting a property shall be deemed to extend to the centerline of public rights-of-way or easement in which such water infrastructure may be located. The development engineering director shall have the authority to determine the appropriate contiguity in the event intervening tract(s) run adjacent to the water infrastructure. 
(Ord. No. 2922, § 1, 10-25-05) 
Sec. 62-63. - Reimbursable costs for wastewater infrastructure. 
    The initial developer shall be reimbursed by connectors for wastewater infrastructure construction cost, as modified by the inflation factor, on the following basis: 
(1)  The reimbursement amount for a connector shall be calculated by prorating the wastewater infrastructure construction cost by the percentage of the capacity required for the connector's property to the total capacity of the infrastructure based on the overall flow for the basin being served by each section of infrastructure. 
(2)  Limitations on reimbursement amounts. 
a.  In the event that a connector desires to connect to wastewater infrastructure and it is determined by the development engineering director that the subdivision plat for the connecting property will require less capacity than projected in the initial developer's reimbursement agreement, then the construction cost to be reimbursed, as modified by the inflation factor, shall be adjusted based on the projected flows required by the connector's subdivision plat and not based on the initial developer's projected capacity. The reimbursement amounts for the remaining properties not yet connected will not be changed from the amounts shown in the reimbursement agreement as a result of this event. 
b.  In the event that a connector desires to connect to wastewater infrastructure and it is determined by the development engineering director that the subdivision plat for the connecting property will require more capacity than projected in the initial developer's reimbursement agreement, then the connector shall reimburse the initial developer for the construction cost, as adjusted by the inflation factor, originally projected by the initial developer's reimbursement agreement and not a higher amount based on the revised capacity required by the subdivision plat for the connector's property at the time of connection. 
(Ord. No. 2922, § 1, 10-25-05) 
Sec. 62-64. - Reimbursable costs for drainage infrastructure. 
    The initial developer shall be reimbursed by connectors for drainage infrastructure construction cost, as modified by the inflation factor. The reimbursable cost will be attributed entirely to the property in which the infrastructure eligible for reimbursement is situated. In the event the infrastructure is situated on more than one property, the cost shall be prorated between the properties as determined by the development engineering director. 
(Ord. No. 2922, § 1, 10-25-05) 
Sec. 62-65. - Reimbursable costs for street infrastructure. 
    The initial developer shall be reimbursed by connectors for street infrastructure construction cost, as modified by the inflation factor, on the following basis: 
(1)  Street infrastructure constructed by the initial developer per the thoroughfare master plan to full width and in accordance with the city's Standards and Specifications for the Design and Construction of Public Improvements, as amended from time to time, shall be eligible for reimbursement by connectors based on the ratio of the connector's linear front footage to the total linear footage of the infrastructure. If the connector's property is fronting or contiguous on only one side of the infrastructure, the connector shall reimburse 50 percent of the construction cost, as modified by the inflation factor, for that front footage. If the connector's property is fronting or contiguous on both sides of the infrastructure, the connector shall reimburse 100 percent of the construction cost, as modified by the inflation factor, for that front footage. 
(2)  Street infrastructure shall be deemed to be contiguous to a connector's property where the street infrastructure is adjacent to the connector's property, or where the street infrastructure crosses or touches any boundary of the connector's property, or where the street infrastructure benefits the connector's property as determined by the development engineering director. Linear footage of the street infrastructure fronting a property shall be deemed to extend to the centerline of public rights-of-way in which such street infrastructure may be located. The development engineering director shall have the authority to determine the appropriate contiguity in the event intervening tract(s) run adjacent to the street infrastructure. 
(Ord. No. 2922, § 1, 10-25-05) 
Sec. 62-66. - Application for reimbursement agreement requirements. 
(a)  Application for reimbursement agreement. Upon approval of construction drawings by development engineering, the initial developer of any property who constructs infrastructure may file with the development engineering director an application for a reimbursement agreement. The complete application, or portions thereof, may be submitted; however, incomplete applications, as determined at the sole discretion of the development engineering director, will not be reviewed or acted upon by the city. 
In order for the city to collect estimated reimbursement payments as described in [Section] 62-67(b) prior to the final execution of a reimbursement agreement, the initial developer shall submit at a minimum the items required in subsection (a)(1), (2), (3), (5), and (8) of this section. Upon submission of these items, provided they are acceptable to the city as described herein, the city will require connectors to pay estimated reimbursement amounts as specified in [Section] 62-67(b). 
Notwithstanding the foregoing, the application for reimbursement agreement shall not be considered complete until all application requirements are submitted. Once the submitted application is determined complete and acceptable to the city, the city will provide the initial developer with a reimbursement agreement; however, the reimbursement agreement shall not be executed until after the time to file a request for an administrative hearing has expired and any administrative hearings which were requested are resolved. 
The application shall include: 
(1)  Payment of the non-refundable application fee. 
(2)  An exhibit depicting the infrastructure suitable for inclusion in the reimbursement agreement as determined by the development engineering director. 
(3)  Documentation, including an ownership map acceptable to the city, showing all the properties affected by the proposed reimbursement agreement, and any other documentation related to ownership as may be required by the development engineering director. 
(4)  A list of the names, mailing addresses of the property owners and the tax ownership identification numbers for the properties within the boundaries of the proposed reimbursement agreement area, accompanied by a written ownership and encumbrance report from a title company or similar document acceptable to the development engineering director evidencing proof of ownership of all property subject to the reimbursement agreement. 
(5)  A report acceptable to the city detailing the actual construction cost and the resulting reimbursement amount proposed to be collected from each property and calculations substantiating the amounts. The initial developer may submit an estimated construction cost prior to taking bids so that the city may collect estimated reimbursement amounts from connectors pursuant to [Section] 62-67(b). In this event, the initial developer shall submit a revised report that details the estimated construction cost, the actual construction cost, and calculations modifying the reimbursement amount for each property to reflect the actual construction cost. Estimated and actual costs shall be based on infrastructure designed to meet the current versions of the city's Standards and Specifications for the Design and Construction of Public Improvements, as amended from time to time, the city's current infrastructure master plans, or based on other design requirements as otherwise determined by the development engineering director. 
(6)  The initial developer shall obtain and submit a minimum of three independent construction bids for the infrastructure. The bids shall include an itemized unit price schedule of values that provides cost break down into the units needed to clearly cost each and every item for each property included in the proposed reimbursement agreement. If any post bid change orders are proposed for inclusion in the reimbursable amount, the change order cost shall be based on the itemized unit prices contained in the bid whenever possible, or when itemized unit prices are not available, the change order amount shall be based on reasonable construction costs, the reasonableness thereof as determined at the sole discretion of the development engineering director. Complete documentation of all post bid change orders shall be submitted with the application. Regardless of which contractor is selected by the initial developer to construct the infrastructure, the initial developer shall use the lowest responsible bidder's itemized unit price schedule of values to calculate the reimbursable amounts for each property. 
Notwithstanding the above, if the initial developer is unable to obtain three independent construction bids as required, the initial developer may make a request of the city's contract manager to waive the requirement. In this event, the initial developer shall provide documentation to the contract manager of the extenuating circumstances that precluded obtaining three independent bids. The contract manager shall have the sole discretion to determine if the documentation of the extenuating circumstances is sufficient to waive the requirement for three independent bids. 
(7)  A notarized affidavit from the initial developer attesting to the construction cost and to the fact that the work was bid to at least three independent contractors. The affidavit shall be supported with complete documentation, including copies of all vendor, consultant and contactor bids, proposals, invoices and other relevant documents to support the validity of the construction cost. In the event the requirement for three independent bids was waived by the city's contract manager, the affidavit will describe the bidding process that was used. The initial developer shall attest that all information contained in the application for reimbursement agreement is true and correct. 
(8)  Exhibits of a size and scale suitable for use in the reimbursement agreement as determined by the development engineering director that clearly define the reimbursement boundaries proposed for the infrastructure, and the associated construction cost and reimbursement amount applicable to each property. 
(9)  Draft copies of the notice required in subsection (b) below to be sent to each property owner. 
As a condition prior to the city's execution of a reimbursement agreement, the initial developer shall supplement his application by submitting documentation acceptable to the development engineering director that provides as follows: 
a.  Final copies of the notice sent to each property owner. 
b.  All infrastructure for which reimbursement of construction costs are requested fully conforms to the city's Standards and Specifications for the Design and Construction of Public Improvements. 
c.  That the infrastructure has been granted initial acceptance by the city. 
d.  That the initial developer has otherwise fully complied with all other city ordinances or regulations pertaining to the development of public improvements and/or the initial developer's property. 
(b)  Notice. The initial developer shall send by first class U.S. mail a notice to each of the owners of each property that is situated within the proposed reimbursement area boundary, together with a copy of the proposed reimbursement agreement and a copy of this City Code section. 
The notice shall state that any owner of affected property located within the city may file a written request with the city manager, or designee thereof, for an administrative hearing to object to the proposed reimbursement agreement. The notice shall advise the property owners that the request for hearing shall include the following requirements: 
(1)  Hearing request shall state in general terms the grounds of objection. 
(2)  Hearing request must be filed within 15 days of the date of the receipt of the notice. Failure by any property owner to file a timely request (within 15 days) for a hearing constitutes a waiver by the owner of any right to such a hearing. 
(c)  Administrative hearing. Upon receiving a timely written request for a hearing, the city manager, or designee thereof, shall set a hearing date and notify the initial developer and all owners of affected property within the city of the date, time, and location of the hearing. The city manager, or designee thereof, shall conduct an administrative hearing on the matter. The burden of proof to establish that the request for reimbursement for construction cost is reasonable and necessary shall be on the initial developer. If the initial developer establishes that the request for reimbursement is reasonable and necessary, the burden of proof to establish disqualification for reimbursement shall shift to the property owner. In the event multiple timely requests for hearing are submitted, such hearings may be consolidated into one hearing at the discretion of the city manager, or designee thereof. 
Prior to the city scheduling the hearing, the initial developer shall pay to the city the city's estimated cost of conducting the hearing. The initial developer shall remit such payment to the city within ten days from the date notification of the estimated cost is sent to the initial developer. If the initial developer fails to remit the estimated hearing cost within the ten day timeframe, the initial developer forfeits his right to argue the reasonableness of the reimbursement to the objecting property owner and that owner's property will be exempt from the reimbursement agreement. The initial developer will be required to remit to the city the difference between the actual hearing cost and the estimated hearing cost within ten days of notification by the city of the actual hearing cost. The city will refund any overpayment should the actual hearing cost be less than the estimated hearing cost. 
If the initial developer prevails and the proposed terms of the reimbursement agreement are substantially upheld, as determined by the development engineering director, the cost of the hearing will be added to the reimbursement amount for the property owner requesting the hearing. 
Following the hearing, the city manager, or designee thereof, shall render a written decision and provide copies of the decision to all parties. The decision is subject to judicial review pursuant to Rule 106(a)(4) of the Colorado Rules of Civil Procedure. 
(d)  Administrative denial. The city manager, or designee thereof, may, without notice or hearing to any other property owner, deny any reimbursement agreement application that does not fully comply with the requirements of this section. The application may also be returned to the applicant for corrections if the city manager, or designee thereof, determines that to be an appropriate action. 
(e)  Audit. The city or its designated representative, at the city's sole option, may audit the records of the initial developer pertaining to construction cost at any reasonable time during normal business hours. 
(Ord. No. 2922, § 1, 10-25-05) 
Sec. 62-67. - Reimbursement agreement administration. 
(a)  No service without payment of reimbursement amounts. No property will be permitted to connect to infrastructure constructed pursuant to this section or to any other part of the city's infrastructure until the obligations associated with such property under any reimbursement agreements have been paid in full. 
(b)  Payment of estimated reimbursement amounts plus the collection fee by the connector to the city. Provided the initial developer has submitted sufficient documentation required by [Section] 62-66(a) for a reimbursement agreement, even though the reimbursement agreement is not yet executed, the city will require connectors to make payment to the city in an amount estimated by the development engineering director to be the connector's obligation under any pending reimbursement agreement. The amount paid by the connector will be adjusted to reflect the actual amount due under any such reimbursement agreement once the reimbursement agreement is executed. The connector shall pay any additional monies due if the funds being held by the city prove to be less than the actual amount due. The connector will receive a refund of any monies paid in excess of the actual amounts due. Once the reimbursement agreement is executed and the actual amount due is determined and collected from the connector, the city will remit the reimbursement amount to the initial developer as required by this section. In the event the initial developer does not receive a reimbursement agreement in accordance with these provisions, the reimbursement amount held by the city, less applicable administrative costs, will then be returned to the connector. 
(c)  Payment of reimbursement amounts plus the collection fee by the connector to the city. Connector shall pay the entire reimbursement amount, as modified by the inflation factor, plus the collection fee, applicable to the entire property which is subject to a reimbursement agreement regardless of whether the property is subdivided. Payment shall be made upon execution of the developer's agreement or at time of connection, whichever occurs sooner. However, if prior to payment of the reimbursement amount and collection fee, the property owner has subdivided the property and sold a portion or portions to other owners, the connector shall be required to pay only their pro rata reimbursement amount and collection fee for their entire remaining property as determined by the development engineering director. Notwithstanding the foregoing, payment by individual residential lots is not allowed unless the individual lot was existing and occupied but not connected to the infrastructure at the time the reimbursement agreement was executed. Refunds or credits of reimbursement amounts will not be made as a result of reducing the number of lots in a subdivision plat. 
(d)  Reimbursement of collections to initial developer. Within 60 days of receipt of a reimbursement payment from a connector, the city will remit the reimbursement to the initial developer; however, the city will have the option to retain funds due any initial developer that is in arrears to the city or for non-compliance with City Code or other agreements, as determined by the development engineering director. 
(e)  Notice of collection to initial developer. The city will send the reimbursement amounts collected from connectors via U.S. mail to the last known address of the initial developer. It shall be the responsibility of the initial developer to notify the city of any change of address or business name. If the reimbursement is returned as undeliverable to the city, and if the city is unable to locate the initial developer by reasonable means, the city will place a public notice regarding the collection of the reimbursement amount in a publication in general circulation in the county where the infrastructure subject to reimbursement is located for a period of two consecutive weeks. The initial developer shall have 90 days following the publication of the second public notice to request in writing the proceeds of the collection and to notify the city of the initial developer's current name and address. If the initial developer fails to timely respond to the public notice, the reimbursement payment, less the collection fee, will be returned to the connector, except as provided in [Section] 62-67(h). Further, the reimbursement agreement shall then become null and void from that point forward, except for provisions in [Section] 62-67(d) and [Section] 62-67(h), and the city shall have no further obligation to the initial developer with regard to the reimbursement agreement. 
(f)  Time limitation. There shall be no collection of reimbursement payments by the city on or after the expiration of 15 years from the date of initial acceptance of the water, wastewater, or drainage infrastructure eligible for reimbursement. There shall be no collections of reimbursement payments by the city on or after the expiration of ten years from the date of initial acceptance of the street infrastructure eligible for reimbursement. Connectors shall similarly have no obligation to make reimbursement payments on or after the expiration of said periods. 
(g)  No reservation of capacity. The city will not reserve capacity in any infrastructure for any connector. Available capacity will be allocated based on a "first come, first served" basis. In the event the capacity of the infrastructure is fully allocated and one or more properties is not allowed to connect to the infrastructure covered under a reimbursement agreement, then the property is relieved of the obligation to make reimbursement under the reimbursement agreement. 
(h)  In the event that final acceptance of any of the infrastructure is not obtained by the initial developer as required by the Standards and Specifications for the Design and Construction of Public Improvements or other city ordinances or codes, as amended from time to time, then the initial developer's right to reimbursement shall terminate and the city may collect any reimbursement funds due from connectors and expend them to secure final acceptance. Any unexpended reimbursement funds shall be returned to the connector(s) on a proportionate basis as determined by the development engineering director. In addition, the reimbursement agreement shall be considered null and void. 
(Ord. No. 2922, § 1, 10-25-05) 
Sec. 62-68. - Conditions of reimbursement. 
    In the event that the city deems the application for a reimbursement agreement complete, the city manager, or designee thereof, shall execute a reimbursement agreement with the initial developer for collection and payment of the reimbursable amount. The following provisions shall be incorporated by reference into the reimbursement agreement. 
(1)  The city specifically will not guarantee collection of any portion of the reimbursable amount. Nothing in Sections 62-60 through 62-69 shall be deemed or construed to be a pledge of the city's faith and credit in facilitating the equitable apportionment of the construction cost of the infrastructure. 
(2)  It shall be the initial developer's obligation to be aware of the city's publicly conducted development approval process, and to timely apply for a reimbursement agreement. Notwithstanding the above, the initial developer acknowledges that in the event he does not submit a complete and correct application for reimbursement agreement within 120 days of initial acceptance of the infrastructure or within 120 days of the adoption of this section, whichever is later, he will be forever barred from making such application and shall not be eligible for reimbursement. 
(3)  The initial developer shall defend and indemnify the city for, and hold the city harmless from, any suit, claim, or action that is or may be brought by any person against the city as a result of the reimbursement agreement entered into pursuant to this section. In the event the city incurs costs as the result of any litigation or dispute in administering this agreement, the initial developer shall reimburse the city for these costs within ten days of the city sending notification thereof. In the event the initial developer fails to reimburse these costs upon written request by the city Attorney, the city will have no further obligations to the initial developer and any reimbursement agreements with the initial developer will be considered terminated. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the city is not limited to these remedies. 
(4)  In the event a court invalidates the reimbursement agreement, the city will have no further obligations to the initial developer and the reimbursement agreement with the initial developer will be considered terminated unless the court order provides otherwise. If the initial developer has received reimbursement payments under a reimbursement agreement that a court invalidates, then the initial developer shall return the reimbursement funds, plus the applicable collection fee paid by the connector, to the connector unless the court order provides otherwise. In this event the city will not be obligated to refund the application fee to the initial developer, or to refund the collection fee to either the initial developer or the connector. 
(5)  The agreement is personal to the initial developer and may not be assigned except upon written approval of the contract manager. 
(6)  The initial developer shall cooperate with the city in the implementation of the agreement including, but not limited to, providing such information as the city may deem necessary to perform its functions under the agreement. 
(7)  Failure of the initial developer to comply with any of the material provisions of the reimbursement agreement shall constitute abandonment of all rights to reimbursement. 
(8)  Limitations on reimbursement amounts. 
a.  In no case will the initial developer be entitled to reimbursement in excess of the amount of the total construction cost, as adjusted by the inflation factor, less the construction cost required to provide capacity needed to serve the initial developer's property. Upon the initial developer receiving reimbursement amounts totaling the amount of the construction cost, as adjusted by the inflation factor, less the construction cost of the capacity needed to serve the initial developer's property, no additional reimbursement amounts will be collected from future connectors. 
b.  In the event the original reimbursement agreement area boundaries as described in the reimbursement agreement are altered by subsequent changes in topography, the installation of unanticipated infrastructure, or any other event which alters the provision of infrastructure from that which was anticipated at the time the initial developer constructed the infrastructure, then the city shall so notify the initial developer in writing. The initial developer shall not receive reimbursement from the areas so altered within the reimbursement agreement boundaries. Connectors shall not be required to reimburse the initial developer in such previously unanticipated instances of deletions or additions to the original reimbursement agreement boundaries. All areas which remain within the original boundaries after such additions or deletions will be required to reimburse the initial developer as outlined in the reimbursement agreement except as noted in Sections 62-63(2)a or 62-63(2)b. 
c.  Adjustments as described above shall only be made in conjunction with the final plat for subsequent connectors' properties. No other adjustments will be allowed to reimbursement amounts or areas once a connection is made. 
(Ord. No. 2922, § 1, 10-25-05) 
Sec. 62-69. - Timing of development/eligibility for reimbursement. 
(a)  Nothing in Sections 62-60 to 62-69 shall be construed so as to impair any contractual obligations existing under utility extension policy contracts executed prior to the effective date of this section. 
(b)  Applications for reimbursement agreements submitted prior to the effective date of this section but not yet fully executed shall be governed by the section in effect as of the date of application.

ARTICLE I. - IN GENERAL 

Secs. 66-1-66-25. - Reserved. 
ARTICLE II. - GUIDELINES FOR SID, GID OR METRO DISTRICT CREATION 

Sec. 66-26. - Purpose. 
    The general assembly has adopted legislation for the formation of special districts to eliminate overlapping of services provided by local government and to avoid double taxation resulting from duplication of services and facilities. The city council is creating procedures to avoid having indebtedness of special districts affect the credit rating of the city and preserve the financial integrity of the city and its citizens. The city council declares its desire to prevent the shifting of development risk to nondevelopers and to attempt to minimize excessive tax burdens upon city residents in special districts, as well as not allow the costs of any special district to be shifted to citizens who are not within the geographic boundaries of a special district or receiving benefit from it. The city council has determined to establish policy guidelines relating to the creation of separate districts within the city's boundaries for the purpose of financing the construction of certain public improvements. The guidelines contained in this article are general in nature, may be considered by the council among such other information as the council deems appropriate and shall vest no right in any individual or entity relating to the creation of a Special Improvement District, General Improvement District or Metropolitan District subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article derives. The adoption of this chapter is necessary to protect the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the city and is provided for under the home rule powers granted by the Constitution of the state. 
(Code 1975, § 60A-1; Ord. No. 1677, 6-22-87; Ord. No. 2623, § 1, 7-14-00) 
Sec. 66-27. - Definitions. 
    The types of districts covered by this article are defined as follows, and include only those districts created subsequent to the effective date of the ordinance from which this article derives: 
    General Improvement District (GID) means a district organized under C.R.S. § 31-25-601 et seq. as a separate political subdivision of the state. 
    Special Improvement District (SID) means a district specifically authorized by Chapter XII of the Charter and, pursuant to Section 12.1 of the Charter, the procedure implementing such authority has been set forth in a procedural ordinance, codified as Article II of Chapter 62 of this Code. 
    Thornton Development Authority means an urban renewal district created pursuant to C.R.S. § 31-25-101 et seq.; also known as TDA. 
    Title 32 Special District , also referred to as a "Metropolitan District" or "Metro District," means a quasi-municipal corporation and political subdivision proposed, organized, or acting pursuant to C.R.S. § 32-1-101 et seq., and in accordance with Article III of this chapter. 
(Code 1975, § 60A-2; Ord. No. 1677, 6-22-87; Ord. No. 2519, § 1, 8-24-98; Ord. No. 2623, § 2, 7-14-00; Ord. No. 3003, § 1, 7-24-07) 
Cross reference- Definitions generally, § 1-2. 
Sec. 66-28. - Scope. 
    This article sets forth: 
(1)  The circumstances when the city may choose to consider using districts as a financing tool, rather than using: 
a.  Pay-as-you-go cash funding through the capital projects fund; 
b.  Incurrence of debt or revenue obligations by the city through the issuance of general obligation bonds, utilities revenue bonds or sales tax revenue bonds; 
c.  Tax increment financing through the TDA; or 
d.  Long-term lease financings, the creation of a nonprofit building authority or any other available financing mechanism. 
(2)  The threshold criteria pursuant to which the city may review each proposal for the creation of a district and evaluate the benefits which will accrue to the city or the affected properties: 
a.  Within the project area of the TDA as established on September 13, 1982, in the Thornton Community Improvement Plan, as amended from time to time (the project area of the TDA); 
b.  Within the city's boundaries, but outside the boundaries of the project area of the TDA; or 
c.  Within the city's extended planning area, as designated in the city's adopted Comprehensive Plan. 
(3)  The unique characteristics of each type of district and the situations where each may offer the most appropriate and efficient financing vehicle, absent other considerations which the council may determine to take into account. 
(Code 1975, § 60A-3; Ord. No. 1677, 6-22-87) 
Sec. 66-29. - Policy goals, objectives and considerations. 
(a)  Policy goals. The city's goal is to be prepared to use the most appropriate financing alternative for the construction of public improvements designed to serve redevelopment projects, new commercial and industrial developments and residential developments within the city's boundaries or service areas. In addition, establishment of these policy guidelines will facilitate compliance with the city's Comprehensive Plan, the utilities master plan, thoroughfare master plan, drainage master plans, the Thornton Community Improvement Plan, and the capital improvements plan, as well as the coordination of planned development within the city's extended planning area and additional growth areas. Through the creation of an SID, GID or Metro District, potentially, the city could achieve two goals: 
(1)  Constructing certain public improvements with noncity funds and localizing the financing burden therefor. 
(2)  In some circumstances, assisting the private sector, as well, by cooperating in projects beneficial to both public and private entities. 
(b)  Policy objectives. As set forth in this subsection, the city may consider the creation of an SID, GID or Metro District when, in the sole discretion of the council, the formation of a district is in the city's best interest and in the best interest of the area to be served. Circumstances which may indicate that a district may be an appropriate financing alternative within the city's boundaries or within the extended service area include: 
(1)  Where the public improvements to be constructed provide a general benefit to all or a portion of city residents and have previously been established as a portion of a system-wide municipal project, as set forth in the city's Comprehensive Plan, thoroughfare master plan, drainage master plans, utilities master plan, capital improvements plan, the Thornton Community Improvement Plan or any other public facility document that the city may adopt, but where construction financing has not been budgeted in a given current year in the city's capital projects fund. Such projects could include interchanges to interstate highways or highways operated by a public highway authority, and major open space or natural features as identified in the parks and open space master plan. 
(2)  Where the public improvements will serve commercial or industrial redevelopment projects or new developments which will enlarge materially the city's tax base. 
(3)  Where the public improvements will serve commercial, industrial or residential development which will enhance the entire community, with a special emphasis on the quality of the proposed development or redevelopment project. 
(4)  Where the financing burden would be imposed primarily on those properties specially benefited. 
(5)  With respect to public improvements which, pursuant to the city's then-current development policies and applicable ordinances, are the obligation of the adjacent, surrounding or nearby properties, where the public improvements are disproportionately large and financially burdensome in comparison to the benefit received by the affected properties. 
(6)  Where the council makes a determination, in its sole discretion, that creation of a district is necessary or desirable, for reasons of economies of scale, construction timing, coordination with other public improvements or the preservation of the health, safety and general welfare of the city's citizens. 
(c)  Objectives for public improvements within project area of TDA. 
(1)  The city may review proposals for district creation in the circumstances set forth in subsection (b) of this section, among other circumstances, and in accordance with the review considerations established in subsection (d) of this section, among other considerations; provided, however, that, as an overriding policy consideration, the city may choose to consider most favorably districts proposed in connection with development or redevelopment projects located within the boundaries of the project area of the TDA. If the proponents for the proposed district can demonstrate to the satisfaction of the city council that the public improvements to be financed through such district will further encourage and enhance development or redevelopment within the boundaries of the project area of the TDA, the city may choose to consider more extensive assistance through the financing mechanism afforded by the proposed district or by any other means available and deemed appropriate by the council. By way of example, but not determinative as a matter of policy, the city may include but not be limited to the types of public improvements to be financed within the boundaries of the project area of the TDA as follows: 
a.  Collector streets, in addition to arterial streets. 
b.  Detention or retention facilities, in addition to distribution water mains and sewer collection and outfall lines. 
c.  Landscape improvements within the public right-of-way and open spaces, storm sewers or traffic signalization improvements, in addition to major off-site improvements. 
(2)  It will remain entirely within the council's discretion to determine the types of public improvements which are warranted for districts created within or without the boundaries of the project area of the TDA. 
(d)  Review considerations. In conjunction with Article II of Chapter 62 relating to SIDs, Article III of this chapter relating to Metro Districts and any future procedural ordinance which the city council may adopt relating to GIDs, those districts which include the following provisions as part of their organizational proceedings or, with respect to SIDs, appropriate assurances contained in collateral documents may be more favorably considered: 
(1)  A report from the city manager that the proponents for the proposed district have submitted all necessary information as required by the city's respective procedural document, and that the city staff has made a recommendation on the formation of the proposed district. 
(2)  A provision that all improvements constructed by the district will be subject to inspection by the city in such form and fashion as necessary to ensure compliance with the city's approval of applicable plans and permits. 
(3)  Exclusive of SIDs and unless otherwise provided for and specifically approved by the city or state or public highway authority, a provision that all facilities constructed by the district would be conveyed to the city or other entity, free and clear of any lien, claim, encumbrance or demand, subject to the city's normal warranty procedures. 
(4)  Exclusive of SIDs, a prohibition against the provision of any ongoing services and operations or maintenance of facilities, unless the council specifically approves the district's proposal to provide continuing services. 
(5)  An assurance that adequate written notice and disclosure will be provided to the initial and subsequent purchasers and users of the properties within the district regarding the existence, operations and additional taxes, charges or assessments which will be imposed in connection with the district. 
(6)  To the extent possible, provisions designed to minimize the financial impact upon the purchasers and users of the properties within the district, and minimize the risk of bond defaults. 
(7)  Exclusive of SIDs, a provision that the district, once created, is subject to the city's zoning, subdivision, Building Code and other land use requirements.

Sec. 66-30. - Application. 
    The following may be considered in determining the appropriateness of the use of each type of district under this article: 
(1)  SIDs may be most favorably considered in situations where the goal is initial construction of the public improvements, i.e., upon completion, the improvements will become part of the city-wide system to be operated and maintained by the city. Other factors conducive to the approval of SIDs may include: 
a.  Requests for the creation of an SID from a substantial number of property owners willing to pay assessments for the benefit conferred. 
b.  Properties in an undeveloped area or in a developing or redeveloping mode. 
c.  Properties with fragmented ownerships along the public right-of-way. 
d.  Public improvements which will provide a benefit to the property commensurate with the cost thereof. 
e.  Properties which will not be subdivided into multiple parcels. 
f.  Properties with a foreclosure sale value sufficient to support the assessment liens imposed. 
g.  Public improvements which require cooperative financing between the city and private individuals or entities, where the city's contribution has been budgeted in the capital project funds. 
h.  Public improvements located within the project area of the TDA, because SIDs are unaffected by the frozen assessed valuation level imposed by the TDA. 
(2)  GIDs may be most favorably considered in situations where the city requires a financing mechanism for the continued operation and maintenance of improvements, separate and apart from the city's general fund or utilities operations funds. 
a.  Other factors conducive to the approval of GIDs include: 
1.  An area where the city considers it necessary to maintain complete control; the city council sits ex officio as the GID's board of directors. 
2.  A situation where the GID's broad condemnation powers would be beneficial. 
3.  Properties in an area which may be overlapped in the future by a larger Title 32 special district. 
b.  Under limited circumstances, the council may determine to permit the creation of a GID which would use general obligation debt as a financing mechanism with a property tax levy as security therefor. Within the boundaries of the project area of the TDA, such debt financing must be specifically authorized by an intergovernmental agreement among the GID, the city and the TDA. 
(3)  The city may choose to consider such Metro Districts in the following situations: 
a.  Where the proponents can demonstrate that there is a necessity for the independent control exercised by the Metro District's board of directors; by way of example, but not determinative of policy, where the viability of the Metro District's financing plan is dependent upon the directors' authority and ability to impose rates, fees and charges, as necessary, to meet payments on its revenue or general obligations issued to finance the public improvements; 
b.  Where the proponents can demonstrate that the district's independent authority to control the construction of improvements will inure to the benefit of the city; or 
c.  An area where the creation of a larger Metro District is not anticipated to be used as a financing vehicle for major areawide public improvements.

Sec. 66-31. - Implementation. 
    Separate procedural documents have been approved and may be approved implementing the procedure deemed necessary to effect the creation of districts in accordance with the policy guidelines set forth in this article for each type of district.

(2)  If disapproval is not required, it is entirely within the discretion of the city council to approve, conditionally approve or disapprove the creation of a Metro District within the city's boundaries. Any such decision by the council will be a legislative, not a quasi-judicial act, and no person shall have any right, by virtue of this article or otherwise, to create a Metro District within the city's boundaries. If the council chooses to consider whether or not the creation of a Metro District is in the best interest of the area proposed to be served thereby, the council may choose to apply the following criteria, in addition to such other information or other criteria as it deems appropriate and pertinent in making a decision: 
a.  Whether the facility and service standards of the proposed Metro District are compatible with the facility and service standards of the city. 
b.  Whether the creation of the proposed Metro District will be in the best interests of the area proposed to be served. 
(3)  Exclusions. The city council may exclude territory from a proposed Metro District prior to approval of the service plan submitted by the proposed Metro District.

ARTICLE IV. - INFRASTRUCTURE REIMBURSEMENT FEES FOR MAJOR SYSTEM-WIDE IMPROVEMENTS 

Sec. 66-75. - Purpose. 
    The city council has determined to create guidelines for establishing infrastructure reimbursement fees for major storm water improvements, water transmission and distribution facilities, wastewater collection facilities, and regional thoroughfares or arterial streets constructed at the city's expense to economically and efficiently achieve the orderly development of the city. 
(Ord. No. 2622, § 1, 7-24-00; Ord. No. 2786, § 1, 7-28-03) 
Sec. 66-76. - Definitions. 
    For purposes of this article, the following definitions shall apply: 
    Connection means any physical connection to a city water or wastewater utility facility subject to an infrastructure reimbursement fee. 
    Connector means a person or entity seeking to connect to any part of the city water or wastewater utility system, which is subject to a water infrastructure reimbursement fee or wastewater infrastructure reimbursement fee, after completion of a water transmission/distribution or wastewater collection facility by the city. 
    Major storm water improvement means improvements to channels, culverts, pipes and detention ponds intended to convey and control the 100-year storm runoff. Recommended improvements identified in the Urban Drainage and Flood Control District Outfall System Planning Studies (Master Plans) are considered to be major storm water improvements. 
    Regional thoroughfares or arterial streets means a regional thoroughfare is a street that meets or exceeds arterial street standards and provides for traffic flow across jurisdictional boundaries. An arterial street is a street whose ultimate configuration is designated in the thoroughfare master plan as an arterial, or is so designated by the deputy city manager for infrastructure. Improvements include street pavement, curb, gutter, sidewalks, signage, traffic control devices, stormwater and other appurtenances, right-of-way costs, and acceleration and deceleration lanes. 
    Total capacity means the total capacity of the wastewater collection facilities or water transmission or distribution facilities constructed pursuant to this section which will be available to connectors as determined by the public works director or designee. 
    Wastewater collection facilities mean these facilities include interceptors, sewage lift stations, force mains, and gravity sewer collection lines and related appurtenances. 
    Water distribution and transmission facilities means these facilities include water transmission and distribution lines, pump stations, or other associated facilities and appurtenances. 
(Ord. No. 2622, § 1, 7-24-00; Ord. No. 2656, § 33, 2-12-01; Ord. No. 2786, § 2, 7-28-03; Ord. No. 3272, § 2, 10-8-13) 
Sec. 66-77. - Infrastructure facilities eligible for reimbursement. 
    The city may create an infrastructure reimbursement fee when the city constructs wastewater collection facilities or water transmission or distribution facilities, major storm water improvements or regional thoroughfares or arterial streets in order to be reimbursed for the cost of such public improvement. 
(Ord. No. 2622, § 1, 7-24-00; Ord. No. 2786, § 3, 7-28-03) 
Sec. 66-78. - Creation of an infrastructure reimbursement fee. 
(a)  Notice. The infrastructure department shall publish a notice of a proposed infrastructure reimbursement fee facility and specific geographic area within which the fee will apply pursuant to Section 2-1. The notice shall provide a description of the improvements the city intends to install, an estimate of the infrastructure reimbursement fee based upon the cost estimates for the facility, and the date and time that city council will consider establishing the infrastructure reimbursement fee. A notice shall also be mailed to property owners of record located within the specific geographic area. The notice shall also state that a public hearing will not be held unless requested by a property owner. Any property that benefits from the public improvement that annexes to the city after the improvement is constructed, may be charged its proportionate share through an annexation agreement. 
(b)  Council consideration. The city council shall consider creation of an infrastructure reimbursement fee area as a regular business item unless a property owner within the specific geographic area requests a public hearing. If the city council determines to create the fee area, it shall adopt a resolution describing the general boundaries of the area that may be provided service by the facilities and the estimated costs for the infrastructure improvement. 
(c)  Costs included in the infrastructure reimbursement fee. The actual costs of materials, labor, equipment, acquisition of rights-of-way and easements, including condemnation costs, engineering services, environmental assessment, and other costs directly related to the design and construction of the improvements shall be included in the infrastructure reimbursement fee. 
(1)  Water distribution/transmission facilities . The city shall include in the calculation of the infrastructure reimbursement fee for water transmission or distribution facilities the actual costs for environmental assessment, engineering services, construction management, acquisition of rights-of-way, construction, easements, and condemnation costs.
