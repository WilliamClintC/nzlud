PREFACE 
    This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City 
of Springfield, Florida. 
    Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1972 Code, as supplemented through 
August 3, 1981, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city commission. The source of each 
section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a 
note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By 
use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 
1972 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
    The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various 
sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of 
the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law 
citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
    The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many 
state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The 
figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of 
the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first 
section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same 
time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For 
example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-
2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions 
may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter 
embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the 
subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may 
be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical 
arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon 
are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon 
represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the 
left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter 
immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of 
codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding 
prefixes:

Indexes 
    The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed 
under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and 
still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous 
cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the 
particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of 
the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory 
legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will 
be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new 
pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. 
As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the 
amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher 
that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, 
that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments 
    This publication was under the direct supervision of Bill Carroll, Vice-President, of the Municipal 
Code Corporation, Tallahassee, Florida. Credit is gratefully given to the other members of the publisher's 
staff for their sincere interest and able assistance throughout the project. 
    The publisher is most grateful to former Charles A. Yautz, City Clerk, and Donald J. Banks, City 
Attorney, for their cooperation and assistance during the progress of the work on this publication. It is 
hoped that their efforts and those of the publisher have resulted in a Code of Ordinances which will make 
the active law of the city readily accessible to all citizens and which will be a valuable tool in the day-to-
day administration of the city's affairs.

Sec. 18. - Probation period. 
    An appointment, employment, or promotion shall not be deemed complete except as to officers and

elapsed, and probationer may be discharged or reduced at any time within the said period of six (6) 
months by the city commission or the head of the department in which the probationer is employed, but if 
no discharge be made within a period of six (6) months, then said appointment, employment or promotion 
shall be deemed complete, and shall entitle the employee or appointee, unless sooner removed pursuant 
to law, to hold said position until the expiration of the term of office for which said person has been 
appointed and said employee shall be deemed a member of the civil service. 


Sec. 19. - Employment during good behavior.

during good behavior unless reduced, discharged, or suspended in accordance with section 20, 21, 22, 
23 or 24. 


Sec. 20. - Reduction in force. 
    When it appears to the mayor or to the head of any department affected by this act that an excessive 
number of persons are employed in their respective department, they shall investigate the things so 
certified, and after the city commissioners are of the opinion that an excessive number of persons are 
employed in any or all of the respective departments of the city, then the city commissioners shall have 
the right to discharge the excessive employees; provided, however, that the person who stands lowest in 
rank or grade and lower in point of seniority in that rank or grade shall be the first discharged, and said 
system of discharge shall continue until the excessive number of employees shall have been reduced in 
accordance with the certification of the mayor or the head of the departments affected; provided further, 
that such person or persons discharged shall be placed on the preferred list of the board of civil service 
commissioners, and shall be given priority for employment. In the event a vacancy occurs, in any 
department, persons discharged in that department under the provisions of this section and who have 
been placed on the preferred list, shall be employed in their respective order as to rank and seniority, and 
the board of civil service commissioners shall not recommend for employment any person or persons 
upon the regular list, until all persons upon the preferred list shall be employed. Upon the preferred list, 
the candidates for employment shall be classified first by rank and next by seniority. The person who was 
of the highest rank and had served the longest period of time in such rank shall be first on said list, and 
shall be entitled to fill the next vacancy in employment, and such system shall be continued until all 
persons on the preferred list shall be employed. 


Sec. 21. - Procedure for suspending, removing, fining or discharging. 
    No officer or employee in the civil service appointed, employed, promoted or confirmed under the 
terms and provisions of sections 10, 11 and 12 of this act, and no officer or employee in the civil service 
who, after examination, has been appointed, employed or promoted under rules of said civil service, shall 
be removed, suspended, fined or discharged except for cause shown upon written charges of misconduct 
or violation of law, or rules of civil service, and after opportunity to be heard in his own defense. Such 
charges shall be investigated by and before said board. The findings and decision of the board of civil 
service commissioners shall be certified by the mayor of the city and shall be enforced by the mayor, but 
the head of any department may suspend a subordinate for a reasonable period, not to exceed thirty (30) 
days, and his action in said suspension shall be reported to the board of civil service commissioners. On 
application in writing of the person so suspended, the board of civil service commissioners shall 
investigate said suspension and in the event they find that same was unwarranted and without cause, 
they shall certify their findings to the mayor of the city, and the said person suspended shall receive 
compensation for the time for which he was suspended. Charges for suspension, removal or demotion 
shall be in letter form, and shall concisely and briefly state the charges against the employee sought to be 
removed, suspended or demoted. This section shall not apply in the event of an excessive employment, 
as above provided. 


Sec. 22. - Causes for reduction, suspension, discharge, fine or dismissalMembers generally. 
    Any member of the civil service who shall be incompetent, neglect his duty, be guilty of 
insubordination, immorality or drunkenness, shall be subject to reduction, suspension, discharge, fine or 
dismissal. Any employee affected by this act who shall engage in political activities, either federal, state, 
county or city, shall be subject to fine, suspension or dismissal; provided however, that nothing herein 
contained shall prevent any employee from voting in such primary or election, or of becoming a candidate 
and acting in his own behalf. 


Sec. 23. - SameSuspension of department chief. 
    A department chief affected by this act may be, for misconduct, suspended for a reasonable period,

occurrence involving any dog that may be dangerous and shall, if possible, interview the owner

enforcement officer, desiring to have a dog classified as dangerous. Any physician, hospital,

attack shall promptly notify the animal control division of such attack. Any animal that is the 
subject of a dangerous dog investigation, that is not impounded with the animal control division,

relocated or ownership transferred pending the outcome of an investigation or any hearings 
related to the determination of a dangerous dog classification. In the event the dog is to be 
destroyed, the dog shall not be relocated or ownership transferred. 
(2) ?A dog shall not be declared dangerous if the threat, injury or damage was sustained by a 
person who, at the time, was unlawfully on the property or, while lawfully on the property, was

whether there is sufficient cause to classify the dog as dangerous and shall afford the owner an 
opportunity for a hearing prior to making a final determination. The animal control division shall 
provide written notification of the sufficient cause finding, to the owner, by registered mail, 
certified hand delivery, or service in conformance with the provisions of F.S. ch. 48 relating to

magistrate. 
(4) ?If the owner or keeper cannot appear at any hearing scheduled by the special magistrate, he or 
she shall contact the animal control division no later than 24 hours prior to the hearing, 
requesting a continuance to the next available date. If the owner or keeper fails to appear at the

waived his or her right to appear at such hearing. In such case the special magistrate shall 
proceed with the hearing and shall notify the owner or keeper in writing of the findings of the 
special magistrate.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 


Sec. 30-31. - Statutory authorization. 
    The legislature of the State of Florida has in F.S. ch. 166 authorized and delegated the responsibility 
to local government units to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safely, and general 
welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City Commission of the City of Springfield, Bay County, Florida 
does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations.

Sec. 30-32. - Findings of fact. 
(a) ?The flood hazard areas of the City of Springfield are subject to periodic inundation, which results in 
loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental 
services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the lax 
base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b) ?These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains causing 
increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy in flood hazard areas by uses 
vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands which arc inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or 
otherwise unprotected from flood damages. 
(Ord. No. 435, art. 1, § B, 8-18-2004; Ord. No. 481, 7-6-2009) 


Sec. 30-33. - Statement of purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this article to promote the public health, safety and general welfare and to 
minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
(1) ?Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to life, health, safety and property due to water or 
erosion hazards, which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights and 
velocities; 
(2) ?Require that uses vulnerable to floods including facilities which serve such uses be protected 
against flood damage throughout their intended life span; 
(3) ?Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers 
which are involved in the accommodation of flood waters; 
(4) ?Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase erosion or flood 
damage; and 
(5) ?Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or 
which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Ord. No. 435, art. 1, § C, 8-18-2004; Ord. No. 481, 7-6-2009) 


Sec. 30-34. - Objectives. 
    The objectives of this article are: 
(1) ?To protect human life, health and to eliminate or minimize property damage; 
(2) ?To minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
(3) ?To minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally 
undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(4) ?To minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
(5) ?To minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, 
telephone and sewer lines, roadways, and bridges and culverts located in floodplains; 
(6) ?To help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood 
prone areas in such a manner as to minimize flood blight areas; and 
(7) ?To ensure that potential homebuyers are notified that property is in a flood hazard area.

Sec. 30-36. - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this article shall be interpreted so as to 
give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this article its most reasonable 
application. 
    Accessory structure (appurtenant structure) means a structure that is located on the same parcel of 
property as the principal structure and the use of which is incidental to the use of the principal structure. 
Accessory structures should constitute a minimal investment, may not be used for human habitation, and 
be designed to have minimal flood damage potential. Examples of accessory structures are detached 
garages, carports, storage sheds, pole barns, and hay sheds. 
    Addition (to an existing building) means any walled and roofed expansion to the perimeter of a 
building in which the addition is connected by a common load-bearing wall other than a firewall. Any 
walled and roofed addition, which is connected by a firewall or is separated by independent perimeter 
load-bearing walls, is new construction. 
    Appeal means a request for a review of the floodplain management administrator's interpretation of 
any provision of this article or a request for a variance. 
    Area of shallow flooding means a designated AO or AH Zone on the community's flood insurance 
rate map (FIRM) with base flood depths from one to three feet where a clearly defined channel does not 
exist, where the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate, and where velocity flow may be 
evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
    Area of special flood hazard is the land in the floodplain within a community subject to a one percent 
or greater chance of flooding in any given year. 
    Base flood means the flood having a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given 
year (also called the "100-year flood" and the "regulatory flood"). Base flood is the term used throughout 
this article. 
    Base flood elevation means the highest water-surface elevation associated with the base flood. 
    Basement means that portion of a building having its floor sub-grade (below ground level) on all 
sides. 
    Breakaway wall means a wall that is not part of the structural support of the building and is intended 
through its design and construction to collapse under specific lateral loading forces without causing 
damage to the elevated portion of the building or the supporting foundation system. 
    Building. See Structure . 
    Coastal high hazard area means an area of special flood hazard extending from offshore to the 
inland limit of a primary frontal dune along an open coast and any other area subject to high velocity wave 
action from storms or seismic sources. The area is designated on the FIRM as Zone VIV30, VE, or V. 
    Critical facility means a facility for which even a slight chance of flooding might be too great. Critical 
facilities include, but are not limited to schools, nursing homes, hospitals, police, fire and emergency 
response installations, installations which produce, use or store hazardous materials or hazardous waste. 
    Datum means a reference surface used to ensure that all elevation records are properly related. The 
current national datum is the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, which is expressed in 
relation to mean sea level, or the North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988. 
    Development means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including, but 
not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavating, drilling 
operations, or storage of materials or equipment.

management regulations adopted by a community before the adoption of Springfield Flood Damage 
Ordinance 247, August 3, 1981. 
    Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision means the preparation of additional 
sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be 
affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and cither final site grading or the 
pouring of concrete pads). 
    Flood or flooding means: 
(1) ?A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas 
from: 
a. ?The overflow of inland or tidal waters; or 
b. ?The unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source. 
(2) ?The collapse or subsidence of land along a shore of a lake or other body of water as the result 
of erosion or undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical 
levels or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, 
accompanied by a severe storm or by an unanticipated force of natures, such as a flash flood or 
an abnormal tidal surge or by some similarly unusual and unforeseeable event which results in 
flooding as defined in subsection (1)a. of this definition. 
    Flood boundary and floodway map (FBFM) means the official map on which the Federal Emergency 
Management Agency (FEMA) or Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) has delineated the areas of flood 
hazards and regulatory floodway.

applicable) and other related data and information. 
    Floodplain means any land area susceptible to flooding. 
    Floodplain management means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive 
measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in 
the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain

    Floodplain administrator is the individual appointed to administer and enforce the city's floodplain 
management regulations. 
    Floodplain management regulations means this article and other zoning ordinances, subdivision 
regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances, and other applications of 
police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state or local 
regulations in any combination thereof, which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss 
and damage.

be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface 
elevation more than one foot. 
    Floodway fringe means that area of the floodplain on either side of the regulatory floodway where 
encroachment may be permitted without additional hydraulic and/or hydrologic analysis. 
    Freeboard means the additional height, usually expressed as a factor of safety in feet above a flood 
level for purposes of flood plain management. Freeboard tends to compensate for many unknown factors, 
such as wave action, blockage of bridge or culvert openings, and hydrological effect of urbanization of the 
watershed, which could contribute to flood heights greater than the heights calculated for a selected 
frequency flood and floodway conditions. 
    Free of obstruction means that any type of lower area enclosure or other construction element will 
not obstruct the flow of velocity water and wave action beneath the lowest horizontal structural member of 
the lowest floor of an elevated building during a base flood event. The requirement applies to the

The term docs not include long-term storage, manufacture, sales, or service facilities. 
    Hardship (as related to variances of this article) means the exceptional hardship associated with the 
land that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The City Commission of Springfield, 
Florida requires that the variance is exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere 
economic or financial hardship alone is NOT exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, 
physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a 
rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means 
without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to 
build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. 
    Highest adjacent grade means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface, prior to the start 
of construction, next to the proposed walls of a building. 
    Historic structure means any structure that is:

Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting 
the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
(2) ?Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the 
historical significance of a registered historic or a district preliminarily determined by the 
secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
(3) ?Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation 
programs which have been approved by the Secretary of the Interior; or 
(4) ?Individually listed on a local inventory historic places in communities with historic preservation 
programs that have been certified either: 
a. ?By an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior; or 
b. ?Directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
    Lowest adjacent grade means the lowest elevation, after the completion of construction, of the 
ground, sidewalk, patio, deck support, or basement entryway immediately next to the structure. 
    Lowest floor means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area (including basement). An unfinished 
or flood resistant enclosure, used solely for parking of vehicles, building access, or storage, in an area 
other than a basement, is not considered a building's lowest floor, provided that such enclosure is not 
built so as to render the structure in violation of the non-elevation design standards of this article. 
    Manufactured home means a building, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a 
permanent chassis and designed to be used with or without a permanent foundation when connected to 
the required utilities. The term also includes park trailers, travel trailers, and similar transportable 
structures placed on a site for 180 consecutive days or longer and intended to be improved property. 
    Manufactured home park or subdivision means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into 
two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    Market value means the building value, excluding the land (as agreed to between a willing buyer and 
seller), as established by what the local real estate market will bear. Market value can be established by 
independent certified appraisal, replacement cost depreciated by age of building (actual cash value), or 
adjusted assessed values. 
    Mean sea level means the average height of the sea for all stages of the tide. It is used as a 
reference for establishing various elevations within the floodplain. For purposes of this article, the term is 
synonymous with National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD). 
    National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) as corrected in 1929 is a vertical control used as a 
reference for establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
    New construction means any structure for which the "start of construction" commenced on or after 
the adoption of Springfield Flood Damage Ordinance 247, August 3, 1981. The term also includes any 
subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    New manufactured home park or subdivision means a manufactured home park or subdivision for 
which the construction of facilities for servicing die lots on which the manufactured homes are to be 
affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site 
grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of the first floodplain 
management code, ordinance or standard. 
    North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988 means a vertical control used as a reference for 
establishing varying elevations within the floodplain. 
    Principally above ground means that at least 51 percent of the actual cash value of the structure is

(4) ?Designed primarily not for use as a permanent dwelling but as temporary living quarters for 
recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use. 
    Regulatory floodway means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas 
that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water 
surface elevation more than one foot. 
    Repetitive loss means flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions 
during a ten-year period ending on the date of the event for which the second claim is made, in which the 
cost of repairing the flood damage, on the average, equaled or exceeded 25 percent of the market value 
of the building at the time of each such flood event. 
    Special flood hazard area (SFHA) (see area of special flood hazard ) means an area having special 
flood hazard and shown on a FHBM or FIRM as Zone A, AO, A1-A30, AE, A99, AH, V1-V30, VE, or V. 
    Start of construction (for other than new construction or substantial improvements under the Coastal 
Barrier Resources Act P. L. 97-348), includes substantial improvement, and means the date the building 
permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, or improvement was 
within 180 days of the permit date. The actual start means the first placement of permanent construction 
of a building (including a manufactured home) on a site, such as the pouring of slabs or footings, 
installation of piles, construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation or placement of 
a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such 
as clearing, grading and oiling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it 
include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor 
does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not 
occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main building. For substantial improvement, the actual start 
of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, 
whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    Structure means all walled and roofed buildings, including gas or liquid storage tanks and 
manufactured homes that are principally above ground. 
    Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of 
restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market 
value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of 
a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the 
"start of construction" of the improvement. This term also includes structures that have incurred 
"substantial damage" or "repetitive loss," regardless of the actual repair work performed. This term does 
not, however, include any repair or improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or 
local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications, which have been identified by the local code 
enforcement official prior to the application for the permit for improvement and which are the minimum 
necessary to assure safe living conditions. This term does not include any alteration of a historic 
structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic 
structure. 
    Substantially improved existing manufactured home parks or subdivisions is where the repair, 
reconstruction, rehabilitation or improvement of the streets, utilities and pads equals or exceeds 50 
percent of the value of the streets, utilities and pads before the repair, reconstruction or improvement 
commenced. 
    Variance is a grant of relief from the requirements of this article, which permits construction in a 
manner otherwise prohibited by this article where specific enforcement would result in a hardship. 
    Violation means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this article. 
A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of 
compliance required in this article is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is 
provided. 
    Watercourse means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, channel or other topographic feature on or 
over which waters flow at least periodically. Watercourse includes specifically designated areas in which 
substantial flood damage may occur. 
    Water surface elevation means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum 
(NGVD) of 1929, (or other datum, where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the 
floodplains of coastal or riverine areas.

the following plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevations of 
the area in question; existing or proposed structures, earthen fill, storage of materials or equipment, 
drainage facilities, and the location of the foregoing. Specifically, the following information is required: 
(1) ?Application stage: 
a. ?Elevation in relation to mean sea level of the proposed lowest floor (including basement) of 
all buildings; 
b. ?Elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any non-residential building will be 
floodproofed; 
c. ?Certificate from a registered professional engineer or architect that the non-residential 
floodproofed building will meet the floodproofing criteria in subsection (2) of this section 
and section 30-92(2); 
d. ?Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as result of 
proposed development; and 
e. ?Elevation in relation to mean sea level of the bottom of the lowest horizontal structural 
member of the lowest floor and provide a certification from a registered engineer or 
architect indicating that they have developed or reviewed the structural designs, 
specifications and plans of the construction and certify that they are in accordance with 
accepted standards of practice in coastal high hazard areas. 
(2) ?Construction stage. Upon placement of the lowest floor or lowest horizontal structural member, 
or floodproofing by whatever construction means, it shall be the duty of the permit holder to 
submit to the floodplain management administrator a certification of the NGVD or NAVD 
elevation of the lowest floor or floodproofed elevation, or bottom of the lowest horizontal 
structural member of the lowest floor as built, in relation to mean sea level. Said certification 
shall be prepared by or under the direct supervision of a registered land surveyor or

Sec. 30-92. - Specific standards for A-Zones. 
    In all A-Zones where base flood elevation data have been provided, as set forth in section 30-38, the 
following provisions, in addition to those set forth in section 30-91, shall apply: 
(1) ?Residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any residential 
building (or manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated at or 
above the base flood elevation. Should solid foundation perimeter walls be used to elevate a 
structure, there must be a minimum of two openings on different sides of each enclosed area 
sufficient to facilitate automatic equalization of flood hydrostatic forces on both sides of the 
exterior walls shall be provided in accordance with standards of subsection (3) of this section. 
(2) ?Non-residential construction. New construction or substantial improvement of any commercial, 
industrial, or non-residential building (or manufactured home) shall have the lowest floor, 
including basement, elevated at or above the base flood elevation. Buildings located in all A-
Zones may be floodproofed in lieu of being elevated provided that all areas of the building 
components, together with attendant utilities and sanitary facilities, below the base flood 
elevation plus one foot are water tight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of 
water, and use structural components having the capability of resisting hydrostatic and 
hydrodynamic loads and the effect of buoyancy. A registered professional engineer or architect 
shall certify that the standards of this subsection are satisfied. Such certification shall be 
provided to the floodplain administrator with the corresponding engineering data and operational 
and maintenance plans. 
(3) ?Enclosures below the lowest floor (elevated buildings). New construction or substantial 
improvements that include fully enclosed areas formed by foundation and other exterior walls 
below the lowest floor elevation shall be designed to preclude finished living space and 
designed to allow for the entry and exit of floodwaters to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood 
forces on exterior walls. 
a. ?Designs for complying with this requirement must either be certified by a professional 
engineer or architect or meet the following minimum criteria: 
1. ?Provide a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one 
square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding; 
2. ?The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above foundation interior 
grade (which must be equal to in elevation or higher than the exterior foundation 
grade); and 
3. ?Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves, or other coverings or 
devices provided they provide the required net area of the openings and permit the 
automatic flow of floodwaters in both directions. 
b. ?Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor shall solely be used for parking of vehicles, 
storage and building access. Access to the enclosed area shall be minimum necessary to 
allow for parking of vehicles (garage door) or limited storage of maintenance equipment 
used in connection with the premises (standard exterior door) or entry to the living area 
(stairway or elevator); and 
c. ?The interior portion of such enclosed area shall not be partitioned or finished into separate 
rooms. 
d. ?Where elevation requirements exceed six feet above the highest adjacent grade, a copy of 
the legally recorded deed restriction prohibiting the conversion of the area below the lowest 
floor to a use or dimension contrary to the building's originally approved design, shall be 
presented as a condition of issuance of the final certificate of occupancy. 
(4) ?Standards for manufactured homes and recreational vehicles. 
a. ?All manufactured homes placed, or substantially improved, on individual lots or parcels, 
outside of an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, in expansions to existing 
manufactured home parks or subdivisions, in a new manufactured home park or 
subdivision or in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on which a 
manufactured home has incurred substantial damage as the result of a flood, the lowest 
floor shall be elevated on a permanent foundation to no lower than one foot above the 
base flood elevation and be securely anchored to an adequately anchored foundation 
system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. All manufactured homes placed 
or substantially improved in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision must be 
elevated so that: 
1. ?The lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated at or above the base flood 
elevation; or 
2. ?The manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation 
elements of at least an equivalent strength, of no less than 36 inches in height above 
the grade. 
3. ?The manufactured home must be securely anchored to the adequately anchored 
foundation system to resist flotation, collapse and lateral movement. 
b. ?All recreational vehicles placed on sites must either: 
1. ?Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
2. ?Be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for 
highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by 
quick disconnect type utilities and security devices and has no permanently attached 
additions); or 
3. ?Meet all the requirements for new construction, including anchoring and elevation 
requirements of subsections (4)a. or (4)b. of this section. 
(5) ?Adequate drainage paths around structures shall be provided on slopes to guide water away 
from structures within Zone AH. 
(6) ?Standards for waterways with established base flood elevations, but without regulatory 
floodways. Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 30-38, where 
streams exist for which base flood elevation data has been provided by FEMA without the 
delineation of the regulatory floodway (Zones AE and A130), the following provisions, in 
addition to those set forth in subsections (1) through (4) of this section, shall apply: 
a. ?Until a regulatory floodway is designated, no new construction, substantial improvement or 
other development included fill shall be permitted within the areas of special flood hazard, 
unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect and anticipated development will not 
increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point in 
the community. 
b. ?Development activities which increase the water surface elevation of the base flood by 
more than one foot may be allowed, provided that the developer or applicant first applies, 
with the city's endorsement, for a conditional FIRM revision, and receives the approval of 
FEMA. 
(7) ?Floodways . Located within areas of special flood hazard established in section 30-38, are 
areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the 
velocity of flood waters which carry debris, potential projectiles and have significant erosion 
potential, the following provisions shall apply: 
a. ?Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements and 
other developments unless certification (with supporting technical data) by a registered 
professional engineer is provided demonstrating through hydrologic and hydraulic analyses 
performed in accordance with standard engineering practices that encroachments shall not 
result in any increase in flood levels during occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
b. ?If subsection (7)a. is satisfied, all new construction and substantial improvements shall 
comply with all applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of division 3. 
c. ?Prohibit the placement of manufactured homes (mobile homes), except in an existing 
manufactured homes (mobile homes) park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured 
home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision 
provided the anchoring standards of section 30-91(2), and the elevation standards of 
subsection (1) of this section and the encroachment standards of subsection (7)a. of this 
section, are met. 
d. ?Development activities including new construction and substantial improvements that 
increase the water surface elevation of the base flood by more than one foot may be 
allowed, provided that the developer or applicant first applies, with the city's endorsement, 
for a conditional FIRM revision, and receives the approval of FEMA. 
e. ?When fill is proposed, in accordance with the permit issued by the Florida Department of 
Health, within the regulatory floodway, the development permit shall be issued only upon 
demonstration by appropriate engineering analyses that the proposed fill will not increase 
the water surface elevation of the base flood in accordance with subsection (7)a. of this 
section. 
(8) ?For all structures located seaward of the coastal construction control line (CCCL), the lowest 
floor of all new construction and substantial improvements shall be elevated at least one foot 
above the base flood elevation established by FEMA, as adopted by section 30-38. 
    Notwithstanding the foregoing, but in addition thereto, for all habitable structures located 
seaward of the CCCL, the bottom of the lowest shore-parallel horizontal structural member of the 
lowest floor of all new construction and substantial improvements shall be elevated to the 100-year 
flood elevation established by the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP). For 
purposes of this subsection, habitable structure means structures which (i) are designed primarily for 
human occupancy and (ii) are potential locations for shelter from storms. Typically included are 
residences, hotels and restaurants. Typically excluded are bath houses, cabanas, swimming pools, 
garages and other structures which are either not designed primarily for human occupancy or, if 
designed for occupancy by humans, are not also potential locations for human shelter from storms.

Sec. 30-93. - Standards for A-Zones without established base flood elevation and floodways. 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 30-38, where streams exist 
for which no base flood elevation data or regulatory floodway has been provided designated by the 
Federal Emergency Management Agency, the following provisions shall apply: 
(1) ?Require standards of section 30-91. 
(2) ?Require that all new subdivision proposals and other proposed developments greater than 50 
lots or five acres, whichever is the lesser, include within such proposals base flood elevation 
data. The standards set forth in section 30-92 shall apply. 
(3) ?When base flood elevation data or floodway data have not been provided in accordance with 
section 30-92, the administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood 
elevation and floodway data available from a federal, state, or any other source, in order to 
administer the provisions of division 3. When such base flood elevation data is utilized: 
a. ?Obtain the elevation (in relation to the mean sea level) of the lowest floor (including the 
basement) of all new and substantially improved structures; 
b. ?Obtain, if the structure has been floodproofed in accordance with the requirements of 
section 30-92(b) of this article, the elevation in relation to the mean sea level to which the 
structure has been floodproofed; and 
c. ?Maintain a record of all such information with the official designated in section 30-39. 
(4) ?Notify, in riverine situations, adjacent communities and the state coordinating office prior to any 
alteration or relocation of a watercourse, and submit copies of such notifications to FEMA. 
(5) ?Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of any 
watercourse is maintained. 
(6) ?Manufactured homes shall be installed using methods and practices that minimize flood 
damage. They must be elevated and anchored to prevent flotation, collapse, or lateral 
movement. Methods of anchoring may include, but are not limited to, use of over-the-top or 
frame ties to ground anchors. This requirement is in addition to applicable state and local 
anchoring requirements for resisting wind forces. 
(7) ?When the data is not available from any source as in subsection (3) above, the lowest floor of 
the structure shall be elevated at or above the highest adjacent grade. 
(Ord. No. 435, art. 5, § C, 8-18-2004; Ord. No. 481, 7-6-2009) 


Sec. 30-94. - Reserved. 
Editor's note Ord. No. 481, adopted July 6, 2009, repealed § 30-94, which pertained to 
standards for streams with established base flood elevation without regulatory floodways, and 
derived from Ord. No. 435, art. 5, § D, 8-18-2004. 


Sec. 30-95. - Standards for AO Zones. 
    Located within the areas of special flood hazard established in section 30-38, are areas designated 
as shallow flooding areas. These areas have flood hazards associated with base flood depths of one to 
three feet, where a clearly defined channel does not exist and the path of flooding is unpredictable and 
indeterminate; therefore, the following provisions apply: 
(1) ?All new construction and substantial improvements of residential structures shall have the 
lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the highest adjacent grade at least as 
high as the flood depth specified on the flood insurance rate map. If no flood depth number is 
specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at or above the highest 
adjacent grade. 
(2) ?All new construction and substantial improvements of non-residential structures shall: 
a. ?Have the lowest floor, including basement, elevated to or above the flood depth specified 
on the flood insurance rate map, above the highest adjacent grade. If no flood depth 
number is specified, the lowest floor, including basement, shall be elevated at least two 
feet above the highest adjacent grade; 
b. ?Together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities be completely floodproofed to the 
specified flood level so that any space below that level is watertight with walls substantially 
impermeable to the passage of water and with structural components having the capability 
of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy, certification is 
required as per section 30-92(2); or 
c. ?Require drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide water away from structures. 
(3) ?Fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are subject to flooding shall meet the non-
elevation design requirements of section 30-92. 
(Ord. No. 435, art. 5, § F, 8-18-2004; Ord. No. 481, 7-6-2009) 


Sec. 30-96. - Standards for subdivision proposals. 
(a) ?All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage; 
(b) ?All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and 
water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage; 
(c) ?All subdivision proposals shall have adequate drainage provided to reduce exposure to flood 
hazards; and 
(d) ?Base flood elevation data shall be provided for subdivision proposals and other proposed 
development proposals (including manufactured home parks and subdivisions) that exceed 50 lots or 
five acres, whichever is the lesser. 
(Ord. No. 435, art. 5, § F, 8-18-2004; Ord. No. 481, 7-6-2009) 


Sec. 30-97. - Coastal high hazard areas. 
    Located within areas of special flood hazard areas established in section 30-38 are coastal high 
hazard areas, designated as Zones VIV30, VE, or V. These areas have special flood hazards 
associated with high velocity waters from surges and, therefore, in addition to meeting all provisions in 
this article, the following provisions shall also apply: 
(1) ?All new construction and substantial improvements in Zones VIV30 and VE (V if base flood 
elevation is available) shall be elevated on pilings or columns so that: 
a. ?The bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor (excluding the 
pilings or columns) is elevated to one foot freeboard; and 
b. ?The pile or column foundation and structure attached thereto is anchored to resist flotation, 
collapse, and lateral movement due to the effects of wind and water loads acting 
simultaneously on all building components. Wind and water loading values shall each have 
a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (one percent annual 
chance). 
c. ?For all structures located seaward of the coastal construction control line (CCCL), the 
bottom of the lowest horizontal structural member of the lowest floor of all new construction 
and substantial improvements shall be elevated to at least one foot above the base flood 
elevation established by FEMA, as adopted by section 30-38. 
d. ?Notwithstanding the foregoing, but in addition thereto, for all habitable structures located 
seaward of the CCCL, the bottom of the lowest shore-parallel horizontal structural member 
of the lowest floor of all new construction and substantial improvements shall be elevated 
to the 100-year flood elevation established by the Florida Department of Environmental 
Protection (FDEP). For purposes of this subsection, habitable structure means structures 
which (i) are designed primarily for human occupancy and (ii) are potential locations for 
shelter from storms. Typically included are residences, hotels and restaurants. Typically 
excluded are bath houses, cabanas, swimming pools, garages and other structures which 
are either not designed primarily for human occupancy or, if designed for occupancy by 
humans, are not also potential locations for human shelter from storms. 
(2) ?A registered professional engineer or architect shall develop or review the structural design, 
specifications and plans for the construction, and shall certify that the design and methods of 
construction to be used are in accordance with accepted standards of practice for meeting the 
provisions of subsection (1) of this section. 
(3) ?Obtain the elevation (in relation to mean sea level) of the bottom of the lowest horizontal 
structural member of the lowest floor (excluding pilings and columns) of all new and 
substantially improved structures in Zones VIV30 and VE. The floodplain management 
administrator shall maintain a record of all such information. 
(4) ?All new construction shall be located landward of the reach of mean high tide. 
(5) ?Provide that all new construction and substantial improvements have the space below the 
lowest floor either free of obstruction or constructed with non-supporting breakaway walls, open 
wood-lattice work, or insect screening intended to collapse under wind and water loads without 
causing collapse, displacement, or other structural damage to the elevated portion of the 
building or supporting foundation system. For the purpose of this section, a breakaway wall 
shall have a design safe loading resistance of not less than ten and no more than 20 pounds 
per square foot. Use of breakaway walls which exceed a design safe loading resistance of 20 
pounds per square foot (either by design or when so required by local codes) may be permitted 
only if a registered professional engineer or architect certifies that the designs proposed meet 
the following conditions: 
a. ?Breakaway wall collapse shall result from water load less than that which would occur 
during the base flood; and 
b. ?The elevated portion of the building and supporting foundation system shall not be subject 
to collapse, displacement, or other structural damage due to the effects of wind and water 
loads acting simultaneously on all building components (structural and nonstructural). 
Maximum wind and water loading values to be used in this determination shall each have a 
one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
(6) ?The enclosed space below the lowest floor shall be useable solely for parking of vehicles, 
building access, or storage. Such space shall not be partitioned into multiple rooms, 
temperature-controlled, or used for human habitation. 
(7) ?Prohibit the use of fill for structural support of buildings. When fill is proposed in a coastal high 
hazard area, appropriate engineering analyses shall be conducted to evaluate the impacts of 
the fill prior to issuance of a development permit. 
(8) ?Prohibit man-made alteration of sand dunes and mangrove stands that would increase 
potential flood damage. 
(9) ?All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved within Zones VIV30, V, and 
VE on the City of Springfield's FIRM on sites meet the standards of section 30-97(1) though (8) 
and that manufactured homes placed or substantially improved on other sites in an existing 
manufactured home park or subdivision with Zones VIV30, V, and VE on the FIRM meet the 
requirements of section 30-92(4)a. and b., if they are located: 
a. ?Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; 
b. ?In a new manufactured home park or subdivision; 
c. ?In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or 
d. ?In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision in which a manufactured home has 
incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood. 
e. ?Prohibit the placement of manufactured homes (mobile home), except in an existing 
manufactured homes (mobile homes) park or subdivision. A replacement manufactured 
home may be placed on a lot in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision 
provided the anchoring standards of this section, and the elevation standards of subsection 
(1) of this section and the encroachment standards of this section are met. 
(10) ?Recreational vehicles placed on sites within Zones VIV30, V, and VE on the community's 
FIRM either: 
a. ?Be on the site for fewer than 180 consecutive days; 
b. ?Be fully licensed and ready for highway use, on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to 
the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no 
permanently attached additions; or 
c. ?Meet the requirements of section 30-66 (permit procedures) and sections 30-92 and 30-97. 
d. ?Prohibit the placement of recreational vehicles, except in an existing recreational vehicle 
park. Must be fully licensed and ready for highway use, on its wheels or jacking system, is 
attached to the site by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no 
permanently attached additions. Be on site no more than 180 days and park must have a

Sec. 34-63. - Powers and duties of the enforcement officer; determination of interested parties. 
(a) ?Generally. The enforcement officer shall be charged with the duty of administering the applicable

(1) ?Make such inspections as may be necessary to effectuate the purposes and intent of this 
chapter.

resolution thereof; however, only matters or conditions pertinent to the existence of a nuisance, 
as defined herein shall be considered or reported by the enforcement officer. 
(b) ?Preparation of notice and order generally. When the enforcement officer verifies the existence of a 
nuisance, it shall be his duty to promptly prepare and submit to the city clerk a proposed form of the 
notice and order required by this chapter. The city clerk or his or her designee, shall review, approve 
or modify and execute the form of notice and order and, with assistance of the city attorney, shall 
determine the owner(s) of record of the real estate upon which the nuisance is located, and send the 
owner(s) a notice and order of abatement, referred to in this chapter as the notice and order. In 
addition, the notice and order shall be given to the record lessee(s), if any, and persons of record 
interest (including by way of example and not limitation mortgagee, contract purchaser, agent with 
power of attorney, and any person claiming an interest in the property) and, by the initial posting of 
notice upon the dwelling or structure in question, to any occupants of that dwelling or structure. All 
such persons are referred to as the "interested parties" in this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 525, § 1, 12-2-2015) 


Sec. 34-64. - Notice and order of abatement. 
(a) ?The notice and order may require the cutting of weeds or underbrush or the removal of rubbish or 
such other measures as are reasonably necessary to abate the nuisance. 
(b) ?The notice and order may require the vacation, repair, restoration or replacement of any unfit or 
unsafe dwelling or structure or of any part or parts thereof, including accessory building(s); provided, 
however, that if the inspector shall determine that the cost to repair, restore or replace any such 
dwelling or structure or part thereof, including accessory building(s) in compliance with all applicable 
building and life safety codes, would exceed 50 percent of the value of such dwelling or structure or 
part thereof, including accessory building(s) (as determined by reference to the most recent, final ad 
valorem tax roll prepared by the Bay County Property Appraiser) he may only order the vacation and 
demolition and removal of the dwelling or structure. 
(c) ?In addition, due to a variety of reasons, including, but not limited to, abandonment, neglect, 
inadequate property management, or obsolescence, the condition(s) constituting a danger or 
nuisance to the public cannot be made safe, the notice and order shall require the vacation of the 
dwelling or structure involved and order the demolition and removal of the dwelling or structure or 
any part or parts thereof, including accessory building(s), contributing to the nuisance. Factors 
evidencing a determination that a property cannot be made safe may include, but not be limited to: a 
history of unsecured or un-securable, dangerous conditions; a history demonstrating the property 
owner's failure to exercise reasonable control over the property to keep it secure or safe; a history 
showing that the property has become an attractive nuisance to children or transients; a history 
showing a proliferation of criminal activity due to dilapidated conditions and lack of management and 
control over the premises; a history showing that notwithstanding the reasonable efforts of law 
enforcement or code enforcement personnel, or both, the property remains in a condition which is 
imminently dangerous to the public health, safety and welfare. 
(d) ?A notice and order requiring the repair, restoration or replacement of any dwelling, structure or part 
or parts thereof, including accessory building(s), shall require that the work meet the standards 
specified by all applicable building and life safety codes. 
(e) ?The notice and order shall be in writing, signed by the city clerk or his or her designee, with a 
description of the nuisance and a legal description of the realty where it is located, including the 
street address, and shall state what the city orders to be done about the condition and the date 
within which the work ordered to be done is to be completed. The notice and order shall state that it 
may be appealed within 30 days by written application to the city clerk. The notice and order shall 
describe the condition(s) found by the inspector to constitute a public nuisance pursuant to this 
chapter. If the notice and order requires demolition and removal of an unfit or unsafe dwelling or 
structure, or part or parts thereof, including an accessory building(s), it shall describe the condition(s) 
found by the inspector, upon consultation with the city attorney, to constitute such a public nuisance 
pursuant to this chapter as to make demolition reasonable. A notice and order requiring demolition 
and removal shall also state that interested parties may elect to abate the nuisance by repair, 
restoration or replacement of the subject unfit or unsafe dwelling or structure, or part or parts thereof, 
including accessory building(s). 
(f) ?In the case of an unfit or unsafe dwelling or structure or part or parts thereof, including accessory 
building(s), this notice and order shall require the owner or other interested parties within 30 days 
after service to obtain a permit and begin specified repairs or improvements, or begin to demolish 
and remove the dwelling or structure or portion thereof. This work shall be completed within 60 days 
from the date of the permit for repair or demolition. Any demolition permit necessary as a result of 
any notice and order herein shall not require a fee. 
(g) ?Except as otherwise provided in this chapter for unsafe or unfit dwellings or structures the city clerk 
shall order such work to be completed within such time as he determines to be reasonable 
considering the nature of the nuisance, the danger to the public and the amount of work involved to 
abate the nuisance. 
(h) ?When the county health officer or licensed pest control operator verifies the existence of a rodent 
infestation in any dwelling or structure that is to be demolished and removed, in order to preclude the 
migration of rodents, the notice and order shall require that effective rodent extermination methods 
be employed by a licensed structural pest control operator prior to demolition. Extermination 
techniques shall include ectoparasite control measures. 
(i) ?An order to vacate, demolish and remove an unfit or unsafe dwelling or structure or any part or parts 
thereof, including accessory building(s), shall not preclude the immediate repair, restoration or 
replacement thereof by an interested party entitled to effect such work (herein collectively an 
applicant). In order to make the election available in this subsection and avoid the demolition and 
removal, within 30 days after service of the notice and order of demolition, the applicant must submit 
a competent application for all or a material portion of the work needed to abate the nuisance and in 
good faith commence and diligently and continuously pursue all the work through completion. The 
work must meet the standards specified by all applicable building and life safety codes. In the event 
that the initial permit application does not cover all the work, the application must be accompanied by 
a description of the remainder of the work to be done and include a schedule of all the work with 
milestones reasonable and customary in the construction industry. The city clerk shall either accept 
or reject the application as covering a material portion of the work, the overall work described as 
sufficient to abate the nuisance and the schedule of work/milestones as reasonable. Should the city 
clerk find that the initial application does not cover a material portion of the work, that the overall 
work described is insufficient to abate the nuisance, or that the schedule of work/milestones is not 
reasonable, he or she shall advise the applicant who shall have ten days to correct the deficiency in 
writing or appeal in writing to the city commission which shall hear the matter at its next regular or 
special meeting. The only issues before the city commission shall be whether to accept or reject the 
matter(s) rejected by the city clerk. The city commission may not amend the application, description 
of work or schedule without the written consent of the applicant. The appeal shall be conducted as a 
quasi-judicial, de novo hearing pursuant the city's Land Development Code, except that only the 
applicant and the city clerk, or their respective designees, shall be entitled to present evidence. No 
other persons shall be considered adversely affected persons. Public comment, but only as 
commentary, shall be permitted. The applicant shall bear the burden of proof. If the applicant's 
position is accepted then the applicant shall be required to immediately commence and diligently and 
continuously pursue the work to abate the nuisance strictly in accord with the schedule upon penalty 
of demolition as provided in section 34-67(b). If the applicant's position is not affirmed, the applicant 
shall have 30 days after entry of the city commission's order to comply with the initial notice and 
order of demolition and removal, and no permit to repair, restore or replace shall be issued. 
(Ord. No. 525, § 1, 12-2-2015) 


Sec. 34-65. - Service of notice and order. 
    It shall be the duty of the city clerk or his or her designee to see to it that the required notice and 
order is delivered to the interested parties by personal delivery of copy thereof to the party to be notified, 
or by leaving such copy at his usual place of abode with some person of the family above 15 years of age 
and informing such person of the contents thereof, or by either registered or certified United States mail 
with return receipt requested. If the name of the party to be notified or his place of residence or his post 
office address cannot be ascertained after diligent search, or in the event a notice and order sent by 
either registered or certified mail shall be returned undelivered, notice shall be made by publishing a copy 
thereof once a week for two consecutive weeks in a newspaper of general circulation within the city. A 
copy of such notice and order shall be posted in a conspicuous place upon such dwelling or structure in 
question, in a conspicuous place at City Hall, and upon the city website. The subsequent removal or 
illegibility of the notice and order posted upon the dwelling or structure shall not render the posting invalid. 
(Ord. No. 525, § 1, 12-2-2015) 


Sec. 34-66. - Extension of time to comply. 
(a) ?In the case of an unfit or unsafe building or structure if the interested parties shall have obtained a 
building or demolition permit within the 30-day period and in good faith and in due time begun work 
to comply with the order and diligently pursue the work, but it appears that they will not be able to 
complete the work by the date ordered, they may file a written request with the city commission 
stating the reasons they have been unable to complete compliance. If reasonable grounds are 
shown therefor, the city commission is authorized to issue an order authorizing an extension of time, 
not to exceed 60 days, in which to complete compliance with the original notice and order. The city 
commission shall consider the request at its next regular or a special meeting, give the requesting 
party an opportunity to be heard, and grant the request only for good cause shown. 
(b) ?In the case of a nuisance which is not an unfit or unsafe dwelling or structure the city clerk or his or 
her designee may grant extensions of up to 60 days to abate the nuisance as are reasonably 
necessary under the circumstances upon written request from the interested parties stating the 
reasons they have been unable to complete compliance and showing reasonable grounds for such 
failure to complete compliance. 
(c) ?Violations of this chapter which constitute a nuisance related to public streets, rights-of-way, and 
public thoroughfares shall be abated immediately. 
(d) ?Should the interested parties, through no fault of their own, be unable to complete compliance by 
the date ordered in the original notice and order nor by any extension date granted pursuant to this 
section, the city commission, in exceptional cases, upon written request, may extend the completion 
date as merited by special hardship, unusual difficulty, or uniqueness of the situation; however, in no 
event shall the completion date extend beyond a maximum period of 180 days. 
(Ord. No. 525, § 1, 12-2-2015) 


Sec. 34-67. - City action on failure to comply. 
(a) ?If the interested party(s) shall fail to comply with an order made pursuant to the provisions of this 
chapter within the time therein fixed or extended, the city, acting through the city clerk, is authorized 
to abate the nuisance in accordance with the notice and order, either with city forces or by 
independent contractor(s) selected through the city's procurement process. 
(b) ?If the interested party(s) respecting an unfit or unsafe dwelling or structure or any part or parts 
thereof, including accessory building(s) which are the subject or an order to demolish and remove 
shall timely elect to repair, restoration or replacement as provided in this chapter but fail to timely 
obtain the required permits, or fail to timely commence and continuously and diligently pursue the 
work, the city, acting through the city clerk, is authorized to effect the ordered demolition and removal 
(including work in progress if work has been commenced) either with city forces or by independent 
contractor(s) selected through the city's procurement process. 
(c) ?In the event of any failure to comply specified in this section or under this chapter, the city clerk and 
the city attorney are authorized to commence on behalf of the city an action in circuit court against 
the interested party(s) to determine the validity of this chapter on its face and as applied, to require 
the interested party(s) to comply with the notice and order and, in the absence of compliance within a 
time specified by the court, to authorize the city to abate the nuisance as specified in the notice and 
order or as pleases the court, and to determine the amount and validity of the lien or assessment to 
be imposed or levied against the subject property to pay the cost of abatement. In the event the city 
commission shall by resolution determine to borrow the funds required to pay the cost of abatement 
and to pledge the proceeds of the lien or assessment to repay the loan, the city clerk and city 
attorney are authorized to seek on behalf of the city pursuant to F.S. ch. 75, validation of the city's 
authority to incur the debt, issue the certificates or bonds evidencing the debt and the legality of all 
the proceedings in connection therewith. In the event validation proceedings are commenced, the 
city clerk is directed to serve upon the interested parties notice of their right to intervene in those 
proceedings. 
(Ord. No. 525, § 1, 12-2-2015) 


Sec. 34-68. - Assessment of cost; lien. 
(a) ?Upon expiration of the 30-day appeal period with no appeal having been taken, the city clerk, after 
proceeding under this chapter, shall as often as may be convenient report the action taken toward 
abatement of the nuisance by the city and the city commission shall assess the entire cost of such 
action against the real property, which assessment, when made shall constitute a lien upon said 
property in favor of the city. The lien of the city shall encompass costs of determining the nuisance, 
effecting the vacation, securing the property, removing or abating the nuisance, demolishing and 
removing the dwelling or structure and accessory building(s) when applicable, all administrative, 
legal, postal and publication expenses, as well as rodent extermination when employed, and the fees 
of independent experts offering opinions, reports or testimony concerning the nuisance or 
abatement, as well as all other direct or indirect costs associated therewith. All such costs and 
expenses are collectively referred to as the abatement cost. To the extent permitted by law, the lien 
upon the property for the abatement cost shall be superior to the interests of all others receiving 
notice and an opportunity to administratively appeal the notice and order, except taxes. 
(b) ?The city clerk shall record a notice and claim of lien in the county's official record book showing the 
nature of such lien, the amount thereof, and a legal description of the property, including the street 
address, and the names of all interested parties known to the city. Such municipal lien shall bear 
interest from said date at the rate of ten percent and shall be enforceable by foreclosure against the 
property if unsatisfied after the expiration of three months from the date of recording the notice and 
claim of lien, or enforceable as other liens may be enforced by the city. Upon notice of an impending 
county tax deed sale, the tax collector shall request the clerk of the circuit court to collect all monies 
due the city, including such municipal lien with interest. 
(c) ?In addition, the city may collect the abatement cost through the additional and alternative method of 
levying a special assessment, sometimes called a non-ad valorem assessment, upon the subject 
property benefitted by the abatement. Collection shall be through the methods authorized by 
Ordinance No. 524, or any amending or succeeding ordinance, and shall include without limitation 
the method of collection specified in F.S. §§ 197.3632 and 197.3635, or any amending or 
succeeding statute. It is the legislative intent of this chapter to authorize the collection of abatement 
costs by assessment placed on the same bill as ad valorem taxes pursuant to applicable statutes 
and regulations promulgated thereunder. In the event this additional and alternative method of 
collection is used, the abatement cost shall include the fees incurred by the city for legal counsel, 
independent experts offering opinions, reports or testimony concerning the abatement benefit to the 
subject property or any other matters related or useful to the levy. This method of collection is 
cumulative to any other method of collection available to the city at law or equity.

forthwith transmit a copy of the notice of appeal, together with all related documents of the 
enforcement officer's department, to the city commission. Within ten days after the filing of notice of 
appeal, the city clerk shall schedule a date for the hearing thereof and give notice of the date for the 
hearing to the interested parties, in a manner as would afford them not less than ten days' notice. 
Under no circumstances shall the clerk establish a hearing date beyond 60 days from the filing of the 
notice of appeal. 
(b) ?All interested parties shall have 30 days within which to comply with the resolution of the 
commission. 
(c) ?Nuisances related to public streets, rights-of-way, and public thoroughfares shall be abated 
immediately. However, offenders shall have the right to appeal decision of abatement to the city 
commission for determination of whether the conduct constituted a nuisance. If there is a 
determination that such conduct did not constitute a nuisance, then any fines or penalties assessed 
against the alleged offender shall be forfeited by the city. 
(Ord. No. 525, § 1, 12-2-2015)

record book, but nay not appear through any person otherwise a stranger to the record. All witnesses 
appearing before the city commission in proceedings under this chapter shall be sworn by the mayor or in 
his absence, by the person acting in his stead, except counsel representing a client.

reports to the enforcement officer, of all dwellings or structures which appear to be substandard

soon as practicable. 
(b) ?In carrying out his responsibilities hereunder, the enforcement officer may request assistance from a 
health officer, to determine violations of municipal ordinances, or state law, and rules and regulations 
of a health officer.

order to enforce the provisions of this chapter. When necessary to obtain such entry, the enforcement 
officer and his designees may institute proceedings to obtain a search warrant.

Sec. 34-74. - Alternative method. 
    This chapter shall be deemed to provide an additional and alternative method for the doing of the 
things authorized hereby, including without limitation the levy of assessments, sometimes called non-ad 
valorem assessments, and shall be regarded as supplemental and additional to powers conferred by 
other laws, and shall not be regarded as in derogation of any powers now existing or which may hereafter

suspend hearing officers for cause including, without limitation, those grounds specified by state law. 
Appointments to fill any vacancy shall be for the remainder of the unexpired term. 
(c) ?Hearing officers shall not be city employees but shall serve without compensation. Hearing officers 
may be reimbursed for such travel, mileage, and per diem expenses as authorized by the mayor. 
(d) ?The city attorney may serve as general counsel to the city. If an appeal to the circuit court is 
requested pursuant to section 42-125(a) the city attorney shall represent the city at such 
proceedings. 
(Ord. No. 433, 4-19-2004) 


Sec. 42-92. - Code enforcement procedure. 
(a) ?For the purpose of this article a "code inspector" is defined to be any agent or employee of the city 
whose duty is to assure code compliance. 
(b) ?Code inspectors shall have the authority to initiate enforcement proceedings as provided below. No 
hearing officer shall have the power to initiate such proceedings. 
(c) ?For the purpose of this article "violators" shall be deemed to be those persons or entities creating or 
permitting a violation of a city ordinance, or those persons or entities owning or possessing land on 
which a violation of an ordinance is created or maintained. The city finds and determines that the 
owner of land has an obligation to know whether conditions created or maintained on that land 
violates any city ordinance and therefore is deemed to have actual constructive knowledge of any 
such violation. The owner of land has a legal duty to determine whether conditions created or 
maintained on his or her land violate any city ordinance, and to correct such violations. 
(d) ?A code inspector who finds a violation of a city ordinance shall determine a reasonable time period 
within which the violator must correct the violation provided that such time period shall be no more 
than 30 days. The determination shall be based on consideration of fairness: practicality, ease of 
correction, ability to correct, severity of the violation; nature, extent and probability of danger or 
danger to the public; and other relevant factors relating to the reasonableness of the time period 
prescribed. A time for correction need not be specified if the violation is deemed to be an 
uncorrectable violation. 
(e) ?A code inspector who finds a violation shall issue a civil violation notice to the violator pursuant to 
section 42-93. 
(f) ?The civil violation shall include but not be limited to the following: 
(1) ?Date and time of issuance. 
(2) ?Name of code inspector and division or department issuing the notice. 
(3) ?Name and address of the violator. 
(4) ?Ordinance number and section violated. 
(5) ?Brief description of the nature of the violation, including location, date and time of violation. 
(6) ?Amount of civil penalty for which the violator may be liable. 
(7) ?Instructions and due date for paying the fine or filing for an administrative hearing before a 
hearing officer to appeal the civil fine. 
(8) ?Time within which the violation must be corrected, if applicable. 
(9) ?Notice that each day of continued violation after the time period for correction has run shall be 
deemed a continuing violation subject to additional penalty in the same amount, without the 
need for additional notices of violation. No appeal is allotted for continued violations beyond the 
original date of appeal. 
(10) ?Notice that the filing of a request for an administrative hearing will toll the accrual of continuing 
violation penalties. 
(11) ?Notice that failure to request an administrative hearing within 20 days, or within the specified 
time period listed for a violation of a specific section of an ordinance, after service of a civil 
violation notice shall constitute a waiver of the violator's right to an administrative hearing before 
the hearing officer, and such waiver shall constitute an admission of the violation. 
(12) ?Notice that the violator may be liable for the reasonable costs of the administrative hearing 
should he be found guilty of the violation. 
(13) ?Notice that if the violator fails to pay civil penalty in the time allowed, or fails to appear in court 
to contest the violation, the violator shall be deemed to have waived his right to contest the 
violation and that, in such case, judgment may be entered against the violator by the hearing 
officer for the amount of maximum civil penalty. 
(g) ?After issuing a civil violation notice to an alleged violator, the code inspector shall promptly deposit 
the original civil violation notice and one copy of the civil violation notice with the Clerk of the Court of 
Bay County, Florida. 
(Ord. No. 433, 4-19-2004) 


Sec. 42-93. - Notices. 
(a) ?All notices required by this part shall be provided to the violator by: 
(1) ?Certified mail, return receipt requested, provided if such notice is sent under this paragraph to 
the owner of the property in question at the address listed in the tax collector's office for tax 
notices, and at any other address provided to the city by such owner and is returned as 
unclaimed or refused, notice may be provided by posting as described in subsection (2) and by 
first class mail directed to the addresses provided to the city by such owner with a properly 
executed proof of mailing or affidavit confirming the first class mailing; 
(2) ?Hand delivered by the sheriff or other law enforcement officer, code inspector, or other person 
designated by the local governing body; 
(3) ?Leaving the violation notice at the violator's usual place of residence with any person residing 
therein who is more than 15 years of age and informing such person of the contents of the 
notice; or 
(4) ?In the case of commercial premises, leaving the notice with the manager or other person in 
charge. 
(b) ?In addition to providing notice as set forth in subsection (a), at the option of the hearing officer, 
notice may also be served by publication or posting, as follows: 
(1) ?Such notice be published once during each week for four consecutive weeks (four publications 
being sufficient) in a newspaper of general circulation in the county where the code enforcement 
board is located. The newspaper shall meet such requirements as are prescribed under F.S. ch. 
50 for legal and official advertisements. Proof of publication shall be made as prescribed in F.S. 
§§ 50.0541 and 50.051. 
(2) ?In lieu of publication provided in subsection (1), such notice may be posted at least ten days 
prior to the hearing, or prior to the expiration of any deadline contained in the notice, in at least 
two locations, one of which shall be the property upon which the violation is alleged to exist and 
the other of which shall be the city hall. Proof of posting shall be by affidavit of the person 
posting the notice, which affidavit shall include a copy of the notice and the date and places of 
its posting. 
(3) ?Notice by publication or posting may run concurrently with, or may follow, an attempt or 
attempts to provide notice by hand delivery or by mail as prescribed in subsection (a) of this 
section. Evidence that an attempt has been made to hand deliver or mail notice as provided in 
subsection (a) of this section together with proof of publication or posting as prescribed in 
subsection (b) of this section, shall be sufficient to show that the notice requirements of this part 
have been met, without regard to whether or not the alleged violator actually received such 
notice. 
(Ord. No. 433, 4-19-2004) 


Secs. 42-9442-120. - Reserved. 


DIVISION 3. - HEARINGS, PENALTIES AND APPEALS 


Sec. 42-121. - Civil penalties and related terms construed. 
(a) ?Penalties for violations of the ordinances to be enforced by this article shall be in the amount 
prescribed in the schedule of civil penalties section 42-128. 
(b) ?An "uncorrectable violation" is a violation which cannot be remedied after the violation has been 
committed because the violation constitutes a single prohibited act rather than an on-going condition 
or circumstance. Each reoccurrence of an uncorrectable violation shall constitute a separate violation 
and shall subject the violator to an additional penalty double that of the original violation. If, however, 
a violator has been found guilty of an uncorrectable violation and causes the same uncorrectable 
violation to occur a second time, each reoccurrence of the uncorrectable violation by the violator 
shall constitute a repeat violation as provided in subsection (d) of this section. 
(c) ?"Continuing violations" are those violations which remain uncorrected beyond the reasonable time 
period for correction in either the civil violation notice or the final order of the hearing officer, 
whichever is applicable. For each day of continued violation after the time for correction has run, an 
additional penalty of the same amount as that prescribed for the original violation shall be added. 
The maximum total fine for any one continuing violation shall not exceed 20 times the original 
penalty amount. 
(d) ?A "repeat violation" is a recurring violation of an ordinance by a violator who has been found guilty of 
the same violation within five years prior to the present violation, or who has admitted violating the 
same provision within five years prior to the present violation, notwithstanding the violations occurred 
at different locations. In the case of correctable violations, a repeat violation can occur only after 
correction of the previous violation has been made. For the first repeat violation the amount of the 
civil penalty shall be double the amount of penalty prescribed for the original violation by section 42-
128. The amount of civil penalty due for each subsequent repeat violation shall be double the 
amount of the penalty due for the first day of the immediately preceding violation, provided that the 
maximum penalty payable for the first day of any one repeat violation shall be $500.00. A repeat 
violation which remains uncorrected beyond the time prescribed for correction in the civil violation 
notice shall be treated as a continuing violation. 
(e) ?A civil penalty imposed pursuant to this section shall not exceed $250.00 per day for a first violation 
and shall not exceed $500.00 per day for a repeat violation. 
(f) ?If a request for administrative hearing is not timely filed continuing violation penalties shall accrue 
from the date of correction given in the civil violation notice until the correction is made and payment 
of fine is received. If the named violator requests an administrative hearing on a correctable violation 
and losses his appeal, the hearing office shall determine a reasonable time period within which 
correction for the violation must be made, based on the considerations set forth in section 42-92(d). 
If correction is not made within the period set by the hearing officer, continuing violation penalties 
shall begin after the time of correction has run. No continuing violation penalties shall accrue during 
the time period from the date of the civil violation notice until the date of the administrative hearing, if 
the named violator timely requests an administrative hearing to appeal the decision of the code 
inspector. Continuing violation penalties cannot be imposed by the hearing officer for uncorrectable 
violations. 
(g) ?Civil penalties assessed pursuant to this article are due and payable to the Clerk of Court of Bay 
County, Florida, on the last day of the period allowed for the filing of an appeal to the circuit court 
from the hearing officer's decision, or, if proper appeal is made, when the appeal has been finally 
decided adversely to the named violator. 
(h) ?In addition, if the code inspector has reason to believe a violation or the condition causing the 
violation presents a serious threat to the public health, safety and welfare or if the violation is 
irreparable or irreversible in nature, or if after attempts under this section to bring a repeat violation 
into compliance with a provision of a code or ordinance prove unsuccessful, the city may make all 
reasonable repairs which are required to bring the property into compliance and charge the owner 
with reasonable cost of the repairs with the fine imposed pursuant to this section. Making such 
repairs does not create a continuing obligation on the part of the city to make further repairs or to 
maintain the property and does not create any liability against the city for any damages to the 
property. 
(Ord. No. 433, 4-19-2004) 


Sec. 42-122. - Rights of violators; payment of fine; right to appeal and correction of violation; failure to 
pay and correct, or to appeal. 
(a) ?A violator who has been served with a civil violation notice shall elect either to: 
(1) ?Pay the civil penalty in the manner indicated on the notice, and correct the violation within the 
time specified on the notice (if applicable); or 
(2) ?Request an administrative hearing before a hearing officer to appeal the decision of the code 
inspector which resulted in the issuance of the civil violation notice. 
(b) ?Appeal by administrative hearing of the notice of violation before a hearing officer shall be 
accomplished by filing a request in writing to the address indicated on the notice, received by the 
hearing officer within the time limit stipulated in the notice, or no later than 20 calendar days after the 
service of the notice, whichever is earlier. Failure of the named violator to appeal the decision of the 
code inspector within the prescribed time period shall constitute a waiver of the violator's right to 
administrative hearing before the hearing officer. A waiver of right to administrative hearing shall be 
treated as an admission of the violation and penalties, including continuing violation penalties, shall 
be assessed by the hearing officer accordingly. 
(c) ?If the named violator, after notice, does not timely appeal and fails to pay the civil penalty and 
correct the violation within the time specified (if applicable), the code inspector shall notify the 
hearing officer and request the hearing officer to issue an order finding the violator guilty and 
imposing the civil penalty and, if applicable, continuing violation penalties. 
(Ord. No. 433, 4-19-2004) 


Sec. 42-123. - Scheduling and conduct of hearing. 
(a) ?Upon receipt of a named violator's timely request for an administrative hearing, the hearing officer 
shall set the matter down for a hearing on the next regularly scheduled hearing date or as soon 
thereafter as possible or as mandated in the specified ordinance which is enforced pursuant to this 
article. 
(b) ?The hearing officer shall provide a notice of hearing by certified mail to the named violator at his last 
known address. Alternatively, the notice may be delivered as provided in section 42-124. The notice 
of hearing shall include but not be limited to the following: 
(1) ?Name of the code inspector who issued the notice. 
(2) ?Factual description of the alleged violation. 
(3) ?Date of alleged violation. 
(4) ?Ordinance and section allegedly violated. 
(5) ?Place, date and time of hearing. 
(6) ?Right of violator to be represented by a lawyer. 
(7) ?Right of violator to present witnesses and evidence. 
(8) ?Notice that failure of violator to attend hearing may result in civil penalty being assessed 
against him. 
(9) ?Notice that requests for continuances will not be considered if not received by the hearing 
officer at least ten calendar days prior to the date set for the hearing. 
(c) ?The hearing officers shall call hearings on a biweekly basis or upon request of the Clerk of Court of 
Bay County, Florida. All hearings shall be set for the next scheduled hearing date after receipt of the 
appeal. No hearing shall be set sooner than 20 calendar days from the date of service of the notice 
of violation. 
(d) ?A hearing date shall not be postponed or continued unless a request of continuance is received in 
writing by the hearing officer at least ten calendar days prior to the date set for the hearing. 
(e) ?All hearings of the hearing officer shall be open to the public. All testimony shall be under oath and 
shall be electronically recorded. Assuming proper notice, a hearing may proceed in the absence of 
the named violator. 
(f) ?The proceedings at the hearing shall be recorded and may be transcribed at the expense of the 
party requesting the transcript. Minutes shall be kept of all hearings by each hearing officer. 
(g) ?The Bay County Clerk of Court shall provide clerical and administrative personnel, services, forms 
and facilities as may be reasonably required by each hearing officer for the proper performance of 
his duties and shall collect and pay over to the city all civil penalties, costs and other sums due and 
payable hereunder, retaining such portion thereof as from time to time may be established by 
resolution of the city commission to compensate the clerk for such assistance. 
(h) ?Each case before a hearing officer shall be presented by the city clerk or his designee. 
(i) ?The hearing need not be conducted in accordance with formal rules relating to evidence and witness 
but fundamental due process shall be observed and shall govern the proceedings. Any relevant 
evidence shall be admitted if the hearing officer finds it competent and reliable, regardless of the 
existence of any common law or statutory rule to the contrary. 
(j) ?The hearing officer may take testimony from the code inspector and the alleged violator. Each party 
shall have the right to call and examine witnesses; to introduce exhibits; to cross examine opposing 
witnesses on any matter relevant to the issues even though that matter was not covered in the direct 
examination; to impeach any witness regardless of which party first called him to testify; and to rebut 
the evidence against him. 
(k) ?The hearing officer shall make findings of fact based on evidence of record. In order to make a 
finding upholding the code inspector's decision, the hearing officer must find that a preponderance of 
evidence indicates that the named violator was responsible for the violation of the relevant section of 
the Code as charged. 
(l) ?If the named violator is found guilty of the violation, he may be held liable for the reasonable costs of 
the administrative hearing as set forth by the Bay County Clerk of Court. If the city prevails in 
prosecuting a case before the hearing officer, the city shall be entitled to recover all costs incurred in 
prosecuting the case before the hearing officer and such costs will be included in the lien authorized 
under section 42-128. 
(m) ?The fact-finding determination of the hearing shall be limited to whether the violation alleged did 
occur and, if so, whether the person named in the civil violation notice is held responsible for that 
violation as provided in section 42-123(c). Based upon this fact-finding determination, the hearing 
officer shall either reverse or affirm the decision of the code inspector as to the responsibility of the 
named violator for the Code violation, and shall issue an order affording the proper relief. If the 
hearing officer affirms the decision of the code inspector, the hearing officer shall issue an order and 
shall determine a reasonable time period within which correction of the violation must be made. If the 
hearing officer reverses the decision of the code inspector and finds the named violator not 
responsible for the Code violation alleged in the civil violation notice, the named violator shall not be 
liable for the payment of the civil penalty, absent reversal of the hearing officer's findings pursuant to 
section 5, O. If the decision of the hearing officer is to affirm, then the following elements shall be 
included in the order: 
(1) ?Amount of civil penalty. 
(2) ?Administrative costs of hearing. 
(3) ?Date by which the violation must be corrected to prevent imposition of continuing violation 
penalties (if applicable). 
(n) ?The hearing officer shall have the power to: 
(1) ?Adopt procedures for the conduct of hearings. 
(2) ?Subpoena alleged violators and witnesses for hearings, subpoenas may be served by the law 
enforcement officers, by the staff of the hearing officer or by the code inspector. 
(3) ?Subpoena evidence. 
(4) ?Take testimony under oath. 
(5) ?Assess and order the payment of civil penalties as provided herein. 
(o) ?Appeals: 
(1) ?A hearing officer shall postpone a hearing if the named violator, prior to the scheduled hearing 
date, files with a duly authorized city board of appropriate jurisdiction a timely administrative 
appeal concerning the interpretation or application of any technical provisions of the Code 
section allegedly violated. However, once an issue has been determined by a hearing officer in 
a specific case, that issue may not be further reviewed by a city board in that specific case. A 
named violator waives his right to appeal to other city boards if the violator does not apply for 
such appeal prior to the violator's code enforcement hearing before the hearing officer. 
(2) ?Upon exhaustion of a timely filed administrative appeal and finalization of the administrative 
order by such board, the hearing officer may exercise all powers given to him by this article. The 
hearing officer shall not, however, exercise any jurisdiction over such alleged Code violations 
until the time allowed for court appeal of the ruling of such board has lapsed or until such further 
appeal has been exhausted. 
(3) ?The hearing officer shall be bound by the interpretations and decisions of duly authorized city 
boards concerning the provisions of the codes. In the event such a board decides that an 
alleged violation of the ordinance is not in accordance with such boards interpretation of the 
ordinance provision on which the violation is based, the hearing officers shall not be empowered 
to proceed with the enforcement of the violation. 
(p) ?If the owner of property which is subject to an enforcement action or proceeding transfers ownership 
of such property between the time the initial citation or citations were issued and the time of the 
hearing, such owner shall: 
(1) ?Disclose, in writing, the existence and the nature of the proceeding to the prospective 
transferee. 
(2) ?Deliver to the prospective transferee a copy of the pleadings, notices, and other materials 
relating to the code enforcement proceeding received by the transferor. 
(3) ?Disclose, in writing, to the prospective transferee that the new owner will be responsible for 
compliance with the applicable code and with orders issued in the code enforcement 
proceeding. 
(4) ?File a notice with the hearing officer of the transfer of the property, with the identity and address 
of the new owner and copies of the disclosures made to the new owner, within five days of the 
transfer. 
    A failure to make the disclosure described in subsections (p)(1), (2), and (3) above, before the 
transfer creates a rebuttable presumption of fraud. If the property is transferred before the hearing, the 
proceeding shall not be dismissed but the new owner will be added as an additional party of record and 
thereafter shall be provided a reasonable period of time as determined by the code inspector to correct 
the violation before the hearing is held. Continuing violation penalties, if any, shall continue to accrue 
against the original party. No civil penalty or continuing violation penalties shall accrue against the new 
owner until and unless the new owner shall fail to correct the violation within the reasonable period 
provided to the new owner. All parties shall be jointly and severally liable for any penalties up to the 
amount common among them, and the amounts paid the city shall be first applied to that common, joint 
and several amount. 
(Ord. No. 433, 4-19-2004) 


Sec. 42-124. - Recovery of unpaid civil penalties; unpaid penalty to constitute a lien; foreclosure. 
(a) ?The city may institute proceedings in a court of competent jurisdiction to compel payment of civil 
penalties. In an action to compel payment of civil penalties, the prevailing party is entitled to recover 
all costs, including reasonable attorney's fee that it incurred in the action. The city shall be entitled to 
collect all costs incurred in recording and satisfying a valid lien. 
(b) ?A certified copy of an order imposing a civil penalty, or a penalty plus repair costs, may be recorded 
in the public records and thereafter shall constitute a lien against the land on which the violation 
exists or, if the violator does not own the land, upon any other real or personal property owned by the 
violator. Upon petition to the circuit court, such order shall be enforceable in the same manner as a 
court judgment by the sheriffs of the state, including execution and levy against personal property of 
the violator, but such order shall not be deemed a court judgment except for enforcement purposes. 
After three months from the filing of any such lien which remains unpaid, the city may foreclose or 
otherwise execute on the lien. 
(c) ?If an order is recorded in public records, and the order is complied with by the date specified in the 
order, the hearing officer shall issue an order acknowledging compliance that shall be recorded in 
the public records. A hearing is not required to issue such an order acknowledging compliance. 
(d) ?Notwithstanding any provisions of this Code, no municipal officer, agent, employee or board shall 
approve, grant, or issue any operating permit, license, building permit, certificate of use and 
occupancy, occupational licenses, platting action or zoning action to any named violator with: 
(1) ?Unpaid civil penalties; 
(2) ?Unpaid administrative costs of hearing; 
(3) ?Unpaid investigative, enforcement, testing or monitoring costs; or 
(4) ?Unpaid liens, any or all of which are owned to the city pursuant to the provisions of the Code of 
the City of Springfield, Florida. 
(Ord. No. 433, 4-19-2004) 


Sec. 42-125. - Appeals. 
(a) ?The named violator of the city may appeal a final order of the hearing officer for all violations by 
filing notice of appeal in the Circuit Court in and for Bay County, Florida. Such appeal shall not be 
hearing de novo but shall be limited to appellate review of the record created before the hearing 
officer. An appeal shall be filed within 30 days of the execution of the order of the appealed. 
(b) ?Unless the findings of the hearing officer are overturned in a proceeding held pursuant to subsection 
(a) of this section all findings of the hearing officer shall be admissible in any proceeding to collect 
unpaid penalties. 
(Ord. No. 433, 4-19-2004) 


Sec. 42-126. - Adoption of F.S. ch. 162; creation and adoption of a code enforcement hearing officer 
system as authorized in F.S. § 162.22. 
(a) ?The city has adopted F.S. ch. 162 and its provisions and powers in the enforcement of city 
ordinances. Florida Statutes § 162.22 authorizes the city to create and adopt it's own policies, 
procedures and methods in the enforcement of its Codes and Ordinances. 
(b) ?The city, by the adoption of Ordinance No. 381 adopted January 4, 1999, has established a code 
enforcement hearing officer system utilizing a one-person hearing officer through which the decision 
of the code inspector may be appealed. The system sets forth the entire procedure for appointment 
of the hearing officer, length of term, removal, duties, responsibilities and powers. It also sets forth 
the code enforcement procedures, penalties for violations, rights of the violator to appeal, schedule 
and conduct of the hearings and the city's method of recovering unpaid penalties. 
(Ord. No. 433, 4-19-2004) 


Sec. 42-127. - Supplemental provisions. 
    Nothing contained in this provision shall prohibit the city from enforcing its Code by any other means. 
The enforcement procedures outlined herein are cumulative to all others and shall not be deemed to be 
prerequisites to filling suit for the enforcement of any section of this article. 
(Ord. No. 433, 4-19-2004) 


Sec. 42-128. - Schedule of civil penalties. 
    The following table shows the sections of this article, as they may be amended from time to time, 
which may be enforced pursuant to the provisions of this article; and the dollar amount of civil penalty for 
the violation of these sections as they may be amended. 
    The "descriptions of violations" are for informal purposes and are not meant to limit or define the 
nature of the violations or the subject matter of the subject Code sections, except to the extent that the 
different types of violations of the same Code section may carry different civil penalties. For each Code 
section listed in the schedule of civil penalties, the entirety of that section may be enforced by the 
mechanism provided in this article, regardless of whether all activities proscribed or required within that 
particular section are described in the "Description of Violation" column. To determine the exact nature of 
any activity proscribed or required by this Code, the relevant Code section must be examined.

Sec. 49-3. - Regulation of motor vehicle repair shops. 
(a) ?Definitions. As used in this section: 
The City of Springfield adopts the requirements set forth by the State of Florida in F.S. ch. 559,

Customer, department, employee, final estimate, motor vehicles, motor vehicle repair shop,

shops. 
(1) ?The city hereby requires that all motor vehicle repair shops operating inside the city provide all

integrity of its construction. Existing vehicle wrecker, tow or repossession services shall have six 
months in which to comply with the requirements of this section. 
8. ?In no case shall any vehicle be stored on the property of an motor vehicle repair business, 
wrecker, tow or repossession service for longer than 90 days.

only a fraction of their crimes. This makes the cost of sexual offender victimization to the society at 
large, while incalculable, clearly exorbitant.

city's citizens by creating areas around locations where children regularly congregate in 
concentrated numbers, where certain sexual offenders and sexual predators are prohibited from 
establishing a temporary or a permanent residence.

discharge which presents an imminent and substantial danger to the environment, or to the health or 
welfare of persons, or to the MS4 or waters of the state, the authorized enforcement agency shall issue 
an emergency order to the person responsible for the premises or the discharge to suspend all 
discharges as necessary to prevent the imminent and substantial danger. If the person fails to 
immediately comply with the emergency order or if the violator or person responsible for the premises

notice of a proposed suspension, and the expiration of the time to appeal, the authorized enforcement 
agency may suspend access to the MS4, including suspension of a facility's water supply, sewer 
connection, or both, or other reasonable actions to suspend the facility's access to the MS4, if such 
suspension would abate or reduce an illicit discharge. 
(Ord. No. 479, § 2, 12-1-2008)

abatement and remediation of the illicit discharge, including any including any abatement or remediation 
of any damage to the MS4 or waters of the state, and including any administrative and legal fees and 
costs, it shall do so by proceeding either with a nuisance abatement action under chapter 34 of the Code 
of Ordinances of Springfield, Florida, a civil action in a court of law, or both. Any such action shall be in 
addition to the issuance of a notice of violation under this chapter and enforcement of this chapter. If an 
illicit discharge has not been corrected pursuant to the requirements set forth in a notice of violation 
before the time for appeal expires, or, in the event of an appeal, on or before the third business day 
following the date of a decision upholding the existence of a violation, then the authorized enforcement 
agency or its designee may enter the premises and is authorized to take any and all measures necessary 
to abate and remediate the illicit discharge. It shall be unlawful for any person, owner, agent or person in 
possession of any property to refuse to allow the authorized enforcement agency or its designee to enter 
the premises for this purpose. 
(Ord. No. 479, § 2, 12-1-2008)

enforcement agency to seek cumulative remedies or to petition for a preliminary or permanent injunction 
restraining the person from violations or compelling the person to perform abatement or remediation 
including environmental cleanup or restoration or repair to the MS4 of waters of the state. In lieu of 
enforcement proceedings, assessment of penalties, and remedies authorized by this chapter, the

Sec. 70-33. - Posting of numbers. 
    All buildings in the city shall have the assigned building number properly displayed, whether or not 
mail is delivered to such building or property. It shall be the duty of the owner and occupant of each 
building in the city to post the assigned building number on the property in the following manner: 
(1) ?The building number shall be affixed to the front of the building, and to a separate structure in 
front of the building such as a mailbox, post, wall, or fence in such a manner so as to be clearly 
visible and legible to the public or private way on which the building fronts. There shall be no 
objects or vegetation obstructing the visibility of the numbers. 
(2) ?If the building is not visible from the road or street due to it's proximity or due to obscuring by 
vegetation or any other object the address must be posted on the building and at the 
intersection of the building driveway and the road or street where the driveway connects. 
(3) ?If there is no driveway and the building's visibility is obstructed as stated above the address will 
be posted, clearly visible from the street or road on which the number was assigned. Such 
posting shall be securely mounted on a permanently constructed sign, post or wall of sufficient 
size to accommodate the following requirements: 
a. ?On a residential address the numbers shall be no less than four inches in height and a 
corresponding width ratio. Reflective numbers are encouraged. 
b. ?The numerals shall be a highly visible contrast to the immediate background upon which 
they are posted. 
Numerals for all commercial buildings shall be no less than six inches in height and a 
corresponding width ratio. The numerals for a commercial building shall be placed on the 
business sign in front of the commercial building or shopping center as well as on the 
building itself. There shall be no obstruction existing or created which obstructs the view of 
the numerals. 
1. ?Placement of the numerals on individual addresses within a shopping plaza or 
shopping center shall be clearly visible from the parking lot or entrance connecting to 
the road or street on which the number was assigned. The numerals shall be placed 
on or above the front door entrance to the business in order to provide uniformity. 
2. ?Commercial addresses located within a shopping plaza, center or complex shall also 
have their address posted on or above the back entrance door of the business in the 
same manner as stated above. 
c. ?Numbers placed on mailboxes shall be posted on both sides of the mailbox so that the 
numerals are clearly visible from both directions of travel on the street in front of the 
building or property for which the address is posted. The numerals must meet size 
specification. If the mailbox is not in front of the property and on the same side of the road 
or street as the property then posting the mailbox with the address numbers does not 
satisfy this article. If the mailbox for the property is grouped or clumped in a group of other 
mailboxes, including centralized mailboxes, or the address posted on the mailbox is or 
would be obscured, the posting of the address on the mailbox does not satisfy this article. 
If the property's mailbox is used for the posting of address numerals the location of the 
mailbox must clearly indicate which property it belongs to. It is not the intent of this article, 
in the use of mailboxes for posting addresses, to control or interfere with the delivery of 
mail. Any postal regulations concerning the numbering or placement of a mailbox should 
take precedence over modifications made by the owner to satisfy this article. The posting 
of address numerals on mailboxes will satisfy the requirement of this article only if the 
posting is done to the specifications of this article. Numerals of an address must always be 
posted on the primary building of the property.

issuance, renewal or reissuance of an occupational license. All licensed persons, firms or companies 
must comply with the Code of Ordinances established by the city commission which are subject to 
change from time to time. Operating a business other than what's permitted on an issued license is cause 
for revocation and cancellation of any prior issued license and otherwise constitutes a nuisance.

occupation licensed. Prior to issuing a license, the city clerk or designee must verify compliance of 
the business, occupation or profession's location in relation to the city comprehensive plan and land 
development regulations. No license for the privilege of carrying on, engaging or conducting any 
business, occupation, vocation, profession or trade shall be issued, renewed or transferred where 
such activity, or any building or structure used in connection with such activity, is in violation of any 
applicable zoning, building, safety or health code of the city. 
(b) ?Any occupation or business which is operated from a property whose principle use is residential will 
be classified as a "home occupation" and subject to the guidelines and definition given in the city 
comprehensive plan and land development regulation. All licenses issued to occupations and 
businesses classified as "home occupations" will be so annotated in clearly understood print. 
Continuance of the license will be predicated on compliance with all applicable governing codes. In 
order to approve the occupational license application, the city clerk will verify that: 
(1) ?The business activity constitutes a home occupation or a home office of convenience as 
defined in the city land development regulation. 
(2) ?The license application complies with the provisions of this article, the city comprehensive plan, 
the city land development regulations and other applicable law. If the city clerk finds that the 
occupational license application does not comply with the aforementioned, then the application 
shall be disapproved. If the license applicant disagrees with the determination, a written appeal 
can be made within 30 days to the city commission, whose determination shall be final. The city 
clerk or the clerk's designee shall maintain a list of all licenses issued showing the date of 
issuance, the name of the party to whom the license is issued, the number of the license and 
the nature of the home occupation licensed to that applicant. 
(c) ?The city may require proof of compliance with trade and other competency requirements. Failure to 
produce proof will constitute grounds for restriction or withdrawal of the city occupational license for 
that business based on review by the city clerk or city attorney.

location shall contain the name and street address of the business, occupation, profession, vocation 
or trade, the owner of the premises if different from the applicant, a general description of the 
business activity to be conducted and an affirmation by the applicant or his duly authorized 
representative, to the best of his knowledge and belief, that the business activity and any building or 
structure used in connection with such activity, is in compliance with all applicable zoning, building, 
safety or health codes of the city, county and state. Application shall be made upon such forms as 
may be prescribed by the city clerk. 
(e) ?Unless otherwise arranged, new or renewal licenses must be picked up within 30 days or will be 
considered null and void. Reapplication and review will be required. 
(f) ?The provisions of this section shall be cumulative to all other enforcement remedies for zoning, 
building, safety and health codes, and the issuance of any occupational license by the city shall not 
limit or restrict authority of the city to enforce its zoning, building, safety or health codes as otherwise 
provided by law.

year. If September 30 falls on a weekend or holiday, the tax shall be due and payable on or before 
the first working day in October. 
(b) ?Licenses that are not renewed when due and payable are delinquent and subject to a delinquency 
penalty of ten percent for the month of October, plus an additional five percent penalty for each 
subsequent month of delinquency until the end of the calendar year, December 31. However, the 
total delinquency penalty may not exceed 25 percent of the occupational license tax for the 
delinquent establishment. 
(c) ?If a person, corporation, partnership or other business entity owes the city for past due occupational 
license fees, the outstanding fees plus applicable penalties must be paid prior to renewal of the 
license at the rates included in this article. If outstanding fees and penalties are not paid by 
December 31 of the then current year, the license will be considered as canceled, not to be renewed 
without payment of all assessed penalties. Renewal will require resubmission and review according 
to rules in effect at that time.

Sec. 74-45. - Computation of tax based on quantity. 
    When the amount of a license tax is based upon or measured by the amount of floor space, the 
seating capacity, the number of employees, the number of units of equipment, or any other units of 
measurement, the license tax shall be due and payable according to the greatest amount of floor space, 
the highest seating capacity, the greatest number of employees, the greatest number of units of 
equipment, and the greatest number of any other units of measurement, employed or used during any 24 
hour period of the license year. 
(Ord. No. 358, § 12, 3-3-1997) 


Sec. 74-46. - Vending and amusement machines. 
    The business premises where a coin-operated or token-operated vending machine that dispenses 
products, merchandise or services, or where an amusement or game machine is operated must ensure 
that any required occupational license for the machine is secured. The term "vending machine" does not 
include coin-operated telephone sets owned by persons who are in the business of providing local 
exchange telephone service and who pay the occupational license under the category designated for 
telephone companies or a pay telephone service provider certified pursuant to F.S. § 364.3375. The 
license tax for vending and amusement machines must be assessed based on the highest number of 
machines located on the business premises on any single day during the previous licensing year or, in 
the case of new businesses, be based on an estimate for the current year. Replacement of one vending 
machine with another machine during a licensing year does not affect the tax assessment for that year, 
unless the replacement machine belongs to an occupational license tax classification that requires a 
higher tax rate. For the first year in which the city assesses an occupational license tax on vending 
machines, each business owning machines located in the city must notify the city, upon request, of the 
location of such machines. Each business owning machines must provide notice of the provisions of this 
section to each affected business premises where the machines are located. The business premises 
must secure the license if it is not otherwise secured.

construed to be separate places of business, and no license may be levied on such vehicles or the

farm products, or products manufactured therefrom, except intoxicating liquors, wine or beer, when 
such products were grown or produced by such natural person in the state. 
(b) ?A wholesale farmers' produce market shall have the right to pay a tax of not more than $200.00 for

office is maintained, no other local governing authority may levy an occupational license tax, or any

or services on a temporary or transitory basis in another municipality or county. In no event shall any work 
or services performed in a place other than the county or municipality where the permanent business

the seller. The tax collector of the city shall bring all suits and actions and take all proceedings necessary 
for the recovery of such tax; provided, however, that the seller shall not be liable for the payment of such 
tax upon unpaid bills. If any purchaser shall fail, neglect or refuse to pay the seller the tax hereby imposed

open for inspection by the duly authorized agents of the city during business hours on all business days, 
and such agents shall have authority to make such transcripts thereof as they may desire. It shall be the 
duty of each such seller of utility service each month in paying over to the city the tax collected to make 
such reports as may be reasonably required on forms to be furnished by the city commission for that 
purpose. Any such seller of utility service failing to make the required reports and to pay over to the city 
the tax collected during the previous month on or before the tenth day of each month immediately 
following the month in which the tax is collected shall be liable for and, in addition to the tax collected, 
shall pay a penalty at the time of paying the tax and making the report equal to five percent of the tax, for 
each month or part of a month that the report and tax is past due. The penalty provided in this section

(Ord. No. 511, § 1.03, 3-4-2013) 


Sec. 74-204. - Findings. 
    It is hereby ascertained, determined, and declared that: 
(1) ?Pursuant to article VIII, section 2(b) of the Florida Constitution, and F.S. §§ 166.021 and 
166.041, the city commission has all powers of local self-government to perform municipal 
functions and render municipal services except when prohibited by law and such power may be 
exercised by the enactment of city ordinances. 
(2) ?The city commission may exercise any governmental, corporate, or proprietary power for a 
municipal purpose except when expressly prohibited by law, and the city commission may 
legislate on any subject matter on which the Florida Legislature may act, except those subjects 
described in (a), (b), (c), and (d) of F.S. § 166.021(3). The subject matter of paragraphs (a), (b), 
(c), and (d) of F.S. § 166.021(3), are not relevant to the imposition of assessments related to fire 
protection services, facilities or programs. 
(3) ?The special benefits to affected lands provided as a result of an assessment include by way of 
example and not limitation, the continual availability of fire protection services to each tax parcel 
within the city, protection of public safety, stable or decreasing insurance costs, a potential 
increase in value to property, and an assured level of service to landowners and tenants. 
(4) ?The constant and continued preparedness to provide fire protection services, facilities and 
programs possess a logical relationship to the value, use and enjoyment of real property by: (1) 
protecting the value of the improvements and structures through the continual availability of fire 
control and provision of fire protection and associated rescue services; (2) protecting the life 
and safety of intended occupants in the use and enjoyment of real property; (3) lowering the 
cost of casualty or liability insurance by the presence of a professional fire protection and 
associated rescue program within the city; (4) providing protection for uninsured or 
underinsured property and property owners; and (5) containing the spread of fire incidents, 
sometimes occurring on vacant or undeveloped property, with the potential to spread and 
endanger the structures and occupants of nearby improved property, thereby limiting liability. 
(5) ?The combined fire control and associated basic life support emergency medical services of the 
city under its existing fire protection program enhances and strengthens the relationship of such 
services to the value, use and enjoyment of the parcels of property within the city. 
(F) ?The assessment imposed pursuant to this article is imposed by the city commission, not the 
property appraiser or tax collector. Any activity of the property appraiser or tax collector under 
the provisions of this article shall be construed as ministerial. 
(6) ?The annual assessments to be imposed pursuant to this article are special assessments and 
may also constitute and be described as non-ad valorem assessments within the meaning and 
intent of the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. 
(7) ?The purpose of this article is to: (1) provide procedures and standards for the imposition of city-
wide assessments under the home rule powers of a municipality to impose special 
assessments, (2) authorize procedures for the funding and financing of fire protection services, 
facilities, or programs providing special benefits to property within the city, and (3) establish a 
revenue or tax equity tool for funding fire protection services, facilities and programs, reduce 
demand on other legally available funds, allow for local policy discretion as difficult overall 
budget choices are made by the city commission each year, and give the community a more 
equitable, balanced, sustainable and dedicated means of funding essential fire protection 
related services and capital improvements.

or programs. For purposes of this article, references to "benefit," "special benefit," "benefited 
property" or the like also include the relief of a burden to continually stand in readiness created by 
real property as well as improvements thereon. All assessments shall be imposed in conformity with 
the procedures set forth in this article II. 
(b) ?The amount of the annual assessment imposed each fiscal year against each parcel of assessed 
property shall be determined pursuant to an apportionment methodology based upon a fair and 
reasonable apportionment of the fire service assessed cost among properties on a basis reasonably 
related to the special benefit provided by the availability of fire protection services, facilities, or 
programs funded with assessment proceeds. The amount of the annual assessment imposed each 
fiscal year shall include administration and collection costs associated with the annual assessment. 
In the event the assessments are collected pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, the 
amount of the annual assessment will also include fees imposed by the property appraiser and tax 
collector and will be adjusted as necessary to account for any statutory discounts which are 
necessitated when employing the efficiencies of collecting the assessments annually on the same bill 
as property taxes. Nothing contained in this article shall be construed to require the imposition of 
assessments against government property. 
(Ord. No. 511, § 2.01, 3-4-2013) 


Sec. 74-212. - Proceedings. 
    The proceedings for the imposition of an assessment shall include a public hearing noticed in the 
manner set forth in section 74-214 hereof, and the adoption at or anytime thereafter of an annual 
assessment resolution which shall (a) contain a brief and general description of the fire protection 
services, facilities or programs to be provided or made available, (b) describe the method or methods of 
apportioning the fire service assessed cost among affected tax parcels, (c) describe the tax parcels, if 
any, to be exempted from the fire service assessment for legal or public policy purposes, (d) identify the 
rate or rates of assessment and approve and adopt the annual assessment roll, consistent with the 
requirements of section 74-213 hereof, and (e) determine the method of collecting the fire service 
assessment. 
(Ord. No. 511, § 2.02, 3-4-2013) 


Sec. 74-213. - Assessment roll. 
(a) ?The assessment coordinator shall prepare, or direct the preparation of, the assessment roll, which 
shall contain the following: 
(1) ?A summary description of all assessed property by tax parcel conforming to the description 
contained on the tax roll. 
(2) ?The name of the owner of the assessed property. 
(3) ?The extension or application of the rates of the proposed assessment to be imposed against 
each such tax parcel of assessed property. 
(b) ?The assessment roll shall be retained by the assessment coordinator and shall be open to public 
inspection. The foregoing shall not be construed to require that the assessment roll be in printed 
form if the amount of the assessment for each tax parcel of property can be determined by use of the 
internet, a computer terminal available to the public or similar technology available to the public. 
(Ord. No. 511, § 2.03, 3-4-2013) 


Sec. 74-214. - Notice. 
    At least 20 days prior to the public hearing, the city shall notice the public hearing by publication in a 
newspaper generally circulated within the boundaries of the city. The notice shall provide the date, time 
and place of the hearing. The notice shall contain a general statement that the city commission will 
consider imposing a special assessment throughout the city on the various parcels of property within the 
city to fund all or a portion of the cost to continually be available and stand ready to provide fire protection 
services, facilities and programs, the proposed rates or explanation of the schedule of assessments and 
include general information pertaining to the proposed apportionment methodology, the method of 
collection and a statement that all affected property owners have a right to appear at the public hearing 
and the right to file written objections within 20 days of the publication of the notice. The notice shall direct 
all interested persons to the assessment roll and information concerning the amount of the proposed 
assessment applicable to each parcel of property; provided, however, that such assessment roll need not 
be in printed form if the amount of the assessment for each parcel of property can be determined by use 
of the internet, a computer terminal available to the public, or similar technology available to the public. 
(Ord. No. 511, § 2.04, 3-4-2013) 


Sec. 74-215. - Annual assessment resolution. 
    At the time named in such notice, or to which an adjournment or continuance may be taken by the 
city commission, the city commission shall receive any written comments or objections of interested 
persons and may then, or at any subsequent meeting of the city commission, adopt the annual 
assessment resolution which shall (a) establish the rate or rates of assessment to be imposed in the 
designated fiscal year; (b) approve and adopt the assessment roll, with such amendments and directions 
as it deems just and right; and (c) provide direction as to the method of collection. All parcels assessed 
shall derive a special benefit from the fire protection services, facilities, or programs to be provided or 
constructed and the assessment shall be fairly and reasonably apportioned between the properties that 
receive the special benefit. All objections to the annual assessment resolution shall be made in writing, 
and filed with the assessment coordinator at or before the time or adjourned time of such hearing. The 
annual assessment resolution as confirmed shall constitute the final action necessary annually to impose 
or re-impose assessments hereunder. 
(Ord. No. 511, § 2.05, 3-4-2013) 


Sec. 74-216. - Effect of annual assessment resolution. 
    The assessments for the initial fiscal year and each subsequent fiscal year shall be established upon 
adoption and confirmation of the annual assessment resolution. The adoption and confirmation of the 
annual assessment resolution shall be the final adjudication of the issues presented (including, but not 
limited to, the method of apportionment and assessment, the rate or rates of assessment, the 
assessment roll, and the levy and lien of the assessments), unless proper steps shall be initiated in a 
court of competent jurisdiction to secure relief within 20 days from the date of the city commission action 
adopting and confirming on the annual assessment resolution. The initial assessment roll, as approved by 
the annual assessment resolution, shall be delivered for collection using the traditional direct billing 
method of collection described in section 74-232 hereof to collect the assessments, or such other method 
as the city commission by resolution shall designate. 
(Ord. No. 511, § 2.06, 3-4-2013) 


Sec. 74-217. - Adoption of subsequent annual assessment resolutions. 
    The city commission may adopt subsequent annual assessment resolutions as a part of and during 
its budget adoption process for each fiscal year following the initial fiscal year for which an assessment is 
imposed hereunder. The annual assessment resolution shall approve the assessment roll for the 
upcoming fiscal year. The assessment roll may be prepared in accordance with the methods of 
apportionment set forth in the prior assessment resolution but may include modifications as a matter of 
policy as to what, if any, portion or portions of the city's budget is paid for from legally available funds 
other than assessment revenues. Failure to adopt an annual assessment resolution during the budget 
adoption process may be cured at any time. 
(Ord. No. 511, § 2.07, 3-4-2013) 


Sec. 74-218. - Alternative use of Uniform Assessment Collection Act. 
(a) ?The city may determine to use the uniform method of collection provided for in the Uniform 
Assessment Collection Act; provided, however that all of the extraordinary procedures required by 
the Uniform Assessment Collection Act can be and are timely complied with. 
(b) ?In the event the uniform method of collection provided for in the Uniform Assessment Collection Act 
is determined to be used, the assessment coordinator shall publish notice which shall conform to the 
requirements set forth in the Uniform Assessment Collection Act and, in addition to the requirements 
set forth in this article, the assessment coordinator shall provide notice of the proposed assessment 
by first class mail to the owner of each parcel of property subject to the assessment which shall 
conform to the requirements set forth in the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. Such mailed notice 
may be provided by including the assessment in the property appraiser's notice of proposed property 
taxes and proposed or adopted non-ad valorem assessments under F.S. § 200.069, or its successor 
in function. The assessment coordinator may provide proof of such notice by affidavit. Failure of the 
owner to receive notice due to mistake or inadvertence shall nevertheless not affect the validity of 
the assessment roll nor release or discharge any obligation for payment of an assessment imposed 
by the city commission pursuant to this article. 
(c) ?The city commission may also establish by resolution or directive such reasonable procedures or 
directions to confirm and comply with the Uniform Assessment Collection Act as may be practicable 
and necessary. 
(d) ?Nothing herein shall preclude the city commission from establishing by resolution a maximum rate of 
assessment provided that notice of such maximum assessment rate is provided pursuant to the 
Uniform Assessment Collection Act. In the event that the uniform method of collection provided for in 
the Uniform Assessment Collection Act is used and (1) the proposed assessment for any fiscal year 
exceeds the maximum rate of assessment adopted by the city commission and included in notice 
previously provided to the owners of assessed property pursuant to the Uniform Assessment 
Collection Act, (2) the method of apportionment is changed or the purpose for which the assessment 
is imposed is substantially changed from that represented by notice previously provided to the 
owners of assessed property pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, (3) assessed 
property is reclassified in a manner which results in an increased assessment from that represented 
by notice previously provided to the owners of assessed property pursuant to the Uniform 
Assessment Collection Act, or (4) an assessment roll contains assessed property that was not 
included on the assessment roll approved for the prior fiscal year, notice and opportunity to be heard 
shall be provided to the owners of such assessed property. Such notice shall substantially conform 
to the notice requirements set forth in the Uniform Assessment Collection Act and inform the owner 
of the time, date and place for adoption of the annual assessment resolution. The failure of the 
owner to receive such notice due to mistake or inadvertence shall not affect the validity of the 
assessment roll nor release or discharge any obligation for payment of an assessment imposed by 
the city commission pursuant to this article. 
(e) ?The assessment roll, as approved by the annual assessment resolution, shall be certified and 
delivered to the tax collector as required by the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. 
(Ord. No. 511, § 2.08, 3-4-2013) 


Sec. 74-219. - Lien of fire service assessments. 
    Upon the adoption of the assessment roll, all assessments shall constitute a lien against such 
property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district, or municipal taxes and special 
assessments. Except as otherwise provided by law, until paid such lien shall be superior in dignity to all 
other prior liens, mortgages, titles, and claims. The lien for an assessment shall be deemed perfected 
upon adoption by the city commission of the annual assessment resolution. The lien for an assessment 
collected under the uniform assessment collection method shall attach to the property included on the 
assessment roll as of the prior January 1, the lien date for ad valorem taxes imposed under the tax roll. 
The lien for an assessment collected under the traditional method of collection provided in section 74-232 
hereof shall be deemed perfected upon adoption and confirmation by the city commission of the annual 
assessment resolution, after a public hearing, and shall attach to the property on such date of each such 
annual assessment resolution. 
(Ord. No. 511, § 2.09, 3-4-2013) 


Sec. 74-220. - Revisions to fire service assessments. 
    If any assessment made under the provisions of this article is either in whole or in part annulled, 
vacated, or set aside by the judgment of any court, or if the city commission is satisfied that any such 
assessment is so irregular or defective that the same cannot be enforced or collected, or if the city 
commission has omitted any property on the assessment roll which property should have been so 
included, the city commission may take all necessary steps to impose a new assessment against any 
property benefited by the fire service assessed costs, following as nearly as may be practicable, the 
provisions of this article and in case such second assessment is annulled, vacated, or set aside, the city 
commission may obtain and impose other assessments until a valid assessment is imposed. 
(Ord. No. 511, § 2.10, 3-4-2013) 


Sec. 74-221. - Procedural irregularities. 
    Any informality or irregularity in the proceedings in connection with the levy of any assessment under 
the provisions of this article shall not affect the validity of the same after the approval thereof, and any 
assessment as finally approved shall be competent and sufficient evidence that such assessment was 
duly levied, that the assessment was duly made and adopted, and that all other proceedings adequate to 
such assessment were duly had, taken, and performed as required by this article; and no variance from 
the directions hereunder shall be held material unless it be clearly shown that the party objecting was 
materially injured thereby. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, any party objecting to an 
assessment imposed pursuant to this article must file an objection with a court of competent jurisdiction 
within the time periods prescribed herein. 
(Ord. No. 511, § 2.11, 3-4-2013) 


Sec. 74-222. - Correction of errors and omissions. 
(a) ?No act of error or omission on the part of the property appraiser, tax collector, assessment 
coordinator, city commission, or their deputies, employees, or agents shall operate to release or 
discharge any obligation for payment of an assessment imposed by the city commission under the 
provision of this article. 
(b) ?When it shall appear that any assessment should have been imposed under this article against a 
parcel of property specially benefited by the provision of fire protection services, facilities, or 
programs, but that such property was omitted from the assessment roll, the city commission may, 
upon provision of notice to the owner by first class mail, impose the applicable assessment for the 
fiscal year in which such error is discovered, in addition to the applicable assessment due for the 
prior two fiscal years. Such total assessment shall become delinquent if not fully paid upon the 
expiration of 60 days from the date of the adoption of said resolution. The assessment so imposed 
shall constitute a lien against such property equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, 
county, district, or municipal taxes and special assessments, and superior in rank and dignity to all 
other prior liens, mortgages, titles and claims in and to or against the real property involved and may 
be collected as provided in article III hereof. 
(c) ?The assessment coordinator shall have the authority at any time, upon his or her own initiative or in 
response to a timely filed petition from the owner of any property subject to an assessment, based 
upon presentation of competent and substantial evidence, to correct any error in annually applying 
the assessment apportionment method to any particular parcel of property not otherwise requiring 
the provision of mailed notice pursuant to this article or the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. 
Additionally, because the size and nature of the tax roll may yield anomalies, the assessment 
coordinator is authorized to apply sound public administration judgment and delete or remove 
individual tax parcels from the assessment roll that due to specific circumstances do not receive a 
special benefit, are not developable (e.g., subsurface rights, submerged, slivers, right-of-way, 
common elements) or are reasonably determined to be inappropriate, infeasible or impracticable to 
assess, and do not merit the expenditure of public funds and resources to impose or collect such 
assessments. Unless the assessment coordinator determines that a tax parcel does receive benefit, 
for any tax parcel with a just value of less than $1,000.00 (as determined solely by the property 
appraiser), such value may be used as a prima facie determination that the tax parcel need not be 
included on the assessment roll. Any such corrections shall be considered valid ab initio and shall in 
no way affect the enforcement of the assessment imposed under the provisions of this article. All 
requests from affected property owners for any such changes, modifications or corrections shall be 
referred to, and processed by, the assessment coordinator and not the property appraiser or tax 
collector. 
(d) ?After the assessment roll has been delivered to the tax collector in accordance with the Uniform 
Assessment Collection Act, any changes, modifications, or corrections thereto shall be made in 
accordance with the procedures applicable to correcting errors and insolvencies on the tax roll upon 
timely written request and direction of the assessment coordinator. 
(Ord. No. 511, § 2.12, 3-4-2013) 


Sec. 74-223. - Interim assessments. 
(a) ?An interim assessment shall be imposed against all property for which a certificate of occupancy is 
issued after adoption and confirmation of the annual assessment resolution. The amount of the 
interim assessment shall be calculated upon a monthly rate, which shall be one-twelfth of the annual 
rate for such property computed in accordance with the annual assessment resolution for the fiscal 
year in which the certificate of occupancy is issued. Such monthly rate shall be imposed for each full 
calendar month remaining in the fiscal year. In addition to the monthly rate, the interim assessment 
shall also include an estimate of the subsequent year's assessment. No certificate of occupancy 
shall be issued until full payment of the interim assessment is received by the city. Issuance of the 
certificate of occupancy by mistake or inadvertence, and without the payment in full of the interim 
assessment, shall not relieve the owner of such property of the obligation of full payment. For the 
purpose of this provision, such interim assessment shall be deemed due and payable on the date the 
certificate of occupancy was issued and shall constitute a lien against such property as of that date. 
Said lien shall be equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district or municipal 
taxes and special assessments, and superior in rank and dignity to all other liens, encumbrances, 
titles and claims in and to or against the real property involved. 
(b) ?Exclusive of property for which an interim assessment was paid pursuant to subsection (a) hereof, 
an interim assessment shall also be imposed against any property which for any reason was omitted 
from the fire service assessment roll or was not listed on the tax roll as an individual tax parcel as of 
the effective date of the assessment roll approved by the annual assessment resolution for any 
upcoming fiscal year. For the purpose of this provision, such interim assessment shall be deemed 
due and payable and shall constitute a lien against such property for which it is imposed. Said lien 
shall be equal in rank and dignity with the liens of all state, county, district or municipal taxes and 
special assessments, and superior in rank and dignity to all other liens, encumbrances, titles and 
claims in and to or against the real property involved. 
(Ord. No. 511, § 2.13, 3-4-2013) 


Sec. 74-224. - Administrative hardship deferment. 
(a) ?Annually upon application of the owner of a tax parcel subject to the assessments contemplated 
herein, the assessment coordinator may grant a hardship deferment, in which case the tax parcel in 
question will receive a deferral. The owner shall be required to execute a binding agreement 
encumbering the tax parcel and otherwise assure the city that payment in full of the assessment and 
any recording cost, plus interest at an estimated cost of city funds compounded annually, shall be 
due over a period of time or upon sale or transfer of the property. Such agreement or a 
memorandum thereof shall be recorded in the official records of Bay County, Florida. Dependent 
upon the volume or demand for such deferment, the city commission may determine to release such 
deferments in the future. However, all funding for such hardship deferment, or the consequences of 
the deferment or any future release, shall be from legally available funds other than direct proceeds 
of other assessments. The assessment coordinator is authorized to use sound public administration 
judgment in applying this authority and considering such applications. 
(b) ?This provision serves to promote a public purpose and the general welfare, morals and contentment 
of the inhabitants and residents of the city.

DIVISION 3. - COLLECTION OF FIRE SERVICE ASSESSMENTS 


Sec. 74-231. - Collection. 
(a) ?The process of collection is driven by many equitable, practical and economic factors. The 
traditional direct billing method is initially far less expensive and provides fair and adequate notice 
and opportunity to be heard through publication in a newspaper of general circulation. The uniform 
method of collection additionally provides extraordinary notice by individual mailing, but such notice 
is many times more expensive than published notice. The individually mailed notice required by the 
Uniform Assessment Collection Act is extraordinary and unique to collection of an assessment 
occurring along with and included on the same bill as for ad valorem taxes. 
(b) ?Unless otherwise directed by the city commission, the assessments shall be collected pursuant to 
the traditional direct billing method provided in section 74-232 hereof. Any hearing or notice required 
by this article may be combined with any other hearing or notice required by this article or the 
Uniform Assessment Collection Act. 
(Ord. No. 511, § 3.01, 3-4-2013) 


Sec. 74-232. - Traditional method of collection. 
    The city may elect to collect the assessments by any other method which is authorized by law or 
provided by this section as follows: 
(a) ?The city shall provide assessment bills by first class mail to the owner of each affected parcel of 
property, other than government property. The bill or accompanying explanatory material shall 
include (1) a brief explanation of the assessment, (2) a description of the unit of measurement or 
method used to determine the amount of the assessment, (3) the number of units contained within 
the tax parcel, (4) the rate or rates applied to the units of measurement or method and the total 
amount of the assessment imposed against the tax parcel for the appropriate period, (5) the location 
at which payment will be accepted, (6) the date on which the assessment is due, and (7) a statement 
that the assessment constitutes a lien against assessed property equal in rank and dignity with the 
liens of all state, county, district or municipal taxes and other non-ad valorem assessments. 
(b) ?A general notice of the lien resulting from imposition of the assessments throughout the city may be 
recorded in the official records of the county. Nothing herein shall be construed to require that 
individual liens or releases be filed in the official records. 
(c) ?The city shall have the right to appoint or retain an agent to foreclose and collect all delinquent 
assessments in any manner provided by law. 
(d) ?An assessment shall become delinquent if it is not paid within 30 days from the date any installment 
is due. The city or its agent shall notify any property owner who is delinquent in payment of his or her 
assessment within 90 days from the date such assessment was due. Such notice shall state in effect 
that the city or its agent may either (1) initiate a foreclosure action or suit in equity and cause the 
foreclosure of such property subject to a delinquent assessment in a method now or hereafter 
provided by law for foreclosure of mortgages on real property; or (2) cause an amount equivalent to 
the delinquent assessment, not previously subject to collection using the uniform method under the 
Uniform Assessment Collection Act, to be collected on the tax bill for a subsequent year. 
(e) ?All costs, fees and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and title search expenses, related 
to any foreclosure action as described herein shall be included in any judgment or decree rendered 
therein. At the sale pursuant to decree in any such action, the city may be the purchaser to the same 
extent as an individual person or corporation. The city may join in one foreclosure action the 
collection of assessments against any or all property assessed in accordance with the provisions 
hereof. All delinquent owners whose property is foreclosed shall be liable for an apportioned amount 
of reasonable costs and expenses incurred by the city and its agents, including reasonable attorney 
fees, in collection of such delinquent assessments and any other costs incurred by the city as a 
result of such delinquent assessments and the same shall be collectible as a part of or in addition to, 
the costs of the action. 
(f) ?In lieu of foreclosure, any delinquent assessment and the costs, fees and expenses otherwise 
reasonably attributable thereto, may be collected subsequently pursuant to the Uniform Assessment 
Collection Act; provided however, that (1) notice is provided to the owner in the manner required by 
the Uniform Assessment Collection Act and this article, and (2) any existing lien of record on the 
affected parcel for the delinquent assessment is supplanted by the lien resulting from certification of 
the assessment roll, as applicable, to the tax collector. 
(g) ?Any city commission action required in the collection of assessments may be by resolution. 
(Ord. No. 511, § 3.02, 3-4-2013) 


Sec. 74-233. - Uniform method of collection. 
(a) ?In lieu of utilizing any other method of collection available to the city, the city may elect to collect 
assessments using the uniform method pursuant to the Uniform Assessment Collection Act; and, for 
any specific parcel of benefitted property may include an amount equivalent to the payment 
delinquency, delinquency fees and expenses and recording costs for a prior year's assessment for a 
comparable service, facility, or program provided, (1) the collection method used in connection with 
the prior year's assessment did not employ the use of the uniform method of collection authorized by 
the Uniform Assessment Collection Act, (2) notice is provided to the owner, and (3) any lien on the 
affected parcel for the prior year's assessment is supplanted and transferred to such assessment 
upon certification of a non-ad valorem roll to the tax collector by the city. 
(b) ?If the city commission determines the assessments are to be collected on the same bill as for ad 
valorem taxes, then the assessment coordinator shall comply and conform to the extraordinary 
requirements of the Uniform Assessment Collection Act. 
(Ord. No. 511, § 3.03, 3-4-2013) 


Sec. 74-234. - Government property. 
(a) ?To the extent permitted by law, the city reserves the right to impose a charge or fee comparable in 
amount to assessments on governmental property. As used in this section, the context of the term 
"assessment" shall refer to such a charge or fee. If assessments are imposed against government 
property, the city shall provide assessment bills by first class mail to the owner or agent of each 
affected parcel of government property. The bill or accompanying explanatory material shall include 
(1) a brief explanation of the assessment, (2) a description of the unit of measurement used to 
determine the amount of the assessment, (3) the number of units contained within the tax parcel, (4) 
the rate or rates applicable to the units of measurement or method and the total amount of the 
assessment imposed against the tax parcel for the appropriate period, (5) the location at which 
payment will be accepted, and (6) the date on which the assessment is due. 
(b) ?Assessments imposed against government property shall be due on the same date as all other 
assessments and, if applicable, shall be subject to the same discounts for early payment. 
(c) ?An assessment shall become delinquent if it is not paid within 30 days from the date any installment 
is due. The city shall notify the owner of any government property that is delinquent in payment of its 
assessment within 90 days from the date such assessment was due. Such notice shall state that the 
city will initiate a mandamus or other appropriate judicial action to compel payment. 
(d) ?All costs, fees and expenses, including reasonable attorney fees and title search expenses, related 
to any mandamus or other action as described herein shall be included in any judgment or decree 
rendered therein. All delinquent owners of government property against which a mandamus or other 
appropriate action is filed shall be liable for an apportioned amount of reasonable costs and 
expenses incurred by the city, including reasonable attorney fees, in collection of such delinquent 
assessments and any other costs incurred by the city as a result of such delinquent assessments 
and the same shall be collectible as a part of or in addition to, the costs of the action. 
(e) ?As an alternative to the foregoing, an assessment imposed against government property may be 
collected as a surcharge on a utility bill provided to such government property in 12 installments with 
a remedy of a mandamus action in the event of non-payment. The city commission may also 
contract for such billing services with any utility not otherwise owned by the city.

DIVISION 4. - ISSUANCE OF OBLIGATIONS 


Sec. 74-241. - General authority. 
(a) ?The city commission shall have the power and is hereby authorized to provide by ordinance or 
resolution, at one time or from time to time in series, for the issuance of obligations to fund and 
finance fire protection facilities and equipment and any amounts to be paid or accrued in connection 
with issuance of such obligations including, but not limited to, capitalized interest, transaction costs 
and reserve account deposits. 
(b) ?The principal of and interest on each series of obligations shall be payable from pledged revenue. 
The city commission may agree, by ordinance or resolution, to budget and appropriate funds to 
make up any deficiency in the reserve account established for the obligations or in the payment of 
the obligations, from other non-ad valorem revenue sources. The city commission may also provide, 
by ordinance or resolution, for a pledge of or lien upon proceeds of such non-ad valorem revenue 
sources for the benefit of the holders of the obligations. Any such ordinance or resolution shall 
determine the nature and extent of any pledge of or lien upon proceeds of such non-ad valorem 
revenue sources.

Sec. 74-242. - Terms of the obligations. 
    The obligations shall be dated, shall bear interest at such rate or rates, shall mature at such times as 
may be determined by ordinance or resolution of the city commission, and may be made redeemable 
before maturity, at the option of the city, at such price or prices and under such terms and conditions, all 
as may be fixed by the city commission. Said obligations shall mature not later than 40 years after their 
issuance. The city commission shall determine by ordinance or resolution the form of the obligations, the 
manner of executing such obligations, and shall fix the denominations of such obligations, the place or 
places of payment of the principal and interest, which may be at any bank or trust company within or 
outside of the State of Florida, and such other terms and provisions of the obligations as it deems 
appropriate. The obligations may be sold at public or private sale for such price or prices as the city 
commission shall determine by ordinance or resolution. The obligations may be delivered to any 
contractor to pay for the provision of fire protection facilities and equipment or may be sold in such 
manner and for such price as the city commission may determine by ordinance or resolution to be for the 
best interests of the city.

Sec. 74-244. - Temporary obligations. 
    Prior to the preparation of definitive obligations of any series, the city commission may, under like

the owner's expense and the owner has not paid the penalty prescribed in the notice the penalty 
assessment shall continue as set forth in chapter 42, article III, division 3.

prior to removal by the towing service. 
b. ?The vehicle will be stored, at the owner's expense, at a secured facility provided by the

upon the public right-of-way or upon private property in violation of this article the action will be 
deemed a repeat violation and the code inspector shall proceed as in section 42-121(d) and in 
addition to towing of said vehicle the code inspector may issue a notice of civil violation for a 
repeat violation wherein the penalty is double that of the first penalty as prescribed in chapter

Sec. 82-215. - Enforcement procedures. 
    If any waters or wastes are discharged, or are proposed to be discharged to the public sewers, which 
waters contain the substances or possess the characteristics enumerated in section 82-214, and which in 
the judgment of the city, may have a deleterious effect upon the sewage works, processes, equipment or 
receiving waters, or which otherwise create a hazard to life or constitute a public nuisance, the city may: 
(1) ?Reject the wastes; 
(2) ?Require pretreatment to an acceptable condition for discharge to the public sewers; 
(3) ?Require control over the quantities and rates of discharge; and/or 
(4) ?Require payment to cover the added cost of handling and treating the wastes not covered by 
existing taxes or sewer charges under the provisions of section 82-220.

the Examination of Water and Wastewater," published by the American Public Health Association, and 
shall be determined at the control manhole provided, or upon suitable samples taken at said control 
manhole. If no special manhole has been required, the control manhole shall be considered to be the 
nearest downstream manhole in the public sewer to the point at which the building sewer is connected. 
Sampling shall be carried out by customarily accepted methods to reflect the effect of constituents upon 
the sewage works and to determine the existence of hazards to life, limb and property. The particular 
analyses involved will determine whether a 24-hour composite of all outfalls of a premises is appropriate 
or whether grab samples should be taken. Normally, but not always, BOD and suspended solid analyses 
are obtained from 24-hour composites of all outfalls whereas pH's are determined from periodic grab 
samples.

Sec. 82-241. - Levy and assessment; collection; enumeration. 
    Charges and assessments are hereby levied and assessed by the city to be collected by the city, 
payable to the city for services to resident and nonresident users of the municipal sewer lines, mains and 
laterals for the disposal of wastewater provided by the city to those residences and commercial and 
industrial establishments which are connected with the sewer system, which charges are designated in 
this section. The users shall pay for such services the sums so designated at the same time as the 
payment for water services shall be made, as provided by the ordinances of the city, and which charges 
shall be assessed upon the water bill of all users. The user shall pay such charges as set forth in this 
section as follows: 
(1) ?Each residential user shall pay a base charge independent of volume of water consumed, of at 
least $5.20 per month and an additive charge based on metered volume of water consumed of 
at least $1.20 per 1,000 gallons, subject to a maximum residential billing for 15,000 gallons and 
minimum of 4,000 gallons monthly. Actual rates shall be established by resolution. 
(2) ?For purposes of determining residential sewer charges in the winter months of December 
through February, each user's water consumption shall be taken as that metered water volume 
properly billed during the current month. 
(3) ?For purposes of determining residential sewer charges in the nonwinter months of March 
through November, each user's water consumption shall be taken as the average metered 
volume properly billed in the preceding winter months (December through February). 
(4) ?For those residential users initially served during nonwinter months (March through November) 
for whom no prior winter consumption figures are available, charges during the initial nonwinter 
period of service shall be determined based on an estimated volume of 75 percent of the 
metered volume properly billed for the current month. Residential users are those defined as 
generating only domestic waste. 
(5) ?Multiple residential units that have individual meters for each unit are considered as residential 
users and are limited to the maximum residential billing of 15,000 gallons per month per meter. 
However, if served by a master meter, they are not subject to the maximum billing of 15,000 
gallons per month. 
(Ord. No. 248, art. V, § 1, 8-25-1981) 


Sec. 82-242. - Base and additive charges for commercial and industrial users; exceptions; surcharge 
calculation. 
(a) ?Each commercial and industrial user, which shall include all establishments classified in the United 
States, Office of Management and Budget, Standard Industrial Classification Manual, 1972, and 
which are not residential users, shall pay a base charge independent of water volume consumed of 
$5.20 per month. The additive charge based on metered volume of water consumed by each class 
per 1,000 gallons per month is $1.20 per 1,000 gallons, per month. These users are also subject to 
additional charges to be determined by the city for pollutants in excess of normal wastewater. 
Governmental buildings (other than hospitals), schools, churches or other eleemosynary institutions 
are excluded as commercial or industrial users and shall be treated as residential users, but shall not 
be subject to the 15,000 gallons per month maximum. 
(b) ?For the purpose of ensuring a proportional distribution of operation and maintenance cost to each 
user, commercial and industrial users shall be subject to a surcharge for discharging wastewater 
which is defined as having the following concentrations (milligrams per liter - mg/l): 
(1) ?Biochemical oxygen demand at five days at 20 degrees Celsius, abbreviated BOD 5 - 250 mg/l; 
and 
(2) ?Total suspended solids, abbreviated TSS - 220 mg/l. 
(c) ?Each commercial and industrial user that is determined to discharge wastewater having pollutants in 
excess of normal wastewater shall pay a charge dependent on water volume consumed or 
wastewater discharged and measured by a wastewater flow meter. These pollutant surcharges are 
as follows: 
(1) ?BOD 5 $0.228 per pound/month 
(2) ?TSS $0.341 per pound/month 
(d) ?Pollutants in excess of normal wastewater shall be determined from periodic laboratory analysis of 
the user's wastewater. Laboratory analysis of the wastewater shall be conducted as outlined in the 
latest publication of the Standard Methods for the Examination of Water and Wastewater, or 
American Society for Testing and Materials, part 31, Water, or the U.S. Environmental Protection 
Agency Methods. 
(e) ?If a commercial or industrial user discharges certain wastes containing inordinate oxygen 
demanding substances, the city reserves the right to substitute a chemical oxygen demand (COD) or 
total organic carbon (TOC) test instead of BOD 5 . An evaluation of the user's discharge and the cost 
of treatment will be established for such substances. If an industrial user chooses or elects to use 
COD, the equivalent domestic waste level is 583 mg/l. If an industrial user requests to use TOC, then 
his proposed methodology shall be submitted to the city for approval prior to it being used as a basis 
for charging for this particular pollutant. It shall be the responsibility of all industrials and any 
commercial customer to notify the city of changes in the pollutant and contribution of their 
wastewater. 
(f) ?For purposes of determining commercial and industrial sewer charges, each user's water 
consumption or wastewater discharged and measured by a wastewater flow meter shall be taken as 
that metered water volume consumed during the current month. 
(g) ?If commercial or industrial users can prove to the satisfaction of the city that substantial amounts of 
metered water do not enter the wastewater collection system, the sewer bill will be reduced 
accordingly. 
(h) ?Commercial and industrial users may be served by separate agreement with the city for wastewater 
services.

non-ad valorem assessment roll as provided by F.S. § 197.3632(4), and give all statutory notices for 
the hearing. The commission shall adopt a rate resolution prior to adopting the non-ad valorem 
assessment roll. The rate resolution may be considered at the same public hearing set to adopting

Sec. 82-289. - Adjustment of fees. 
(a) ?Request for adjustment of the utility fee shall be submitted to the director who is hereby given the 
authority to develop and administer the procedures and standards for the adjustment of fees as 
established herein. All requests shall be judged on the basis of the amount of impervious area on the 
site. No credit shall be given for the installation of facilities required by city development codes or 
state stormwater rules. The following procedures shall apply to all adjustment requests of the 
stormwater fee: 
(1) ?Any owner who has paid his utility fees and who believes his utility fee to be incorrect may, 
subject to the limitations set forth in this article, submit an adjustment request to the director. 
(2) ?Adjustment requests for the utility fees shall be in writing and must set forth, in detail, the 
grounds upon which relief is sought. 
(3) ?Adjustment requests made during the first calendar year that the utility fee is imposed will be 
reviewed by the director within a two-month period from the date of filing of the adjustment 
request. Adjustments resulting from such request shall be retroactive to the beginning of 
billings, but retroactive adjustment shall not exceed one year. 
(4) ?The owner requesting the adjustment may be required, at his own cost, to provide 
supplemental information to the director including, but not limited to, survey data approved by 
either a registered professional land surveyor (R.P.L.S.) and engineering reports approved by a 
professional engineer (P.E.). Failure to provide such information may result in the denial of the 
adjustment request. 
(5) ?Adjustments to the utility fee will be made upon the granting of the adjustment request, in 
writing, by the director. Denials of adjustment requests shall be made, in writing, by the director. 
(6) ?If the assessment (fee) is placed on the tax bill, the adjustment request must be made within 60 
days after opening of the tax roll collection. If the assessment (fee) is not placed on the tax bill, 
the adjustment request must be made during the year the assessment (fee) is imposed. The 
adjustment request will be reviewed by the director within a four-month period from the date of 
filing of the adjustment request. Consideration by the director of the owner's request for 
adjustment shall not relieve the owner of the obligation to make timely payment of the 
assessment (fee). In the event an adjustment is granted by the director which decreased the 
assessment (fee), the owner shall be entitled to a refund of excess assessments (fees) paid. If 
the assessment (fee) is placed on the tax bill, the refund shall be mailed by the tax collector. 
(b) ?If the assessment (fee) is placed on the tax bill, any errors in the assessment (fee) or failure to 
charge an assessment (fee) may be corrected by the director within 60 days after opening of the tax 
roll for collection. If the assessment (fee) is not placed on the tax bill, any errors in the assessment 
(fee) or failure to charge an assessment (fee) may be corrected by the director during the year in 
which the assessment (fee) is imposed. Corrections which result in an increase in the assessment 
(fee) cannot be imposed until the owner has consented in writing to the increase or has been given 
at least ten days' notice by certified mail and an opportunity to be heard by the commission. Once 
the fee is finalized, the director shall send documentation reflecting the adjustment to the owner and, 
if the assessment (fee) is placed on the tax bill, the documentation will also be sent to the tax 
collector. 
(1) ?The commission, shall complete their review within 30 days of receipt of said request for 
review. The city commission's determination on the review shall be in writing and set forth in 
detail, the reasons for their decision. 
(2) ?In reviewing denials of adjustment requests, the city commission shall apply the standards and 
review criteria contained in this section. 
(Ord. No. 537, § 9, 5-1-2017) 


Sec. 82-290. - Capital contributions. 
(a) ?Where the city has constructed or plans to construct stormwater facilities which are proposed to be 
used by a developer in lieu of a facility usually required to be constructed by him, the city may accept 
a capital contribution from the developer and waive certain construction requirements. 
(b) ?Procedures and standards developed by the city shall define appropriate means to optimize the 
developer's capital contributions in the construction or refunding of stormwater systems. These 
capital contributions shall take the form of fee-in-lieu-of or availability charges. Each situation will be 
analyzed by the city and a specific written decision will be developed. The application of each is 
defined as follows: 
(1) ?Fee-in-lieu-of is applied to a site specific negotiated procedure, wherein a development's 
stormwater contribution (quantity and quality) is assessed its share of the capital needs of the 
facilities required to serve the development in question. This capital contribution would be used 
for the construction or refunding of city-owned stormwater facilities. The process does not apply 
wherein the stormwater facilities are privately held. Each application is evaluated against the 
city's master plan, or where the master plan is incomplete, against the cumulative impacts from 
the development. 
(2) ?Availability charge is administered on a site specific basis identical to the fee-in-lieu-of 
procedure noted above. The only difference is that the capital investment advanced by the city 
in implementing a stormwater facility is now recovered through an availability charge. The 
capital charge is determined on a pro-rata share of the capacity used by the new applicant as 
measured by the cumulative impact from the development upon all impacted facilities applied to 
the present worth of the original capital expenditure. In the case of a developer constructing 
stormwater management facilities in excess of the site needs, the city may enter an agreement 
with that developer to rebate fee-in-lieu-of charges paid to the city by other developers utilizing 
those facilities over a period of time not exceeding seven years from the date of the agreement. 
(Ord. No. 537, § 10, 5-1-2017) 


Sec. 82-291. - Program responsibility. 
    It shall be the duty of the public works director to administer the stormwater management utility. The 
public works director shall keep an accurate record of all persons using the services and facilities of said 
stormwater management system of the city and to make changes in accordance with the rates and 
changes established in this article. 
(Ord. No. 537, § 11, 5-1-2017) 


Sec. 82-292. - Stormwater management utility funds. 
    There shall be established a stormwater management utility fund for the deposit of all fees and 
charges collected by the stormwater utility. These funds shall be for the exclusive use of the city's 
stormwater management utility, including, but not limited to, the following: 
(1) ?Administrative costs associated with the management of the stormwater management utility; 
(2) ?Planning and engineering; 
(3) ?Operation and maintenance of the system; 
(4) ?Funding of pollution abatement devices constructed on stormwater systems discharging to the 
surface water of the city; or 
(5) ?Debt service financing. 
(Ord. No. 537, § 12, 5-1-2017)

Variances to the provisions of this Code may be granted by the City Commission for
small scale development activities or other developments which do not require an
amendment to the Comprehensive Plan. Variances allow under this subsection shall not

arises out of the physical surroundings, shape, topographical conditions, or other physical
or environmental conditions that are unique to the specific property involved. If so, the
Building Official shall make the following required findings based on the granting of the
variance for that site alone. If, however, the condition is common to numerous sites so
that request for similar variances are likely to the received, the Building Official shall
CITY OF SPRINGFIELD
LAND DEVELOPMENT REGULATION CODE
34
make the required findings based on the cumulative effect of granting the variance to all
who may apply.

it makes positive finding, based on substantial competent evidence, on each of the
following:
1. These are extreme practical or economic difficulties in carrying out the
strict letter of this Code.

cost of developing the site.
3. The proposed variance will not substantially increase congestion on
surrounding public streets, the danger of fire, or other hazard to the public.
4. The proposed variance will not substantially diminish property values in,
nor alter the essential character of, the area surrounding the site.
5. The effect of the proposed variance is in harmony with the general intent
of this Code and the specific intent of the relevant subject area(s) of this
Code, and the Comprehensive Plan.
In reviewing a development approval involving a variance, the Building Official may
recommend such conditions and restrictions upon the premises benefited by a variance as
may be necessary to allow a positive finding to be made on any of the foregoing factors,
or to minimize the injurious effect of the variance.
2-6.5 Amendments to the Comprehensive Plan.

covered by impervious surfaces such as buildings, parking lots,
driveways or similar development. Open space is the land area
remaining in a landscape or natural state after development occurs.
The allowable lot coverage/open space ratio shall be determined by
multiplying the gross land area of any lot or parcel to be developed
by the applicable lot coverage standard set forth in subsection 5-
4.3 (Example: 43,560 sq. ft. x .5 = 21,780 sq. ft. allowable lot
coverage, and 21,780 sq. ft. open space).

prohibited.
e. In lieu of constructing the barriers required above, the developer
may physically designate large areas containing protected trees
where no land preparation or other development activities of any
kind will occur. The area shall be designated by placing stakes a
maximum of twenty five (25) feet apart and tying ribbon, plastic
tape, rope, etc. This perimeter line shall be beyond the tree
protection zone of any protected trees growing within the area.
f. Required protective barriers and perimeter lines shall remain in
place until all construction activity, except landscaping within the
protected area, is terminated.
7. Avoiding Injuries Due to Chemical Poisoning

LAND DEVELOPMENT REGULATION CODE
79
- The area within the tree protection zone shall be properly fertilized to
improve the vigor and growth of the roots.
- Porous, four-inch agriculture drain tiles shall be laid over the soil to
drain liquids away from the trunk. A drop of at least one eighth (1/8)
inch per foot shall be provided. The drain field shall be designated to
provide adequate drainage of the existing configuration of the trees.
- The number of drains shall depend upon soil material; lighter sandy
soils and porous gravelly material require fewer drains than heavy
non-porous soils.
- Aeration shall be provided by installing vertical tiles along the system.
The vertical tiles shall be filled with gravel and capped with a heavyduty
mesh to keep out trash and debris.
- Dry wells shall be large enough to allow for maximum growth of the
tree trunk. Most large shade trees require at least a sixty (60) inch
diameter wall. For slow-growing mature trees, a space of twelve to
eighteen (12-18) inches shall be provided between the trunk and the
side of the wall at every point.
- To prevent washing of material into the well, the dry well casing walls
shall be high enough to bring the coping just above the level of the
proposed fill.
- Dry well walls shall be constructed of materials that permit passage of
air and water. Concrete blocks backed with galvanized screening may
be used for sides of the well.

preserved by using any of the following methods:
a. Terracing- The area within the tree protection zone is left at the
original grade by terracing.
b. Retaining Wall- The area within the tree protection zone is left at the
original grade constructing a dry retaining wall. The retaining wall
shall be porous to allow for aeration.
c. Terracing and Retaining Wall- The area within the tree protection zone
is left at the original grade by the combined use of terracing and dry
retaining wall.
10. Minor Changes in Grade
When the change in grade is minor, lesser protective measures than those
described above may be taken. The County Forester shall be consulted
before use of these methods where their use will not endanger the health
of the protected tree.
11. Avoiding Injuries Due to Excavations
a. Water, sewer and other utility lines should be routed around the
tree protection zones of protected trees whenever possible.
b. If a line cannot reasonable by routed around the tree protection zone,
the line shall be tunneled beneath the area within the zone. The tunnel
shall be offset to one side of the trunk to prevent damage to the main
tap roots.
Porous paving may be placed within the tree protection zone of a protected tree,
so long as no damage is inflicted to the tree by grade change, compaction of the
soil, or any other cause.

psi) falls below thirty (30) psi on a city-wide basis.
f. Recreation
Population demand for recreation sites and facilities, based on
annual population estimated, reaches 95% of availability for such
sites and facilities.
g. Population
All capacity thresholds will be immediately reevaluated in the
event population growth exceeds ten percent (10%) during any one
year. Population growth shall be based upon annual estimates of
population published by the Bureau of Economics and Business

development for purposes of recording a cumulative requirements when capacity
thresholds have been met, shall be as follows.
1. Determination of Availability Capacity
Available capacity shall be determined for public facilities and
services as follows:
a. Roadways
i. The City Clerk shall obtain the latest available
Average Daily Traffic (ADT) counts from the
Florida Department of Transportation each year, or
as revised ADT counts become available.
ii. Each year, ADT counts will be used to: 1)
determine if capacity thresholds have been reached
or exceeded; and, 2) establish the basis from which
traffic caused by proposed development can be
expected to impact upon level of service standards.
iii. Using the annual ADT counts as a basis, potential
traffic to be generated by a proposed development
shall be estimated through use of criteria specified
in Trip Generation, 4th Edition, Institute of
Transportation Engineers, 1987. Estimates of trips
to be generated shall be added to the annual ADT
basis to determine if capacity thresholds or levels of
service standards will be met or exceeded. The City
Clerk shall maintain a cumulative total of estimated
trips added to the ADT count basis until such time
as revised ADT counts become available from the
Florida Department of Transportation.
2. Sewer
CITY OF SPRINGFIELD
LAND DEVELOPMENT REGULATION CODE
90
i. The City shall maintain an estimate of average daily
sewage flow which shall be updated each month.
Sewage flow estimates will be derived from an
average of monthly sewage flows for six (6) month
period immediately preceding the month for which
the estimate is being made. The Four Cities- Bay
County Monthly Sewage Flow Report shall be
used to estimate monthly sewage flows.
ii. Estimated average daily flows derived from the
average monthly sewage flows shall be used as the
basis to determine if capacity thresholds or level of
service standards will be met or exceeded. Average
daily sewage flow will be estimated for all proposed
development using the level of service specified in
subsection 3-9.4. Additional sewage flow caused
by proposed development shall be added to the
estimated monthly sewage flow to determine if
adequate capacity is available.
iii. The City Clerk shall maintain a cumulative total of
permitted sewage flows and shall reduce the Citys
allocated capacity accordingly on a monthly basis.
3. Solid Waste
i. On an annual basis, the City shall identify available
solid waste disposal capability which can be
provided by Bay County. This volume shall
provide the basis to determine if capacity thresholds
or level of service standards will be met or
exceeded.
ii. The City shall apply the level of service standard
found in subsection 3-9.4 to estimate volumes of
solid waste generated by proposed developments.
4. Drainage
i. The City shall require all developers submitting an
application for development approval to provide as
part of the overall development site plan a drainage
and grading plan. At a minimum, such drainage
and grading plan shall include: 1) finished
topographic contours; 2) impervious surfaces; 3)
existing drainage structures; and, 4) proposed
CITY OF SPRINGFIELD
LAND DEVELOPMENT REGULATION CODE
91
drainage structures; and, 5) proposed stormwater
treatment facilities.
ii. Design standards for drainage shall be as specified
in Section 3-6. No development permit shall be
issued by the City until the developer has obtained a
stormwater permit pursuant to Chapter 17-25,
Florida Administrative Code, if applicable, and the
developer has a drainage and grading plan approved
by the City.
iii. Drainage facilities for the proposed development of
a single-family detached or duplex dwelling unit on
an individual lot or parcel shall be presumed
adequate when: 1) proposed development is part of
a larger common plan of development which has
been previously approved by the City; or, 2) site
modifications are in conformance with Section 3-6
of this Code.
iv. All development shall be undertaken in strict
conformance with the erosion control measures
specified in subsection 3-7.6 of this Code.
5. Potable Water
i On an annual basis, the City shall identify the
amount of potable water and delivery rate (pounds
per square inch) which can be supplied by Bay
County. This amount shall provide the basis to
determine whether capacity thresholds or levels of
service standards will be met or exceeded.
ii. The City shall apply the level of service standard
found in subsection 3-9.4 to estimate potable water
consumption for all proposed development.
6. Recreation
i On an annual basis, the City shall identify public
and private recreation sites and facilities available
for use by the general public. These sites and
facilities shall provide the basis to determine
whether capacity thresholds or levels of service
standards have been met or exceeded.
CITY OF SPRINGFIELD
LAND DEVELOPMENT REGULATION CODE
92
ii The City shall apply the level of service standards
found in subsection 3-9.4 to estimate demand for
recreation sites and facilities caused by proposed
development.

improvements to maintain level of service standards. In
such case the application shall include appropriate plans for
improvements, documentation that such improvements are
designed to provide the capacity necessary to achieve or
maintain the level of service, and an enforceable
development agreement guaranteeing the construction,
consistent with calculations of capacity above.
b. The proposed project may be altered such that project level
of service is no less than the adopted level of service.
8. Burden of Showing Compliance on Developer
The burden of showing compliance with level of service
requirements shall be upon the developer. All applications for
development approval shall provide sufficient information showing
compliance with these standards.
9. Initial Determination of Concurrency
The initial determination of concurrency occurs during the review
of the application for development approval, and shall include
compliance with the level of service standards adopted by the City.
