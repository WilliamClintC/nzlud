COACHELLA - CITY CODE 
2003 
____________ 
A Codification of the General 
Ordinances of the City 
Of Coachella, CA 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 10, 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 
  
PREFACE 
The Coachella City Code is a codification of the general and permanent ordinances of Coachella, CA. The ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Matthew Bender & Company under the direction of Caroline Hernandez, Coachella deputy city clerk. 
Beginning with Supplement 10, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation. 
The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 10, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance 1130, passed January 23, 2019.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
This Code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this Code. 
Numbering System. 
The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This Code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this Code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
There are many tables of contents in this Code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
Beginning with Supplement No. 10, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
As of Supplement No. 10, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
Beginning with Supplement No. 10, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
Beginning with Supplement No. 10, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
When originally published, the pages of this code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. 10, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM.

C.  Hearing notice . The city shall provide at least ten (10) calendar days advance notice of the hearing date, time, and location to all requestors.

E.  Hearing officer's decision . At the hearing, or within five days thereafter, the hearing officer shall issue a decision approving or modifying the amount of the nuisance costs ("decision"). The decision shall identify the legal owner, the street address, the assessor's parcel number, and the legal description of the nuisance property, as available and applicable. All the costs of the hearing shall be borne by the non-prevailing parties. If any cost recovery is upheld, even in part, the city shall be the prevailing party. If cost recovery is entirely denied, the requestor shall be the prevailing party. If the city is the prevailing party, the confirmed amount of the nuisance costs shall include all costs incurred related to the hearing. If the city is the prevailing party, the decision will order the responsible parties to pay the confirmed nuisance costs to the city within thirty (30) days, and shall specific that any confirmed nuisance costs not paid within thirty (30) days shall become a lien and a special assessment against the nuisance property. The hearing officer's decision shall be final. The city shall serve notice of the hearing officer's decision on all interested parties.

Though no general shortage of consumer goods is evident, numerous consumers have reported cases of excessive price increases for consumer items, such as gasoline and food items, many times above the prices in effect prior to the disasters. Though price increases may be necessary where a merchant has incurred higher expenses, the reported price increases clearly exceed those that would be reasonable and just to recapture any increase of operation expenses. 
B.  Legislative Intent. It is the intention of the city council, in adopting this section, to protect citizens from excessive and unjustified increases in the prices charged during any abnormal disruption of the marketplace for consumer goods and services vital and necessary for the health, safety, and welfare of consumers resulting from emergency or major disaster for which a state of emergency for the city is proclaimed or for which a local disaster or emergency is declared by the President of the United States or Governor of California. 
C.  Excessive Price Increases Prohibited. Upon a proclamation of public emergency involving or threatening the lives, property or welfare of the citizens or for which a local disaster or emergency is declared by the President of the United States or the Governor of California and for a period of thirty (30) days from the date such declaration is terminated, it is unlawful for any person, contractor, business or other entity to sell or offer to sell any consumer food items, repair or reconstruction services, emergency or medical supplies, or gasoline for an amount which exceeds ten (10) percent of the price charged by such person, contractor, business or other entity for said goods or services on the day prior to the proclamation of emergency, unless such person, business contractor or other entity can prove that an increase in price was directly attributable to additional costs imposed on it by the supplier of the goods or for labor and materials used to provide the service. 
D.  Definitions. For the purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply: 
1.  A "consumer food item" is any article which is used or intended for use for food, drink, confection or condiment by man or other animal.

(Ord. 893 § 2 (part), 2003)  
4.08.100 - Local business preference program. 
A.  Definitions. 
1.  "Director" means the city manager or the city manager's designee. 
2.  "Coachella Valley" means the nine incorporated cities of the Coachella Valley, and the unincorporated areas of Riverside County in the Coachella Valley that are located within the boundaries of the Coachella Valley Association of Governments. 
3.  "Local business" means a vendor, contractor, or consultant who has a valid physical business address located within the Coachella Valley, at least six months prior to bid or proposal opening date, from which the vendor, contractor, or consultant operates or performs business on a day-to-day basis, and holds a valid business license by a jurisdiction located in the Coachella Valley. Post office boxes are not verifiable and shall not be used for the purpose of establishing such physical address. 
4.  "Solicitation" shall mean the city's process to obtain bids or proposals as provided in this chapter for the purchase of goods or services. 
B.  Findings. 
1.  The city annually spends significant amounts on purchasing supplies, materials, and equipment, and contractual and professional services. The dollars used in making these purchases are derived in large measure from taxes and fees derived from local businesses and the city council has determined that funds generated in the community should, to the extent possible, be placed back in the local economy. Therefore, the city council has determined that it is in the best interest of the city to give a preference to local businesses in making such purchases whenever the application of such a preference is reasonable in light of the dollar-value received in relation to such expenditure. 
2.  The city council further finds that the Coachella Valley is in a state of economic depression and many local businesses have been forced to close their doors due to severe financial losses. Many of these local business establishments have been doing business in the Coachella Valley for many years. The city council finds that the city should promote and stimulate local businesses by requiring that purchases of supplies, materials, and equipment and contractual services be acquired from local businesses. 
3.  The city council further finds that this action is necessary to grow the local economy and preserve the local businesses that have diligently served the Coachella Valley for many years. 
4.  Strategies that encourage people to buy locally are an important component of economic sustainability. Retaining local dollars within a community reduces economic export and increases the financial productivity of taxpayer dollars and increases the consumption of local goods and services while fostering a sustainable community. In working towards a sustainable economy, the city council recognizes that sustainable procurement policies are an important early step on the Coachella path to a sustainable community. By leveraging the purchasing power of the city to buy local products and services instead of products and services from outside the Coachella Valley it strengthens the local economic activity and employment as well as sets an example that helps foster and maintain a vital economic community for future generations. 
C.  Statement of Policy. It is the policy of the city to promote employment and business opportunities for local residents and firms on all contracts and give preference to local residents, workers, businesses, contractors, and consultants to the extent consistent with the law and interests of the public. 
D.  Local Preference in Purchasing. In the bidding of, or letting for procurement of, supplies, materials, and equipment, as provided in this chapter, the city council or the director may give a preference to local businesses in making such purchase or awarding such contract in an amount not to exceed five percent of the local business' total bid price, or fifteen thousand dollars ($15,000.00), whichever amount is lower. Total bid price shall include only the base bid price but also adjustments to that base bid price resulting from alternates requested in the solicitation. In order for a local business to be eligible to claim the preference, the business must request the preference in the solicitation response and provide a copy of its current business license from a jurisdiction in the Coachella Valley. 
E.  Local Preference in Services. In awarding contracts for services, including consultant services, preference to local business shall be given whenever practicable pursuant to this chapter consistent with the statement of policy in subsection (c) of this section. The contractor or consultant will also, to the extent legally possible, solicit applications for employment and proposals for subcontractors and subconsultants for work associated with the proposed contract from local residents and firms as opportunities occur and hire qualified local residents and firms whenever feasible. In order for a local business to be eligible to claim the preference, the business must request the preference in the solicitation response and provide a copy of its current business license from a jurisdiction in the Coachella Valley. 
F.  Exceptions to Local Business Preference Policy. The preference set forth in this section shall not apply to the following purchases or contracts: 
1.  Goods or services provided under a cooperative purchasing agreement. 
2.  Purchases or contracts which are funded in whole or in part by a governmental entity and the laws, regulations, or policies governing such funding prohibit application of that preference. 
3.  Purchases made or contracts let under emergency or noncompetitive situations. 
4.  Purchases with an estimated cost of five thousand dollars ($5,000.00) or less. 
5.  Application of the local business preference to a particular purchase, contract, or category of contracts for which the city council is the awarding authority may be waived at the city council's discretion. 
G.  Quality and Fitness. The preferences established in this section shall in no way be construed to inhibit, limit or restrict the right and obligation of the city council and the director to compare quality and fitness for use of supplies, materials, equipment, and services proposed for purchase and compare the qualifications, character, responsibility, and fitness of all persons, firms, or corporations submitting bids or proposals. In addition, the preferences established in this section shall in no way be construed to prohibit the right of the city council or the director from giving any other preference permitted by law or this chapter. 
H.  Application. The local business preference provided in this section shall apply to new contracts for supplies, materials, equipment, and services first solicited as of the effective date of the enabling ordinance. This section shall be implemented in a manner consistent with otherwise applicable provisions of this chapter and competitive bidding laws. 
I.  Verification of Local Business Preference Eligibility. Any vendor or consultant claiming to be a local business shall so certify in the bid, in writing to the director. The director shall not be required to verify the accuracy or any such certifications, and shall have sole discretion to determine if a vendor or consultant meets the definition of "local business." 
J.  Enforcement. 
1.  The information furnished by each bidder requesting a local business preference shall be under penalty of perjury. 
2.  No person or business shall knowingly and with intent to defraud, fraudulently obtain, retain, attempt to obtain or retain, or aid another in fraudulently obtaining or retaining or attempting to obtain or retain certification as a local business for the purpose of this section. 
3.  No person or business shall willfully and knowingly make a false statement with the intent to defraud, whether by affidavit, report, or other representation, to a city official or employee for the purpose of influencing the certification or denial of certification of any entity as a local business. 
4.  A business which has obtained city certification as a local business by reason of having furnished incorrect supporting information or by reason of having withheld information, and which knew or should have known, the information furnished was incorrect or the information withheld was relevant to its request for certification, and which by reason of such certification has been awarded a contract to which it would not otherwise have been entitled, shall: 
(i)  Pay to the city any difference between the contract amount and what the city's costs would have been if the contract had been properly awarded; 
(ii)  In addition to the amount described in subsection (i) above, be assessed a penalty in an amount of not more than ten (10) percent of the amount of the contract involved; and 
(iii)  Be subject to debarment from future award of contracts from the city. 
5.  The penalties identified in (4) above shall also apply to any business that has previously obtained proper certification and, as a result of a change in its status would no longer be eligible for certification, fails to notify the director of this information prior to responding to a solicitation or accepting a contract award. 
K.  Promulgation of Administrative Rules. The director is authorized to adopt administrative rules supplemental to the provisions of this chapter as necessary or appropriate to implement the provisions of this section. The provisions of this section and the rules adopted by the director shall be provided to potential bidders, vendors, and contractors to the widest extent practicable.

Chapter 4.28 - TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX 
 
4.28.010 - Title. 
This chapter shall be known as the "Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax Ordinance of the City of Coachella." 
(Prior code § 22-54)  
4.28.020 - Definitions. 
Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this section govern the construction of this chapter: 
"Hotel" means any structure or any portion of any structure including mobile home spaces or trailer spaces which is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging house, rooming house, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, mobile home or house trailer at a fixed location, or other similar structures or portion thereof. 
"Occupancy" means the use or possession, or the right to use or possession of any room or rooms or portion thereof, in any hotel for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes. 
"Operator" means the person who is the proprietor of a hotel, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his or her functions through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purpose of this chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his or her principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both. 
"Person" means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club, fraternal organization joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate, or any other group or combination acting as a unit. 
"Rent" means the consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and property and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever. 
"Tax administrator" means the director of finance. 
"Transient" means any and all persons who exercise occupancy or are entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other agreement, for a period of the first thirty (30) consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of thirty (30) days has expired. The fact that a person continues to occupy the hotel subsequent to the thirty (30) day period does not alter his status as a transient for the first thirty (30) days. 
(Prior code § 22-55)  
4.28.030 - ImposedPayment. 
A.  For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, a transient is subject to and shall pay a tax in the amount of nine percent of the rent charged by the operator for any period of time up to thirty (30) days, save and except such occupancy is for a term longer than thirty (30) days. Such tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the city, which is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the city. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient's ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the tax administrator may require that such tax be paid direct to the tax administrator. 
B.  In the case of time sharing uses, the transient occupancy tax shall be computed by averaging the daily room rates for conventionally utilized transient living facilities of the same approximate size and within the same zone in the city as defined by the finance director and applying the tax rate under this chapter thereto. Upon computation of such daily average room rates, the taxes may be increased every year in an amount equivalent to the percentage increase in the Los Angeles Consumer Price Index and the applicable tax computed therefrom. The daily average room rate, as computed and adjusted in this section, shall also be collected for each day time sharing units are rented on a conventional basis. 
(Prior code § 22-56)  
4.28.040 - Exemptions. 
No tax shall be imposed upon: 
A.  Any person as to whom, or any occupancy as to which, it is beyond the power of the city to impose the tax provided in this section; 
B.  Any federal or state of California officer or employee when on official business; and 
C.  Any officer or employee of a foreign government who is exempt by reason of express provision of federal law or international treaty. 
No exemption shall be granted except upon a claim therefor made at the time rent is collected and under penalty of perjury upon a form prescribed by the tax administrator. 
(Prior code § 22-57)  
4.28.050 - Operator's dutiesAbsorbing tax prohibited. 
Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this chapter to the same extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent charged, and each transient shall receive a receipt for payment from the operator. No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner hereinafter provided. 
(Prior code § 22-58)  
4.28.060 - Registration requiredCertificate. 
Within thirty (30) days after commencing business, each operator of any hotel renting occupancy to transients shall register the hotel with the city clerk and obtain from him or her a "Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate" to be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on the premises. Such certificate shall, among other things, state the following: 
A.  The name of the operator; 
B.  The address of the hotel; 
C.  The date upon which the certificate was issued; 
D.  A statement that: 
"This Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate signifies that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax Ordinance by registering with the tax administrator for the purpose of collecting from transients the transient occupancy tax and remitting said tax to the tax administrator. This certificate does not authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business or to conduct any lawful business in an unlawful manner, nor to operate a hotel without strictly complying with all local applicable laws, including but not limited to those requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or office of this city. This certificate does not constitute a permit." 
(Prior code § 22-59)  
4.28.070 - Reporting and remitting tax. 
Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following the close of each calendar quarter, or at the close of any shorter reporting period which may be established by the tax administrator, make a return to the tax administrator, on forms provided by him or her, of the total rents charged and received and the amount of tax collected for transient occupancies. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the city clerk. The tax administrator may establish shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder if he or she deems it necessary in order to insure collection of the tax and he or she may further require information in the return. Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust for the account of the city until payment thereof is made to the tax administrator. 
(Prior code § 22-60)  
4.28.080 - Penalties and interest. 
A.  Original Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty of ten (10) percent of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax. 
B.  Continued Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any delinquent remittance on or before a period of thirty (30) days following the date on which the remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second delinquent penalty of ten (10) percent of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax and the ten (10) percent penalty first imposed. 
C.  Fraud. If the tax administrator determines that the nonpayment of any remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of twenty-five (25) percent of the amount of the tax is added thereto in addition to the penalties stated in subsections A and B of this section. 
D.  Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the rate of one percent per month or a fraction thereof on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until paid. 
E.  Penalties Merged with Tax. Every penalty imposed and such interest as accrues under the provisions of this section shall become a part of the tax in this section required to be paid. 
(Prior code § 22-61)  
4.28.090 - Failure to collect and report taxDetermination of tax by tax administrator. 
If any operator shall fail or refuse to collect such tax and to make, within the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of such tax or any portion thereof required by this chapter, the city clerk shall proceed in such manner as he or she may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to base his or her estimate of the tax due. As soon as the city clerk shall procure such facts and information as he or she is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, he or she shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by this chapter. In case such determination is made, the city clerk shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his or her last known place of address. Such operator may within ten (10) days after the serving or mailing of such notice make application in writing to the city clerk for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the tax administrator shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the tax administrator shall give not less than five days' written notice in the manner prescribed in this chapter to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in such notice why the amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing the operator may appear and offer evidence why the specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing the tax administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed in this chapter of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen (15) days unless an appeal is taken as provided in Section 4.28.100. 
(Prior code § 22-62)  
4.28.100 - Appeals. 
Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the tax administrator with respect to the amount of such tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the council by filing a notice of appeal with the tax administrator within fifteen (15) days of the serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The council shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and the tax administrator shall give notice in writing to such operator at his or her last known place of address. The findings of the council shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed above for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of notice. 
(Prior code § 22-63)  
4.28.110 - Records requiredRight to inspect. 
It shall be the duty of every operator liable for the collection and payment to the city of any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve, for a period of three years, all such records as may be necessary to determine the amount of such tax as he or she may have been liable for the collection of and payment to the city, which records the tax administrator shall have the right to inspect at all reasonable times. 
(Prior code § 22-64)  
4.28.120 - Refunds. 
A.  Whenever the amount of any tax, interest or penalty has been overpaid or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city under this chapter it may be refunded as provided in subsections B and C of this section provided a claim in writing therefor, stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded, is filed with the city clerk within three years of the date of payment. The claim shall be on forms furnished by the tax administrator. 
B.  An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner prescribed by the tax administrator that the person from whom the tax has been collected was not a transient; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to the transient or credited to rent subsequently payable by the transient to the operator. 
C.  A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city by filing a claim in the manner provided in subsection A of this section, but only when the tax was paid by the transient directly to the tax administrator, or when the transient having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the satisfaction of the tax administrator that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax. 
D.  No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless the claimant establishes his or her right thereto by written records showing entitlement thereto. 
(Prior code § 22-65)  
4.28.130 - Actions to collect. 
Any tax required to be paid by any transient under the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the transient to the city.

Any person owing money to the city under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to an action brought in the name of the city for the recovery of such amount. 
(Prior code § 22-66)  
4.28.140 - Violations. 
Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punishable therefor as provided by Section 1.08.010.

There is a rebuttable presumption that communication services, which services are capable of terminating a call to another person on the general telephone network, and which are billed to a billing address or service address in the city, are used, in whole or in part, within the city's boundaries, and such services are subject to taxation under this chapter. If the billing address of the service user is different from the service address, the service address of the service user shall be used for purposes of imposing the tax.

C.  The tax administrator may issue and disseminate to communication service suppliers, which are subject to the tax collection requirements of this chapter, an administrative ruling identifying those communication services, or charges therefor, that are subject to the tax of subsection (A) above. This administrative ruling shall not impose a new tax, revise an existing tax methodology as stated in this section, or increase an existing tax, except as allowed by California Government Code Section 53750(h)(2). 
D.  As used in this section, the term "communication services" shall include, but not be limited to, charges for: connection, reconnection, termination, movement, or change of communication services; late payment fees; detailed billing; central office and custom calling features (including, but not limited to, call waiting, call forwarding, caller identification and three-way calling); voice mail and other messaging services; directory assistance; access and line charges; universal service charges; regulatory, administrative and other cost recovery charges; local number portability charges; and text messaging. As used in this section, the term "telecommunication services" shall not include separately stated charges for: installation or maintenance of wiring or equipment on a customer's premises and wire maintenance fees; sale or rental of tangible personal property; digital products delivered electronically, such as software, downloaded music, ring tones and reading materials; 911 surcharge; and sales for resale. 
E.  To facilitate the uniform interpretation and application of similar ordinance provisions in other local jurisdictions in the state, the tax administrator may, prior to issuing and disseminating a sourcing rule or an administrative tax ruling, submit its proposed sourcing rule or administrative tax ruling to a municipal organization for review and comment, according to the rules and procedures of that municipal organization, or its successor organization. 
F.  To prevent actual multi-jurisdictional taxation of communication services subject to tax under this section, any service user, upon proof to the tax administrator that the service user has previously paid the same tax in another state or city on such communication services, shall be allowed a credit against the tax imposed to the extent of the amount of such tax legally imposed in such other state or city; provided, however, the amount of credit shall not exceed the tax owed to the city under this section. 
G.  The tax on communication services imposed by this section shall be collected from the service user by the service supplier.

The tax shall be collected from the service user by the service supplier or nonutility supplier, or its billing agent. 
B.  As used in this section, the term "charges" shall apply to all services, components and items that are: i) necessary or common to the receipt, use and enjoyment of electric service; or, ii) currently, or historically have been, included in a single or bundled rate for electric service by a local distribution company to a class of retail customers.

C.  As used in this section, the term "charges" shall include the value of any other services, credits, property of every kind or nature, or other consideration provided by the service user in exchange for the electricity or services related to the provision of such electricity. 
D.  The tax administrator, from time to time, may survey the electricity service suppliers to identify the various unbundled billing components of electric retail service that they commonly provide to residential and commercial/industrial customers in the city, and the charges therefor, including those items that are mandated by state or federal regulatory agencies as a condition of providing such electric service. The tax administrator, thereafter, may issue and disseminate to such electric service suppliers an administrative ruling identifying those components and items which are: i) necessary or common to the receipt, use or enjoyment of electric service; or, ii) currently, or historically have been, included in a single or bundled rate for electric service by a local distribution company to a class of retail customers. Charges for such components and items shall be subject to the tax of subsection (A) above. 
E.  As used in this section, the term "using electrical energy" shall not be construed to mean the storage of such energy by a person in a battery owned or possessed by him or her for use in a automobile or other machinery or device apart from the premises upon which the energy was received; provided, however, that the term shall include the receiving of such energy for the purpose of using it in the charging of batteries; nor shall the term include electricity used and consumed by an electric public utility; nor shall the term include the mere receiving of such energy by an electric public utility or governmental agency at a point within the city for resale; or the use of such energy in the production or distribution of water by a public utility or a governmental agency. 
F.  The tax on electricity provided by self-production or by a nonutility supplier or an electric utility not under the jurisdiction of this chapter shall be collected and remitted in the manner set forth in section 4.30.070.

2.  Gas transportation charges (including interstate charges to the extent not included in commodity charges); 
3.  Storage charges; provided, however, that the service supplier shall not be required to apply the tax to any charges for gas storage services when the service supplier cannot, as a practical matter, determine the jurisdiction where such stored gas is ultimately used; but it shall be the obligation of the service user to self-collect the amount of tax not applied to any charge for gas storage by the service supplier and to remit the tax to the appropriate jurisdiction; 
4.  Capacity or demand charges, service establishment or reestablishment charges, administrative charges, marketing charges, transition charges, customer charges, minimum charges, annual and monthly charges, and any other charges which are necessary or common to the receipt, use and enjoyment of gas service; and

D.  The tax administrator, from time to time, may survey the gas service suppliers to identify the various unbundled billing components of gas retail service that they commonly provide to residential and commercial/industrial customers in the city, and the charges therefor, including those items that are mandated by state or federal regulatory agencies as a condition of providing such gas service. The tax administrator, thereafter, may issue and disseminate to such gas service suppliers an administrative ruling identifying those components and items which are: i) necessary or common to the receipt, use or enjoyment of gas service; or, ii) currently, or historically have been, included in a single or bundled rate for gas service by a local distribution company to a class of retail customers. Charges for such components and items shall be subject to the tax of subsection (A) above. 
E.  The following shall be excluded from the base on which the tax imposed in this section is computed:

3.  Charges made by a gas utility for gas used and consumed in the conduct of business of gas public utilities; 
4.  Charges made for gas used in the propulsion of motor vehicles, as that phrase is defined in the vehicle code of the state, utilizing natural gas; and 
5.  Charges made for gas used by a nonutility supplier to generate electrical energy for its own use or for sale to others provided the electricity so generated is subject to the tax in accordance with section 4.30.070. 
F.  The tax on gas provided by self-production or by a nonutility supplier not under the jurisdiction of this chapter shall be collected and remitted in the manner set forth in section 4.30.070. All other taxes on charges for gas imposed by this section shall be collected from the service user by the gas service supplier or its billing agent. The amount of tax collected in one month shall be remitted to the tax administrator, and must be received by the tax administrator on or before the twentieth day of the following month; or, at the option of the person required to collect or remit the tax, such person shall remit an estimated amount of tax measured by the tax billed in the previous month or upon the payment pattern of the service user, which must be received by the tax administrator on or before the twentieth day of the following month, provided that the service user shall submit an adjusted payment or request for credit, as appropriate, within sixty (60) days following each calendar quarter. The credit, if approved by the tax administrator, may be applied against any subsequent tax bill that becomes due. 
(Ord. No. 1017, § 1, 3-24-10)  
4.30.070 - Collection of tax from service users receiving direct purchase of gas or electricity. 
A.  Any service user subject to the tax imposed by section 4.30.050 or section 4.30.060, which produces gas or electricity for self-use, or which receives gas or electricity directly from a nonutility supplier not under the jurisdiction of this ordinance, or which otherwise is not having the full tax due on the use of gas or electricity in the city that is directly billed and collected by the service supplier or its billing agent, shall report said fact to the tax administrator and shall remit the tax due directly to the tax administrator within thirty (30) days of such use. In lieu of paying said actual tax, the service user may, at its option, remit to the tax administrator within thirty (30) days of such use an estimated amount of tax measured by the tax billed in the previous month, or upon the pattern payment of similar customers of the service supplier using similar amounts of gas or electricity, provided that the service user shall submit an adjusted payment or request for credit, as appropriate, within sixty (60) days following each calendar quarter. The credit, if approved by the tax administrator, may be applied against any subsequent tax bill that becomes due. 
B.  The tax administrator may require said service user to identify its nonutility supplier and provide, subject to audit, invoices, books of account, or other satisfactory evidence documenting the quantity of gas or electricity used and the cost or price thereof. If the service user is unable to provide such satisfactory evidence, or, if the administrative cost of calculating the tax, in the opinion of the city, is excessive, the city may determine the tax by applying the tax rate to the equivalent charges the service user would have incurred if the gas or electricity used had been provided by the service supplier, which is the primary supplier of gas or electricity. 
(Ord. No. 1017, § 1, 3-24-10)  
4.30.080 - Water users tax. 
A.  There is imposed a tax upon every person using water in the city which is transported and delivered through a pipeline distribution system.

D.  The tax administrator, from time to time, may survey the water service suppliers in the city to identify the various unbundled billing components of water retail service that they commonly provide to residential and commercial/industrial customers in the city, and the charges therefor, including those items that are mandated by a water district or a state or federal agency as a condition of providing such water service. The tax administrator, thereafter, may issue and disseminate to such water service suppliers an administrative ruling identifying those components and items which are: i) necessary for or common to the receipt, use or enjoyment of water service; or, ii) currently are or historically have been included in a single or bundled rate for water service by a local distribution company to a class of retail customers.

(Ord. No. 1017, § 1, 3-24-10)  
4.30.110 - Exemptions. 
The taxes imposed by this chapter shall not apply to: 
A.  Constitutional and Statutory Exemptions. 
1.  Any person or service user if imposition of such tax upon that person or service user would be in violation of a federal or state statute or the Constitution of the United States or the Constitution of the State of California, or otherwise exempted by this chapter; and 
2.  The city. 
B.  Special Exemptions. 
1.  Service users that meet both of the following criteria, and have demonstrated their compliance with the following criteria to the tax administrator's satisfaction, are hereby exempted from the utility users tax imposed by this chapter: 
(a)  Are at least sixty-five (65) years of age or older; and 
(b)  Where the combined gross income of all members of the service user's residence is less than the amount established for Riverside County by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development for very low income or extremely low-income families for the applicable household size. 
2.  The income exemption limit provided herein shall be revised annually by the tax administrator to conform to the most current very low income and extremely low-income limits for Riverside County for applicable household sizes, as determined by the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) with regard to the Public Housing and Section 8 Program. 
C.  The exemptions granted by this section shall not eliminate the duty of the service supplier, nonutility supplier, or person to collect and remit utility user taxes for exempt persons, or the duty of exempt persons to pay such taxes, unless an exemption is applied for and granted in accordance with section 4.30.120. 
D.  This ordinance shall authorize the city to levy and collect a utility users tax up to a maximum of five percent of the charges made for any gas, electric, communications, video, sewer, refuse or water services used by any service user within the city, except where any such service user or utility service is made expressly exempt from utility users tax by this chapter. Notwithstanding the above, the city council is hereby expressly authorized, by order or resolution, to establish classes of persons or classes of utility service otherwise subject to payment of utility users tax imposed by this chapter, and to suspend the collection of utility users tax, in whole or in part, from such classes of persons or utility service, and may, from time to time, modify any such order or resolution, provided that no order or resolution of the city council shall result in the collection of utility users tax from any service user in the city for any class of utility service in excess of five percent of the charges made for such utility service. 
(Ord. No. 1017, § 1, 3-24-10)  
4.30.120 - Application for exemption. 
A.  Any service user that is exempt from the tax imposed by this chapter or from whom the city council has suspended collection of the tax imposed by this chapter pursuant to subsection 4.30.120(D) shall file an application with the tax administrator for said exemption or suspension; provided, however, this requirement shall not apply to a service user that is a state or federal agency or subdivision with a commonly recognized name. Said application shall be made upon a form approved by the tax administrator and shall state those facts, declared under penalty of perjury, which qualify the applicant for an exemption or suspension, and shall include the names of all utility service suppliers serving that service user. If deemed subject to an exemption or suspension by the tax administrator, such service user shall give the tax administrator timely written notice of any change in utility service suppliers so that the tax administrator can properly notify the new utility service supplier of the service user's tax exempt or suspended status. A service user that fails to comply with this section shall not be entitled to a refund of utility users taxes collected and remitted to the tax administrator from such service user as a result of such noncompliance. Upon request of the tax administrator, a service supplier or nonutility supplier, or their billing agents, shall provide a list of names and addresses of those customers which, according to their billing records, are deemed exempt or suspended from the payment of utility users tax. 
B.  The decision of the tax administrator may be appealed pursuant to section 4.30.230. Filing an application pursuant to section 4.30.230 and appeal to the city manager pursuant to section 4.30.230 is a prerequisite to a suit thereon. 
C.  Following application and approval of any exemption or suspension from the payment of all or any part of the utility users tax by the city, the tax administrator shall prepare a list of the persons exempted or suspended from the payment of such tax by virtue of this section and shall furnish a copy thereof to each service supplier. 
D.  Any service user who has been exempted or suspended from the collection of utility users tax pursuant to this section shall notify the tax administrator within ten (10) calendar days following a change in facts or circumstances which may disqualify said service user from receiving such exemption or suspension. It shall be a misdemeanor for any person to knowingly receive the benefits of an exemption or suspension provided by this section when the basis for such exemption or suspension does not exist or ceases to exist. 
(Ord. No. 1017, § 1, 3-24-10)  
4.30.130 - Substantial nexus/minimum contacts. 
A.  For purposes of imposing a tax or establishing a duty to collect and remit a tax under this chapter, "substantial nexus" and "minimum contacts" shall be construed broadly in favor of the imposition, collection and/or remittance of the utility users tax to the fullest extent permitted by state and federal law, and as it may change from time to time by judicial interpretation or by statutory enactment. Any communication service (including VoIP) used by a person with a service address in the city, which service is capable of terminating a call to another person on the general telephone network, shall be subject to a rebuttable presumption that "substantial nexus/minimum contacts" exists for purposes of imposing a tax, or establishing a duty to collect and remit a tax, under this chapter. A service supplier shall be deemed to have sufficient activity in the city for tax collection and remittance purposes if its activities include, but are not limited to, any of the following: maintains or has within the city, directly or through an agent or subsidiary, a place of business of any nature; solicits business in the city by employees, independent contractors, resellers, agents or other representatives; solicits business in the city on a continuous, regular, seasonal or systematic basis by means of advertising that is broadcast or relayed from a transmitter with the city or distributed from a location with the city; or advertises in newspapers or other periodicals printed and published within the city or through materials distributed in the city by means other than the United States mail. 
B.  The city shall make available, upon request, an accurate description of its jurisdictional boundaries based on street addresses, in an electronic format. If a service supplier relies upon such information provided by city, it shall not be responsible for any errors in taxation that may result. 
(Ord. No. 1017, § 1, 3-24-10)  
4.30.140 - Duty to collectProcedures. 
The duty to collect and remit the taxes imposed by this chapter shall be performed as follows: 
A.  The tax shall be collected insofar as practicable at the time and along with the charges made in accordance with the regular billing practices of the service supplier. Where the amount paid by a service user to a service supplier is less than the full amount of the charge and tax which has accrued for the billing period, such amount and any subsequent payments by a service user may be applied to the utility service charge first until such charge has been fully satisfied. Any remaining balance shall be applied to the taxes due, except in those cases where a service user pays the full amount of the charges but notifies the service supplier of his or her refusal to pay the tax imposed on the charges. 
B.  The duty to collect tax from a service user shall commence with the beginning of the first full regular billing period applicable to the service user where all charges normally included in such regular billing are subject to the provisions of this chapter. Where a person receives more than one billing, one or more being for different periods than another, the duty to collect shall arise separately for each billing. 
C.  Bundling rule. If any nontaxable charges are bundled with and not separately stated from taxable service charges on the customer bill or invoice of a service supplier, the combined charge is subject to tax unless the service supplier identifies, by reasonable and verifiable standards, the portions of the combined charge that are nontaxable and taxable through the service supplier's books and records kept in the regular course of business, and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and not created and maintained for tax purposes. The service supplier has the burden of proving the proper apportionment of taxable and nontaxable charges. If the service supplier offers a combination of taxable and non-taxable services, and the charges are separately stated, then for taxation purposes, the values assigned the taxable and non-taxable services shall be based on its books and records kept in the regular course of business and in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles, and not created and maintained for tax purposes. The service supplier has the burden of proving the proper valuation of the taxable and nontaxable services. 
(Ord. No. 1017, § 1, 3-24-10)  
4.30.150 - Filing return and payment. 
Each person required by this chapter to remit a tax shall file a return to the tax administrator, on forms approved by the tax administrator on or before the due date. The full amount of the tax collected shall be included with the return and filed with the tax administrator. The tax administrator is authorized to require such additional information as he/she deems necessary to determine if the tax is being levied, collected, and remitted in accordance with this chapter. Returns are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. Pursuant to Revenue and Tax Code Section 7284.6, the tax administrator, and its agents, shall maintain such filing returns as confidential information exempt from disclosure provisions of the Public Records Act. 
(Ord. No. 1017, § 1, 3-24-10)  
4.30.160 - Collection penalties. 
A.  Taxes collected from a service user, or self-collected by a service user subject to section 4.30.070, are delinquent if not received by the tax administrator on or before the due date. Should the due date occur on a weekend or legal holiday, the return must be received by the tax administrator on or before the first regular working day following the weekend or legal holiday. A direct deposit, including electronic fund transfers and other similar methods of electronically exchanging monies between financial accounts, made by a service supplier in satisfaction of its obligations under this subsection shall be considered timely if the transfer is initiated on or before the due date, and the transfer settles into the city's account on or before the following business day. 
B.  If a service supplier, or a service user subject to section 4.30.070, fails to remit any tax collected, on or before the due date, said person shall pay a penalty for such delinquencies at the rate as set forth by resolution of the city council of the total tax that is delinquent in the remittance, and shall pay interest at the rate as set forth by resolution of the city council, on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent, until paid. 
C.  The tax administrator shall have the power to impose additional penalties upon persons required to collect and/or remit taxes pursuant to the provisions of this chapter for fraud or gross negligence in reporting or remitting at the rate as set forth by resolution of the city council of the amount of the tax collected and/or required to be remitted, or as recomputed by the tax administrator. 
D.  For collection purposes only, every penalty imposed and such interest that is accrued under the provisions of this section shall become a part of the tax herein required to be paid. 
E.  Notwithstanding the foregoing, the tax administrator may, in his or her discretion, modify the due dates of this chapter to be consistent with any uniform standards or procedures that are mutually agreed upon by UUT public agencies, or otherwise legally established, to create a UUT central payment location or mechanism. 
(Ord. No. 1017, § 1, 3-24-10)  
4.30.170 - Deficiency determination and assessmentTax application errors. 
A.  The tax administrator shall make a deficiency determination if he or she determines that any person required to collect or self-collect taxes pursuant to the provisions of this chapter has failed to collect and remit the proper amount of tax by improperly or failing to apply the tax to one or more taxable services or charges. 
B.  The tax administrator shall mail a notice of such deficiency determination to the person required to pay or remit the tax, which notice shall refer briefly to the amount of the taxes owed, plus interest at the rate as set forth by resolution of the city council, on the amount of the tax from the date on which the tax should have been received by the city. Within fourteen (14) calendar days after the date of service of such notice, the person may request in writing to the tax administrator for a hearing on the matter. If the person fails to request a hearing within the prescribed time period, the amount of the deficiency determination shall become a final assessment, and shall immediately be due and owing to the city. 
C.  If the person requests a hearing, the tax administrator shall cause the matter to be set for hearing, which shall be held within thirty (30) days after receipt of the written request for hearing. Notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be mailed by the tax administrator to such person at least ten (10) calendar days prior to the hearing, and, if the tax administrator desires said person to produce specific records at such hearing, such notice may designate the records requested to be produced. 
D.  At the time fixed for the hearing, the tax administrator shall hear all relevant testimony and evidence, including that of any other interested parties. At the discretion of the tax administrator, the hearing may be continued from time to time for the purpose of allowing the presentation of additional evidence. Within a reasonable time following the conclusion of the hearing, the tax administrator shall issue a final assessment (or nonassessment), thereafter, by confirming, modifying or rejecting the original deficiency determination, and shall mail a copy of such final assessment to person owing the tax. The decision of the tax administrator may be appealed pursuant to section 4.30.230. Filing an application pursuant to section 4.30.230 and appeal to the city manager pursuant to section 4.30.230 is a prerequisite to a suit thereon. 
E.  Payment of the final assessment shall become delinquent if not received by the tax administrator on or before the thirtieth day following the date of receipt of the notice of final assessment. The penalty for delinquency shall be at the rate as set forth by resolution of the city council on the total amount of the assessment, along with interest at the rate as set forth by resolution of the city council, on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date of delinquency, until paid. The applicable statute of limitations regarding a claim by the city seeking payment of a tax assessed under this section 4.30.170 shall commence from the date of delinquency as provided in this subsection (E). 
F.  All notices under this section may be sent by regular mail, postage prepaid, and shall be deemed received on the third calendar day following the date of mailing, as established by a proof of mailing. 
(Ord. No. 1017, § 1, 3-24-10)  
4.30.180 - Administrative remedyNonpaying service users. 
A.  Whenever the tax administrator determines that a service user has deliberately withheld the amount of the tax owed by the service user from the amounts remitted to a person required to collect the tax, or whenever the tax administrator deems it in the best interest of the city, he or she may relieve such person of the obligation to collect the taxes due under this chapter from certain named service users for specific billing periods. Whenever the service user has failed to pay the amount of tax owed for a period of two or more billing periods, the service supplier shall be relieved of the obligation to collect taxes due. The service supplier shall provide the city with the names and addresses of such service users and the amounts of taxes owed under the provisions of this chapter. 
B.  In addition to the tax owed, the service user shall pay a delinquency penalty at the rate as set forth by resolution of the city council of the total tax that is owed, and shall pay interest at the rate as set forth by resolution of the city council, on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the due date, until paid. 
C.  The tax administrator shall notify the nonpaying service user that the tax administrator has assumed the responsibility to collect the taxes due for the stated periods and demand payment of such taxes, including penalties and interest. The notice shall be served on the service user by personal delivery or by deposit of the notice in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the service user at the address to which billing was made by the person required to collect the tax; or, should the service user have a change of address, to his or her last known address.

If such cannabis business or person, after written demand by the city manager, refuses to make available for audit, examination or verification such books, records, or equipment as the city manager requests, the city manager may, after full consideration of all information within the city manager's knowledge concerning the cannabis business and its business and activities of the person so refusing, make an assessment in the manner provided in Section 4.31.130. 
D.  The conviction and punishment of any person for failure to pay the required tax shall not excuse or exempt such person from any civil action for the tax debt unpaid at the time of such conviction. No civil action shall prevent a criminal prosecution for any violation of the provisions of this Chapter or of any State law requiring the payment of all taxes. 
E.  Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter or any regulation or rule passed in accordance herewith, or knowingly or intentionally misrepresenting to any officer or employee of the city any material fact in procuring the a certificate or permit from the city as provided for in this chapter or Chapters 5.68 or 17.85 of this code shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor. 
(Ord. No. 1101, § 1, 11-18-16)  
4.31.130 - Debts; deficiencies; assessments and appeals. 
A.  The amount of any tax, penalties, and interest imposed by the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed a debt to the city and any person operating a cannabis business without having paid any applicable tax, penalties, and interest shall be liable in an action in the name of the city in any court of competent jurisdiction for the amount of the tax, and penalties and interest imposed on such cannabis business. 
B.  If the city manager is not satisfied that any statement filed as required under the provisions of this chapter is correct, or that the amount of tax is correctly computed, the city manager may compute and determine the amount to be paid and make a deficiency determination upon the basis of the facts contained in the statement or upon the basis of any information in his or her possession or that may come into his or her possession. One or more deficiency determinations of the amount of tax due for a period or periods may be made. When a person discontinues engaging in a cannabis business, a deficiency determination may be made at any time within three years thereafter as to any liability arising from engaging in such business whether or not a deficiency determination is issued prior to the date the tax would otherwise be due. Whenever a deficiency determination is made, notice shall be given to the person concerned in the same manner as notices of assessment are given under Subsections C, D, and E of this section. 
C.  Under any of the following circumstances, the city manager may make and give notice of an assessment of the amount of tax owed by a person under this chapter: 
1.  If the person has not filed any statement or return required under the provisions of this chapter; 
2.  If the person has not paid any tax due under the provisions of this chapter; 
3.  If the person has not, after demand by the city manager, filed a corrected statement or return, or furnished to the city manager adequate substantiation of the information contained in a statement or return already filed, or paid any additional amount of tax due under the provisions of this chapter; 
4.  If the city manager determines that the nonpayment of any tax due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of twenty-five (25) percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to penalties and interest otherwise stated in this chapter. 
5.  The notice of assessment shall separately set forth the amount of any tax known by the city manager to be due or estimated by the city manager, after consideration of all information within the city manager's knowledge concerning the business and activities of the person assessed, to be due under each applicable section of this chapter, and shall include the amount of any penalties or interest accrued on each amount to the date of the notice of assessment. 
D.  The notice of assessment shall be served upon the person either by handing it to him or her personally, or by a deposit of the notice in the United States mail, postage prepaid thereon, addressed to the person at the address of the location of the cannabis business appearing on the face of the business license issued under Chapter 5.04 of this Code, or to such other address as he or she shall register with the city manager for the purpose of receiving notices provided under this Chapter or Chapter 5.04; or, should the person have no business license issued and should the person have no address registered with the City Manager for such purpose, then to such person's last known address. For the purposes of this section, a service by mail is complete at the time of deposit in the United States mail. 
E.  Within ten (10) days after the date of service the person may apply in writing to the city manager for a hearing on the assessment. If application for a hearing before the city is not made within the time herein prescribed, the tax assessed by the city manager shall become final and conclusive. Upon receipt of any such application for hearing, the city manager shall cause the matter to be set for hearing before a hearing officer pursuant to the provisions of Section 1.10.070 (A) through (D) of this code. At such hearing said applicant may appear and offer evidence why the assessment as made by the city manager should not be confirmed and fixed as the tax due. Based upon the submission of such evidence and the review of the city's files, the hearing officer shall issue a written notice and order upholding, modifying or reversing the determination from which the appeal is taken. The notice shall be given within fourteen (14) calendar days after the conclusion of the hearing and shall state the reasons for the decision. The notice shall specify that the decision is final and that any petition for judicial review shall be filed within ninety (90) days from the date of the decision in accordance with Code of Civil Procedure Section 1094.6. If the hearing officer fails or refuses to act on an appeal within the fourteen-day period, the appeal shall be deemed to have been denied by the hearing officer on the fifteen (15th) calendar day. 
(Ord. No. 1101, § 1, 11-18-16)  
4.31.140 - No injunction/writ of mandate. 
No injunction or writ of mandate or other legal or equitable process shall issue in any suit, action, or proceeding in any court against this city or against any officer of the city to prevent or enjoin the collection under this chapter of any tax or any amount of tax required to be collected and/or remitted. 
(Ord. No. 1101, § 1, 11-18-16)  
4.31.150 - Future amendment to cited statute. 
Unless specifically provided otherwise, any reference to a state or federal statute in this chapter shall mean such statute as it may be amended from time to time; provided, that such reference to a statute herein shall not include any subsequent amendment thereto, or to any subsequent change of interpretation thereto by a state or federal agency or court of law, to the extent that such amendment or change of interpretation would require voter approval under California law, or to the extent that such change would result in a tax decrease. Only to the extent voter approval would otherwise be required or a tax decrease would result, the prior version of the statute (or interpretation) shall remain applicable. For any application or situation that would not require voter approval or would not result in a decrease of a tax, provisions of the amended statute (or new interpretation) shall be applicable to the maximum possible extent. To the extent that the city's authorization to collect or impose any tax imposed under this chapter is expanded or limited as a result of changes in state or federal law, no amendment or modification of this chapter shall be required to conform the tax to those changes, and the tax shall be imposed and collected to the full extent of the authorization up to the full amount of the tax imposed under this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 1101, § 1, 11-18-16)  
4.31.160 - Application of tax to retail medical cannabis and recreational cannabis businesses. 
A.  As of the effective date of this chapter, the Coachella Municipal Code only authorizes the operation of wholesale medical cannabis cultivation and manufacturing businesses within the city. However, a statewide initiative measure has qualified for the November 8, 2016 ballot known as the "Adult Use of Marijuana Act" (Proposition 64). If passed by California voters, this measure would legalize the personal use of cannabis/marijuana for recreational purposes, but would allow local agencies to reasonably regulate and tax activities tied to recreational cannabis/marijuana. 
B.  Should Proposition 64 or any similar state law authorizing recreational use of cannabis be passed, and should the Coachella Municipal Code be amended to authorize the operation of recreational cannabis businesses within the city, the People of Coachella expressly intend for the tax imposed herein to apply to such operations, on the same terms and conditions as set forth in this chapter. 
C.  Should the Coachella Municipal Code be amended to authorize the operation of retail medical cannabis businesses within the city, the People of Coachella further expressly intend for the tax imposed herein to apply to such operations, on the same terms and conditions as set forth in this chapter. 
D.  No provision of this chapter shall be construed to authorize the operation of retail medical or of any recreational cannabis businesses without further amendment to the city's municipal code. 
(Ord. No. 1101, § 1, 11-18-16)

A.  Pursuant to the authority contained in Section 935 of the Government Code of the state of California, the following claims and procedures are established for those claims against the city for money or damages not now governed by state or local laws. 
B.  Notwithstanding the exemptions set forth in Section 905 of the Government Code of the state of California, all claims against the city for damages or money, when a procedure for processing such claims is not otherwise provided by state or local laws, shall be presented within the time limitations and in the manner prescribed by Sections 910 through 915.2 of the Government Code of the state. Such claims shall further be subject to the provisions of Section 945 through 946 of the Government Code of the state relating to the prohibition of suits in the absence of the presentation of claims and action thereon by the council. 
(Prior code § 2-7)  
Chapter 4.36 - FEE AND SERVICE CHARGE REVENUE/COST COMPARISON SYSTEM 
 
4.36.010 - Findings and intent. 
A.  Pursuant to Article XIIIB of the California Constitution, it is the intent of the city council to require the ascertainment and recovery of costs reasonably borne from fees, charges and regulatory license fees levied therefor in providing the regulation, products or services hereinafter enumerated in this chapter. 
B.  The fee and service charge revenue/cost comparison system set forth in this chapter provides a mechanism for ensuring that fees adopted by the city for services rendered do not exceed the reasonable estimated cost for providing the services for which the fees are charged. 
C.  The adoption of this chapter is exempt from the California Environmental Quality Act (Public Resources Code Section 2100 et seq.), because it approves and sets forth a procedure for determining fees for the purpose of meeting the operating expenses of city departments, as set forth in Public Resources Code Section 21080(b)(8)(1).

In adjusting fees and charges, the city manager shall act in an administrative and ministerial capacity and shall consider only the standards and criteria established by this chapter, and the procedures set and by applicable state law. All executive orders issued hereunder shall comply in all respects with this chapter, and the several schedules of fees and rates as set by the city council by resolution. 
(Prior code § 30-2)  
4.36.030 - Costs reasonably borne defined.

C.  Fixed asset recovery expenses, consisting of depreciation of fixed assets, and additional fixed asset expense recovery charges calculated on the current estimated cost of replacement, divided by the approximate life expectancy of the fixed asset. A further additional charge to make up the difference between book value depreciation not previously recovered and reserved in cash and the full cost of replacement, also shall be calculated and considered a cost so as to recover such unrecovered costs between book value and cost of replacement over the remaining life of the asset. 
D.  General overhead, expressed as a percentage, distributing and charging the expenses of the city council, city attorney, city administration, city clerk, city treasurer, economic development, finance department, personnel office, and city promotion, and all other staff and support service provided to the entire city organization. Overhead shall be prorated between tax-financed services and fee-financed services on the basis of such percentage so that each of taxes and fees and charges shall proportionately defray such overhead costs. 
E.  Departmental overhead, expressed as a percentage, distributing and charging the cost of each department head and his or her supporting expenses as enumerated in subsections A, B, C and F of this section. 
F.  Debt service costs, consisting of repayment of principal, payment of interest, and trustee fees and administrative expenses for all applicable bond, certificate, note or securities issues or loans of whatever nature or kind. Any required coverage factors or required or established reserves beyond basic debt service costs also shall be considered a cost if required by covenant within any securities ordinance, resolution, indenture or general law applicable to the city. 
(Prior code § 30-3)  
4.36.040 - Schedule of fees and service charges.

(Prior code § 30-7)  
Chapter 4.40 - TRANSPORTATION MITIGATION FEE 
 
4.40.010 - Transportation mitigation fee. 
A.  The city council of the city finds that future development within the city and within the Coachella Valley to the year 2010 will result in traffic volumes in excess of capacity on the regional system of streets, arterials and highways now existing. 
B.  The city council finds that failure to expand the capacity of the existing circulation system will cause unacceptable levels of congestion on the streets and arterials of the regional system. 
C.  The city council also finds and declares that in the absence of this chapter imposing a fair share traffic fee upon new development, existing and future sources of revenue are inadequate to fund substantial portions of the regional transportation system improvements needed to avoid unacceptable levels of congestion and related adverse impacts. 
D.  The city council finds that exactions from development will construct only a portion of the local and regional facilities and that the adoption of this transportation uniform mitigation fee article will raise the additional revenues needed to construct the improvements to accommodate traffic that will be generated by development of land within the city and within the Coachella Valley. 
E.  The city council also finds that the Coachella Valley area transportation study has determined the extent to which the new development of land will generate traffic volumes impacting the roadway system and that this chapter establishes a fair and equitable method for distributing the unfunded costs of transportation improvements necessary to accommodate the traffic volumes generated by such development. 
F.  The city council further finds that the regional transportation improvements and the transportation uniform mitigation fee established by this chapter are based on the findings of the 1987 Coachella Valley Area Transportation Study whose policy-committee members represented all nine cities in the Coachella Valley and Riverside County. This study has established that growth in the year 2010 will affect the entire regional transportation system and therefore the area of impact for future development is the entire Coachella Valley as defined in this chapter. The study made the following additional findings: 
1.  Population and employment within the Coachella Valley is expected to double by the year 2010 and would cause levels of service E and F (as defined in the National Academy of Sciences 1964 Highway Capacity Manual and as updated in the 1985 Highway Capacity Manual, Special Report 209) on existing streets and arterials. 
2.  The Coachella Valley area transportation study shows that by the year 2010 the Coachella Valley will increasingly become a more integrated and interdependent Valley, most as intercity trips for both residents and visitors. 
3.  The 1987 Coachella Valley area transportation study modeled and evaluated the effect of projected growth to the year 2010 on all major streets and highways in the Coachella Valley and found that without expansion, the transportation system would suffer severe congestion. Further, the study showed that the recommended transportation improvements would accommodate the traffic anticipated in the year 2010 at the desired level of service C. 
4.  In the year 2010, according to the Coachella Valley area transportation study, the valley will remain a self-contained community where jobs and the labor force are well-balanced. The increase in intercity travel, however, will result in an increase in average trip length. 
5.  Existing and future sources of public revenues are insufficient to fund all the needed transportation improvements. 
6.  The revenues generated by this transportation mitigation fee will provide the additional funds necessary to construct the transportation improvements and provide the additional capacity needed by the year 2010 to accommodate the traffic generated by the development of land in the city and in the Coachella Valley. 
7.  The transportation mitigation fee is a fair and equitable method of distributing the cost of transportation improvements among the developments which will generate the increased traffic. 
G.  The city council adopts all findings and incorporates by reference all findings contained in the following reports/studies, attached as exhibits on file in the office of the city clerk: 
1.  Coachella Valley area transportation study, dated December, 1987, exhibit A on file in the office of the city clerk; 
2.  Transportation Uniform Mitigation Fee Ordinance Report, dated June, 1988, exhibit B on file in the office of the city clerk;

A.  There is established a transportation uniform mitigation fee, the proceeds of which shall be placed in the trust fund established by CVAG and used to construct the transportation improvements and provide the additional capacity needed by the year 2010 to accommodate the traffic generated by the development of land in the city and in the Coachella Valley. 
B.  The amount of the mitigation fee shall be based on the trip generation rate and as recommended by CVAG. The council shall adopt by resolution the fee amount recommended by CVAG or may adopt a higher fee amount. The executive committee of CVAG shall annually review and, if necessary, amend the amount of the recommended mitigation fee to insure that it is a fair and equitable method of distributing the costs of the improvements necessary to accommodate traffic volumes generated by future growth. 
C.  The council shall annually review and, if necessary amend the amount of the mitigation fee to insure that it is a fair and equitable method of distributing the costs of the improvements necessary to accommodate traffic volumes generated by future growth. If the amount of the recommended mitigation fee is amended by CVAG pursuant to CVAG's annual review, the council shall amend its fee amount in accord or in an amount greater. 
D.  No tract map, parcel map, conditional use permit, land use permit or other entitlement shall be approved unless payment of the mitigation fee is a condition of approval for any such entitlement. The mitigation fee shall be paid to the city. 
E.  No building or similar permit, certificate of occupancy or business license reflecting a change of use shall be issued unless the applicant has paid the mitigation fee. 
F.  Mitigation fees shall be imposed and collected by the city and shall be transmitted to CVAG to be placed in the Coachella Valley Transportation Mitigation Trust Fund. All interest or other earnings of the fund shall be credited to the fund.

To receive a credit, the developer shall obtain in advance an agreement with CVAG pursuant to CVAG's rules and regulations. That credit shall be an amount equal to the actual engineering and construction costs incurred at the time of the development to the extent that CVAG has included those costs in its estimated cost of constructing the regional system. 
B.  The fees required by this chapter shall be in addition to any fees, conditions or exactions for on-site and off-site improvements imposed upon projects pursuant to state and local laws, ordinances, or administrative policy which may authorize the imposition of conditions, fees or exactions on development and the developer shall not be entitled to any credits for such fees, conditions or exactions. 
C.  If a developer constructs, or is required by the city to construct, any portion of the regional network as identified in Section 4.40.080 in excess of that required to meet standard street requirements as provided by local ordinances, municipal codes, and the city's general plan, the developer shall be entitled to a credit for the cost of such excess construction. All such construction on the regional network must have the approval of CVAG as to plans and detailed costs estimates. 
D.  Should the credit exceed the applicant's total fee, the difference may be credited against any of the applicant's future development within five years which would be subject to the fee. The credit may not be refunded in cash. 
E.  Should a developer provide improvements which benefit adjacent undeveloped land, the developer may be reimbursed for a proportionate share of the cost of such improvements contingent upon future fees contributed from other benefited developments and pursuant to special agreements made in advance with CVAG and in accordance with CVAG's rules and regulations.

Chapter 4.45 - DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 1013, adopted Feb. 10, 2010, amended ch. 4.45 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former ch. 4.45 pertained to the same subject matter, consisted of §§ 4.45.0104.45.120, and derived from Ord. 943, 2006. 
 
4.45.010 - Purpose and findings. 
City council finds that: 
1.  The purpose of this chapter is to establish provisions for assessing and collecting fees as a condition of a development approval. 
2.  The purpose of the fees established by this chapter is to impose upon development projects the costs of constructing public facilities which are reasonably related to the impacts of the development project. New development in the city will require the construction of new public facilities. The city council finds that it is in the interest of the public's health, safety and welfare for new development to pay the costs of constructing the public facilities reasonably related to the impacts of the new development. 
3.  The fees established by this chapter shall be used for those purposes identified in section 4.45.60. 
4.  The city council finds that there is a reasonable relationship between the use of the fees established by this chapter and the types of development projects on which the fees are imposed. The public facilities for which the fees are collected are reasonably related to the types of development to which they apply. 
5.  The city council finds that there is a reasonable relationship between the need for the public facilities and the type of development projects to which the fees apply. 
6.  The city council finds that there is a reasonable relationship between the amount of the fees and the costs of the public facilities or portions thereof attributable to the development project on which the fees are imposed. 
(Ord. No. 1013, § 2, 2-10-10)  
4.45.020 - Basis for calculation of development impact fees. 
The city approves, adopts and incorporates the facilities study, which establishes the following: 
1.  The total estimated cost of such public facilities, including design, engineering, construction, installation and management of such construction and installation; 
2.  Allocation of such cost among the residential, commercial and industrial types of development within the city; 
3.  Formulas based on the density of residential unit development and the square footage of commercial and industrial building development, to determine the amount of fees payable for each such type of development; 
4.  Specific fees payable for each residential unit and square footage of commercial and industrial buildings in each development project; 
(Ord. No. 1013, § 2, 2-10-10)  
4.45.030 - Need for public facilities. 
In order to implement the goals and objectives of the city's general plan and applicable specific plans by accommodating the need for public facilities and mitigating the financial and physical impacts for all development projects within the city, the following public facilities must be constructed, installed, and paid for or financed: 
1.  General government facilities. 
2.  Library facilities. 
3.  Park and recreation facilities. 
4.  Street facilities. 
5.  Fire facilities. 
6.  Police facilities. 
(Ord. No. 1013, § 2, 2-10-10)  
4.45.040 - Need for development impact fees. 
The city council has determined, based on the facilities study, the city general plan, and applicable specific plans, as well as substantial evidence submitted in public hearing, that development impact fees are needed in order to finance these public facilities and to allocate the responsibility to pay each development project's fair share of the costs of constructing and installing such public facilities. 
(Ord. No. 1013, § 2, 2-10-10)  
4.45.050 - Consistency with city general and specific plans. 
In establishing these development impact fees, the city council finds that they are consistent with the city's general plan and applicable specific plans, and declares that it has considered the effects of such fees with respect to the city's housing needs defined in the housing element of the city general plan, and the standards and criteria for public facilities applied in comparable developments within the city, in accordance with California Government Code Section 65913.2. 
(Ord. No. 1013, § 2, 2-10-10)  
4.45.060 - Use of development impact fees. 
Development impact fees hereby are established for each development project located with the city, predicate on the following findings regarding their use: 
A.  General government facilities fees will be used to enable the city to ensure that its citizens have adequate facilities for the daily administrative service operations of the city and for the city council, planning commission, various boards and commissions of the city, as well as for community organization meetings and events. General government facilities in the City of Coachella primarily include public works facilities and the city hall. 
B.  Library facilities fees will be used for the land acquisition and construction costs of a public library facility as part of the Riverside County Library System, to serve the new residential development in the city. 
C.  Park and recreation facility fees will be used to ensure that city park land dedicated pursuant to the 2006 Parks and Recreation Master Plan which incorporated the standard for parkland dedication in-lieu fee as allowed under the Quimby Act of three acres per thousand population, or otherwise, will be improved with the financial resources provided by this development impact fee in addition to those of the Coachella Valley Parks and Recreation District. Typical improvements will include turf, fields, fencing, play apparatus, lighting, restrooms and parking. 
D.  Street facilities fees will be used for the following purposes: 
1.  Construction or installation of improvements to add or modify traffic signals and related devices to maintain service levels that are directly impacted by specific development projects; 
2.  Construction or installation of street rehabilitation and construction improvements to add or modify land and circulation capacity to maintain service levels that are directly impacted by specific development projects. 
3.  Construction or installation of bridge and grade circulation improvements to add or modify bridge and grade separation service levels for areas specifically impacted by a development project. 
4.  Construction or installation of bus shelter improvements to add or improve shelters in accordance with the regional transit plan and specifically impacted by development projects. 
E.  Fire facility fees ensure residents of the city have adequate fire protection facilities including buildings, land, equipment and vehicles based on the facility standard of one fire station for every three thousand (3,000) dwelling units. 
F.  Police facility fees ensure residents and workers of the city have adequate police protection facilities including buildings, land, equipment and vehicles.

1.  The owner or developer of any development project within the city shall have constructed a public facility described in the facilities study and required to be constructed as a condition of the development approval of the development project. 
2.  In the event that an owner or developer constructs such a public facility, the owner or developer may apply the project credit to offset an obligation of the owner or developer to pay a fee imposed pursuant to this chapter, provided that the project credit shall be limited to reducing an obligation for a fee in the same fee category as the category of the public facility so constructed. After deducting a project credit against the applicable fee due hereunder, the owner or developer shall pay the obligation remaining in the fee category against which the project credit was applied. 
3.  The city engineer shall determine the amount of the project credit for the construction of a public facility described in the facilities study requested by an owner or developer. The amount of each project credit shall be certified by the city engineer after final completion and acceptance of each such public facility, based on final accepted and approved "as-built plans" and specifications and verification of the actual cost to construct the public facility, subject to appeal to the city council.

In the event that an owner or developer constructs a public facility described in the facilities study and the actual cost to construct or install it exceeds the fee otherwise payable hereunder as the owner's or developer's fair share for such a public facility, such an owner or developer shall be entitled to a project reimbursement in an amount equal to the difference between the actual cost to construct or install such public facility and the fee payable hereunder for the fair share of such cost. The amount of the reimbursement shall include the cost to acquire any land or right-of-way needed for the public facility in addition to the actual cost to construct or install the public facility. 
B.  The city shall offer a project reimbursement agreement to each owner or developer who has constructed a public facility for the amount that the actual reasonable cost to construct or install the public facility exceeds the amount of the development impact fee that said owner or developer would be obligated to pay under this chapter. The project reimbursement agreement shall obligate the payment of said amount to the owner or developer provided that the obligation shall be limited to funds contained in the development impact fee account for the type of public facility constructed or installed by the owner or developer. Neither the general fund nor any other fund shall be liable for the payment of the amount contained in the project reimbursement agreement. The priority of the use of funds in each development impact fee account shall be reserved to the city council such that it may determine what funds shall be used to construct public facilities and what funds shall be used to make payments to owners and developers under any project reimbursement agreement. 
C.  No project reimbursement agreement authorized by this chapter shall be for a term of more than ten (10) years from execution, unless otherwise provided in a development agreement approved by the city. The form and substance of any such reimbursement agreement shall be determined by the city engineer and the city attorney.

Chapter 4.46 - PUBLIC ARTS FEE, FUND AND PROGRAM 
 
4.46.010 - Purpose. 
A.  California Government Code Section 15813 recognizes that the city has a responsibility for expanding public experience with art. 
B.  Cultural and artistic resources, including artwork and the performing arts, enhance the quality of life for individuals living in, working in, and visiting the city. 
C.  Balanced development of cultural and artistic resources preserves and improves the quality of the urban environment and increases real property values. 
D.  As development and revitalization of the real property within the city continue, the opportunity for creation of cultural and artistic resources is diminished. As this development and revitalization continue as a result of market forces, urbanization of the community results. As these opportunities are diminished and this urbanization occurs, the need to develop alternative sources for cultural and artistic outlets to improve the environment, image and character of the community is increased. 
E.  Development of cultural and artistic assets should be financed by those whose development and revitalization diminishes the availability of the community's resources for those opportunities and contributes to community urbanization. 
F.  Establishment of this art in public places program ("APPP") will promote the general welfare through balancing the community's physical growth with revitalization and its cultural and artistic resources. 
(Ord. No. 1034, § 6, 1-11-12)

(1)  Art exhibitions or displays; 
(2)  Promotion of art education within the community, either separate from or complementary to art programs of schools, museums or other nonprofit organizations. 
G.  Replacement.

4.46.060 - Certificates of occupancy. 
A.  No final city approval, such as final inspection or a certificate of occupancy, for any project subject to this chapter shall be granted or issued unless and until full compliance with the public arts program is achieved, in one or more of the following ways: 
(1)  The approved artwork has been placed in a manner satisfactory to the commission. 
(2)  In-lieu art fees have been paid. 
(3)  Financial security in an amount equal to the acquisition and installation costs of an approved artwork, in a form approved by the city attorney, have been posted.

(Ord. No. 1034, § 11, 1-11-12)  
4.46.070 - Requirement to provide artwork or pay development fee. 
A.  The applicant shall be deemed to have satisfied his or her obligations under this chapter through the placement of artwork in a manner consistent with this chapter, valued at an amount equal to the program allocation. 
B.  In lieu of placement of an approved artwork, the applicant may, at his or her discretion, pay to the city for deposit into the public arts fund an amount equal to the program allocation set forth in subsection (D) of this section. 
C.  Fees are to be collected with respect to all projects prior to issuance of a building permit, except in the case of residential developments of more than one dwelling unit, where the fee shall be collected on a pro rata basis for each dwelling when it receives its final inspection or certificate of occupancy, whichever occurs first. 
D.  The program allocation, as used in this chapter, is the percentage of the building cost which is set aside for the city's public arts program. The total building valuation shall be computed using the latest building valuation data as set forth by the International Conference of Building Officials (ICBO) unless, in the opinion of the building official, a different valuation measure more accurately represents the value of the building.

(3)  One-quarter (¼) of one percent for new residential subdivisions or developments of two or more units, whether by detached single-family residential structures, condominiums, apartments, duplexes, townhouses or other dwelling units being built in the same tract by the same owner or developer. A project shall be considered a development of two or more units when two or more building permits are issued to the same person for development of new residential structures within a one-hundred-eighty-day period; 
(4)  One-quarter (¼) of one percent for new individual single-family residential units constructed on a lot located in an existing subdivision for that portion of building permit valuation in excess of two hundred thousand dollars ($200,000.00). 
E.  Nothing in this section shall prohibit the applicant from placing an approved artwork with acquisition and installation costs in an amount less than the program allocation; provided that the applicant shall also pay to the public arts fund an amount equal to the difference between the program allocation and the costs of acquisition and installation of such artwork. 
F.  Nothing herein shall restrict the city council from waiving the requirements of this chapter, in whole or in part, with respect to any project otherwise subject to the provisions of this chapter, provided that the city council determines that the project applicant has entered into an agreement with the city providing for the applicant's acquisition and installation of artwork in connection with the development of the project which addresses the goals and aims of this chapter in a manner equally or more favorable to the city than would be achieved by strict compliance with this chapter. In such an event, the city council shall make findings to this effect on the basis of substantial evidence. 
(Ord. No. 1034, § 12, 1-11-12)

The following criteria shall be considered in the selection of artwork: 
(1)  Quality of the artwork; 
(2)  Media. All visual art forms may be considered, subject to limitations set by the selection jury or the commission; 
(3)  Style. Artworks of all schools, styles, and tastes should be considered for the city collection; 
(4)  Environment. Artworks and art places should be appropriate in scale, material, form and content for the immediate, general, social and physical environments with which they relate; 
(5)  Permanence. Consideration should be given to structural and surface integrity, permanence, and protection against theft, vandalism, weathering, excessive maintenance, and repair costs; 
(6)  Elements of design. Consideration should take into account that public art, in addition to meeting aesthetic requirements, also may serve to establish focal points, terminate areas, modify, enhance, or define specific spaces, or establish identity; 
(7)  Diversity. The public arts program should strive for diversity of style, scale, media, artists, including ethnicity and gender and equitable distribution of artworks and art places throughout the city. 
B.  The following methods may be used to select artwork: 
(1)  Direct Purchase. A completed work of art may be purchased for a specific project or location; 
(2)  Direct Commission. An artist may be chosen directly by an artist-selection jury and paid to submit a proposal. Artists will be selected on the basis of their qualifications for a particular project and its probability of successful completion; 
(3)  Limited Competition. A small number of artists may be invited and paid by the selection jury to submit proposals; 
(4)  Open Competition. Any artist may apply subject to limitations established by the selection jury. No proposal fee is paid to artists; however, a small number of finalists may be selected to submit details, models or plans for which a fee is paid. 
C.  In selecting an artwork, the commission may appoint a selection jury of qualified persons. The jury shall be subject to the provisions of the Brown Act.

4.46.100 - Maintenance of artwork on public and private property. 
A.  Public Artwork on Public Property. A maintenance fund shall be established as part of the public arts program. Procedures for custody, maintenance and conservation of artwork shall be established by the commission as well as a maintenance schedule. Specific instructions for care of each work shall be kept on file as part of the collection management. The commission will strive to include maintenance provisions in the artwork contracts that stipulate the length of time (typically one year) the artist will be responsible for repairs, that urge artists to provide a maintenance manual, and that allow the artist first-refusal on repair contracts within the fair market rate of remuneration. Regular inspection-for-condition reporting shall be conducted so that the collection is maintained in the best possible condition as supervised by designated city personnel. When necessary, a conservation plan will be established prioritizing the work which is to be done. 
B.  Private Artwork on Private Property. The obligation to provide all maintenance necessary to preserve the artwork in good condition shall remain with the owner of the site. Art installed on or integrated into a construction project pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall not be removed or altered without the approval of the commission. Artwork installed pursuant to this chapter shall be maintained as specified in the written agreement between the city and the private property owner with regard to that artwork. Maintenance of artwork, as used in this chapter, shall include without limitation, preservation of the artwork in good condition to the satisfaction of the city, protection of the artwork against physical defacement, mutilation or alteration, and securing and maintaining fire and extended coverage insurance against vandalism and other similar acts in an amount to be determined by the city attorney. Prior to placement of an approved artwork, applicant and the owner of the site shall execute and record a covenant in a form approved by the city for maintenance of the artwork. Failure to maintain the artwork as provided herein is declared to be a public nuisance. If the artwork is not maintained in the manner prescribed, or is removed or altered without approval of the commission, in addition to all other remedies provided by law, the city may, upon reasonable notice, perform all necessary repairs, maintenance, secure insurance, or take such legal or other action deemed necessary to have the artwork maintained and if necessary, restored, and the costs therefor shall become a lien against the real property. 
(Ord. No. 1034, § 15, 1-11-12)  
4.46.110 - Application procedures for placement of artwork on private property. 
Any artwork being placed on private property as part of the city's public arts program shall be a one-of-a-kind piece.

Chapter 4.48 - COACHELLA VALLEY MULTIPLE SPECIES HABITAT CONSERVATION PLAN/NATURAL COMMUNITY CONSERVATION PLAN MITIGATION FEE[3] 

Footnotes: 
--- (3) --- 
Editor's note Ord. No. 1029, adopted September 19, 2011, amended ch. 4.48 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former ch. 4.48 pertained to the same subject matter and derived from Ord. 992, 2008. 
 
4.48.010 - Short title. 
This ordinance shall be known as the "Coachella Valley Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan/Natural Community Conservation Plan Mitigation Fee Ordinance." 
(Ord. No. 1029, 9-14-11)  
4.48.020 - Findings. 
City council finds and determines as follows: 
A.  In order to realize the goals and objectives of the Coachella Valley Multiple Species Habitat Conservation Plan/Natural Community Conservation Plan ("MSHCP") and to mitigate the impacts caused by new development in the city, lands supporting species covered by the MSHCP must be acquired, monitored and managed in order to achieve habitat conservation in perpetuity. 
B.  The local development mitigation fee (the "fee") is necessary in order to supplement the financing of the acquisition of lands supporting species covered by the MSHCP and related public services, and to pay for new development's fair share of the cost of acquisition and perpetual conservation. 
C.  The appropriate source of funding for the costs associated with mitigating the impacts of new development to the natural ecosystems and covered species within the city, as identified in the MSHCP, is a fee paid for by residential, commercial and industrial development. The amount of the fee is determined by the nature and extent of the impacts from the development to the identified natural ecosystems and the relative cost of mitigating such impacts. 
D.  The fee does not reflect the entire cost of the lands which need to be acquired and perpetually conserved in order to implement the MSHCP and mitigate the impact caused by new development. Additional revenues will be required from other sources. The city finds that the benefit to each development project is greater than the amount of the fee to be paid by that project. 
E.  The use of the fee is apportioned relative to the type and extent of impacts caused by the development. 
F.  The costs of funding the proper mitigation for natural ecosystems and covered species identified in the MSHCP which are impacted by new development are apportioned relative to the type and extent of impacts caused by the development. 
G.  The facts and evidence provided to and considered by the city council establish that there is a reasonable relationship between the need for acquiring and conserving in perpetuity the natural ecosystems and covered species identified in the MSHCP, and the impacts to such natural ecosystems and species created by the types of development on which the fee will be imposed; and that there is a reasonable relationship between the fee's use and the types of development for which the fee is charged. This reasonable relationship is described in more detail in the mitigation fee nexus report. 
H.  The fees collected pursuant to this ordinance are reasonable and will not exceed the estimated total cost of the acquisition and perpetual conservation of the lands necessary to protect natural ecosystems and covered species, the plan and schedules for which are set forth in the MSHCP. Conservation of the land shall require monitoring and management beyond the life of the MSHCP permit. 
I.  The fee shall be used to finance the acquisition and perpetual conservation of lands and certain improvements necessary to implement the goals and objectives of the MSHCP. 
(Ord. No. 1029, 9-14-11)  
4.48.030 - Administrative responsibility.

If the mixed use includes residential units, the fee applicable to the parcels upon which residential units are to be sited shall be calculated by reference to the appropriate residential fee category. If the mixed use occurs on the same parcel, the fee which is applicable to commercial or industrial projects shall be calculated by reference to the project area of the parcel. A fee schedule which contains the fee which is applicable to each of the five fee categories shall be adopted and may, from time to time, be amended by resolution ("resolution"). 
The amount of the fee required to be paid for a commercial or industrial project shall be based on the project area, as calculated by city staff based on the subdivision map, plot plan, and/or other information submitted to or required by the city.

A.  The fee shall be paid in full at the time of the issuance of a building permit for the project; provided, however, that if the city's municipal code provides for all fees assessed pursuant to the Mitigation Fee Act to be collected at a later time, then the fee collected pursuant to this ordinance shall be collected at the same time as that mandated by the city's municipal code for the payment of all such other fees. 
B.  In no event shall a final inspection be made or a certificate of occupancy be issued prior to full payment of the fee. 
C.  The fee shall be assessed one time per lot or parcel, except in cases of the construction of additional residential units, subsequent development of portions of a commercial or industrial parcel for which the fee was not originally collected, or changes in land use. The additional fee required to be paid in the case of such exceptions shall not include the amount of any previously paid fee for that parcel. No refunds shall be provided for changes in land use to a lower fee category. It shall be the responsibility of the applicant to provide documentation of any previously paid fee. 
D.  The fee required to be paid under this ordinance shall be the fee in effect at the time of payment. 
E.  Notwithstanding anything in the city's municipal code, or any other written documentation to the contrary, the fee shall be paid whether or not the project is subject to conditions of approval by the city.

Projects that paid the FTL HCP fee are required to pay the local development mitigation fee but may obtain a refund of the FTL HCP fee from CVCC. Refunds shall be granted subject to the rules and regulations established by the Coachella Valley Conservation Commission. 
(Ord. No. 1029, 9-14-11)  
4.48.090 - Collection, accounting and disbursement of local development mitigation fees. 
A.  Subject to the provisions of this section, all fees collected pursuant to this chapter shall be collected, administered and remitted for deposit into the account established therefore, to the commission in compliance with all applicable policies and procedures of the commission monthly.

Such application may be made before, at or within six months after payment of the prescribed license tax. The applicant shall, by sworn statement and supporting testimony, show this method of business and the gross volume or estimated gross volume of business and such other information as the director of finance may deem necessary in order to determine the extent of any of the such undue burden or violation. The director of finance shall then conduct an investigation and, after having first obtained the written approval of the city attorney, shall fix as the license tax for the applicant an amount that is reasonable and nondiscriminatory, or if the license tax has already been paid, shall order a refund of the amount over and above the license tax so fixed. In fixing the license tax to be charged, the director of finance shall have the power to base the license tax upon a percentage of gross receipts or any other measure which will assure that the license tax assessed shall be uniform with that assessed on business of like nature, so long as the amount assessed does not exceed the license tax as prescribed by this chapter. Should the director of finance determine the gross receipts measure of license tax to be the proper basis, he or she may require the applicant to submit, either at the time of termination of applicant's business in the city or at the end of each three-month period, a sworn statement of the gross receipts and pay the amount of license tax therefor; provided, that no additional license tax during any one calendar year shall be required after the license shall have paid an amount equal to the annual license tax as prescribed in this chapter.

5.16.020 - General provisions. 
A.  Scope of City's Authority. The city may grant one or more franchises, and each such franchise shall be awarded in accordance with and subject to the provisions of this chapter. However, no franchise shall be granted on terms or conditions more favorable or less burdensome than those contained in any existing franchise. 
B.  Franchise Required. A franchise is required of any person desiring to construct, operate and maintain a cable system within all or any portion of the city. A franchise may be granted by the city council to any person, whether operating under an existing franchise or not, who or which offers to furnish and provide such cable system under and pursuant to the terms and provisions of this chapter and a franchise agreement acceptable to the city council. The grant of a cable franchise is not an authorization to provide other services except as may otherwise be permitted under applicable state or federal law, nor is it a bar to the imposition of other compensation requirements. 
C.  Rights Reserved to City. The city expressly reserves the following rights: 
1.  To exercise its governmental powers, now or hereafter, to the full extent that such powers may be vested in or granted to the city. 
2.  To adopt and promulgate ordinances as it shall find reasonably necessary in the exercise of its lawful police power. Such power shall include all rights the city may have under 47 U.S.C. § 552 and the right of the city to manage the public rights-of-way and to adopt such lawful regulations of general applicability relating to the management of the public rights-of-way as the city and/or its departments shall provide. Nothing in a franchise agreement shall be deemed to waive the requirements of the various codes and ordinances of the city regarding permits, fees to be paid, or manner of construction. 
The powers of the city may be exercised through a mutually agreed upon amendment of this chapter as well as through enactment of separate ordinances and regulations of general applicability. 
D.  Unlawful Acts. It is unlawful for any person to establish, operate or carry on the business of distributing to any persons in the city any television signals or radio signals by means of a cable system unless a franchise therefor has first been obtained pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, and unless such franchise is in full force and effect. 
It is unlawful for any person to make any unauthorized connection, whether physically, electrically, acoustically, inductively, or otherwise, with any part of a franchised cable system within the city for the purpose of enabling himself or herself or others to receive any television signal, radio signal, picture, program or sound, without payment to the owner of the cable system. 
It is unlawful for any person without the consent of grantee, to willfully tamper with, remove or injure any cables, wires or equipment used for distribution of television signals, radio signals, pictures, programs or sound. 
E.  Failure of City to Enforce Compliance. A grantee shall not be excused from complying with any of the provisions of this chapter or the terms and conditions of a franchise agreement by any failure of the city, upon any one or more occasions, to insist upon the grantee's performance or to seek grantee's compliance with any of the provisions of this chapter or terms or conditions of a franchise agreement. 
F.  Franchise Fees. Grantee shall pay to the city five percent of its gross receipts as a franchise fee. 
The franchise fee shall be payable quarterly to the city. Upon request by the city, the grantee shall file a complete statement listing receipts included in the gross receipts during the period for which such quarterly payment is made. Such payment shall be made to the city treasurer not later than sixty (60) days after the end of each calendar quarter. The grantee shall also provide annually within ninety (90) days after the end of the fiscal year a report certified as to accuracy by a certified public accountant, who may be an employee of grantee, verifying each revenue item included in gross revenues and an explanation of the source documents and methodology used in the calculation of each revenue that constitutes gross revenue and gross receipts. 
City may examine all applicable records of the grantee to determine accuracy of amounts payable to city. 
The city shall have right to audit and to recompute any amounts determined to be payable under this chapter; provided, however, that such audit shall take place within thirty-six (36) months following the close of each of the grantee's fiscal years. Any additional undisputed amount due to the city as a result of the audit shall be paid within thirty (30) days following written notice to the grantee by the city. Such notice to the grantee shall include a copy of the audit report. The city will bear the cost of the city audit, provided, however, that if such audit indicates a franchise fee underpayment of five percent or more of the amount due, grantee shall assume all reasonable costs of such audit. 
In the event that grantee does not make the franchise fee payment or an undisputed recomputed amount is not made on or before the applicable dates heretofore specified, following notice by the city to the grantee, interest shall be charged daily from such applicable date at the annual rate equivalent to the then existing prime rate of the largest bank in the city. 
G.  Franchise Term. The term of a franchise shall be for the number of years negotiated in the franchise agreement with the city unless terminated earlier in accordance with this chapter. 
H.  Grantee to be Bound by Terms and Conditions of this Chapter and Franchise Agreement. In case of conflict, franchise agreement supersedes this chapter. 
In the event of a conflict between the franchise agreement and the provisions of this chapter, the provisions of the franchise agreement shall prevail. Failure to provide services as promised in grantee's franchise may be deemed a breach of this chapter to which the provisions of Section 5.16.140 and Section 5.16.150 of this chapter shall apply. 
(Prior code § A-2-2)  
5.16.030 - Requirements for issuing new cable television franchises.

An applicant to whom the city council grants a nonexclusive initial franchise, in addition to the nonrefundable fee specified herein above, shall pay to the city, within thirty (30) days of receipt of notice of the amount, an amount set by the city council, or its designee, which shall represent the remaining out-of-pocket costs incurred by the city, in granting the franchise and not defrayed by fees forthcoming from the provisions of Section 5.16.030(A). 
C.  Procedure Required by City to Process an Application and/or Require a Request for Proposals. 
1.  Upon receipt of an application, the city may either: (i) evaluate the application pursuant to subsection (C)(4) of this section, conducting such investigations as it deems necessary; or (ii) issue a request for proposals after conducting a proceeding, if necessary, to identify the future cable related needs and interests of the community. Any such request for proposals shall be provided to the person applying for an initial franchise and made available to any other interested party. The request for proposals may contain a proposed franchise agreement. 
2.  An applicant shall respond to a request for proposals by filing an application with the city within the time directed by the city that contains the information and material set forth in subsection D of this section. The procedures, instructions, and requirements set forth in the request for proposals shall be followed by each applicant. Any applicant that has already filed an application need not refile the same materials with its response to the request for proposals, but must supplement its application to include any additional or different information or material required of the request for proposals. The city or its designee may seek additional information from any applicant and establish deadlines for the submission of such information. 
3.  Notwithstanding the provisions in this section, a person may apply for an initial franchise by submitting an unsolicited application containing the information required in subsection D of this section, and requesting an evaluation of that application pursuant to subsection (C)(4) of this section. Prior to evaluating such an application, the city may conduct such investigations as are necessary to determine whether the application satisfies the standards set forth in subsection (C)(4) of this section. The city may seek additional applications. 
4.  In evaluating an application for a franchise, the city shall consider, among other things, the following factors: 
a.  Whether the applicant has the financial, technical, and legal qualifications to provide cable service; 
b.  Whether the application satisfies any minimum requirements established by the city and is otherwise reasonable to meet the future cable-related needs and interests of the community, taking into account the cost of meeting such needs and interests; 
c.  Whether the applicant will provide adequate public, educational, and governmental access channel capacity, facilities or financial support; 
d.  Whether issuance of a franchise is in the public interest considering the immediate and future effect on the public rights-of-way and private property that would be affected by the cable system, including the extent to which installation or maintenance as planned would require replacement of property or involve disruption of property, public services, or use of the public rights-of-way, the effect of granting a franchise on the ability of an existing franchisee, if any, to meet the cable related needs and interests of the community and the comparative superiority or inferiority of competing applications; and 
e.  What effects a grant of a franchise may have on competition in the delivery of cable service in the city. 
5.  If the city finds that it is in the public interest to issue a franchise after considering the factors set forth above, and subject to the applicant's entry into a franchise agreement, it shall issue a franchise. If the city denies an application for an initial franchise, it will issue a written decision setting forth its reasons for denial. Prior to deciding whether or not to issue a franchise, the city will hold one or more public hearings or implement other procedures under which comments from the public on an application may be received. The city may reject any application that is incomplete or fails to respond to a request for proposals. This chapter is not intended and shall not be interpreted to grant any applicant standing to challenge the denial of its application or the issuance of a franchise to another applicant.

A grantee shall submit to the city an original application (FCC Form 394 or any successor form thereto) and four copies, unless otherwise directed, which application shall fully describe the terms and conditions of the action or proposed action subject to this section and clearly state the basis on which the application should be approved. 
At any time during the review process, the city reserves the right to request additional supporting documentation from a grantee or any other person involved in the action or proposed action, all in accordance with federal law. A grantee shall provide all reasonably requested assistance to the city in connection with any such inquiry and, as appropriate, shall secure the cooperation and assistance of all other persons involved in such action, all in accordance with federal law. 
For any application requiring the city's consent pursuant to subsections A through K in this section, the city shall respond to such application within one hundred twenty (120) days from the date of filing such application and the city's receipt of all additional information required by the city pursuant to this chapter, the grantee's franchise agreement, and applicable law. Such application shall be deemed approved if the city should fail to render a final decision within one hundred twenty (120) days following the grantee's filing of the application and the city's receipt of all information reasonably required to accompany such application under this chapter, grantee's franchise agreement and applicable law. 
E.  Showings Required of Proposed Assignee or Transferee. Assignee or Transferee Must Agree to Conditions Prescribed by City. A proposed assignee or transferee must demonstrate that it possesses the legal, financial and technical qualifications necessary to perform all the terms, conditions and obligations under this chapter and the grantee's franchise agreement for the remaining term thereof, and such reasonable additional obligations required of the assignee or transferee by the city for the specific and limited purpose of assuring the performance by the assignee or transferee of all the terms, conditions and obligations of the franchise agreement.

The city may request, and assignee or transferee shall provide, all reasonable financial data relative to the transfer. In addition, assignee or transferee shall provide to the city the terms and conditions of the sale and any other information reasonably related to the assignee's or transferee's acquisition of the grantee's franchise which is needed to clarify the change in ownership. 
G.  Transfer of Control Occurs with Change of Forty-five Percent of Voting Interest or of Person Exercising Management Authority Over Grantee. For purposes of this section, "control" means the ability to exert working control, in whatever manner exercised, over the affairs of a grantee, either directly or indirectly. 
A rebuttable presumption that transfer of control has occurred, including of control in fact (i.e. transfer of de facto control), shall arise upon the acquisition or accumulation by any person, or group of persons, of forty-five (45) percent of the voting interest of a publicly held grantee, or of forty-five (45) percent of the voting interest of a privately held grantee or of the person exercising management authority over such a privately held grantee. 
H.  Transfer or Assignment without Prior Consent Deemed to be Material Breach, and May be Subject to Liquidated Damages. Any transfer or assignment of a franchise or of ownership or control of grantee without the prior consent of the city shall be null and void unless later ratified by the city and shall: (i) be deemed a material breach of a franchise agreement; and (ii) among and/or in addition to other remedies available to the city, be subject to a liquidated damages assessment, on a daily basis, until the transfer or assignment is approved, or if not approved, until the prior ownership, control or other status quo is restored to a condition satisfactory to the city. 
I.  City May Revoke Franchise if Unauthorized Transfer or Assignment Occurs. If the city fails to approve or deny its consent to any such transfer or assignment of a franchise, in accordance with federal law, or of the ownership or control of a grantee and such action has nevertheless been effected, the city may revoke a franchise and terminate a franchise agreement unless control of the grantee or the system is promptly restored to its status prior to such unauthorized action or to a status acceptable to the city. 
J.  Consent of City to Transfer or Assignment shall not Constitute Waiver of City's Rights. The consent or approval of the city council to any transfer or assignment of a franchise or of ownership or control of a franchise shall not constitute a waiver or release of any of the rights of the city unless the city specifically releases or waives such rights. 
K.  Successor Grantee Must Become Signatory to Franchise Agreement. In no event shall an assignment of a franchise or a transfer of ownership or control be approved without the successor grantee becoming a signatory to the existing franchise agreement. 
L.  Grantee Not to Enter Into Any Management Contract if Results in a Change of Control. A grantee shall not enter into any management contract or other arrangement for the management of the system, to the extent that such contract or other arrangement would result in a significant change of operational control of a grantee or the system (as defined in subsection G of this section), without the prior consent of the city. 
M.  No Prior Consent Required for Transfer or Assignment If Under Common Control. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary, no such prior consent of the city shall be required for any transfer or assignment to any person controlling, controlled by, or under the same common control as the grantee. 
(Prior code § A-2-4)  
5.16.050 - Liability and indemnification. 
A.  Indemnification of the City. 
1.  The grantee shall, at its sole cost and expense, indemnify, defend and hold harmless the city and its officials, officers, boards, commissions, agents and employees against any and all claims, suits, causes of action, proceedings and judgments for damage arising out of the operation of the cable television system under a franchise. These damages include, but are not limited to, personal injury property damage, penalties arising out of copyright infringements and antitrust violations and damages arising out of the failure by the grantee to secure consent from the owners, authorized distributors or licensees of programs to be delivered by the grantee's cable television system, whether or not any act or omission complained of is authorized, allowed or prohibited by the franchise.

2.  In order for the city to assert its rights to be indemnified and held harmless, the city must: 
a.  Promptly notify grantee of any claim or legal proceeding which gives rise to such right; 
b.  Afford grantee the opportunity to participate in and fully control any compromise, settlement, resolution or disposition of such claim or proceeding; and 
c.  Fully cooperate in the defense of such claim and make available to grantee all such information under its control relating thereto.

C.  Notice of Cancellation or Reduction of Coverage. The insurance policies mentioned above shall state that the policies are extended to cover the liability assumed by the grantee under the terms of any franchise agreement and shall contain the following endorsement. 
"It is hereby understood and agreed that this policy shall not be canceled nor the amount of coverage thereof reduced until thirty (30) days after receipt by the city by registered mail of written notice of such intent to cancel or reduce the coverage." 
D.  Evidence of Insurance Filed with the City. A certificate of insurance, on a form satisfactory to the city attorney, and written evidence of payment of required premiums shall be filed and maintained with the city during the term of this franchise or any renewal thereof. 
E.  No Waiver of Insurance or Performance Bond. Recovery by the city of any amounts under insurance, a performance bond, or otherwise does not limit a grantee's duty to indemnify the city in any way; nor shall such recovery relieve a grantee of its obligations under a franchise, limit the amounts owed to the city, or in any respect prevent the city from exercising any other right or remedy it may have pursuant to this chapter, a franchise agreement, or applicable law. 
(Prior code § A-2-5)  
5.16.060 - Cable system construction.

However, where electrical and telephone lines are now underground, all trunk, feeder and drop cable shall be constructed underground at such depths and locations as shall be required by applicable law applicable to cable television systems. Whenever and wherever electrical lines and telephone lines are moved from overhead to underground placement in an area, all cable system facilities and plant in that area shall be similarly and concurrently moved underground by the grantee at the grantee's sole cost and expense at such depths and locations as shall be required by applicable law. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the event any utility is compensated by the city for moving or relocating its facilities, then in such case the grantee shall be similarly compensated. 
G.  Grantee May Be Required to Move Its Facilities to Accommodate Changes in Public Improvements. A grantee shall, from time to time, protect, support, temporarily dislocate, or temporarily or permanently, as may be required, remove or relocate, without expense to the city or any other governmental entity, the cable system, if and when made necessary by any lawful change of grade, alignment, or width of any public street by the city or any other governmental entity, or made necessary by any other public improvement or alteration in, under, on, upon or about any public street or other public property, whether such public improvement or alteration is at the instance of the city or another governmental entity, and whether such improvement or alteration is for a governmental or proprietary function, or made necessary by traffic conditions, public safety, street vacation or any other public project or purpose of the city or any other governmental entity.

Upon failure of the grantee to complete any restoration to be done in any street or other public place, within ten (10) days following due notice and to the reasonable satisfaction of the city, the city may, at its option, cause such work to be done and a grantee shall pay to the city the cost thereof in the itemized amounts reported by the city to the grantee, within thirty (30) days after receipt of such itemized report. In the alternative, at the city's option, the city may demand of grantee the estimated cost of such work as estimated by the city, and such shall be paid by grantee to city within thirty (30) days of such demand, thereafter, upon award of any contract or contracts for such work, grantee shall pay to city within thirty (30) days of demand any additional amount necessary to provide for cost of such work.

When authorized, such trimming shall be limited to the area required for clear cable passage and shall not include major structural branches which materially alter the appearance and natural growth habits of the tree. If such trimming is not performed by the city, the grantee shall be responsible for any and all damages to any tree as a result of trimming, or to the land surrounding any tree, whether such tree is trimmed or removed, or for damage to property or person caused by such trimming and removal of any tree. 
N.  Grantee Shall Remove Cable System from Any Public Street Following Termination or Expiration of Franchise. In the event that the use of a part of the cable system is discontinued for any reason for a continuous period of twelve (12) months, or in the event such cable system or property has been installed in any street or public place without complying with the requirements of the franchise, or the franchise has been terminated, canceled or has expired without renewal, a grantee shall promptly, at its own expense, and upon being given ten (10) days' written notice from the city, remove from the streets or public places all such property and poles of such cable system other than any which the city may permit to be abandoned in place.

A copy of such log showing the outages shall be made available for review by the city. 
G.  Planned Service Interruption. A grantee may intentionally interrupt service on the cable system only for good cause and for the shortest time possible. 
H.  The City Can Require Testing of Cable System and Report on System Performance.

5.16.130 - Letter of credit or performance bond.

Within thirty (30) days after the effective date of an initial franchise, grantee shall deposit with the city an irrevocable letter of credit or obtain a performance bond in the amount set forth in the franchise agreement and issued by a local federally insured commercial lending or bonding institution that has been approved by the city. The form and substance of such letter of credit and performance bond shall be subject to approval by the city attorney. The letter of credit or the performance bond shall be used to assure: (i) the faithful performance by the grantee of all provisions of the franchise agreement and this chapter and other ordinances of the city; (ii) compliance with all orders, permits and directions of the city manager or any agency, commission, board, department, division or office of the city having jurisdiction over any aspect of the grantee's performance under a franchise and this chapter; and (iii) the payment by the grantee of any penalties, liquidated damages, claims, liens, franchise fees, taxes or other fees due to the city which arise by reason of the construction, operation or maintenance of the cable system, including cost of removal of any property of the grantee. 
The letter of credit or the performance bond may be drawn or called upon by the city by presentation of a draft on sight at the lending institution, accompanied by a written certificate signed by the city manager certifying that the grantee has failed to comply with the franchise agreement and/or this chapter, stating the nature of the noncompliance, and stating the amount being drawn or called. Examples of the nature of the noncompliance for drawing upon the letter of credit or calling upon the performance bond include, but are not limited to, the following:

In the event of such noncompliance, the city may order the withdrawal of the appropriate amount of liquidated damages, penalties, fees or otherwise from the letter of credit, performance bond or other instrument for payment to the city, provided that, prior to each such withdrawal: (i) the grantee shall be afforded an opportunity to cure any of such failures within thirty (30) days after written notice from the city that the withdrawal is being made; or (ii) if such cure cannot be reasonably accomplished within such thirty (30) days, then the grantee shall have a reasonable time to cure, provided that the grantee commences such cure within such thirty (30) days and diligently pursues such cure to completion. 
B.  Letter of Credit or Performance Bond shall be Replenished to Original Amount Following Any Draw Down. Grantee shall structure the letter of credit or performance bond in such a manner so that if the city at any time draws upon the letter of credit or performance bond, the amount of available credit or bond shall automatically increase to the extent necessary to replenish that portion of the available credit or bond exhausted by the honoring of the draft. The intent of this subsection is to make available to the city at all times a letter of credit or performance bond in the amount specified in the franchise agreement. 
C.  The City's Rights with Respect to Letter of Credit or Performance Bond are in Addition to Other Rights. The rights reserved to the city with respect to the letter of credit or performance bond are in addition to all other rights of the city, whether reserved by a franchise agreement or authorized by law, and no action or proceeding against a letter of credit or performance bond shall affect any other right the city may have. 
(Prior code § A-2-13)  
5.16.140 - Liquidated damages. 
A.  Parties Shall Agree to Specific Liquidated Damages to be Paid by Grantee for Certain Delays or Nonperformance.

B.  Procedures Outlined Leading to Possible Termination of Franchise.

If the violation breach, failure, refusal or neglect by a grantee continues for a period of thirty (30) days following such written demand without written proof that the corrective action has been taken or is being actively and expeditiously pursued, the city shall place the issue of termination of a franchise before the city council. The city shall cause to be served upon grantee, at least twenty (20) days prior to the date of such city council meeting, a written notice of intent to request such termination and the time and place of the meeting.

Any franchise granted shall, at the option of city, cease and terminate on one hundred twenty (120) days after the appointment of a receiver or receivers or trustee or trustees to take over and conduct the business of grantee whether in a receivership, reorganization, bankruptcy, or other action or proceeding unless such receivership or trusteeship shall have vacated prior to the expiration of such one hundred twenty (120) days, or unless: 
1.

The failure of the city to take any action in the event of a material breach by the grantee shall not be construed or otherwise be deemed to constitute a waiver of the right of the city to take such action at any other time in the event that such material breach has not been cured, or with respect to any other material breach by the grantee.

In the event that, after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, any court, agency, commission, legislative body, or other authority of competent jurisdiction: (i) declares the chapter invalid, in whole or in part; or (ii) requires the grantee either to: (a) perform any act which is inconsistent with any provision of this chapter; or (b) cease performing any act required by any provision of this chapter, and the grantee intends to exercise its rights pursuant to such declaration, the grantee shall so notify the city of such declaration or requirement.

7.05.010 - Declaration of findings and policy. 
It is hereby found and declared that: 
A.  Due to inadequate supervision, some large gatherings of people, such as parties, frequently become loud and unruly to the point that they constitute a threat to the peace, health, safety, or general welfare of the public as a result of conduct such as one or more of the following: excessive noise, excessive traffic, obstruction of public streets or crowds who have spilled over into public streets, public drunkenness, the service of alcohol to minors, fights, disturbances of the peace, and litter. 
B.  The city of Coachella is required to make multiple responses to such unruly gatherings in order to restore and maintain the peace and protect public safety. Such gatherings are a burden on scarce city resources and can result in police responses to regular and emergency calls being delayed and police protection to the rest of the city being reduced. 
C.  In order to discourage the occurrence of repeated loud and unruly gatherings, the persons responsible for the public nuisance created by these gatherings should be fined. 
(Ord. No. 1023, § 1, 11-17-10; Ord. No. 1025, 11-17-10)  
7.05.020 - Loud or unruly gatheringsPublic nuisance. 
It shall be unlawful and a public nuisance to conduct a gathering of ten (10) or more persons on any private property in a manner which constitutes a substantial disturbance of the quiet enjoyment of private or public property in a significant segment of a neighborhood, as a result of conduct constituting a violation of law. Illustrative of such unlawful conduct is excessive noise or traffic, obstruction of public streets by crowds or vehicles, public drunkenness, the service of alcohol to minors, fights, disturbances of the peace, litter. A gathering constituting a public nuisance may be abated by the city by all reasonable means including, but not limited to, an order requiring the gathering to be disbanded and citation and/or arrest of any law violators under any applicable local laws and state statutes. 
(Ord. No. 1023, § 1, 11-17-10; Ord. No. 1025, 11-17-10)  
7.05.030 - Notice of unruly gatheringsPosting, mail. 
A.  When the city intervenes at a gathering which constitutes a public nuisance under this chapter, the premises at which such nuisance occurred shall be posted with a notice substantially in the form attached hereto as Exhibit "A" stating that a public nuisance under this chapter was caused by a gathering at the premises, the date and time of the police intervention, and that any subsequent or second police intervention with respect to a nuisance under this chapter at said premises, including a second intervention that same day or night, within sixty (60) days of the first intervention, shall result in the joint and several liability of any guests causing the public nuisance, persons who are residents or in control of the property at which the public nuisance occurred, persons who sponsored the gathering constituting the public nuisance, and owners of the premises as more fully set forth in Sections 7.05.0407.05.060, below. The residents and persons in control of such property, and the sponsors of the event, shall be responsible for ensuring that such notice is not removed or defaced and shall be liable for a civil penalty of one hundred dollars ($100.00) in addition to any other penalties which may be due under this chapter, if such notice is removed or defaced, provided, however, that the residents of the premises or sponsor of the event, if present, shall be consulted as to the location in which such notice is posted in order to achieve both the security of the notice and its prominent display. The notice shall remain posted for the entire 60-day period. 
B.  Notice of the police intervention shall also be mailed to any property owner at the address shown on the city's property tax assessment records and shall advise the property owner that any subsequent gathering resulting in a public nuisance within sixty (60) days on the same premises necessitating city intervention shall result in liability of the property owner for all penalties associated with such intervention as more particularly set forth below.

7.05.040 - Persons liable for subsequent response to a gathering constituting a public nuisance. 
If the city is required to intervene as to a gathering constituting a public nuisance on the same premises more than once in any 60-day period, including a second intervention during the same day or night as the first intervention, the following persons shall be jointly and severally liable for civil penalties as set forth in Section 7.05.050, below, in addition to liability for any injuries to city personnel or damage to city property. 
A.  The person or persons who own the premises where the gathering constituting a public nuisance took place if any of the following are the case: 
(1)  Said owner resides on or adjacent to the premises; 
(2)  Said owner was present when the notice described in Exhibit "A" was first posted; or 
(3)  The notice described in Exhibit "A" was mailed to said owner and fourteen (14) days have elapsed since the date of said mailing. 
For purposes of this subsection, where a gathering takes place within the confines of a single unit in a building owned by a housing cooperative, the owner of the property shall be deemed to be the owner of the single unit and not the members of the housing cooperative in general. Where the gathering took place in the common area of a building owned by a housing cooperative, only the members of the cooperative owning units in the building where the gathering took place shall be deemed the owners of the property for purposes of this subsection. Other members of the housing cooperative may still be liable if they fall within the categories of person made liable by Section 7.05.040, subsections (B), (C), or (D), below. 
B.  The person or persons residing on or otherwise in control of the property where such gathering took place. 
C.  The person or persons who organized or sponsored such gathering. 
D.  All persons attending such gathering who engaged in any activity resulting in the public nuisance. 
E.  Nothing in this section shall be construed to impose liability on the resident or owners of the premises or sponsor of the gathering, for the conduct of persons who are present without the express or implied consent of the resident or sponsor, as long as the resident and sponsor have taken all steps reasonably necessary to exclude such uninvited participants from the premises. Where an invited guest engages in conduct which the sponsor or resident could not reasonably foresee and the conduct is an isolated instance of a guest at the event violating the law which the sponsor is unable to reasonably control without the intervention of the police, the unlawful conduct of the individual guest shall not be attributable to the sponsor, owner, or resident for the purposes of determining whether the event constitutes a public nuisance under this section. 
F.  There shall be no liability for civil penalties under this chapter for a subsequent intervention during the same day or night as the prior intervention, unless a reasonable time has been provided to abate the public nuisance, taking into account the size of the gathering, the time of day, and other relevant factors. 
G.  There shall be no liability for civil penalties under this chapter for a second response during the same day or night as the first response when a person who would otherwise be liable under subsection (A) seeks assistance from the police department to abate a public nuisance under this chapter, and the person cooperates fully with the police while taking reasonable action to abate the public nuisance. 
H.  If the city is required to intervene at a gathering constituting a public nuisance on the same premises more than once in any 60-day period, excluding a second intervention during the same day or night as the first intervention, the 60-day period shall be extended by another sixty (60) days from the date of the second intervention.

7.05.050 - Recovery of subsequent response fee. 
A.  After given proper notice pursuant to Section 7.05.030 and a reasonable opportunity to abate a gathering constituting a public nuisance, a subsequent response fee shall be assessed against all persons liable for the city's intervention. The subsequent response fee shall include: 
1.  The actual cost to the city of law enforcement services incurred as a result of a subsequent response; 
2.  The actual cost of any medical treatment required by a police officer for injuries sustained during a subsequent response; and 
3.  The cost of repairing or replacing any city equipment or property damaged or destroyed during a subsequent response. 
B.  Except as provided in subsection (A) of this section, the subsequent response fee shall not exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) for any subsequent response. 
C.  The remedies set forth in this chapter shall be in addition to any other penalties imposed by law for particular violations of law committed during the course of an event which is a public nuisance under this chapter, provided however, that if the only violation of law which constituted the public nuisance under this chapter is excessive noise, the remedies provided under this chapter shall be exclusive of any other remedies provided by law to the city for such excessive noise. 
D.  The city shall bill all persons liable for subsequent response fees by mail by sending a letter in substantially the form attached hereto as Exhibit "B." Payment of the fees shall be due within thirty (30) days of the date the bill is deposited in the mail. If full payment is not received within the required time for payment, the bill will be delinquent, and all persons liable for the fees shall be charged interest at the maximum legal rate from the date the payment period expires and a further civil penalty in the amount of one hundred dollars ($100.00).

Dear: 
The City of Coachella was required to abate the public nuisance caused by a gathering of 10 or more persons at (location of property), which substantially disrupted the quiet enjoyment of property in a significant segment of the adjacent neighborhood. This is the (second/third/fourth, etc.) such public nuisance at this property within the last 60 days, and thus, a fee of ________ is imposed on you. If you fail to remit this fine to the City of Coachella by (30 days from the date of this notification) you will be liable for an additional $100 penalty, plus interest. The payment should be remitted to the address listed below. Your liability is based on the fact that you were: 
[ ] An owner of the property to whom was sent prior notice of a public nuisance at the property within the previous 60 days; and/or 
[ ] An owner of the property who resided on or adjacent to the property when the public nuisance took place; and/or 
[ ] An owner of the property who was present when a Notice of a public nuisance was first posted at the property; and/or 
[ ] A person who resided on or was otherwise in control of the property when the public nuisance took place there; and/or 
[ ] A person who organized or sponsored the event that created the public nuisance at such property; and/or 
[ ] A person who attended the event constituting the public nuisance at such property and engaged in the conduct which resulted in the public nuisance. 
If you believe that you are not liable you may defend this claim in the civil action which the City of Coachella will file against you upon your failure to remit the fee. You should be aware, however, that if you fail to prevail in that action you will be liable for the additional penalty of $100 and interest on the total fee. 
Sincerely yours,

Chapter 8.48 - GRAFFITI[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note Section 1, Exhibit A of Ord. No. 1042, adopted Apr. 11, 2012, amended ch. 8.48 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former ch. 8.48 pertained to the same subject matter, consisted of §§ 8.48.0108.48.060 and derived from the prior code; and Urgency Ord. No. 1041, adopted Mar. 28, 2012. 
 
8.48.010 - Purpose and intent of chapter. 
A.  Graffiti on public and private property is a blighting factor which not only depreciates the value of the property, but also the value of the adjacent and surrounding communities. Government Code Section 53069.3 authorizes this city to enact ordinances to provide for use of city funds to remove graffiti from public and privately owned permanent structures located within the city. The city council finds that graffiti or related inscribed material is obnoxious and pursuant to Government Code Section 53069.3 authorizes that a program be instituted allowing for the use of city funds to remove graffiti on public and private property. It is the intent of the city council to provide for the prohibition of the placement of graffiti on public and private property as set forth in this chapter. 
B.  The city council finds and determines that graffiti is obnoxious and a public nuisance, and, unless promptly removed from public and privately owned properties, tends to remain and to attract more graffiti; other properties are then the target of graffiti, with the results that entire neighborhoods, and, indeed, the community is depreciated in value and becomes a less desirable place to live, shop and visit. The city council therefore determines that it is appropriate that the city develop new procedures to implement the provisions of Section 53069.3 of the Government Code and provide for the expedient removal of graffiti from both public and privately owned property under the circumstances set forth hereinafter. The city council further determines that it is appropriate to provide regulations relating to the display for sale of aerosol paint containers and marking pens and to provide penalties relating to possession of graffiti implements for the purpose of engaging in graffiti vandalism. 
C.  Government Code Sections 38772, 38773.2, and 38773.6 authorize cities to adopt ordinances making the expense of abating graffiti caused by certain minors or other persons: 
(1)  A personal obligation of the minor (and of the parents or guardians having custody and control of the minor) and/or other persons, and 
(2)  A lien or special assessment against property of the minor (and property of the parents or guardians having custody and control of the minor) and/or other persons.

As used herein, "sheeting material" or "sheeting" means a minimum of .20-inch thick clear or semi-clear shatter-proof polycarbonate material with a strength capable of sustaining impact without breaking or shattering, absent excessive force. For example, such polycarbonate material shall be capable of sustaining a human propelled brick without breaking or shattering. Examples of such sheeting strength yields would include strength yields equal or greater than American Society for Testing and Materials (ASDM) D638 Tensile Strength, Yield value of eight thousand (8000) psi. Sheeting shall be installed in a manner intended to provide an appearance approximating glass in the window casings, and consistent in appearance with the surrounding surface in the case of all other openings that require securing. Unless otherwise granted a variance by the building authority from strict compliance herewith, materials such as particle board, wafer board, Masonite or other similar material shall not be used for boarding up property. 
C.  Boarding StandardWindows. 
1.  Internal Compression Method. Windows with broken, missing, or removed glass, or that are otherwise unsecure, shall be boarded as follows: 
a.  All remaining broken glass shall be removed from the window opening including damaged frames as to provide a clean opening; 
b.  The sheeting material shall be cut to match the dimensions of the inside of the window casing so that when installed, the sheeting will fit tightly and not permit a tool to be placed behind it; 
c.  A ½-inch hole shall be drilled into each of the four corners of the sheeting material. The holes shall be positioned so they are no more than 1-inch from the window frame at the width and no more than six inches from the window sill and top frame; 
d.  Two solid continuous composite cross-beams shall be cut in sufficient length to be no less than eight inches longer than the horizontal width of the interior window casing. Each cross-beam shall be predrilled with 7/16 -inch holes that are positioned to match the horizontal pattern of the holes in the sheeting; 
e.  The sheeting shall be secured in place over the exterior of the window opening by placing a 3/8 -inch corrosion resistant, smooth-head carriage bolt through each of the holes in the sheeting and then placing one washer onto each of the carriage bolts; the cross-beams shall then be aligned and affixed to such carriage bolts from the interior of the window opening. Another nut and washer shall be placed onto each of the carriage bolts and tightened with a ratchet to achieve sufficient torque and a slight deflection in the cross-beams so that the nuts cannot be loosened by hand. Once secured, no space shall exist between the sheeting and the exterior window casing. 
2.  Exterior Screw Method. Fixed or inoperable windows with intact glass; or windows in which the internal compression method is impractical shall be secured as follows: 
A.  The sheeting material shall be cut to match the dimensions of the inside of the window casing so that when installed, the sheeting will fit tightly and not permit a tool to be placed behind it; 
B.  Drill and countersink holes shall be made along the perimeter of the sheeting material starting with a hole at each of the four corners and adding additional holes at 10-inch increments around the perimeter of the sheeting. Minimum length 2-inch corrosion resistant security head screws shall be used in each hole to affix the sheeting to the window frame or exterior casing. 
C.  In the event the sheeting cannot be secured by cutting the sheeting material so as to neatly fit the inside window casing, the sheeting shall be placed over the exterior window casing such that the sheeting material covers the entire window casing and extends beyond the window casing at least 8 inches on center. The sheeting material shall be secured with minimum length 2-inch corrosion resistant security head screws secured at the corners, and along the sheeting outer edges in 10-inch spaced increments as described in subsection a. above. 
3.  Variance. If circumstances make the foregoing methods of installation impractical such as due to excessive frame, door and wall damage, or windows that are in an arc encasing or other unusual inset or characteristic the window or opening shall still be installed with the sheeting, but may be affixed and secured in any manner approved by the building authority as to achieve substantial compliance with this chapter. 
D.  Boarding StandardUnsecure Doors; Sliding or Other Doors. 
1.  Exterior Access Door. At least one exterior door shall allow authorized persons access to the interior of the property. Such exterior access door may be secured by: (a) using a solid core wood or steel door with no windows or other openings in the door; (b) or hinged sheeting material. The door shall be securely locked using a padlock and hasp assembly that is bolted through the door or sheeting material. The lock loop portion of the hasp shall be attached to the door frame using a minimum of 3-inch long security screws. 
2.  Sliding Glass Doors and Other Exterior Doors. Sliding glass doors or exterior doors other than the exterior access door shall be secured in the same manner as described in Section 8.60.060(C). 
E.  If the property is owned by a corporation and/or out of area beneficiary, trustee or owner, a local property management company shall be contracted to perform weekly inspections to verify that the requirements of this section, and any other applicable laws, are being met. 
F.  The property shall be posted with the name and twenty-four (24) hour contact phone number of the local property management company. The posting shall be no less than eighteen (18) inches by twenty-four (24) inches, shall be of a font that is legible from a distance of forty-five (45) feet, and shall contain the following verbiage: "THIS PROPERTY MANAGED BY ____________," and "TO REPORT PROBLEMS OR CONCERNS CALL (name and phone number)." 
G.  The posting shall be placed on the interior of a window facing the street to the front of the property so it is visible from the street, or secured to the exterior of the building/structure facing the street of the front of the property so it is visible from the street. If no such area exists, the posting shall be on a stake of sufficient size to support the posting, in a location that is visible from the street to the front of the property, and to the extent possible, not readily accessible to potential vandalism. Exterior posting must be constructed of, and printed with weather resistant materials. 
H.  The local property management company shall inspect the property on a weekly basis to determine if the property is in compliance with the requirements of this chapter. If the property management company determines the property is not in compliance, it is the company's responsibility to bring the property into compliance. 
I.  The duties and obligations specified in this section shall be joint and several among and between all trustees and beneficiaries and their respective agents.

(Ord. No. 1035, § 1, 1-11-12)  
8.64.060 - Security requirements. 
A.  Properties subject to this chapter shall be maintained in a secure manner so as not to be accessible to unauthorized persons. 
B.  Generally, "secure manner" means boarding unsecure windows, doors, and other openings with sheeting material in accordance with this section. As used herein, "sheeting material" or "sheeting" means a minimum of .20-inch thick clear or semi-clear shatter-proof polycarbonate material with a strength capable of sustaining impact without breaking or shattering, absent excessive force. For example, such polycarbonate material shall be capable of sustaining a human propelled brick without breaking or shattering. Examples of such sheeting strength yields would include strength yields equal or greater than American Society for Testing and Materials (ASDM) D638 Tensile Strength, Yield value of eight thousand (8000) psi. Sheeting shall be installed in a manner intended to provide an appearance approximating glass in the window casings, and consistent in appearance with the surrounding surface in the case of all other openings that require securing. Unless otherwise granted a variance by the building authority from strict compliance herewith, materials such as particle board, wafer board, Masonite or other similar material shall not be used for boarding up property. 
C.  Boarding StandardWindows. 
1.  Internal Compression Method. Windows with broken, missing, or removed glass, or that are otherwise unsecure, shall be boarded as follows: 
a.  All remaining broken glass shall be removed from the window opening including damaged frames as to provide a clean opening; 
b.  The sheeting material shall be cut to match the dimensions of the inside of the window casing so that when installed, the sheeting will fit tightly and not permit a tool to be placed behind it; 
c.  A ½-inch hole shall be drilled into each of the four corners of the sheeting material. The holes shall be positioned so they are no more than 1-inch from the window frame at the width and no more than six inches from the window sill and top frame; 
d.  Two solid continuous composite cross-beams shall be cut in sufficient length to be no less than eight inches longer than the horizontal width of the interior window casing. Each cross-beam shall be predrilled with 7/16 -inch holes that are positioned to match the horizontal pattern of the holes in the sheeting; 
e.  The sheeting shall be secured in place over the exterior of the window opening by placing a 3/8 -inch corrosion resistant, smooth-head carriage bolt through each of the holes in the sheeting and then placing one washer onto each of the carriage bolts; the cross-beams shall then be aligned and affixed to such carriage bolts from the interior of the window opening. Another nut and washer shall be placed onto each of the carriage bolts and tightened with a ratchet to achieve sufficient torque and a slight deflection in the cross-beams so that the nuts cannot be loosened by hand. Once secured, no space shall exist between the sheeting and the exterior window casing. 
2.  Exterior Screw Method. Fixed or inoperable windows with intact glass; or windows in which the internal compression method is impractical shall be secured as follows: 
A.  The sheeting material shall be cut to match the dimensions of the inside of the window casing so that when installed, the sheeting will fit tightly and not permit a tool to be placed behind it; 
B.  Drill and countersink holes shall be made along the perimeter of the sheeting material starting with a hole at each of the four corners and adding additional holes at 10-inch increments around the perimeter of the sheeting. Minimum length 2-inch corrosion resistant security head screws shall be used in each hole to affix the sheeting to the window frame or exterior casing. 
C.  In the event the sheeting cannot be secured by cutting the sheeting material so as to neatly fit the inside window casing, the sheeting shall be placed over the exterior window casing such that the sheeting material covers the entire window casing and extends beyond the window casing at least eight inches on center. The sheeting material shall be secured with minimum length 2-inch corrosion resistant security head screws secured at the corners, and along the sheeting outer edges in 10-inch spaced increments as described in subsection a. above. 
3.  Variance. If circumstances make the foregoing methods of installation impractical such as due to excessive frame, door and wall damage, or windows that are in an arc encasing or other unusual inset or characteristic the window or opening shall still be installed with the sheeting, but may be affixed and secured in any manner approved by the building authority as to achieve substantial compliance with this chapter. 
D.  Boarding StandardUnsecure Doors; Sliding or Other Doors. 
1.  Exterior Access Door. At least one exterior door shall allow authorized persons access to the interior of the property. Such exterior access door may be secured by: (a) using a solid core wood or steel door with no windows or other openings in the door; (b) or hinged sheeting material. The door shall be securely locked using a padlock and hasp assembly that is bolted through the door or sheeting material. The lock loop portion of the hasp shall be attached to the door frame using a minimum of 3-inch long security screws. 
2.  Sliding Glass Doors and Other Exterior Doors. Sliding glass doors or exterior doors other than the exterior access door shall be secured in the same manner as described in Section 8.64.060(C). 
E.  If the property is owned by a corporation and/or out of area owner, a local property management company shall be contracted to perform weekly inspections to verify that the requirements of this section, and any other applicable laws, are being met. 
F.  If the property is subject to subsection (E), the property shall be posted with the name and twenty-four-hour contact phone number of the local property management company. The posting shall be no less than eighteen (18) inches by twenty-four (24) inches, shall be of a font that is legible from a distance of forty-five (45) feet, and shall contain the following verbiage: "THIS PROPERTY MANAGED BY ____________," and "TO REPORT PROBLEMS OR CONCERNS CALL (name and phone number)." 
G.  If the property is subject to subsection (E), the posting shall be placed on the interior of a window facing the street to the front of the property so it is visible from the street, or secured to the exterior of the building/structure facing the street of the front of the property so it is visible from the street. If no such area exists, the posting shall be on a stake of sufficient size to support the posting, in a location that is visible from the street to the front of the property, and to the extent possible, not readily accessible to potential vandalism. Exterior posting must be constructed of, and printed with weather resistant materials. 
H.  If the property is subject to subsection (E), the local property management company shall inspect the property on a weekly basis to determine if the property is in compliance with the requirements of this chapter. If the property management company determines the property is not in compliance, it is the company's responsibility to bring the property into compliance. 
I.  If there are multiple owners of a property subject to this chapter, the duties and obligations specified in this section shall be joint and several among and between all owners and their respective agents.

d.  Administrative Hearing Procedures. 
(A)  Procedural Matters. 
(1)  Appearances. The officer issuing the citation shall not be required to appear at the hearing. The contestant shall appear at the hearing, unless a hearing by mail has been designated by the contestant in the appeal request form. If the contestant does not appear at the hearing, the appeal shall be decided by the hearing official based on the citation, the record of the administrative review, and any other relevant material in the record, taking into account the reasons specified by the contestant on the appeal request form. Appearances by minors shall be governed by the provisions of Section 40215(c)(2) of the California Vehicle Code. 
(2)  Hearing Officials. The hearing shall be conducted by a hearing official. 
(3)  Hearing Record. The hearing official shall write pertinent information into the record during the in-person hearing. The hearing record and any supporting documentation will remain with the case file at the city. If the contestant appeals the hearing official's decision to the court, the entire case file will be forwarded to the court. The hearing records for those cases not appealed to the court will be retained by the city for one year. 
(4)  Representation. The contestant may, in his or her discretion, be represented by an attorney in the appeal process, at the administrative hearing. Any such representation shall be at the sole and exclusive cost of the contestant. No contestant shall be entitled to representation at the expense of the city, or any other public agency, irrespective of indigence status. 
(B)  Conduct of the Administrative Hearing. 
(1)  Hearing Official Duties. At the time of the administrative hearing, the hearing official shall: (i) make a pre-hearing statement, briefly explaining the nature of the civil proceedings, the manner of conducting the hearing and the limits on the introduction of evidence, the process of rendering a decision, the effects of the decision in terms of collection remedies available to the Coachella Police Department, the right of the contestant to appeal to the court for a de novo hearing, and any other matters in the hearing official's discretion; (ii) read the citation into the record; (iii) administer an oath to the contestant and any prospective witnesses; (iv) record the name and address of the contestant; and (v) write the registered owner's name and address and the contestant's relationship to the registered owner (if applicable). 
(2)  Proof Requirements; Validity of Citation. The city bears the burden of proof, by a preponderance of the evidence, that the citation meets statutory requirements for validity. Where the citation, or copy thereof, contains all of the items specified in Section 40202(a) of the California Vehicle Code, the issuing agency shall not be required to produce any evidence other than the notice of the parking violation or copy thereof and information received from the department of motor vehicles identifying the registered owner of the vehicle. The documentation in proper form shall be prima facie evidence of the violation. The contestant may introduce relevant evidence relating to the validity of the citation in rebuttal. 
(3)  Proof Requirements; Contestant Defenses. The contestant bears the burden of proof, by the preponderance of the evidence, that although the citation is facially valid, a viable defense exists which would preclude the contestant's liability for the parking penalty, or that a viable defense exists which would limit the contestant's liability for late payment penalties. Nonreceipt of the notice of violation itself, if based on sufficient evidence, may constitute a defense to the late payment penalties based on nonpayment of the notice of violation, however, is not a defense to late response to the notice of delinquent parking violation. The defense of nonreceipt of the notice of violation is not available to the registered vehicle owner, where the person operating the vehicle at the time of the citation was not the registered vehicle owner. Clear proof of timely payment of the citation is a defense to late payment penalties. Defenses relating to the merits of the citation must be established by the contestant by sufficient evidence. Such defenses may include, but are not limited to: (i) signage matters (missing, obscured or defaced signs); (ii) impossibility of knowledge of the applicable parking restrictions (where the contestant demonstrates that it was impossible for him or her to become aware of the applicable parking restrictions); (iii) malfunctioning parking meters; (iv) recent loss of parking permit or placard; and (v) mechanical breakdown of the vehicle (where the vehicle was not illegally parked prior to the breakdown, the violation in fact results from the breakdown and reasonable steps were taken to remove the vehicle prior to the occurrence of the violation). Personal reasons, inconveniences, lack of funds, forgetfulness, failure to observe signs, lack of available parking elsewhere, lack of knowledge of the applicable restrictions, and similar or related matters are not under any circumstances a defense to liability for the parking penalties. Failure to list a defense in the statement of reasons contained in the contestant's appeal request precludes the contestant from utilizing that defense at the time of the appeal hearing. 
(4)  Evidence. The rules of evidence for civil court procedures shall not apply in administrative hearings conducted pursuant to this procedure. Evidence relevant to the issues raised by the contestant's statement of reasons, and to the validity of the citation itself under Section 40202 of the California Vehicle Code, will be received. Weight and reliability of the evidence provided will be determined by of the hearing officer. Other than the citation and the DMV information, the hearing official shall receive into the record the reviewing official's record from the administrative review, together with relevant testimony, documentation and other material which is submitted by either party. Weight and reliability determinations, shall be made by the hearing official. The hearing official may, but is not required to, admit evidence in the form of declarations of witnesses, submitted by the contestant. Such declarations shall not be admitted unless presented in the form required for declarations under California Section 2015.5 of the California Code of Civil Procedure, and shall contain the statements required by Sections 2015.5(a) and 2015.5(b) of the California Code of Civil Procedure. 
(5)  Witnesses. The contestant may present witness testimony as evidence at the discretion of the hearing official. The hearing official, after conducting the initial procedures of the hearing, may exclude witnesses until their turn to testify. The hearing official may limit the number of witnesses to prevent repetitive testimony in the interest of efficiency The hearing official may conduct such cross-examination of the contestant or any witness presented at his or her discretion. 
(C)  Determination of Appeal. The hearing official shall make a written decision on liability for the parking penalties based on the testimony and other evidence in the record. The hearing official shall enter the disposition and the total amount of parking penalties on the hearing record. The decision, including the rationale thereof, shall be placed in written form. Although the hearing official's decision may be personally delivered to the contestant following the completion of the hearing, the written decision shall be sent to the contestant, to the address listed on the contestant's appeal form, via first class mail. Following a determination by the hearing official that a person has committed the violation, the hearing official may in his or her discretion, may allow for deferred payment of the parking penalty, if the person provides evidence satisfactory to the hearing official, of an inability to pay the parking penalty in full. The hearing official's decision shall be the final decision of the city. The decision shall set forth the time limits for the contestant to file for judicial review in the court, and a notice that if no such review is sought within the applicable time limitations, the decision shall be final for all purposes. 
5.  Judicial Review. Within thirty (30) days after the mailing or personal delivery of the final decision described in Section 10.08.040(J)(4)(d)(C), the contestant may seek review by filing an appeal with the court. Such review will be conducted in accordance with the provisions of Section 40230 of the California Vehicle Code. 
6.  Copies of Citations. Upon request by mail or in person, the Coachella Police Department will provide a copy of a citation to any person who has received a notice of delinquent parking violation, or to his or her agent. The copy will be provided within fifteen (15) days of the request, upon payment of the fee established by the Coachella Police Department.

Chapter 12.42 - CAMPING WITHIN CITY LIMITS 
 
12.42.010 - Purpose and intent. 
This chapter is intended to protect the public health, welfare, and safety by reserving open spaces and facilities within the city limits for their intended purposes. Public property within the city should be readily accessible and available to residents and the public at large. The use of these areas for camping purposes or storage of personal property interferes with the rights of others to use the areas for their intended purposes and is deleterious to the public peace, health, safety, and welfare. The use of these areas for camping obstructs the intended uses for the public at large, contributes to blight, and can cause damage to public property. This chapter is intended to avoid unsafe and potentially disorderly conditions, unsanitary and unhealthful conditions, and the degradation or destruction of open spaces and facilities within the city.

Article I - In General 
 
13.01.001 - Area served. 
The city of Coachella municipal code Title 13, Public Utilities, provides for the regulatory framework for sewer and water services for the city of Coachella and the recognized sphere of influence in Riverside County, California. This title may be referred to as the public utilities ordinances. The public utilities ordinance pertains to water, sewer, and electric system service to land or improvements, or both, lying within the boundaries of the city, unless specific provision is made by agreement with the city for service outside of city limits. If sewer and water do not exist in the immediate area, the applicant, owner, or the customer shall provide or finance such facilities and/or capacity. The owner of the property outside of a then-existing city limit, which property has adequate sewer and water facilities and/or capacity or funds therefore, must cause all such facilities and/or capacity or funds to be transferred to the city. 
Property not within the incorporated boundaries of the city and which is to be provided with service by the city, is subject to annexation to the city of Coachella. Annexation to the city may, in turn, be subject to annexation to other agencies, except as otherwise provided by agreement. 
The city, at its discretion, may from time to time contract with an applicant, owner, or customer to initiate and pursue to completion the establishment of a financing district and the sale of bonds to provide the funds to construct the necessary sewer, water, and/or recycled water facilities or system capacity necessary for service to collection and distribution facilities that are required to provide the applicant, owner or customer as a condition of obtaining service from the city. 
(Ord. No. 1057, § 1(Exh. A), 10-23-13)  
13.01.002 - Service conditions.

Sewer and water system service shall be available only in accordance with the rules and regulations, as well as applicable federal, state, and local statutes, ordinances, regulations, and contracts, and other requirements including, but not by way of limitation, the California Water Code, and other state statutes and regulations imposed by the California Regional Water Quality Control Board - Colorado River Region, and State and local health departments, as well as the terms of any service agreement and permit issued by the city. Any such permit may be revoked by the city and thereupon all such sewer and water system service shall cease in the manner provided for in the city Code of Ordinances. 
(Ord. No. 1057, § 1(Exh. A), 10-23-13)  
13.01.003 - Application procedure.

The conditions under which a discharge permit may be required are based on the quantities and constituents of wastewater discharged into the city's sewerage facilities. The applicant shall comply with all federal and state requirements including, but not by way of limitation, any and all requirements of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and any commitments for reimbursements required by the EPA in excess of the charges of the city. These requirements are set forth in the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and the Code of Federal Regulations, which by this reference are herein incorporated as though set forth in full. 
C.  The city may, at its discretion, require specific prior approval of any permit by any federal, state, and or local agency having jurisdiction over an interest in the operation of the city's facilities. 
D.  The utilities general manager review applications and shall render a decision on completed applications. The utilities general manager shall review the application and make such investigation relating thereto as deemed necessary. The utilities general manager may prescribe requirements in writing to the applicant as to the facilities necessary to be constructed, manner of connection, the financial requirements, and the use of service including the availability of adequate water and sewerage system facilities, and in cases of sewer service pretreatment facilities, if necessary, to insure initial and future continued compliance with the city's ordinance and rules and regulations and any other applicable requirements.

For purposes of establishing industrial connection charges, equivalent dwelling units for industrial uses shall be determined as follows: 
1.  For domestic type wastewater, multiply the fixture units (as defined by the Uniform Plumbing Code) as shown on approved building plans by a sewage factor of 0.0741 based upon a 20-gallon-per-fixture unit flow per day. 
2.  For nondomestic wastewaters, compute from information contained on the industrial waste discharge permit using the following sewage factor formula: 
Sewage Factor Formula 
SF = K = [0.37 + 0.31(BOD)/230) + (0.32(SS)/220)] 
Where: 
SF 	= 	Sewage factor 
K 	= 	Gallons per fixture unit divided by the average domestic household flow of 270 gallons = 1 EDU 
BOD 5 mg/l 	= 	User's dischargeBiochemical oxygen demand (mg/l) 
SS mg/l 	= 	User's dischargeSuspended residue (mg/l) 
EDU 	= 	Estimated nondomestic flow [0.37 + 0.31(BOD) / 230)+ (0.32(SS) / 220)] 
 
3.  Combine the resultant EDU's derived from subsections (1) and (2) of this subsection.

13.01.317 - Calculation of equivalent dwelling units for purposes of determining monthly charges. 
Monthly sewer charges for residential, commercial and industrial uses shall be determined based upon the service unit rate formula, as computed by the utilities department according to the following service unit assignment formula: 
Service Unit Assignment Formula 
SU = F/(270(0.37) + BOD(230) X (0.31) + SS(220) X (0.32) 
Monthly Sewer Service Charge = SU X Service Unit Rate 
Where: 
SU 	= 	Sewer units 
F 	= 	Sewage flow in gallons per day based on sewage factor applied to water meter readings 
BOD 5 	= 	User's dischargeBiochemical oxygen demand (mg/l) 
SS 	= 	User's dischargeSuspended solids concentration (mg/l) 
Q 	= 	Domestic water usage (gallons per day) taken directly from water meter readings.

A.  Sewer bills shall be sent to the owner of the property served, who shall be responsible for the payment thereof. Property owners and occupants may make special arrangements with the finance director on application forms to be provided by the finance director for that purpose for bills to be sent to the occupant of the property rather than to the owner of the property. From the date of the signing and filing of the application, bills shall be sent to the occupant. Thereafter the property owner and the occupant shall be liable, jointly and severally, for the payment of sewer bills. 
B.  Sewer bills shall be rendered monthly and shall be due and payable upon presentation. The bill for each monthly period shall segregate amounts charged for collection and sewer treatment service. The agency responsible for the sewer treatment service shall be named on the bill. The bill shall be mailed not later than the tenth day of the second month for which service has been rendered and is billed. The commencement date for sewer bills for newly constructed structures shall be the first day of the month following the date upon which final inspection is given by the development services department or the first day of the month following the date that the premises or any portion thereof are occupied, whichever occurs first. The commencement date for sewer bills for structures previously served by facilities other than the city sewer system shall be the first of the month following the date that the structure is connected to the city sewer system.

13.01.354 - Lien for delinquent charges. 
Any sewer rates authorized pursuant to this article which remain unpaid for 60 days past the date upon which they were billed may be collected thereafter by the city, as provided as follows: 
1.  The city shall cause a report of delinquent sewer fees to be prepared periodically. The city council shall fix a time, date and place for hearing the report and any objections or protests thereto. The report shall contain a list and description of each parcel of real property to which is attributed a delinquency in the payment of sewer rates, for a period of sixty (60) days or more, the names of the owners and the total amount of the delinquency attributable to that parcel. 
2.  The city council shall cause notice of the hearing to be mailed to the owners of the property with delinquencies, as listed on the latest equalized assessment roll. Such notice shall contain the date, time and place of the hearing and be sent not less than fourteen (14) days prior to the date of the hearing and shall inform the recipients of the amount of unpaid sewer rates and penalties. Such notice shall inform the owners that the unpaid sewer rates and penalties will be assessed against and shall result in a lien on their property. 
3.  At the hearing, the city council shall hear any objections or protests of the landowners who are to be assessed for delinquent fees. The city council may make such revisions or corrections to the report as it deems just, after which, by resolution, the report shall be confirmed. 
4.  The delinquent sewer rates, and any penalties thereon, set forth in the confirmed report shall constitute a special assessment against the respective parcels of land and are a lien on the property for the amount of delinquent fees, the late charges, and cost of lien. The city clerk shall certify that the report has been adopted by the city council in its final form, and file the report with the county auditor. In addition, the city clerk shall also record the amount of unpaid charges with the county recorder. 
(Ord. No. 1057, § 1(Exh. A), 10-23-13)  
13.01.355 - Termination of service. 
A.  If all structures in which sewage is produced are removed from a property served by the sewer system, or if the structure in which sewage is produced is demolished, then the city shall consider the service disconnected and shall provide a prorated adjustment of annual assessment based upon the first day of the month following the notification of removal or demolition of the structure by the city building official. The owner shall be entitled to a refund of the deposit or to such portion of the deposit as may be unused, upon written application therefore. Termination of service shall be considered equivalent to disconnection. 
B.  Thereafter, the property shall not be inhabited by humans nor shall any sewage be produced thereon until service has been restored through payment of new connection and deposit fees. If the property is inhabited by human beings and any sewage is produced thereon before the service has been restored, the accounting officer shall have authority to disconnect the property without further notice and to pursue any additional available remedies. 
(Ord. No. 1057, § 1(Exh. A), 10-23-13)  
13.01.356 - Reconnection. 
After a building sewer has been disconnected from the sewer system, it shall not be reconnected until all delinquent charges plus penalties, all charges which have accrued since the time of disconnection, any supplementary connection charges, and the estimated cost of reconnection have been paid; the deposit restored to the required amount; and any required guarantee for the payment of bills has been made. In addition to the connection charge, the deposit shall be paid or restored to the required amount as provided in this article. All of the charges, deposits and other amounts required to be paid shall be paid before the building sewer is reconnected to the sewer system. 
(Ord. No. 1057, § 1(Exh. A), 10-23-13)  
13.01.357 - Restoration of terminated service. 
After service to a property has been terminated, the sewer connection permit issued for the property shall be considered cancelled. The permit and service shall not be considered as restored until all delinquent charges plus penalties, all charges which have accrued since time of termination, and a restoration charge in an amount adopted by ordinance of the district has been paid and the deposit restored to the required amount. In addition to the amount provided in this section, all of the charges, deposits and other amounts required to be paid shall be paid before the permit and service are restored.

13.01.386 - Applicability. 
The provisions of this article shall apply to additions to and extensions of the sewer system, which extensions or additions are built at the direct expense of property owners, sub-dividers or other persons or groups of persons. Other provisions of this chapter not in conflict with provisions of this article shall also apply. This article shall not apply to portions of the sewer system constructed by the city and paid for out of the sewer fund, except that nothing in this article shall prohibit the city from participating in the construction of an extension of the sewer system when the extension is of more than local benefit. 
(Ord. No. 1057, § 1(Exh. A), 10-23-13)  
13.01.387 - Additions and extensions defined. 
A.  As used in this article, the word "addition" shall mean a system of sewer mains, house connection sewers and appurtenances built by property owners at their expense to serve their land, and which does not serve any other land adjoining the work by direct connection thereto. 
B.  As used in this article, the word "extension" shall mean a system of sewer mains, house connection sewers and appurtenances built by property owners at their expense to serve their land, and which may also serve other adjoining land, the owners of which have not shared in the cost of the work. 
C.  A single sewer project may include additions and extensions. The term "property owner," as used in this article, shall include a single person, a group of persons, or a corporation, firm or other combination of persons. 
(Ord. No. 1057, § 1(Exh. A), 10-23-13)  
13.01.388 - Acceptance of work; special consideration. 
A.  Following the satisfactory completion of any sewer project for the construction of an addition or extension, and upon recommendation of the superintendent, the city council shall, by resolution, accept the work, which shall then become a part of the city sewer system. The resolution of acceptance shall contain the terms of any special consideration which shall apply to the sewers so accepted. 
B.  Special consideration may include provisions for reimbursement and relief from the connection charge, but shall not include provisions for monthly charges different from those established elsewhere in this chapter, except as provided for service to property lying outside the corporate limits of the city. All provisions for special consideration shall terminate at the expiration of ten (10) years following the date of the resolution of acceptance, or at such earlier date as may be established in the resolution of acceptance. 
(Ord. No. 1057, § 1(Exh. A), 10-23-13)  
13.01.389 - Reimbursement of costs. 
A.  The provisions of this section shall apply only to extensions and shall not apply to additions. If the resolution of acceptance is to provide for reimbursement, the city shall, before the work is accepted, determine the cost thereof and prorate this cost against all of the land which, in the city's opinion, will ultimately benefit from the work. The proration shall be based upon frontage or such other method as, in the opinion of the city, will provide an equitable sharing of cost. The cost of house connection sewers shall not be included in the determination of cost. 
B.  The city shall further determine the cost incurred by each person who has participated in the expense of the work. After considering the pro rata share of each such person's cost as based upon the benefit derived from the work, the city shall finally determine the total maximum amount which any person shall subsequently be entitled to receive as a reimbursement from persons connecting to the work. 
C.  Money which is to be paid as reimbursement shall be paid to each person entitled to receive it in proportion to the outstanding balance which each such person is entitled to receive. Any person entitled to receive reimbursement under the provisions of this article shall keep a correct mailing address on file with the city. If the city is unable to locate any person entitled to receive reimbursement, the city shall send a written notice to that person by registered mail to the last address filed with the superintendent by that person. The notice shall contain a statement of the amount and purpose of the particular reimbursement and shall state that if the person receiving the notice does not claim his portion of the reimbursement within one year from the date of the notice all rights of that person to that particular reimbursement will be forfeited. 
D.  Any portion of a reimbursement which remains unclaimed for one year after the date of the notice mentioned in subsection (c) of this section shall be paid, as previously provided, to other persons who may be entitled to receive the reimbursement. If any money is available for reimbursement and remains unclaimed for one year after the date of such notice and no other person is entitled to receive it, this money shall be paid into the sewer fund. The right to receive a reimbursement may be transferred by the person entitled to receive it by filing a statement of transfer with the city on a form for transfer to be furnished by the city.

(Ord. No. 1057, § 1(Exh. A), 10-23-13)  
13.01.391 - Connecting to extensions. 
A property owner who desires to connect to an extension shall make application in the same manner as for an ordinary sewer connection. If the owner has not shared in the cost of the sewer and if reimbursement provisions apply, the owner shall pay to the city the amount which has previously been determined as the pro rata share of the cost of the sewer for his property. This amount shall be paid before the permit is issued. 
(Ord. No. 1057, § 1(Exh. A), 10-23-13)  
13.01.392 - Relief from connection charge. 
A property owner who connects to an addition or extension shall, during the first ten (10) years following the completion of the work and its acceptance into the sewer system, be relieved from part or all of the connection charge at the time the property is first connected to the sewer system if the owner has shared in the cost of the work. Unless otherwise provided in the resolution of acceptance, the amount of relief shall be the entire connection charge, except that no relief shall be given in excess of the cost of the addition or extension, including the house connection sewer, which was incurred by the owner and which applies to the property to be connected. The amount of the cost shall be determined by the sewer superintendent. Relief from connection charge shall not apply to any supplementary connection charge or any charges subsequently imposed for the reconnection of a disconnected sewer or the restoration of a terminated service.

13.01.476 - Intent and purpose. 
The city council hereby declares that the fees required to be paid by this article are solely for the purpose of producing revenue, to be used to provide necessary sewerage facilities. The continued increase in housing in the city, with the attendant increase in sewage, has created an urgent need to provide the necessary sewerage facilities and the financing thereof. 
(Ord. No. 1057, § 1(Exh. A), 10-23-13)  
13.01.477 - Facilities expansion fee. 
A.  In addition to any other fees prescribed by this code, sewerage facilities expansion fees shall be payable to the city for all new dwelling units and mobile home or trailer spaces which will make use of the sewerage facilities of the city. If dry sewers are installed for future connection to the sewerage system, the fees shall be required even though onsite disposal systems are to be utilized as an interim measure. In those cases where onsite disposal systems are authorized for other than interim use due to the lot size and soil conditions, the fees shall not be required, provided that if any such dwelling units so exempted connect to the sewerage system in the future, the fees shall be payable by the then owner of record of the property. 
B.  Every person constructing a dwelling in a different location or providing a new dwelling unit in a one-family or multi-family dwelling, dwelling group, apartment hotel or mobile home or trailer providing trailer spaces in a mobile home or trailer park, shall pay a sewerage facilities expansion fee in an amount adopted by ordinance of the district. Every person constructing an industrial or commercial building, moving an industrial or commercial building to a different location, providing a new industrial or commercial facility shall pay a sewerage facilities expansion fee in an amount adopted by ordinance of the district. The number of equivalent dwelling units attributable to each industrial or commercial building shall be computed in accordance with Section 13.01.316, as amended. The sewerage facilities expansion fee shall be paid prior to the issuance of the building permit for the subject unit or space. 
C.  Sewer expansion fees to be levied on existing system users who expand or revise use. In some situations existing commercial and industrial users will expand uses to meet increasing demands. As a result, additional fixture units will usually be included within the expanded facility. Under these situations the following criteria will apply: 
1.  Sewer expansion fees will only be levied on the fixture unit (FU) count difference between existing FUs and new FUs. 
2.  The sewer expansion fee will be determined based on the fee in effect at the time of building or sewer permit issuance for the expanding development. 
3.  A change in use, placing a commercial development in a different Table 3.01.316(e) category, will not result in the recalculation of sewer expansion obligation for the existing FUs. Only the new added FUs will be levied sewer expansion fees based on the Table 3.01.316(e) category which best defines the proposed use. 
D.  Attachment of sewer use rights; tied to property or structure. Under certain situations, an existing discharger may want to relocate a business. The issue may then arise as to ownership of certain existing discharge rights in the system. All sewer capacity remains with the existing building and should be sold to building owners rather than tenants. In cases where an existing building is completely demolished, the transfer of capacity rights can be permitted provided that: 
1.  Proof of building demolition can be documented; 
2.  Payment for original system capacity can be documented; 
3.  The demolition occurs simultaneously with the transfer; and 
4.  The transfer occurs within the city/agency who originally sold the capacity.

It is the policy of the city council that the sewer service be operated as a utility, and that it shall be operated in a prudent manner with adequate reserves to meet emergencies and to replace parts of the system. 
(Ord. No. 1057, § 1(Exh. A), 10-23-13)  
13.01.502 - Funds established. 
The following sewer funds are to be created and maintained: 
1.  Maintenance and operating fund. The sewer maintenance and operating fund is to be created and maintained for the purpose of paying for the expenses associated with the maintenance and operation of the sewer system. Such expenses are to include direct sewage treatment costs, direct accounting and billing costs, and direct preventative and emergency sewage collection system maintenance costs, as well as general and departmental overhead as defined in Section 13.01.010. The source of the money for this fund is to be sewer permit fees, interest earnings and sewer service charges. Refundable sewer deposits provided by property owners are accounted for within this fund, and the amount of such deposits shall not be reflected in the fund balance. 
2.  Sewer replacement fund. The sewer replacement fund is to be created and maintained for the purpose of paying for replacing parts of the sewer system as they wear out, deteriorate or become obsolete. All items deemed to be replacement of existing facilities shall be paid for from this fund. The source of the money for this fund is to be through city council authorized transfers from the sewer maintenance and operating fund. Such transfers are to be authorized so that funds will be available to pay for future replacement of parts of the sewer system. The determination as to the amount of money to be held in this fund will be made by taking into consideration the estimated life and replacement cost of the various parts of the sewer system using the following formula: 
(Replacement cost of sewer system facility additions) X (0.10) X (Age of sewer system facilities) ° (75 years) 
3.  Sewer capital fund. The sewer capital fund is to be created and maintained for the purpose of paying for new sewer facilities found necessary because of the development of the city. Such facilities could include, but are not limited to, pumping stations, sewer laterals, manholes, cleanouts, sewer mains, treatment facilities, interceptors, monitoring stations, and equipment. An annual appropriation shall be made from this fund for general and department overhead. The source of the money for this fund is to be sewer connection charges, interest earnings, sewer installation charges, property assessments, and government grants. 
4.  Sewerage facilities expansion fund. The sewerage facilities expansion fund is to be created and maintained for the purpose of paying for sewer facilities needed for the expansion of the city including, but not limited to, treatment plants and sewer interceptor lines. The source of the money for this fund is to be the sewerage facilities expansion fee collected pursuant to Section 13.01.477.

13.01.505 - Loans from sewer funds. 
Loans between sewer funds or to other funds may only be made pursuant to authorization of the city council and shall be for a specific time period not to exceed five years. During such time that moneys are on loan from any fund, interest shall be paid annually to the fund. The interest rate during this loan period shall be at least the average rate for the city's interest-bearing deposits during the loan duration. No loans shall be made from the maintenance and operating fund and the sewer replacement fund. Existing loans shall be brought into compliance with this section within five years. 
(Ord. No. 1057, § 1(Exh. A), 10-23-13)  
13.01.506 - Allocation of personnel and equipment costs. 
A.  Personnel. The total number of employees in the sewer maintenance and operating budget shall be determined using the following formula: 
(Total number actual hours proposed to be charged to the sewer maintenance and operating fund for permanent employees for the proposed operating budget) / (2,080 hours) 
Personnel costs will be charged on actual number of hours worked. Personnel costs include salaries and related benefits. 
B.  Equipment. The original purchase cost charged to the sewer capital fund shall be no more than its pro rata share of time used in sewer activities. The motor pool rental charges shall also be based on the actual hours used; the motor pool shall be responsible for the replacement of these capital items.

A.  The schedule shall contain progress increments in the form of dates for the commencement and completion of major events leading to the construction and operation of additional pretreatment required for the user to meet the applicable pretreatment standards (such events include, but are not limited to, hiring an engineer, completing preliminary and final plans, executing contracts for major components, commencing and completing construction, and beginning and conducting routine operation); 
B.  No increment referred to above shall exceed nine months; 
C.  The user shall submit a progress report to the general manager no later than fourteen (14) days following each date in the schedule and the final date of compliance including, as a minimum, whether or not it complied with the increment of progress, the reason for any delay, and, if appropriate, the steps being taken by the user to return to the established schedule; and 
D.  In no event shall more than nine months elapse between such progress reports to the general manager. 
(Ord. No. 1057, § 2(Exh. B), 10-23-13)  
13.02.610 - Reports on compliance with categorical pretreatment standard deadline. 
Within ninety (90) days following the date for final compliance with applicable categorical pretreatment standards, or in the case of a new source following commencement of the introduction of wastewater into the city's collection system, any user subject to such pretreatment standards and requirements shall submit to the general manager a report containing the information described in Section 13.02.600(B)(4-6) of this chapter. For users subject to equivalent mass or concentration limits established in accordance with the procedures in 40 CFR 403.6(c), this report shall contain a reasonable measure of the user's long-term production rate. For all other users subject to categorical pretreatment standards expressed in terms of allowable pollutant discharge per unit of production (or other measure of operation), this report shall include the user's actual production during the appropriate sampling period. All compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with Section 13.02.410. 
(Ord. No. 1057, § 2(Exh. B), 10-23-13)

13.02.675 - Notification of hazardous waste discharge. 
A.  All industrial users shall notify the city, the EPA regional waste management division director, and state hazardous waste authorities in writing of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be classified as a hazardous waste pursuant to 40 CFR part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch or other). If the industrial user discharges more than one hundred (100) kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification shall also contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the industrial user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the waste stream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the waste stream expected to be discharged during the following twelve (12) months. The notifications required by this subsection shall provide the notification no later than 180 days after the discharge of the hazardous waste. 
B.  Any notification under this subsection need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed discharges must be submitted in accordance with 40 CFR 403.12(j). 
C.  The hazardous waste discharge notification requirements specified in this subsection do not apply to pollutants already reported under the self-monitoring requirements of this chapter. Industrial users are also exempt from such requirements during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen (15) kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). 
D.  Discharges of more than fifteen (15) kilograms of non-acute hazardous wastes, as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), require a one-time notification. Additional notification is not required for subsequent months during which the industrial user discharges additional quantities of the same nonacute hazardous waste. 
E.  In the case of new federal regulations under section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the industrial user shall notify the city, the EPA regional waste management division director and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety (90) days of the effective date of such regulations. 
F.  In the case of any notification made under these requirements, the industrial user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume or toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
(Ord. No. 1057, § 2(Exh. B), 10-23-13)  
13.02.680 - Toxic organics management plan. 
The city may require any user to submit a toxic organic management plan (TOMP) to address the prevention of discharge of toxic organics to the POTW or the environment. A TOMP shall contain, at a minimum, the toxic organic compounds used, the method(s) of disposal, and the procedures for assuring that toxic organics do not spill into the wastewater being discharged. The city may allow a user to develop and implement a TOMP in lieu of required self-monitoring for toxic organics. 
(Ord. No. 1057, § 2(Exh. B), 10-23-13)

13.02.720 - Consent orders. 
The general manager may enter into consent orders, assurances of voluntary compliance, or other similar documents establishing an agreement with any user responsible for noncompliance. Such documents will include specific action to be taken by the user to correct the noncompliance within a time period specified by the document. Such documents shall have the same force and effect as the administrative orders issued pursuant to Section 13.02.730 and shall be judicially enforceable. 
(Ord. No. 1057, § 2(Exh. B), 10-23-13)  
13.02.725 - Show cause orders. 
A.  The general manager may order a user which has been given a notice of violation and which has failed to submit an acceptable plan of corrective action or which, having submitted such a plan, fails to follow through with execution of the plan, to appear at a hearing scheduled by the general manager to show cause why the enforcement action proposed in the show cause order should not be taken. 
B.  The show cause order shall specify the time and place for the hearing, the proposed enforcement action, the reasons for such action, and a request that the user show why the proposed enforcement action should not be taken. The show cause order shall be served personally or by registered or certified mail (return receipt requested) at least fifteen (15) days prior to the hearing. The order may be served on any authorized representative of the user. A show cause order shall not be a bar against, or prerequisite for, taking any other action against the user. 
C.  At the conclusion of the show cause hearing, the general manager may: rescind previous enforcement action; issue an appropriate administrative order (consent order, compliance order, or cease and desist order), including assessment of fines; initiate control mechanism revocation proceedings or termination of sewer services; or direct the remission of the file to counsel for legal action.

(Ord. No. 1099, § 4, 1-11-17)  
15.24.020 - Expressed findings. 
The City of Coachella finds the following: 
The Fire Department hereby finds that the proposed amendments to the Fire Code are reasonable and necessary because of local climactic, geologic and topographical conditions within the City of Coachella. This finding is supported and based upon the following express findings which address each of these conditions and present the local situation which make the proposed amendments necessary. 
I.  Climatic Conditions: 
A.  The City of Coachella located in Riverside County is located in Southern California and covers a vast and varied geographic area. The base climate in western Riverside County consists of semi-arid Mediterranean weather patterns. Eastern Riverside County is a desert area with Mohave Desert temperatures and weather patterns. Those two primary areas are divided by the San Bernardino Mountain Range. Both areas outside of the mountain terrain annually experience extended periods of high temperatures with little or no precipitation. Hot, dry winds, which may reach speeds of 70 m.p.h. or greater, are common to the area. Examples are: Santa Ana/Foehn winds, afternoon surface-heating generated winds, and prevailing desert winds. 
These climatic conditions cause extreme drying of vegetation and common building materials. Frequent periods of drought and low humidity add to the fire danger. This predisposes the area to large destructive fires (conflagration) which necessitates rapid identification, locating and extinguishment of all fires in the smallest stage possible. In addition to directly damaging or destroying buildings, these fires are also prone to disrupt utility services throughout the County. Obstacles generated by a strong wind, such as fallen trees, street lights and utility poles, will greatly impact the response time to reach an incident scene. During these winds, the inability to use aerial type firefighting apparatus would further decrease our ability to stop fires in large buildings and place rescue personnel at increased risk of injury. 
B.  Although Riverside County and the City of Coachella occasionally experiences periods of significant drought, the County can also experience periods of substantial rainfall. Annual rainfall varying from three (3) inches in Blythe to over thirty three (33) inches in Pine Cove. When Riverside County does experience heavy rain, or rain over a period of days or weeks, many areas of the County are subject to flooding. Runoff from rain drains either naturally into rivers, washes, and creeks or into flood control facilities. Flash flooding is also a common problem, especially in the Coachella Valley and the easterly portions of the county. Flash flooding is typically associated with short duration, high intensity precipitation events often associated with summer thunderstorms. Such events can occur even during a drought. 
C.  Water demand in densely populated Southern California far exceeds the quantity supplied by natural precipitation; and although the population continues to grow, the already-taxed water supply does not. California is projected to increase in population by nearly ten million (10,000,000) over the next quarter of a century with fifty (50) percent of that growth centered in Southern California. Due to storage capacities and consumption, and a limited amount of rainfall future water allocation is not fully dependable. This necessitates the need for additional and on-site fire protection features. It would also leave tall buildings vulnerable to uncontrolled fires due to a lack of available water and an inability to pump sufficient quantities of available water to floors in a fire. 
D.  These dry climatic conditions and winds contribute to the rapid spread of even small fires originating in high-density housing or vegetation. These fires spread very quickly and create a need for increased levels of fire protection. The added protection of fire sprinkler systems and other fire protection features such as identification and notification will supplement normal fire department response by providing immediate protection for the building occupants and by containing and controlling the fire spread to the area of origin. Fire sprinkler systems will also reduce the use of water for firefighting by as much as fifty (50) to seventy-five (75) percent. 
II.  Topographical Conditions: 
A.  Natural: The topographical conditions of Riverside County varies from three hundred (300) feet below sea-level, flat desert communities, to mountains over ten thousand (10,000) feet in Alpine-like areas of the San Bernardino Mountain Range. In between these areas, developable slopes of twenty-five (25) percent and greater generally occur throughout the foothills. Riverside County extends from Orange County to the State of Arizona and is mixed with congested urban areas, rural lands and wild lands. A large number of sensitive habitats for various animal species and vegetation consist within large open space areas between major urban centers that impact building and structure location, which impedes emergency access and response. This variety in regions contributes to an increased emergency response time, which necessitates cooperation between local agencies. 
B.  Traffic and circulation congestion is an artificially created, obstructive topographical condition, which is common throughout Riverside County. 
C.  These topographical conditions combine to create a situation, which places fire department response time to fire occurrences at risk, and makes it necessary to provide automatic on-site fire-extinguishing systems and other protection measures to protect occupants and property. 
III.  Geological Conditions: Located within Riverside County are several known active and potentially active earthquake faults, including the San Andreas, San Jacinto, and Elsinore Fault. In the event of an earthquake, the location of the epicenter as well as the time of day and season of the year would have a profound effect on the number of deaths and casualties, as well as property damage. 
The major form of direct damage from most earthquakes is damage to construction. Bridges are particularly vulnerable to collapse, and dam failure may generate major downstream flooding. Buildings vary in susceptibility, dependent upon construction and the types of soils on which they are built. Earthquakes destroy power and telephone lines; gas, sewer, or water mains; which, in tum, may set off fires and/or hinder firefighting or rescue efforts. The hazard of earthquakes varies from place to place, dependent upon the regional and local geology. Ground shaking may occur in areas sixty-five (65) miles or more from the epicenter (the point on the ground surface above the focus). Ground shaking can change the mechanical properties of some fine grained, saturated soils, where upon they liquefy and act as a fluid (liquefaction). 
A.  Previous earthquakes in southern California have been accompanied by disruption of traffic flow and fires. A severe seismic event has the potential to negatively impact any rescue or fire suppression activities because it is likely to create obstacles similar to those indicated under the high wind section above. With the probability of strong aftershocks there exists a need to provide increased protection for anyone on upper floors of buildings. 
B.  Road circulation features located throughout the county also make amendments reasonably necessary. Located through the county are major roadways, highways and flood control channels that create barriers and slow response times. Hills, slopes, street and storm drain design accompanies with occasional heavy rainfall, causes roadway flooding and landslides and at times may make an emergency access route impassable. There are areas in Riverside County that naturally have extended emergency response times that exceed the five minute goal. 
California Health and Safety Code Sections 17958.7 and 18941.5 require that the modification or change be expressly marked and identified as to which each finding refers. Therefore the city council finds that the following table sets forth the 2016 California Fire Code sections that have been modified and the associated local climatic, geological and/or topographical conditions described above supporting the modification.

2.  The mixed waste facility shall determine the amount of material landfilled versus diverted and provide the compliance official with tonnage diverted on receipts. 
B.  The city shall make available to each building permit applicant paying a performance security a current list of mixed waste processing facilities. 
(Ord. 930 § 2 (part), 2005)  
15.54.070 - Construction and demolition waste plan. 
A.  In conjunction with the building permit applications fee, the applicant shall submit a properly completed C&D waste plan to the compliance official, in a form as prescribed by that official, for one or more building permits issued at the same time. The completed C&D waste plan shall contain the following: 
1.  The estimated volume or weight of construction and demolition waste that will be disposed; 
2.  The estimated weight of such materials that can feasibly be diverted via reuse or recycling by material type; 
3.  The vendor(s) that the applicant proposes to use to service the clean up activities and the markets identified that will be used in recycling or reusing the diverted materials. 
The applicant must contract with the city's designated refuse hauler for all refuse removal including, but not limited to, recycling materials. 
Because actual material weights are not available in this stage, estimates are used. In estimating the volume or weight of materials as identified in the C&D waste plan, the applicant shall use the standardized conversion rates approved by the city of Coachella for this purpose. Approval of the C&D waste plan as complete and accurate shall be a condition precedent to the issuance of any building or demolition permit. If the applicant calculates the projected feasible diversion rate as described above, and find the rate does not meet the diversion goal, the applicant must then submit information supporting the lower diversion rate. If this documentation is not included, the C&D waste plan shall be deemed incomplete. 
B.  Evaluation of the C&D waste plan will determine the following: 
1.  Approval. No building or demolition permit shall be issued for any covered project unless and until the compliance official has approved the C&D waste plan. The compliance official shall only approve a C&D waste plan if he or she determines that all of the following conditions have been met: 
a.  The C&D waste plan provides all of the information set forth in this section; 
b.  The C&D waste plan indicates that the diversion requirements of Section 15.54.040 of this chapter are met; and

2.  Nonapproval. If the compliance official determines that the C&D waste plan is incomplete or fails to indicate that the diversion requirements of Section 15.54.040 of this chapter will be met, he or she shall either: 
a.  Return the C&D waste plan to the applicant marked "Disapproved," including a statement of reasons, and will notify the building department, which shall then immediately stop processing the building or demolition permit application; or 
b.  Return the C&D waste plan to the applicant marked "Further Explanation Required." 
(Ord. 930 § 2 (part), 2005)  
15.54.080 - Performance security. 
A.  The applicant for a building or demolition permit shall submit a performance security along with the C&D waste plan. This performance security shall be in the amount of one percent of the building permit valuation, but not greater than one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00). 
B.  For large projects, a one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00) performance security will be deposited. The security may be carried forward to the following phase provided the contractor has met the required diversion requirements. If diversion requirements are not met and a portion or all of the performance security is forfeited, the security must be replenished to meet one hundred thousand dollars ($100,000.00). The dollar amount to be replenished will be based on the diversion schedule in Section 15.54.130 of this chapter. 
C.  The applicant shall post performance security in the form of cash, money order, letter of credit, performance or surety bond. 
(Ord. 930 § 2 (part), 2005)

A.  The compliance official may authorize the refund of any performance security which was erroneously paid or collected. 
B.  The compliance official may authorize the refund of any performance security when the building permit application is withdrawn or cancelled before any work has begun. 
C.  The performance security shall be returned, without interest, in total or prorated, upon proof of satisfaction by the compliance official that no less than the required percentage of construction and demolition waste tonnage generated by the covered project has been diverted from disposal and has been recycled or reused. If a lesser percentage of construction and demolition waste tonnage than is required is diverted, a proportionate share of the deposit shall be returned. The deposit shall be forfeited entirely or to the prorated extent that there is a failure to comply with the requirements of this chapter. The city may, by formal resolution, modify the amount of the required security. 
(Ord. 930 § 2 (part), 2005)  
15.54.100 - Use of performance security. 
A.  Monies received by the city as performance security shall be used only for: 
1.  Payment of performance security refunds; 
2.  Programs to divert construction, demolition, and alteration projects from the landfill; 
3.  Programs whose purpose is to develop or improve the infrastructure needed to divert wastes from construction, demolition, and alteration projects from landfill disposal; 
4.  Allocated staff costs. 
(Ord. 930 § 2 (part), 2005)  
15.54.110 - Reporting. 
A.  To the extent practical, all construction and demolition waste shall be weighed in compliance with all regulatory requirements for accuracy and maintenance. For construction and demolition waste for which weighing is not practical due to small size or other considerations, a volumetric measurement shall be used. For conversion of volumetric measurements to weight, the applicant shall use the standardized conversion rates approved by the city for this purpose. 
B.  Throughout the duration of the project, the applicant is required to submit documentation to the compliance official that proves compliance with the requirements of Sections 15.54.040 and 15.54.070 of this chapter. The documentation shall consist of monthly updates showing waste tonnage data, total tonnage, tonnage diverted, and tonnage landfilled supported by original or certified photocopies of receipts and weight tags or other records of measurement from recycling companies, deconstruction contractors, and/or landfill and disposal companies. Receipts and weight tags will be used to verify whether waste generated from the covered project has been or is being recycled, reused, salvaged or disposed. The applicant shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that all designated recyclable and reuse waste salvaged or disposed are measured and recorded using the most accurate method of measurement available. If the applicant fails to complete this requirement, the building inspector or compliance official will consider placing a stop work order on the project or covered project to ensure compliance with this section. 
C.  Within sixty (60) days following the completion of the demolition of a covered project (if applicable), and again within sixty (60) days following the final inspection of the project, the applicant shall submit documentation to the compliance official that proves compliance with the requirements of Sections 15.54.040 and 15.54.070 of this chapter. The documentation shall consist of a final completed C&D waste plan showing actual waste tonnage data, supported by original or certified photocopies of receipts and weight tags or other records of measurement from recycling companies, deconstruction contractors, and/or landfill and disposal companies. Receipts and weight tags will be used to verify whether waste generated from the covered project has been or is to be recycled, reused, salvaged, or disposed. The applicant shall make reasonable efforts to ensure that all designated recyclable and reuse waste salvaged or disposed are measured and recorded using the most accurate method of measurement available. If the applicant fails to comply with this requirement, the performance security will be forfeited. 
(Ord. 930 § 2 (part), 2005)  
15.54.120 - Forfeiture of performance security. 
A.  If the compliance official determines that the applicant has not made a good faith effort to comply with this chapter, or if the applicant fails to submit the documentation required by Sections 15.54.070, 15.54.110, and 15.54.130 of this chapter within the sixty (60)-day time period, then the deposit shall be forfeited to the city. 
B.  If it has been determined through the monthly progress of submitted documentation that the project is failing to meet the criteria of Section 15.54.040 of this chapter, the city reserves the right to hire appropriate assistance necessary for the project to achieve compliance. If this occurs, the applicant will be held liable for the costs associated with compliance. 
C.  If the compliance official determines that the applicant has diverted a lesser percentage of construction and demolition waste tonnage than required, the deposit shall be forfeited entirely or to the prorated extent that there is failure of compliance. 
(Ord. 930 § 2 (part), 2005)  
15.54.130 - Compliance and release of performance security. 
The compliance official shall review the information submitted under Section 15.54.110 of this chapter and determine whether the applicant has complied with the diversion requirement as follows: 
A.  Full Compliance. If the compliance official determines that the applicant has fully complied with the diversion requirement applicable to the project, the compliance official shall cause the performance security to be returned in full, without interest, within fifteen (15) days. 
B.  Partial Compliance. If the contractor is not found in compliance but has submitted required forms and documentation, the city may refund a percentage of the deposit for partial compliance. See schedule in this subsection to determine the amount of the security to be refunded based on the level of diversion obtained and supported. 
% Diverted 	% Deposit Returned 
50% 	100% 
4049% 	80% 
3039% 	60% 
2029% 	40% 
1019% 	20% 
Under 10% 	0% 
 
C.  Noncompliance. If the compliance official determines that the applicant has not fully or partially complied with the diversion requirement, or if the applicant fails to submit the documentation required by Section 15.54.110 of this chapter within the sixty (60)-day time period, then the performance security shall be forfeited to the city. 
(Ord. 930 § 2 (part), 2005)  
15.54.140 - Appeal/administrative appeal. 
A.  Any decision of a code compliance officer made under Section 15.54.130 of this chapter may be appealed under the procedure set forth in Chapter 3.28 of this code. 
(Ord. 930 § 2 (part), 2005)  
15.54.150 - Option to revise. 
Annually, the city will evaluate the Recycling and Diversion of Construction and Demolition Waste Ordinance to determine its effectiveness in reducing the amount of C&D waste disposed. In making this determination, the city will consider issues such as the amount of C&D waste disposed, volume of C&D activity, markets for C&D waste, and other barriers encountered by applicants. If the city determines the C&D disposed had the potential for diversion, then the city may amend these provisions and implement the necessary measures to divert more C&D waste. 
(Ord. 930 § 2 (part), 2005)  
15.54.160 - Violation as a public nuisance. 
A violation of any provision of this chapter shall be a public nuisance subject to the enforcement provisions of Title 3 of this code. 
(Ord. 930 § 2 (part), 2005)  
15.54.170 - Misdemeanor violation.

Chapter 15.56 - FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT* 
Sections:  
Article I - Statutory Authorization, Findings of Fact, Purpose and Methods 
 
15.56.010 - Statutory authorization. 
The legislature of the state of California has in Government Code Sections 65302, 65560, and 65800 conferred upon local governments the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city of Coachella of the county of Riverside does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations. 
(Ord. 1005 § 2 (part), 2008: Ord. 1002 § 2 (part), 2008)  
15.56.020 - Findings of fact. 
A.  The flood hazard areas of Coachella Valley are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
B.  These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities also contributes to flood losses. 
(Ord. 1005 § 2 (part), 2008: Ord. 1002 § 2 (part), 2008)  
15.56.030 - Statement of purpose. 
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by legally enforceable regulations applied uniformly throughout the community to all publicly and privately owned land within flood prone, mudslide (i.e., mudflow) or flood related erosion areas. These regulations are designed to: 
A.  Protect human life and health; 
B.  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
C.  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
D.  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
E.  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
F.  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage; 
G.  Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and 
H.  Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. 
(Ord. 1005 § 2 (part), 2008: Ord. 1002 § 2 (part), 2008)  
15.56.040 - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes regulations to: 
A.  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities; 
B.  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
C.  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters; 
D.  Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; 
E.  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. 
(Ord. 1005 § 2 (part), 2008: Ord. 1002 § 2 (part), 2008)  
Article II - Definitions 
 
15.56.050 - Definitions. 
Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application. 
A Zone. See "Special flood hazard area." 
"Accessory structure" means a structure that is either: 
1.  Solely for the parking of no more than two cars; or

"Area of shallow flooding" means a designated AO or AH zone on the flood insurance rate map (FIRM). The base flood depths range from one to three feet; a clearly defined channel does not exist; the path of flooding is unpredictable and indeterminate; and velocity flow may be evident. Such flooding is characterized by ponding or sheet flow. 
Area of Special Flood Hazard. See "Special flood hazard area." 
"Base flood" means a flood which has a one percent chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year (also called the "one hundred (100) year flood"). Base flood is the term used throughout this chapter. 
"Base flood elevation (BFE)" means the elevation shown on the flood insurance rate map for zones AE, AH, A1-30, VE and V1-V30 that indicates the water surface elevation resulting from a flood that has a one percent or greater chance of being equaled or exceeded in any given year. 
"Basement" means any area of the building having its floor subgrade - i.e., below ground level - on all sides. 
Building. See "Structure." 
"Development" means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, mining, dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations or storage of equipment or materials. 
"Encroachment" means the advance or infringement of uses, plant growth, fill, excavation, buildings, permanent structures or development into a floodplain which may impede or alter the flow capacity of a floodplain. 
"Existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before August 19, 1980. 
"Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
"Flood," "flooding," or "floodwater" means: 
1.  A general and temporary condition of partial or complete inundation of normally dry land areas from the overflow of inland or tidal waters; the unusual and rapid accumulation or runoff of surface waters from any source; and/or mudslides (i.e., mudflows); and 
2.  The condition resulting from flood-related erosion. 
"Flood boundary and floodway map (FBFM)" means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the floodway. 
"Flood insurance rate map (FIRM)" means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
"Flood insurance study" means the official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the flood insurance rate map, the flood boundary and floodway map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood. 
"Floodplain" or "flood-prone area" means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source - see "Flooding." 
"Floodplain administrator" is the community official designated by title to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations. 
"Floodplain management" means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans. 
"Floodplain management regulations" means this chapter and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other application of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state or local regulations in any combination thereof which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. 
"Floodproofing" means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents. For guidelines on dry and wet floodproofing, see FEMA Technical Bulletins TB 1-93, TB 3-93, and TB 7-93. 
"Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. Also referred to as "Regulatory Floodway." 
"Floodway fringe" is that area of the floodplain on either side of the "Regulatory Floodway" where encroachment may be permitted. 
"Fraud and victimization" as related to Article VI of this chapter, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the city council will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty (50) to one hundred years (100). Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates. 
"Functionally dependent use" means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, and does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
"Governing body" is the local governing unit, i.e., county or municipality, that is empowered to adopt and implement regulations to provide for the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. 
"Hardship" as related to Article VI of this chapter means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The city council requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. 
"Highest adjacent grade" means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
"Historic structure" means any structure that is: 
1.  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
2.  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
3.  Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of Interior; or 
4.  Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either by an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
"Levee" means a man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
"Levee system" means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accord with sound engineering practices. 
"Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement (see "Basement" definition). 
1.  An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure below the lowest floor that is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor provided it conforms to applicable non-elevation design requirements, including, but not limited to: 
a.  The flood openings standard in Section 15.56.170(C)(3); 
b.  The anchoring standards in Section 15.56.170(A);

Article IV - Administration 
 
15.56.130 - Designation of the floodplain administrator. 
The director of public works is appointed to administer, implement, and enforce this chapter by granting or denying development permits in accord with its provisions. 
(Ord. 1005 § 2 (part), 2008: Ord. 1002 § 2 (part), 2008)  
15.56.140 - Duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator. 
The duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator shall include, but not be limited to the following: 
A.  Permit Review. Review all development permits to determine: 
1.  Permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied, including determination of substantial improvement and substantial damage of existing structures; 
2.  All other required state and federal permits have been obtained; 
3.  The site is reasonably safe from flooding; 
4.  The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a floodway has not been designated. This means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the city of Coachella; and 
5.  All letters of map revision (LOMR's) for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMR's). Approved CLOMR's allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the "start of construction" definition. 
B.  Development of Substantial Improvement and Substantial Damage Procedures. 
1.  Using FEMA publication FEMA 213, "Answers to Questions About Substantially Damaged Buildings," develop detailed procedures for identifying and administering requirements for substantial improvement and substantial damage, to include defining "Market Value." 
2.  Assure procedures are coordinated with other departments/divisions and implemented by community staff. 
C.  Review, Use and Development of Other Base Flood Data. When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Section 15.56.070, the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or state agency, or other source, in order to administer Article V. 
NOTE: A base flood elevation may be obtained using one of two methods from the FEMA publication, FEMA 265, "Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A AreasA Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base (100-year) Flood Elevations" dated July 1995. 
D.  Notification of Other Agencies. 
1.  Alteration or Relocation of a Watercourse. 
a.  Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of Water Resources prior to alteration or relocation; 
b.  Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency; and 
c.  Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained. 
2.  Base Flood Elevation Changes Due to Physical Alterations. 
a.  Within six months of information becoming available or project completion, whichever comes first, the floodplain administrator shall submit or assure that the permit applicant submits technical or scientific data to FEMA for a letter of map revision (LOMR). 
b.  All LOMR's for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMR's). Approved CLOMR's allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the "start of construction" definition. 
Such submissions are necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain management requirements are based on current data. 
3.  Changes in Corporate Boundaries. Notify FEMA in writing whenever the corporate boundaries have been modified by annexation or other means and include a copy of a map of the community clearly delineating the new corporate limits. 
E.  Documentation of Floodplain Development. Obtain and maintain for public inspection and make available as needed the following: 
1.  Certification required by Sections 15.56.170(C)(1) and 15.56.200 (lowest floor elevations); 
2.  Certification required by Section 15.56.170(C)(2) (elevation or floodproofing of nonresidential structures); 
3.  Certification required by Sections 15.56.170(C)(3) (wet floodproofing standard); 
4.  Certification of elevation required by Section 15.56.190(A)(3) (subdivisions and other proposed development standards); 
5.  Certification required by Section 15.56.220(B) (floodway encroachments); and 
6.  Maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
F.  Map Determination. Make interpretations where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in Section 15.56.160. 
F.  Remedial Action. Take action to remedy violations of this chapter as specified in Section 15.56.080. 
G.  Biennial Report. Complete and submit Biennial Report to FEMA. 
H.  Planning. Assure community's general plan is consistent with floodplain management objectives herein.

b.  Be certified by a registered civil engineer or architect. 
4.  Manufactured Homes. 
a.  See Section 15.56.200. 
5.  Garages and Low Cost Accessory Structures. 
a.  Attached Garages. 
i.  A garage attached to a residential structure, constructed with the garage floor slab below the BFE, must be designed to allow for the automatic entry of floodwaters. See Section 15.56.170(C)(3). Areas of the garage below the BFE must be constructed with flood resistant materials. See Section 15.56.170(B). 
ii.  A garage attached to a nonresidential structure must meet the above requirements or be dry floodproofed. For guidance on below grade parking areas, see FEMA Technical Bulletin TB-6. 
b.  Detached garages and accessory structures. 
1.  "Accessory structures" used solely for parking (two car detached garages or smaller) or limited storage (small, low-cost sheds), as defined in Section 15.56.050, may be constructed such that its floor is below the base flood elevation (BFE), provided the structure is designed and constructed in accordance with the following requirements:

A.  All manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved, on sites located: (1) outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; (2) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision; (3) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or (4) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision upon which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, shall: 
1.  Within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's flood insurance rate map, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation and be securely fastened to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
B.  All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's flood insurance rate map that are not subject to the provisions of Section 15.56.200(A) will be securely fastened to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, and be elevated so that either the: 
1.  Lowest floor of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation; or 
2.  Manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than thirty-six (36) inches in height above grade.

3.  Meet the permit requirements of Section 15.56.150 of this chapter and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes in Section 15.56.200(A). 
(Ord. 1005 § 2 (part), 2008: Ord. 1002 § 2 (part), 2008)  
15.56.220 - Floodways. 
Since floodways are an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply: 
A.  Until a regulatory floodway is adopted, no new construction, substantial development, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within zones A1-30 and AE, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the city of Coachella. 
B.  Within an adopted regulatory floodway, the city of Coachella shall prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development, unless certification by a registered civil engineer is provided demonstrating that the proposed encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
C.  If Sections 15.56.220(A) and (B) are satisfied, all new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Article V. 
(Ord. 1005 § 2 (part), 2008: Ord. 1002 § 2 (part), 2008)  
Article VI - Variance Procedure 
 
15.56.230 - Nature of variances. 
The issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only. Insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance. 
The variance criteria set forth in this section of the ordinance are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners. 
It is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. 
(Ord. 1005 § 2 (part), 2008: Ord. 1002 § 2 (part), 2008)  
15.56.240 - Conditions for variances. 
A.  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the procedures of Articles IV and V of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
B.  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "historic structures" (as defined in Section 15.56.050 of this chapter) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
C.  Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
D.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the "minimum necessary" considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance. 
E.  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that: 
1.  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars ($25.00) for one hundred dollars ($100.00) of insurance coverage; and 
2.  Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. It is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the Riverside County recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land. 
F.  The floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(Ord. 1005 § 2 (part), 2008: Ord. 1002 § 2 (part), 2008)  
15.56.250 - Appeal board. 
A.  In passing upon requests for variances, the city council shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the: 
1.  Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
2.  Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
3.  Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property; 
4.  Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
5.  Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
6.  Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
7.  Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
8.  Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
9.  Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
10.  Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site; and 
11.  Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges. 
B.  Variances shall only be issued upon a: 
1.  Showing of good and sufficient cause; 
2.  Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional "hardship" to the applicant; and 
3.  Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance (see "Public safety and nuisance"), cause "fraud and victimization" of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
C.  Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of subsections A through D of this section are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance. 
D.  Upon consideration of the factors of Section 15.56.240(A) and the purposes of this chapter, the city council may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

1.0 ALLUVIAL FAN ADVISORY 
Hazards of Alluvial Fan Development 
Alluvial fans present a unique flood hazard environment where the combination of sediment, slope, and topography create an ultra hazardous condition for which elevation on fill will not provide reliable protection. Active alluvial fan flooding is characterized by flow path uncertainty combined with abrupt deposition and erosion. As a result, any area of an alluvial fan may be subject to intense flood hazards. 
The technology of mathematically modeling the hydrodynamics of water and debris flows for alluvial fans is still in the early development stage. The Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has formulated a mapping procedure for the purpose of defining the likelihood of flood hazards on inundated alluvial fan zones to be used for flood insurance purposes and general floodplain regulation, referred to as the FEMA alluvial fan methodology. 
An active alluvial fan flooding hazard is indicated by three related criteria: 
a. Flow path uncertainty below the hydrographic apex; 
b. Abrupt deposition and ensuing erosion of sediment as a stream or debris flow loses its competence to carry material eroded from a steeper, upstream source area; and 
c. An environment where the combination of sediment availability, slope, and topography creates an ultra hazardous condition for which elevation on fill will not reliably mitigate the risk. 
Inactive alluvial fan flooding is similar to traditional riverine flood hazards, but occurs only on alluvial fans. It is characterized by flow paths with a higher degree of certainty in realistic assessments of flood risk or in the reliable mitigation of the hazard. Counter to active alluvial fan flooding hazards, an inactive alluvial fan flooding hazard is characterized by relatively stable flow paths. However, areas of inactive alluvial fan flooding, as with active alluvial fan flooding, may be subject to sediment deposition and erosion, but to a degree that does not cause flow path instability and uncertainty. 
An alluvial fan may exhibit both active alluvial fan flooding and inactive alluvial fan flooding hazards. The hazards may vary spatially or vary at the same location, contingent on the level of flow discharge. Spatially, for example, upstream inactive portions of the alluvial fan may distribute flood flow to active areas at the distal part of the alluvial fan. Hazards may vary at the same location, for example, with a flow path that may be stable for lower flows, but become unstable at higher flows. 
More detailed information can be found at FEMA's website: "Guidelines for Determining Flood Hazards on Alluvial Fans" at http://www.fema.gov/fhm/ft_afgd2.shtm#1. 
Alluvial Fans and LOMR's 
The NFIP does not allow for the removal of land from the floodplain based on the placement of fill (LOMR-F) in alluvial fan flood hazard areas. The NFIP will credit a major structural flood control project, through the LOMR process, that will effectively eliminate alluvial fan flood hazards from the protected area. Details about map revisions for alluvial fan areas can be found in the Code of Federal Regulations at Title 44, Part 65.13. 
Alluvial Fan Task Force 
 As stated in AB 2141 (Longville, Chapter 878, Statutes of 2004), the State of California Department of Water Resources will convene an Alluvial Fan Task Force (AFTF). The AFTF will produce an alluvial fan model ordinance for local communities and a recommendations report to the legislature. As of March 2006, the ordinance and report are projected to be completed by 2007. 
2.0 HIGHER STANDARDS RECOMMENDED BY THE STATE OF CALIFORNIA 
This ordinance meets the minimum standards required to participate in the National Flood Insurance Program. Community adoption of higher standards can be applied towards credit under the Community Rating System (CRS) program and result in reduced premiums for all flood insurance policy holders within the entire community. The State of California recommends: 
A. Freeboard. 
 To elevate at least 2 feet above the minimum required base flood elevation, make the following changes: 
1. Modify Sections 5.1.C.1.a, 5.1.C.1.C, and 5.4.A.1 by replacing "elevated to or above" with "elevated 2 feet above." 
2. Modify Section 5.4.B.1 by replacing "at or above" with "at least 2 feet above." 
3. Replace Section 5.1.C.1.b with: 
In an AO zone, elevated above the highest adjacent grade to a height 2 feet above the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM, or elevated at least 4 feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified. 
B. Determining BFE's in Unnumbered A Zones. 
 Replace "may" with "shall" in the second paragraph of Section 4.2.C to read: 
"NOTE: A base flood elevation shall" 
C. Determining Market Value of Existing Structures. 
 Replace the "Market value" definition in Section 2 with: 
"Market value" shall be determined by estimating the cost to replace the structure in new condition and adjusting that cost figure by the amount of depreciation which has accrued since the structure was constructed. 
1. The cost of replacement of the structure shall be based on a square foot cost factor determined by reference to a building cost estimating guide recognized by the building construction industry. 
2. The amount of depreciation shall be determined by taking into account the age and physical deterioration of the structure and functional obsolescence as approved by the floodplain administrator, but shall not include economic or other forms of external obsolescence. 
Use of replacement costs or accrued depreciation factors different from those contained in recognized building cost estimating guides may be considered only if such factors are included in a report prepared by an independent professional appraiser and supported by a written explanation of the differences. 
D. Increased Cost of Compliance (ICC) CoverageRepetitive Loss Provisions. 
This provision allows communities the opportunity for flood insurance policy holders to have ICC coverage made available in repetitive loss situations. 
 Modify the definition of "Substantial damage" as follows: 
"Substantial damage" means: 
1. Damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred; or 
2. Flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a 10-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such event, on the average, equals or exceeds 25 percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. This is also known as "repetitive loss." 
E. Non-conversion of Enclosed Areas Below the Lowest Floor. 
 Insert/add the following section as Section 4.2.J. 
A. Non-conversion of Enclosed Areas Below the Lowest Floor. 
To ensure that the areas below the BFE shall be used solely for parking vehicles, limited storage, or access to the building and not be finished for use as human habitation without first becoming fully compliant with the floodplain management ordinance in effect at the time of conversion, the Floodplain Administrator shall: 
1. Determine which applicants for new construction and/or substantial improvements have fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are 5 feet or higher; 
2. Enter into a "NON-CONVERSION AGREEMENT FOR CONSTRUCTION WITHIN FLOOD HAZARD AREAS" or equivalent with the City of Coachella. The agreement shall be recorded with the County of Riverside County Recorder as a deed restriction. The non-conversion agreement shall be in a form acceptable to the Floodplain Administrator and County Counsel; and 
3. Have the authority to inspect any area of a structure below the base flood elevation to ensure compliance upon prior notice of at least 72 hours. 
3.0 SPECIAL REQUIREMENTS 
A. Crawlspace Construction. 
Communities with construction practices that result in crawl spaces with interior floors up to 2 feet below grade have historically been in violation of the NFIP requirements. FEMA Technical Bulletin 11-01 now provides accommodation for these practices. 
 Remove the following from "Lowest floor" definition in Section 2: 
2. For residential structures, all subgrade enclosed areas are prohibited as they are considered to be basements (see "Basement" definition). This prohibition includes below-grade garages and storage areas. 
 Add the following section into your ordinance at Section 5.1 .C: 
5.1 .C. Crawlspace Construction. 
This sub-section applies to buildings with crawl spaces up to 2 feet below grade. Below-grade crawl space construction in accordance with the requirements listed below will not be considered basements. 
a. The building must be designed and adequately anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy. Crawl space construction is not allowed in areas with flood velocities greater than 5 feet per second unless the design is reviewed by a qualified design professional, such as a registered architect or professional engineer; 
b. The crawl space is an enclosed area below the BFE and, as such, must have openings that equalize hydrostatic pressures by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. For guidance on flood openings, see FEMA Technical Bulletin 1-93; 
c. Crawl space construction is not permitted in V zones. Open pile or column foundations that withstand storm surge and wave forces are required in V zones; 
d. Portions of the building below the BFE must be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage. This includes not only the foundation walls of the crawl space used to elevate the building, but also any joists, insulation, or other materials that extend below the BFE; and 
e. Any building utility systems within the crawl space must be elevated above BFE or designed so that floodwaters cannot enter or accumulate within the system components during flood conditions. 
f. Requirements for all below-grade crawl space construction, in addition to the above requirements, to include the following: 
1. The interior grade of a crawl space below the BFE must not be more than 2 feet below the lowest adjacent exterior grade (LAG), shown as D in figure 3 of Technical Bulletin 11-01; 
2. The height of the below-grade crawl space, measured from the interior grade of the crawl space to the top of the crawl space foundation wall must not exceed 4 feet (shown as L in figure 3 of Technical Bulletin 11-01) at any point; 
3. There must be an adequate drainage system that removes floodwaters from the interior area of the crawl space within a reasonable period of time after a flood event, not to exceed 72 hours; and 
4. The velocity of floodwaters at the site should not exceed 5 feet per second for any crawl space. For velocities in excess of 5 feet per second, other foundation types should be used. 
B. Mudslide (i.e., Mudflow) Prone Areas. (Zone M) 
 Communities with mudslide prone areas shall insert the following: 
1. Definitions to Section 2: 
"Area of special mudslide (i.e., mudflow) hazard" is the area subject to severe mudslides (i.e., mudflows). The area is designated as Zone M on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). 
"Mudslide" describes a condition where there is a river, flow or inundation of liquid mud down a hillside, usually as a result of a dual condition of loss of brush cover and the subsequent accumulation of water on the ground, preceded by a period of unusually heavy or sustained rain. 
"Mudslide (i.e., mudflow) prone area" means an area with land surfaces and slopes of unconsolidated material where the history, geology, and climate indicate a potential for mudflow. 
2. Section " 5.{X} Mudslide (i.e., Mudflow) Prone Areas ": 
5.{X} Mudslide (i.e., Mudflow) Prone Areas. 
A.  The Floodplain Administrator shall review permits for proposed construction of other development to determine if it is proposed within a mudslide area. 
B.  Permits shall be reviewed to determine that the proposed site and improvement will be reasonably safe from mudslide hazards. Factors to be considered in making this determination include, but are not limited to: 
1. The type and quality of soils; 
2. Evidence of ground water or surface water problems; 
3. Depth and quality of any fill; 
4. Overall slope of the site; and 
5. Weight that any proposed development will impose on the slope. 
C.  Within areas which may have mudslide hazards, the Floodplain Administrator shall require: 
1. A site investigation and further review by persons qualified in geology and soils engineering; 
2. The proposed grading, excavation, new construction, and substantial improvement be adequately designed and protected against mudslide damages; 
3. The proposed grading, excavations, new construction, and substantial improvement not aggravate the existing hazard by creating either on-site or off-site disturbances; and 
4. Drainage, planting, watering, and maintenance not endanger slope stability. 
C. Erosion-prone areas. (Zone E) 
 Communities with erosion prone areas shall insert the following: 
1. Definitions into Section 2: 
"Area of special flood-related erosion hazard" is the land within a community which is most likely to be subject to severe flood-related erosion losses. The area may be designated as Zone E on the Flood Insurance Rate Map (FIRM). 
"Flood-related erosion" means the collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical level or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as a flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusually and unforeseeable event which results in flooding. 
"Flood-related erosion area" or "Flood-related erosion prone area" means a land area adjoining the shore of a lake or other body of water, which due to the composition of the shoreline or bank and high water levels or wind-driven currents, is likely to suffer flood-related erosion damage. 
"Flood-related erosion area management" means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood-related erosion damage, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood-related erosion control works, and floodplain management regulations. 
2. Section " 5.{X} FLOOD-RELATED EROSION-PRONE AREA " into Section 5: 
5.{X} FLOOD-RELATED EROSION-PRONE AREA 
A.  The Floodplain Administrator shall require permits for proposed construction and other development within all flood-related erosion-prone areas known to the community. 
B.  Permit applications shall be reviewed to determine whether the proposed site alterations and improvements will be reasonably safe from flood-related erosion, and will not cause flood-related erosion hazards or otherwise aggravate the existing hazard. 
C.  If a proposed improvement is found to be in the path of flood-related erosion or would increase the erosion hazard, such improvement shall be relocated or adequate protective measures shall be taken to avoid aggravating the existing erosion hazard. 
D.  Within Zone E on the Flood Insurance Rate Map, a setback is required for all new development from the ocean, lake, bay, riverfront or other body of water to create a safety buffer consisting of a natural vegetative or contour strip. This buffer shall be designated according to the flood-related erosion hazard and erosion rate, in relation to the anticipated "useful life" of structures, and depending upon the geologic, hydrologic, topographic, and climatic characteristics of the land. The buffer may be used for suitable open space purposes, such as for agricultural, forestry, outdoor recreation and wildlife habitat areas, and for other activities using temporary and portable structures only.

(Ord. 969 § 1, 2007)  
15.60.040 - Purpose and intent; violation of chapter. 
The city council has determined that the quality of life in Coachella is tied to the character and condition of real property within the city, and that inadequate property maintenance tends to cause a diminution in the enjoyment, use, aesthetics, and value of surrounding properties. It is the purpose of this chapter to restate, cross-reference, and amend the city's property maintenance standards, in an effort to promote public awareness of those standards, visual unity and order, as well as enhance the value of land and development within the city, and protect the appearance, integrity and character of the community. Restatements and cross-references of existing code provisions and laws are not intended to supersede or conflict with those laws. 
Inspection of property for compliance with these standards may be accomplished in any constitutionally permissible fashion including inspection from public rights-of-way, inspection with a property owner or occupier's consent, and inspection through a court-issued warrant. Violations of the property management standards of this chapter are declared a public nuisance, which may be abated by the city in accordance with Chapter 8.20 of this code. In addition to or in lieu of such administrative abatement, the city may pursue any other legal or equitable remedies available to it under this code or state law, including, but not limited to, the procedures contained in the California Health and Safety Code. 
(Ord. 988 § 6 (part), 2007)  
15.60.050 - Substandard buildings and housing. 
Buildings and structures on property shall not be left abandoned, partially destroyed, in an "unreasonable state of partial construction," or in a condition that violates an applicable provision of the California Health and Safety Code or of the California Codes previously adopted by the city, as the same currently exist or may hereafter be amended. See California Health and Safety Code Sections 17920.3, 17922.2; see also Title 15 of this code. 
For purposes of this section, the following definitions shall apply: 
"Abandoned" means forsaken and devoid of any apparent owner or other person claiming title, or unoccupied and unmaintained for such an extended period of time and in such a manner as to give an outward appearance that all claims to possession or control have been relinquished. 
"Partially destroyed" means severely damaged by fire, flood, earthquake, vandalism or other forces and, as a result, substantially detracting from the appearance of the immediate neighborhood or reduces the property values in the immediate neighborhood. 
"Unreasonable state of partial construction" means a state in which building permits for construction have expired before the completion of construction and the partially constructed building or structure substantially detracts from the appearance of the immediate neighborhood, or reduces the property values in the immediate neighborhood. 
(Ord. 988 § 6 (part), 2007)  
Chapter 15.62 - SAFETY ASSESSMENT PLACARDS 
Sections: 
 
15.62.010 - Intent. 
This chapter establishes standard placards to be used to indicate the condition of a structure for continued occupancy. The chapter further authorizes the building official and his or her authorized representatives to post the appropriate placard at each entry point to a building or structure upon completion of a safety assessment. 
(Ord. 958 § 1 (part), 2006)  
15.62.020 - Application of provisions.

Within seven working days of filing of a tentative subdivision map, together with all required documents, the director shall transmit the requested number of copies of the map together with accompanying data to such public agencies and public and private utilities as may be concerned. Each of the public agencies and utilities may, within ten (10) days after the map has been received by such agency, forward to the director a written report of its findings and recommendations thereon. Within twenty-five (25) days after submission, the director will hold a conference on the tentative map with the subdivider and the development committee. 
The director shall prepare a written report of recommendations on the tentative map in relation to the requirements of this chapter and other applicable regulations of the city or public and private utilities and shall submit the same to the commission within thirty (30) days after the filing of the map and supporting documents. 
(Prior code § 21-67)  
16.12.080 - Development committee. 
The development committee shall make such recommendations to the subdivider as seem proper regarding such tentative map, and shall recommend consultations by the subdivider with such organizations, including public and private utilities as it shall designate and shall report its conclusions and findings in writing to the subdivider within seven days of the conference. This procedure is not required in the processing of a parcel split. However, consultation with the director prior to the preparation of a tentative parcel map is recommended. 
(Prior code § 21-68)  
16.12.090 - Planning commissionResolution. 
The commission shall consider the tentative map as submitted by the subdivider together with the recommendations prepared by the director. The director may, with a minimum of three working days' notice, require that all or any part of the boundaries and/or streets of a proposed subdivision be flagged at the site to facilitate any field review of the commission. The commission shall report, by resolution, on the map of any subdivision submitted to it within fifty (50) days after the tentative map, including environmental assessment, has been filed and the resolution shall recommend approval, conditional approval or disapproval. The number, size and configuration of lots to be created and alignment and width of streets and easements shall be depicted upon the tentative map prior to approval by the commission. Conditions to make the map approvable which involve modification to lots in terms of number, size or configuration, or to streets in terms of alignment or width may be set forth by the commission for the guidance of the subdivider. However, when such conditions are substantial, the development committee may require that these changes be incorporated upon a revised tentative map and be returned to the director. The director shall have the authority to approve the resubmitted revised tentative map on behalf of the commission if the map is clearly in conformity with the conditions established by the commission. The director may, at his or her discretion, require that the revised map be submitted to the commission for approval in any instance where the map is not clearly in conformity with such conditions. Any report or recommendation on the tentative map by the staff to the commission or council, shall be in writing and a copy thereof shall be served on the subdivider at least three days prior to any hearing or action on such map by the commission or council. 
(Prior code § 21-69)  
16.12.100 - City council action. 
A.  Within ten (10) days or at its next regularly scheduled meeting after receipt of the resolution of the commission on the map, the council shall act thereon. If the council finds that the proposed map complies with the requirements of this chapter, it shall approve the map. If the council finds that the proposed map does not meet the requirements or conditions of this chapter or the map act, it shall disapprove the map. The council may waive any irregularities in the proposed map if a determination is made that such irregularity is the result of a technical or inadvertent error which does not materially affect the validity of the map. The council shall approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove the tentative map by resolution within thirty (30) days after the filing of the commission's resolution. The council may extend the time within which it must act with the consent of the applicant. 
B.  No map shall be approved unless the council finds that the proposed subdivision, together with the provisions for its design and improvement, is consistent with the general plan. 
C.  The council shall deny approval of a tentative map, as required by the map act, if it makes any of the following findings: 
1.  That the proposed map is not consistent with applicable general and specific plans; 
2.  That the design or improvement of the proposed subdivision is not consistent with applicable general and specific plans; 
3.  That the site is not physically suitable for the type of development; 
4.  That the site is not physically suitable for the proposed density of development; 
5.  That the design of the subdivision or the proposed improvements are likely to cause substantial environmental damage or substantially and unavoidably injure fish or wildlife or their habitat; 
6.  That the design of the subdivision or the type of improvements is likely to cause serious public health problems; and 
7.  That the design of the subdivision or the type of improvements will conflict with easements, acquired by the public at large, for access through or use of property within the proposed subdivision. In this connection, the governing body may approve a map if it finds that alternate easements, for access or for use, will be provided, and that these will be substantially equivalent to ones previously acquired by the public. 
This subsection shall apply only to easements of record or to easements established by judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction and no authority is granted to a legislative body to determine that the public at large has acquired easements for access through or use of property within the proposed subdivision. 
(Prior code § 21-70)  
16.12.110 - Public hearing. 
All tentative subdivision maps shall be reviewed by both the planning commission and the city council at duly noticed public hearings. Notice of public hearings shall be by both mailed notice and posting of the property. 
A.  Written notice shall be mailed to the subdivider and to the owners of all property within three hundred (300) feet of the exterior boundaries of the property involved at least ten (10) days prior to the date of the hearing. The last known name and address of each owner as shown on the records of the county assessor may be used for the notice. 
B.  An agent of the city planner shall post notices of public hearings not less than ten (10) days before the event. At least three notices, not more than three hundred (300) feet apart, shall be posted in front of each block or part of a block effected by the public hearing. 
C.  Notification of subsequent hearings may be given at each preceding meeting, but additional written notice is not required. 
D.  Any interested person may appear at a hearing and shall be heard. 
(Prior code § 21-71)  
16.12.120 - Suspension of requirementsVariance or adjustment. 
In approving a tentative map, the commission or council may grant a suspension of any of the subdivision requirements set forth or referred to in this chapter, except underground facilities which may be waived only by the council, provided such suspensions are not inconsistent with state law. A variance from the lot area, frontage, width, depth and front yard or setback requirements of the various zones set forth in this code, may also be granted by the commission or the council. Any suspension or variance shall be based upon a sufficient showing that there are special circumstances or conditions affecting the property in question and that such suspension or variance, if granted, will not be materially detrimental to the general welfare of adjacent persons or property, and such other findings for suspension or variance as may be required in other sections of this code. If a suspension or variance is requested, a public hearing shall be conducted as provided in Title 17 of the zoning ordinance. 
The time limits established in Sections 16.12.060 through 16.12.100 may be extended by mutual consent of the subdivider and the commission or council as appropriate. 
(Prior code § 21-72)  
16.12.130 - Retention in files. 
One copy of the map and accompanying data, together with the commission's resolution, any staff reports and a record of the council's resolution with conditions of approval, if any, shall be filed with the director, and retained until recordation of the final map or maps encompassing the total area included in the tentative map. 
(Prior code § 21-73)  
16.12.140 - Extension of time. 
Upon written application of the subdivider made within twenty-four (24) months of the approval or conditional approval of the tentative map, the commission may grant by resolution, an extension of time of up to three one-year time extensions for filing of the final map. Such application shall state the reasons why an extension is needed. 
All applications shall be filed sufficiently in advance of the expiration date to permit inclusion upon commission agenda, and to permit commission action prior to such expiration date. At the time of consideration by the commission of the extension of the approved tentative map, the commission shall hear the testimony of the subdivider or any witnesses in his or her behalf and the testimony of the representatives of the development committee or any other witnesses. Upon conclusion of the hearing or the time of consideration, unless the subdivider and commission mutually agree that additional time is needed for consideration, the commission shall, within seven days, declare its findings by resolution based on the testimony and documents placed before it. The commission may approve, conditionally approve or deny the request for extension. 
The responsibility for making timely application for any extension shall remain entirely with the subdivider, and the city assumes no obligation to notify the subdivider that any tentative map or extension is about to expire. 
(Prior code § 21-74)  
16.12.150 - Revised tentative maps. 
Any revised tentative map shall comply with all the provisions of the map act and this chapter in effect at the time the revised map is approved. Proceedings on a revised tentative map shall be conducted in the same manner as for the original approval of a tentative map. The approval or conditional approval of a revised tentative map shall annul approval of the previous tentative map, but the approval thereof shall not extend the time within which the final map may be filed.

Chapter 16.16 - VESTING TENTATIVE MAPS 
Sections: 
 
16.16.010 - Citation and authority. 
This chapter is enacted pursuant to the authority granted by Chapter 4.5 (commencing with Section 66498.1) of Division 2 of Title 7 of the Government Code of the State of California (referred to as the vesting tentative map statute), and may be cited as "the Vesting Tentative Map Ordinance." 
(Prior code § 21-77)  
16.16.020 - Purpose and intent. 
It is the purpose of this chapter to establish procedures necessary for the implementation of the vesting tentative map statute, and to supplement the provisions of the subdivision map act and the subdivision ordinance. Except as otherwise set forth in the provisions of this chapter, the provisions of this chapter shall apply to this chapter. 
To accomplish this purpose, the regulations outlined in this chapter are determined to be necessary for the preservation of the public health, safety and general welfare, and for the promotion of orderly growth and development. 
(Prior code § 21-78)  
16.16.030 - Consistency. 
No land shall be subdivided and developed pursuant to a vesting tentative map for any purpose which is inconsistent with the general plan and any applicable specific plan or not permitted by the zoning ordinance or other applicable provisions of this code. 
(Prior code § 21-79)  
16.16.040 - Definitions. 
A.  A "vesting tentative map" shall mean a "tentative map" for a residential subdivision, as defined in the Coachella subdivision ordinance, Section 16.04.010 et seq., that shall have printed conspicuously on its face the words "Vesting Tentative Map" at the time it is filed in accordance with Section 16.16.060 and is thereafter processed in accordance with the provisions hereof. 
B.  All other definitions set forth in this chapter are applicable. 
(Prior code § 21-80)  
16.16.050 - Application. 
A.  This chapter shall apply only to residential developments. Whenever a provision of the subdivision map act, as implemented and supplemented by the Coachella subdivision ordinance, requires the filing of a tentative map or tentative parcel map for a residential development, a vesting tentative map may instead be filed, in accordance with the provisions hereof. 
B.  If a subdivider does not seek the rights conferred by the vesting tentative map statute, the filing of a vesting tentative map shall not be a prerequisite to any approval for any proposed subdivision, permit for construction, or work preparatory to construction. 
(Prior code § 21-81)  
16.16.060 - Filing and processing. 
A vesting tentative map shall be filed in the same form and have the same contents, accompanying data and reports and shall be processed in the same manner as set forth in the Coachella subdivision ordinance for a tentative map Chapter 16.12 except as provided in this chapter: 
A.  At the time a vesting tentative map is filed, it shall have printed conspicuously on its face the words "Vesting Tentative Map," and shall be accompanied by the following: 
1.  Height, size and location of buildings; 
2.  Information on the uses to which the buildings will be put; 
3.  Architectural plans; 
4.  Any other studies which the city defers to the time of issuance of a building permit. 
(Prior code § 21-82)  
16.16.070 - Fees. 
Upon filing a vesting tentative map, the subdivider shall pay the fees required for the filing and processing of a tentative map, per Section 16.40.010. 
(Prior code § 21-83)  
16.16.080 - Expiration. 
The approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall expire at the end of the same time period, and shall be subject to the same extensions, established by this chapter for the expiration of the approval or conditional approval of a tentative map. 
(Prior code § 21-84)  
16.16.090 - Development rights vesting on approval of vesting tentative map. 
A.  The approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall confer a vested right to proceed with development in substantial compliance with the ordinances, policies and standards described in Government Code, Section 66474.2. 
However, if Section 66474.2 of the Government Code is repealed, the approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall confer a vested right to proceed with development in substantial compliance with the ordinances, policies and standards in effect at the time the vesting tentative map is approved or conditionally approved. 
B.  Notwithstanding subsection A of this section, a permit approval, extension or entitlement may be made conditional or denied if any of the following are determined: 
1.  A failure to do so would place the residents of the subdivision or the immediate community, or both, in a condition dangerous to their health or safety, or both. 
2.  The condition or denial is required in order to comply with state or federal law. 
C.  The rights referred to herein shall expire if a final map is not approved prior to the expiration of the vesting tentative map as provided in Section 16.16.080. If the final map is approved, these rights shall last for the following periods of time: 
1.  An initial time period of one year. Where several final maps are recorded on various phases of a project covered by a single vesting tentative map, this initial time period shall begin for each phase when the final map for that phase is recorded. 
2.  The initial time period set forth in subsection 1 of this section shall be automatically extended by any time used for processing a complete application for a grading permit or for design or architectural review, if such processing exceeds thirty (30) days, from the date a complete application is filed. 
3.  A subdivider may apply for a one-year extension at any time before the initial time period set forth in subsection 1 of this section expires. If the extension is denied, the subdivider may appeal that denial to the city council within fifteen (15) days. 
4.  If the subdivider submits a complete application for a building permit during the periods of time specified in subsections (C)(1) through (3), the rights referred to in this chapter shall continue until the expiration of that permit, or any extension of that permit. 
(Prior code § 21-85)  
16.16.100 - Development inconsistent with zoningConditional approval. 
A.  Whenever a subdivider files a vesting tentative map for a subdivision whose intended development is inconsistent with the zoning ordinance in existence at that time, that inconsistency shall be noted on the map. The city may deny such a vesting tentative map or approve it conditioned on the subdivider, or his or her designee, obtaining the necessary change in the zoning ordinance to eliminate the inconsistency. If the change in the zoning ordinance is obtained, the approved or conditionally approved vesting tentative map shall, notwithstanding Section 16.16.090(A), confer the vested right to proceed with the development in substantial compliance with the change in the zoning ordinance and the map, as approved. 
B.  The rights conferred by this section shall be for the time periods set forth in Section 16.16.090(C). 
(Prior code § 21-87)  
16.16.110 - Applications inconsistent with current policies. 
Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter, a property owner or his or her designee may seek approvals or permits for development which depart from the ordinances, policies and standards described in Sections 16.16.090(A) and 16.16.100, and local agencies may grant these approvals or issue these permits to the extent that the departures are authorized under applicable law.

Specific details of design shall be subject to the approval of the city engineer, who shall have the authority to approve minor deviations from the minimum standards listed here. 
All subdivisions should result in the creation of lots which are developable and capable of being built upon. No subdivision should create lots which are impractical to improve due to steepness of terrain, location of watercourses, problems of sewerage or driveway grades, or natural physical conditions. 
(Prior code § 21-211)  
16.32.020 - Access to public streets. 
All lots or parcels created by the subdivision of land shall have access to a public street improved to standards hereinafter required. Private streets, common driveways or access easements shall not normally be permitted. However, if the commission determines that the most logical development of the land requires that lots be created which cannot easily be served by a public street, a private access may be approved. The subdivider shall submit a development plan showing the alignment, width, grade and material specifications of any proposed private improvements, the topography and means of access to each lot, drainage and sewerage of the lots served by such private improvements and a plan satisfactory to the city for ownership and maintenance of said access and the liability for taxes thereon. Construction of these improvements as approved by the city shall be completed prior to occupancy of any buildings on lots served by a private access. 
(Prior code § 21-212)  
16.32.030 - Street standards. 
Streets shall conform to the following minimum conditions as set out in this section and Sections 16.32.040 through 16.32.100. 
Subdivision design shall conform to the concept of major streets designated in the general plan, and to any future street rights-of-way designated by the commission and approved by the council. Whenever a subdivision embraces any major street, it shall be included in the tract and shall be platted by the subdivider in the location generally indicated. If a specific location has been designated by the commission and approved by the council, that location shall be used. 
(Prior code § 21-213)  
16.32.040 - Minimum standards. 
Typical sections of various classes of streets shall be in accord with the applicable city standard drawings, and in accord with the following table: 
Classification 	Minimum R/W Width (in feet) 	Minimum T/W Width (in feet) 
State highway 	See Caltrans 	See Caltrans 
Express way 	120 	78 (22' median) 
Major arterial 	110 	64 (22' median) 
Minor arterial 	100 	64 (12' median) 
Major collector 	88 	64 
Minor collector 	60 	40 
Cul-de-sac 	50 	36 
 
The basis for requirements for streets and roadway widths and design shall be the topography of the land and density of development in terms of the proposed number of dwellings to be served by such street or roadway on an ultimate basis. Reduced right-of-way width shall, in all cases, be sufficient to accommodate utility facilities within the right-of-way. 
Improvements as set forth in Chapter 16.28 shall be installed within the half of an existing or proposed street adjacent to the subdivision boundary. Substandard existing improvements shall be removed and replaced as directed by the city engineer. Where an existing street has not previously been paved, paving having a minimum width from face of curb to edge of pavement of twenty-eight (28) shall be installed. 
The subdivider shall dedicate all rights-of-way for streets or portions of streets as necessary within the subdivision boundary. Full width dedications within the subdivision shall have complete improvements installed, except that upon secondary, major and arterial roads, paving upon each half may be a minimum of twenty-four (24) feet in width from the face of curb to edge of pavement, subject to prior approval of the city.

(Prior code § 21.214)  
16.32.050 - Street pattern. 
The street pattern in the subdivision shall provide for the most advantageous development of the site and adjoining areas and the entire neighborhood or district. 
Where appropriate to the design and terrain, proposed streets shall be continuous and in alignment with existing, planned or platted streets with which they are to connect. The center lines of streets, if not in alignment, shall be offset at least two hundred (200) feet unless otherwise approved by the city engineer for reasons of severe topography, one-way streets, or other unusual circumstances. 
Proposed streets shall be extended to the boundary lines of the land to be subdivided, unless prevented by topography or other physical conditions, or unless, in the opinion of the commission upon recommendation of the city engineer, such extension is not necessary for the coordination of the subdivision with the existing layout or the most advantageous future development of adjacent tracts. Where reservation for future street is made, slope rights along the sides and end of the reserved area shall be preserved in the name of the city. 
In the case of stub-end streets extending to the boundary of the property, a one-foot strip at the end of the stub-end street the width of the street right-of-way shall be deeded to the city pending the extension of the street into adjacent property. Where required, a temporary turnaround or a temporary connection to another street shall be provided by the subdivider. 
Proposed streets shall intersect one another as nearly at right angles as topography and other limiting factors on good design permit. Streets shall be designed in a manner which will discourage the use of local streets for through traffic. Four-way intersections involving local streets shall be avoided whenever possible. 
(Prior code § 21-215)  
16.32.060 - Design adjacent to arterial, major and secondary roads. 
Subdivision design shall be in general accord with the concepts of the general plan, and as determined by the commission. 
Street design should have the purpose of making adjacent lots, if for residential use, desirable for such use by cushioning the effect of heavy traffic and of minimizing the interference with traffic on such streets. 
The number of intersecting streets along arterial, major and secondary streets should be held to a minimum. Wherever practicable, such intersections should be spaced not less than one thousand (1,000) feet on center. 
Residential lots adjacent to these roads normally will be required to be served by a residential street paralleling the road or by a series of cul-de-sac or loop streets extending from a parallel street. Where such double frontage lots are created, improvements on such lots shall be oriented to and front upon the local street. A decorative wall of concrete block or of a comparable material approved by the planning commission, with a minimum height of six feet, shall be required at the property line or top of slope adjacent to the arterial, major or secondary road. Landscaping and permanent irrigation may be required. 
When the rear of any lot borders any arterial or major road, the subdivider shall be required to execute a certificate on the title sheet, deemed sufficient by the city attorney, prohibiting the right of ingress and egress from the major or arterial road to the lot. The council may require similar dedication in other instances where deemed necessary for health, safety and welfare. 
(Prior code § 21-216)  
16.32.070 - Grade, curves and sight distances. 
Grades, curves and sight distances shall be subject to approval by the city engineer, to insure proper drainage and/or safety for vehicles and pedestrians. 
Grades of streets shall be not less than two-tenths percent, except, on local streets a minimum grade of fifteen-hundredths percent may be used if approved by the city engineer, nor more than seven percent on arterial or major roads, ten (10) percent on secondary roads, twelve (12) percent on residential collector streets, fifteen (15) percent on residential streets. Maximum grade for hillside local streets shall not exceed twenty (20) percent. Any grade segment in excess of twelve (12) percent may not exceed three hundred (300) feet in length. For all grades of twelve (12) percent or more, the installation of a Portland cement concrete road surface is required. 
At street intersections, property lines at each block shall be rounded by an arc, the radius of which shall not be less than ten (10) feet and which shall be concentric with the curb return wherever possible. 
The radii of curvature shall not be less than that specified in the following table. Determination of which topography classification to be used shall be subject to approval by the city engineer. 
Street Classification 	Minimum Radius Moderate Topography (In Feet) 	Minimum Radius Rough Topography (In Feet) 
Arterial 	1,200 	
Major 	1,000 	750 
Secondary 	600 	300 
Residential 	230 	100 
 
(Prior code § 21-217)  
16.32.080 - Curbs, sidewalks, and pedestrian ways. 
Vertical concrete curbs and gutters and sidewalks shall be required in all subdivisions except as noted. 
A.  The requirements for sidewalks may be omitted in whole or in part by the commission on all streets less than secondary highways; provided, that the findings are made that such sidewalks are not necessary because of either of the following: 
1.  The traffic count on a particular street is significantly reduced from the established standard for local streets as determined by the city engineer; 
2.  The design or the topography of the subdivision and its relationship to adjoining properties and uses does not warrant the standard sidewalk requirements, based on recommendation of the city engineer; 
3.  When required for access to schools, playgrounds, shopping centers, transportation facilities, other community facilities, or for unusually long blocks, the commission may require pedestrian ways not . less than twenty (20) feet in right-of-way and paved with concrete a minimum of ten (10) feet in width. Such pedestrian ways may be bordered on each side with sprinklered landscaping and a minimum six-foot-high chain link fence. In lieu of the chain link fence, the commission may require the subdivider to use a masonry wall as specified in this chapter, a minimum of six feet high, where they deem it necessary for any one of the following reasons: 
a.  Separation of land use; 
b.  Acoustical buffer; 
c.  Promotion of an architectural theme or compatibility of the area; or 
d.  Where alternate pedestrian facilities are provided. 
4.  Where sidewalks are not required, concrete driveway aprons shall extend to the property line. 
B.  The requirement for curb and gutter may be omitted in whole or in part by the commission on all residential streets less than secondary highways; provided, that the findings are made that such curbs and gutters are not necessary because of the following: 
1.  Topography and geology of the property is such that run-off from the roadways will not endanger public health, safety and/or welfare; and 
2.  Curb and gutter is not required as part of an area storm drainage system. 
Where curb and gutter is not required, driveway aprons may be constructed of asphalt concrete. 
(Prior code § 21-218)  
16.32.090 - Street names and numbers. 
Street names and numbers shall be assigned by the director.

16.32.110 - Hillside subdivisions and planned unit developments. 
In either a planned unit development or a hillside subdivision or portions thereof which have an average slope in excess of ten (10) percent prior to grading, the commission, in the exercise of its discretion, may modify the requirements of this chapter in a manner that will result in the best possible utilization of the land to be subdivided, giving consideration to the topography and natural cover of the land, the general character of the proposed subdivision, the proposed zoning and the desirability of minimizing grading upon the site. 
(Prior code § 21-221)  
16.32.120 - Atlas maps. 
The subdivider shall provide the city with accurate maps of the subdivision at scales of one inch equals two hundred (200) feet and one inch equals four hundred (400) feet for use by the city in updating its atlas maps.

200' scale 	Streets, name and width 
	Lots, number and dimensions 
	Easements, type and dimension 
400' scale 	Outline of streets and lots, no dimensions 
 
(Prior code § 21-222)  
16.32.130 - Utility easements. 
Easements for water, drainage or sewer purposes shall be provided as necessary, with a minimum width of ten (10) feet. Easements for large structures or unusually deep structures shall be of such greater width as may be specified by the city engineer. Any reduction in width shall require approval of both the city engineer and the utility involved. 
(Prior code § 21-223)  
16.32.140 - Lot standards. 
The size, shape and orientation of lots, each of which shall contain a practical building site, shall be appropriate to the location of the proposed subdivision and to the type of development contemplated. The following principles and standards shall be observed: 
A.  The side lines of all lots, so far as possible, should be at approximately right angles to the street on which the lot faces, or approximately radial to the center of curvature of a cul-de-sac on which the lot faces. 
B.  No lot shall be divided by a city or special district boundary line. 
C.  No remnants of property, with the exception of one-foot control lots, shall be created which do not conform to lot requirements, or are not required for a private or public utility purpose. 
D.  The division of a lot or parcel by a tax code boundary shall not be permitted. 
E.  Lot lines between adjacent lots within a subdivision should be located at the top of any grading slope which may be proposed at such location. 
F.  Unless otherwise altered by the provisions of a planned unit development, the minimum lot depth for a residential development shall be not less than ninety (90) feet with the following exception: Lots adjacent to freeways, major streets or collector roads shall utilize a minimum lot depth of one hundred (100) feet to provide sufficient separation from the road noise and to facilitate the usable lot area. 
G.  In determining the permissible lot size, all public utility transmission line easements shall be excluded. 
H.  The depth of the lot shall not exceed three times the width. 
(Prior code § 21-224)  
16.32.150 - Block design. 
Blocks shall normally have sufficient width for an ultimate layout of two tiers of lots of the size required by the provisions of the zoning ordinance. 
Blocks shall not normally exceed one thousand (1,000) feet in length between street lines, except in hillside development or where subdivisions containing parcels of one-half acre or larger justify or require a variation from this requirement. In any block over nine hundred (900) feet in length a crosswalk or pedestrian way may be required in accordance with Section 16.32.080. 
(Prior code § 21-225)  
16.32.160 - Nonresidential subdivisions. 
The street and lot layout of a nonresidential subdivision shall be appropriate to the land use for which the subdivision is proposed, and shall conform to the proposed land use standards established in the general plan and zoning ordinance. 
In addition to the principles and standards in this chapter which are appropriate to the planning of all subdivisions, the subdivider shall demonstrate to the satisfaction of the commission that the street, parcel and block pattern proposed is specifically adapted to the uses anticipated and takes into account other uses in the vicinity. The following principles and standards shall be observed: 
A.  Proposed industrial parcels shall be suitable in area and dimensions to the types of industrial development anticipated. 
B.  Street rights-of-way and pavement shall be adequate to accommodate the type and volume of traffic anticipated to be generated thereon. 
C.  Special requirements may be imposed by the city with respect to street, curb, gutter and sidewalk design and construction. 
D.  Special requirements may be imposed by the city with respect to the installation of public utilities, including water, sewer and storm drainage. 
E.

F.  Streets carrying nonresidential traffic, especially truck traffic, shall not normally be extended to the boundaries of adjacent existing or potential residential areas, or connected to streets intended for predominantly residential traffic. 
G.  Nonresidential subdivisions shall take into account and specifically designate all private areas proposed for vehicular circulation and parking, for pedestrian circulation, and for buffer strips and other landscape. 
H.  Buffer strips shall consist of landscaped areas which are designed to shield and otherwise soften the effect of the nonresidential subdivision on nearby residential areas. Such buffer strips shall be improved to standards as specified in the zoning ordinance. 
(Prior code § 21-226)  
16.32.170 - New development and redevelopment. 
The following specific procedures and standards shall be applied to proposed changes in product sizes within single-family residential tracts in which a previously approved product was constructed. If a residential product was approved and not built, this section of the code shall not apply. Evaluation of the proposed changes shall be by director's review based upon the standards, criteria and findings for reviewing development plans in accordance with the site plan review process, except in the event that changes in product size of twenty-five (25) percent or greater increase or decrease, based on a weighted average, are proposed. If the change is twenty-five (25) percent or greater, evaluation shall be by the planning commission based upon the standards, criteria and findings for reviewing development plans in accordance with the architectural review process. 
A.  Compatibility. Proposed product changes shall incorporate the following criteria to provide continuity and integrity within the neighborhood: 
1.  All proposed homes shall have compatible architecture, materials, colors, roof lines and frontage widths with built homes in the tract; and 
2.  All proposed walls and fencing shall be compatible with existing fencing. 
B.  Transition Area. If a transition area is required, it shall consist of three to five homes and shall be established side to side and across the street from any built homes.

1.  Proposed homes closest in design and size to the built homes shall be placed in the transition area; 
2.  Two-story homes shall be located side to side or across the street from existing two-story homes; and 
3.  One-story homes shall be located side to side or across the street from existing one-story homes. 
C.  Degree of Change of Product Size. The degree of change shall be determined from the percent difference between the weighted average square footage of the units built (total square footage of all built units divided by the number of units) and the weighted average square footage of the proposed units (total square footage of all proposed units divided by the number of units). 
1.  Product Change of Fifteen (15) Percent or Less. 
a.  Must provide compatibility per subsection (A) of this section; 
b.  Requires no notice to adjacent property owners.

(Ord. No. 1021, § 1, 7-28-10)  
Chapter 16.36 - RESERVATIONS AND DEDICATIONS FOR PUBLIC FACILITIES 
Sections: 
 
16.36.010 - Purpose. 
It is the purpose and intent of the provisions of this chapter to require the reservation or dedication of land directly benefiting the regulated subdivision in order to provide for necessary public facilities including, but not limited to, sites for parks and recreational areas, open space, or other public facilities as deemed necessary. In addition to requirements for reservation and dedication of lands, provision is made in this, chapter for the payment of fees in lieu thereof for the acquisition of lands outside of the regulated subdivision, which lands will provide equivalent sites for the purposes set forth in this chapter to benefit the regulated subdivision. In each case it is the intent that the regulated subdivision will receive the direct benefit upon which the exaction was postulated. 
(Prior code § 21-261)  
16.36.020 - Neighborhood facilities. 
The subdivider may be required to reserve sites, appropriate in area and location, for necessary and desirable neighborhood facilities, such as parks and playgrounds. Such sites shall be located in accordance with the principles and standards contained in this chapter or expressed in the general plan. School sites may be dedicated in accordance with the provisions of Section 66478 of the map act. Recreation sites shall be dedicated in accordance with the provisions of Section 64477 of the map act and the provisions of this code, or, in the alternative, a fee shall be paid as required in this chapter. 
(Prior code § 21-262)  
16.36.030 - Determination of need. 
The neighborhood facilities needed shall be determined on the basis of the estimated number of families in the area to be served by the facilities. 
(Prior code § 21-263)  
16.36.040 - Service area. 
The definition of service areas determining the need for neighborhood facilities at the district or community level shall be based on the general plan. The planning neighborhood will normally provide the basis for estimating the number of families to be served by facilities at the local level. A planning neighborhood shall, insofar as possible, exhibit the following characteristics: 
A.  It is bounded, rather than bisected, by major thoroughfares or other substantial land use or natural barriers to pedestrian traffic. 
B.  It is usually not over a mile in extent in any direction. 
C.  It contains a minimum of five hundred (500) families. 
(Prior code § 21-264)  
16.36.050 - Principles and standards. 
The following principles and standards are intended to serve as a general guide in determining the neighborhood facilities for which sites normally will be required: 
A.  Wherever possible, playground and neighborhood recreation areas shall be developed in conjunction with elementary school sites. 
B.  Where ravines, including natural waterways, are included within the boundaries of a subdivision, such ravines may, at the discretion of the city, be reserved for public use, including recreation and the disposal of storm waters. These purposes may be accomplished through dedication and/or storm drainage and scenic easements. 
(Prior code § 21-265)  
16.36.060 - Dedication of land and/or payment of fees for park and recreation purposes pursuant to the Quimby Act. 
A.  This section is adopted pursuant to Section 66477 of the Government Code which provides for the dedication of land or the payment of fees in lieu thereof for park and recreational facilities as a condition of approval of a tentative map or parcel map. 
B.  Whenever land that is proposed to be divided for residential use lies within the boundaries of the city, a fee and/or the dedication of land shall be required as a condition of approval of the division of land. 
C.  It is found and determined by the city council that the public interest, convenience, health, welfare and safety requires that three acres of land for each one thousand (1,000) persons residing within a subdivision shall be devoted to neighborhood and community park and recreational facilities. However, if the amount of actual acreage of neighborhood and community park area existing within the city, as shown on the city's records, plans, recreational element, maps, or reports as of the date of the most recent available federal census, per one thousand (1,000) members of the total population of the city, as shown in the most recent available federal census, exceeds that limit, then the city council determines that the public interest, convenience, health, welfare and safety requires that a higher standard, not to exceed five acres of land per one thousand (1,000) persons residing within the city, shall be devoted to neighborhood and community park purposes. 
D.  Definitions. 
"Dwelling unit" means a building or mobilehome designed for residential occupancy. For the purposes of this section, the number of dwelling units created by a land division shall be as follows: One dwelling unit per lot created in a single-family residential zone, one dwelling per unit approved in a multifamily residential zone; and where the number of units to be built in a multifamily residential zone is unknown, the maximum number of dwelling units allowed under that zone. For a condominium project, the number of dwelling units created shall be the number of condominium units approved. 
"Park" means a parcel or parcels of land, exclusive of natural open space, which is open and available for use by the general public and which serves the recreational needs of the public. 
"Parks and recreation plan" means a general plan and/or other plan for park and recreational facilities adopted by the city which describes current and planned facilities and services. 
E.  Exemptions. This section shall not apply to the following land divisions: 
1.  Commercial or industrial; 
2.  Condominium projects or stock cooperatives which consist of the subdivision of airspace in an existing apartment building which is more than five years old and no new dwelling units area added; and 
3.  Subdivisions containing less than five parcels and not used for residential purposes; provided, however, that a condition of approval shall be placed on those maps that if a building permit is requested for the construction of a residential structure or structures on one or more of the parcels within four years, the fee may be required to be paid by the owner of each parcel as a condition to issuance of such permit. F. Adoption and Amendment of a Parks and Recreation Plan. 
1.  Prior to requiring a subdivider to dedicate land or pay a fee, or a combination of both, the city must adopt a parks and recreation plan which shall be used to plan and direct park and recreation services within the city. 
2.  The city may amend an approved parks and recreation plan at any time to reflect the needs of the city or when there are pertinent changes in the city's boundaries. 
3.  A parks and recreation plan shall contain a statement of goals, policies, programs, standards and proposed location and development or rehabilitation of recreation facilities and services such as natural reservations, parks, parkways, playgrounds, recreational community gardens, and other recreational areas. 
G.  Land Dedication and Fee Requirements. 
1.  Whenever a tentative map or a parcel map which is subject to the provisions of this section is submitted to the community development department of the city, the city director of community development shall determine whether the city will require the dedication of land or payment of fees in lieu thereof for park and recreational purposes. If dedication of land is required, the city director of community development also shall determine its location, after consultation with the subdivider. Thereafter, such location shall be shown on the tentative map or parcel map as submitted. The subdivider shall have the right to appeal any such determination to the planning commission and thereafter to the city council, upon filing a written appeal with the city director of community development within fifteen (15) days after written notice of such determination is received by the subdivider. 
2.  The conditions of approval of a tentative map or a parcel map subject to the provisions of this section shall require the dedication of land, the payment of fees in lieu thereof, or a combination of both for park and recreational purposes to serve the future inhabitants of the subdivision. If the land is to be dedicated, the proposed dedication shall be shown on the approved tentative map or parcel map. If fees are to be paid, the condition of approval shall require that the fees be paid to the city. 
3.  The amount and location of land to be dedicated and/or the fees to be paid shall bear a reasonable relationship to the use of the park and recreational facilities by the future inhabitants of the subdivision. 
4.  All land dedicated, fees paid, or a combination of both, must be used only for the purpose of developing new or rehabilitating existing neighborhood or community park and recreational facilities to serve the subdivision. 
5.  The amount and location of property to be dedicated and the amount of any fees to be paid shall be as approved by the city in accordance with the provisions of this section. 
6.  Whenever subsequent development occurs on property for which fees have been paid or land dedicated, no additional fees or dedications shall be required except as to any additional lots or dwelling units which were not subject to a prior fee or dedication requirement. 
7.  All dedications of land shall be in accordance with the Subdivision Map Act. Land shall be conveyed in fee simple to the city free and clear of all encumbrances except those which will not interfere with the use of the property for its intended purposes and which the city agrees to accept. All deeds shall be delivered to the city before the approval of the final map or parcel map. If the final map or parcel map is disapproved, or if it is withdrawn by the subdivider, the deeds shall be returned to the subdivider. If the final map or parcel map is approved, the deeds shall be recorded by the city at the time the final map or parcel map is recorded. No deed for dedication of land shall be accepted unless it is accompanied by a policy of title insurance, secured by the subdivider, in an amount equal to the value of the land dedicated. 
8.  Whenever land has been conveyed or fees paid to the city and a final map is never recorded or, if recorded, is reverted to acreage, the city shall, at its option, either reconvey all land dedicated to it, repay all fees paid without interest, allow the developer a credit for any land dedicated or fees paid to be applied only to a new subdivision on the same property, or make other arrangements with the subdivider. 
9.  Land which has been dedicated and accepted may be sold by the city if the subdivider has not begun substantial construction on the subdivision and the city council determines that another site would be more suitable for local park or recreational facilities. The proceeds from the sale of the land must be used for the purchase of the more suitable site. 
10.  Where a proposed subdivision lies within an area not then within the city's element of the general plan but intended to be annexed into the city by the developer, the developer shall dedicate land, pay a fee in lieu thereof, or both, in accordance with the provisions of this section and the general plan shall be amended after the approval of the tentative map or parcel map to include said development and any previously unincluded park for which development there was a dedication of land and/or a payment of fees. 
11.  Whenever fees are to be paid, the fees shall be paid at such time as is agreed upon by the subdivider and the city through the conditions of approval. Payment may be required prior to recordation of the final map or parcel map if the fees are to reimburse the city for expenditures previously made, or if the city determines that the fees will be collected for park and recreation facilities for which an account has been established and funds appropriated and for which the city has adopted a proposed construction schedule or plan. Payment may be deferred to the date of the issuance of building permits, or the date of final inspection or the date the certificate of occupancy is issued, whichever occurs last. If the payment of fees is deferred, the city may determine whether the fees shall be paid on a pro rata basis for each dwelling unit when it received its final inspection or certificate of occupancy, on a pro rata basis when certain percentages of the dwelling units have received their final inspections or certificates of occupancy, or on a lump-sum basis when the last dwelling in the development receives its final inspection or certificate of occupancy. 
12.  Whenever fees are paid pursuant to this section, the city shall deposit them into a separate subdivision park trust fund. 
13.  All fees paid must be used only for the purpose of developing new or rehabilitating existing neighborhood or community park and recreational facilities to serve the subdivision. The development of new park and recreational facilities includes, but is not limited to, the acquisition of land for neighborhood or community parks for recreational purposes. 
14.  Fees paid pursuant to this section shall be expended for use only within the boundaries of the city and as specified in this chapter and the city shall maintain appropriate records to reflect such expenditures. 
15.  All fees collected pursuant to this section shall be committed by the city for a specific project to serve residents of the subdivision in a budgetary year either within five years of receipt of the fees or five years after the issuance of building permits on one-half of the lots created by the subdivision whichever occurs later. If the fees are not so committed, the fees received shall be distributed to the then record owners of the subdivision in the same proportion that the size of their lot bears to the total area of all lots in the subdivision. 
16.  A subdivider of any tentative map or parcel map which was approved prior to the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter may apply to be reassessed pursuant to the provisions of this section, provided the fees have not yet been paid and, in such event, all other provisions of this section shall apply. Upon such application, the community development department shall determine the amount of fees required, and the matter need not be set for hearing before the city council or the planning commission unless a dedication of land or a credit as provided in subsection (H)(6) of this section is requested by the subdivider or recommended by the community development department. 
H.  Land Dedication and Fee Determinations. 
1.  Whether the conditions of approval for a land division shall require the dedication of land, the payment of fees, or both, shall be based on the following: 
a.  The natural features of the area; topography; geology; available access; the location; size and shape of the subdivision; the land available for dedication; the feasibility of dedication; the location of existing and proposed park sites and trailways; suitability for patrol, supervision and maintenance; and the compatibility of dedication with the city's general plan and other plans pertaining to parks and recreation adopted by the city. 
b.  For subdivisions containing fifty (50) parcels or less, only the payment of fees may be required, provided, however, that when a condominium project, stock cooperative or community apartment project, as those terms are defined in Section 1351 of the Civil Code, exceeds fifty (50) dwelling units, the dedication of land may be required even though the number of parcels may be less than fifty (50). Nothing in this section shall prevent the city from accepting the voluntary dedication of land by a subdivider for a subdivision containing less than fifty (50) parcels if the dedication meets the other requirements of this section. 
c.  Whenever the actual amount of land to be dedicated is less than the amount of land required to be dedicated, the subdivider shall pay fees for the value of any additional land that otherwise would have been required to be dedicated. 
2.  Unless a different number is set forth in the parks and recreation plan, the average number of persons per unit (density) for calculating the amount of land to be dedicated or the amount of fee to be paid, or a combination of both, shall be 4.72 according to the U. S. Census Bureau, Census 2000. 
3.  The amount of land to be dedicated or fees paid shall be based on the residential density of the subdivision and shall be determined by multiplying the number of dwelling units of the subdivision by the average number of persons per unit (as determined pursuant to subsection (H)(2) of this section) by a coefficient equaling the number of acres of park land required per person (ranging from .003 to .005). 
4.  Whenever land will be dedicated, the following provisions shall apply: 
a.  Whenever land is dedicated, the subdivider shall, without credit, provide the following for the benefit of the land dedicated: 
i.  Full street improvements and utility connections including, but not limited to, curbs, gutters, relocation of existing public utility facilities, street paving, traffic control devices, street trees, and sidewalks to the dedicated land; 
ii.  Fencing along the property lines of the subdivision which are contiguous to the park; 
iii.  Improve the drainage through the park site; 
iv.  Provide minimal physical improvements, not including recreational facilities, building, or equipment, which the city determines are necessary for acceptance of the land for park and recreational purposes; 
v.  Provide access from the park and recreational facilities to an existing or proposed public street, unless the city determines that such access is unnecessary for maintenance of the park area or use of the park by the residents of the area; 
vi.  Water, sewer, grading and drainage improvements in addition to those grading, drainage, irrigation and planting improvements required under other city ordinances. All land to be dedicated and improvements to be made should be approved by the city prior to the approval or disapproval of a subdivision; 
vii.  All grading plans for land to be dedicated shall be reviewed and approved by the city for conformance with the city's general plan and any other parks and recreation plans and the needs of the city; and 
viii.  No grading, drainage, irrigation, planting, street or utility improvements required under this section shall be eligible for a credit against the land to be dedicated or fees paid under the provisions of this section. 
5.  Whenever a fee is to be paid in lieu of the dedication of land, the following provisions shall apply: 
a.  The amount of the fee shall be determined by multiplying the number of acres of land required to be dedicated pursuant to subsection (H)(3) of this section by the per acre fair market value of the land within the subdivision which would otherwise be dedicated. 
b.  The per acre fair market value of the land within the subdivision which would otherwise be required to be dedicated shall be based on the zoning of the property contemplated under the development approval and on the value of the land within the subdivision as if it were improved only with those improvements specified in subsection (H)(4)(a) of this section. The value of any structures other than those improvements specified in subsection (H)(4)(a) of this section shall not be considered when determining fair market value. The fair market value shall be determined by the city council based on annual appraisals of the average values of property within the city zoned for single-family and multiple-family residential uses, with an approved subdivision or parcel map and improved with those improvements described in subsection (H)(4)(a) of this section. 
6.  The subdivider may receive a credit against the payment of fees or the dedication of land as follows: 
a.  Common interest developments, as defined in Section 1351 of the Civil Code, shall be eligible to receive a credit, as determined by the city council, against the amount of land required to be dedicated or the amount of the fee imposed pursuant to this section, for the value of private open space within the development which is usable for active recreational uses. 
b.  A credit may be given against the requirement for the payment of fees or the dedication of land required by this section for the reasonable value of park and recreation improvements, including any equipment, provided by the subdivider to the dedicated land. The amount of the credit shall be determined prior to the approval or conditional approval of the tentative map or parcel map. The granting of a credit shall be made by the city council and shall be based on an approved set of improvement plans. However, the city reserves the right to require in-lieu fees if it finds the improvements unacceptable. 
c.  A credit may be given where private areas for park and recreational purposes are provided in a subdivision and such areas are for active recreational uses, to be privately owned and maintained in common by the future owner(s) of the development. Such areas may be credited against up to fifty (50) percent of the requirement of land dedication or fees at the discretion of the city council; provided, that the city council determines that it is in the public interest to grant such credits and that all of the following standards either have been or will be met prior to approval of the final map or development permit: 
1.  That yards, court areas, setbacks, and other open space areas, as may be required to be maintained by this code, the building code and other regulations, shall not be included in the computation of such private areas; 
2.  Evidence is provided that the private ownership and maintenance of the area will be adequately provided for by recorded written agreement, covenants or restrictions; 
3.  That the use of the private area is restricted for park and recreational purposes by an open space easement or other instrument; 
4.  That the proposed private area is reasonably adaptable for use of park or recreational purposes, taking into consideration such factors as size, shape, topography, geology, access and location; 
5.  "Active recreational uses" mean, for the purposes of this section, recreation facilities occurring on usable level land (five percent maximum slope) in a planned development which are designed to provide individual or group activities of an active nature including, but not limited to, open lawn, sports fields, court games, swimming pools, children's play areas, picnic areas, golf courses, and recreational community gardening. Active recreational uses do not include natural open space, nature study areas, open space for buffer areas, steep slopes, or scenic overlooks. Credits for areas within watercourses, drainage areas, or water bodies may be granted only if: 
a.  Such areas are suitable for active recreational use, 
b.  Such areas will actually be used for active recreation, and 
c.  The proposed type of active recreational use to be located within such areas is allowed or otherwise permitted by the city's general plan or other plan adopted by the city for parks and recreational facilities; 
6.  Notwithstanding the fifty (50) percent limitation as set forth above, a private open space credit in excess of fifty (50) percent of the requirement of land dedication or fees payment may be granted by the city council provided that the proposed recreational use is cited in the city's general plan or other plan adopted by the city for parks and recreational facilities. 
I.  Annual Reports. 
1.  The city shall maintain a separate account for all land dedications and fee payments received pursuant to this section and shall prepare an annual report for each account. The annual reports shall be prepared no later than ninety (90) days after the fiscal year of the city ends. The reports shall include each of the following: 
a.  The land dedications and fee payments received, the balance of the account, and the facilities purchased, leased or constructed during the fiscal year; 
b.  Documentation in support of and justification for the land dedications, fee payments, fee expenditures and any change in the fee account balance; 
c.  Information describing any changes in boundaries, service area, plan goals, policies, standards, as well as, any changes in park and recreation facility inventory; and 
d.  A schedule of how, when and where the city intends to use the land dedicated or fees paid, or both, to develop park or recreational facilities to serve the residents of the subdivisions and the anticipated starting dates for the development of the park and recreation facilities. The starting dates shall be reasonable with respect to the need for such parks and facilities, weather constraints, the need to minimize the disruption of the neighborhood, the amount of land and fees received, and the anticipated availability of funds for the operation and maintenance of the parks and facilities which are constructed.

(Prior code § 061.03)  
17.40.040 - Procedures subsequent to the designation of an assessment improvement area. 
A.  Selection of Consultant. The city council shall direct the planning commission in cooperation with the petitioners, to select and recommend to the city council the appointment of a specific architect or other professional designer to serve as consultant for the improvement of the area, and determine the probable cost of the consultant's services. 
The planning commission, after consultation with the city engineer, shall recommend what portion of this cost shall be paid by a special assessment district, and what portion should be paid by the city. The city council shall direct the city engineer to prepare a tentative assessment district to defray the cost of the consultant's services to be paid by the assessment district. 
B.  Preparation by Assessment Roll. Upon appointment of a consultant and approval of his or her fee by the city council, the city engineer shall be directed by the council to prepare a special assessment roll, which shall be transmitted to the city council. Upon confirmation, the council shall direct the roll to the city treasurer, who shall thereupon proceed to collect this assessment. If this assessment is not paid within sixty (60) days after receipt of the special assessment roll, then the city treasurer shall report this fact to the city council who may then order the assessment improvement area ordinance cancelled and the assessment refunded. 
C.  Preparation of Plans. When all assessments have been collected, the city council shall notify the appointed consultant to proceed with the preparation of the improvement plan. The plan shall be submitted to the planning commission which shall, in conjunction with the petitioners, investigate the practicality and feasibility of the proposed improvement and transmit their recommendation to the council regarding the acceptability of the project and the cost estimate. If the city council approves the plans and the cost estimate, such documents shall be forwarded to the city engineer with the request that the city engineer prepare a benefited district and a tentative special assessment roll to pay for the proposed improvement. The city engineer shall then submit his or her report to the city council which may authorize its transmittal to the planning commission for consideration. 
D.  Commission and Petitioner Review of Assessment Roll. The planning commission shall meet with the petitioners to review the tentative special assessment roll and the entire improvement program. If fifty-one (51) percent of the petitioners within the proposed assessment district concur with the plans and wish to proceed with the improvements, a petition containing their signature and indicating their concurrence shall be filed with the city council. Such fifty-one (51) percent majority of property owners shall represent at least fifty-one (51) percent of the proposed assessment. 
E.  Institution of Assessment Proceedings. Upon receipt of the petition representing the owners of at least fifty-one (51) percent of the proposed assessment, the city council shall order the city engineer to institute proceedings as provided in the Improvement Act of 1911, State of California Street and Highways Code.

Chapter 17.42 - T TEMPORARY CLASSIFICATION ZONE 
 
17.42.010 - Intent and purpose. 
To ensure that the property to be rezoned will conform to all specified standards and conditions deemed necessary to protect the best interests of the surrounding property or neighborhood and secure an appropriate development in harmony with the objectives of the general plan. 
(Prior code § 062.01)  
17.42.020 - Definition of tentative zone change. 
A temporary classification which is combined for a specified period of time with another zone and which, according to the terms of the ordinance, either terminates and returns the property to its underlying zone classification, or becomes final, in which case the (T) classification symbol and the underlying zone classification are removed and the proposed or tentative zone classification becomes finally effective. 
(Prior code § 062.02)  
17.42.030 - Imposition of (T) tentative zone change classification. 
When the planning commission or city council finds that an application for a zone change is consistent with the objectives of this chapter, provided certain dedications of land, waivers of access, or installations of improvements in a public right-of-way or on private property are completed or security for improvements is offered and accepted within a specified time period, it shall recommend or adopt the zone change subject to compliance with specified conditions. In such cases, the ordinance changing the zone of the property concerned shall, instead of immediately and finally rezoning the property, place it in the (T) tentative zone change classification. Such ordinance shall specify the change in zone, the conditions to be met, and the time allowed for satisfying the conditions. 
(Prior code § 062.03)  
17.42.040 - Zoning map designations. 
The (T) tentative zone change classification shall be shown on the zoning map by the symbol "T", in parenthesis, immediately followed by the proposed zoning designation, a comma, and the underlying zoning designation, for example, (T) RM 400, R9S 6,000. When the rezoning proceedings are completed in accordance with this article, the (T) symbol and the underlying zone designation shall be removed leaving only the proposed zoning designation on the property, for example, RM 400. When the rezoning proceedings terminate in accordance with this chapter, the (T) symbol and the proposed zone designation shall be removed leaving only the original zoning designation on the property, for example, RS 6,000. 
(Prior code § 062.04)  
17.42.050 - Maximum time periods. 
Where either a final map or a parcel map is required by the rezoning, the (T) tentative zone change classification may remain on the property for up to two and one-half years after the effective date of the ordinance creating said temporary classification. The planning commission may extend such periods of time for one additional period not to exceed one year, provided a written application requesting such extension is filed not less than thirty (30) days prior to the expiration of the originally specified period. Applications for time extensions shall set forth all applicable facts and evidence supporting such request. 
(Prior code § 062.05)  
17.42.060 - Completion or termination. 
If all conditions are met within the specified time period, or an authorized extension thereof, the rezoning proceedings shall be deemed to be complete, the (T) tentative zone classification shall be removed in accordance with Section 17.42.040 (Zoning map designation), and the new zone designation shall finally become effective. If all conditions are not met within the specified time period, or an authorized extension thereof, the rezoning proceedings shall terminate, the (T) tentative zone change classification shall become null and void and shall be removed in accordance with Section 17.42.040 (Zoning map designations), and the property shall be restricted to its previously designated zone classification. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this chapter to the contrary, no public hearing need be held nor further notice be given as a requisite to the completion or termination of the rezoning proceedings as provided in this chapter. 
(Prior code § 062.06)  
17.42.070 - City engineer's report. 
Prior to the finalization of the zone change proceedings and the removal of the (T) tentative zone change classification, the planning department shall have received a report from the city engineer, or other appropriate city agency, verifying that all required dedications of land or installations of improvements on public or private property have been completed or security for such improvements has been offered and accepted, or that any other applicable requirement has been satisfactorily met in compliance with the specified conditions of the (T) tentative zone change ordinance. 
(Prior code § 062.07)  
17.42.080 - Interim use of property. 
While property remains in the (T) tentative zone change classification, it may continue to be used only for the purposes permitted in the zone applicable to the property prior to the establishment of, such (T) classification; and no permits shall be issued, no structures shall be erected or constructed, and no land shall be used for any other purpose; provided, however, that grading or other improvements required as conditions of the zone change may be accomplished. In addition, no new structures or uses shall be established for the duration of the (T) temporary classification which would become nonconforming upon the finalization of the zone change and no such existing structure or use shall be enlarged or increased in intensity of use during such period. Such limitation on the use of the property shall continue until the building department has received notification from the planning department of the removal of the (T) tentative zone change classification and the finalization or termination of the zone change proceedings.

Chapter 17.54 - OFF-STREET PARKING AND LOADING 
 
17.54.010 - Parking requirements. 
A.  Purpose and Intent. The purpose of this section is to provide sufficient off-street parking and loading spaces for all land uses and to assure the provision and maintenance of safe, adequate and well-designed off-street parking facilities. It is the intent of this section that the number of parking spaces shall be in proportion to the need created by the particular type of use. The standards for parking facilities are intended to reduce street congestion and traffic hazards, promote vehicular and pedestrian safety and efficient land use. Off-street parking and loading areas shall he established in a manner which will promote compatibility between parking facilities and surrounding neighborhoods; protect property values and enhance the environment through good design by providing such amenities as landscaping, walls, fencing and setbacks; improve the appearance of parking lots, yards, uncovered sales areas and buildings; control heat, wind and air pollutants; minimize nuisances; and promote aesthetic values and the general well-being of the residents of the city. Off-street vehicle parking shall be provided in accordance with this section when the building or structure is constructed or the use is established. Additional off-street parking shall be provided in accordance with this section if an existing building is altered or dwelling units, apartments or guest rooms are added, or a use is intensified by the addition of floor space or seating capacity, or there is a change of use, at the time of such alteration, addition, intensification or change of use. 
B.  General Provisions. 
1.  All required parking and loading spaces and driveways shall be maintained in good condition and available for its intended use as long as the use for which it was required continues to operate or exist. Except in residential districts, inside a garage, no storage shall encroach into any required parking or loading space or driveway and no vehicles shall be continuously parked in these areas, and all vehicles so parked shall be operable and have current registration. All motor vehicles incapable of movement under their own power and/or not licensed to operate on California highways, other than in the cases of emergency, shall be deemed detrimental to the public welfare and shall be stored in either an entirely enclosed building or in the rear yard of commercial and industrial zoned property that is entirely enclosed by a view-obscuring fence or wall. After due notice of noncompliance, said vehicles shall be required to be removed from the premises. 
2.  Where automobile parking spaces are provided and maintained on a lot in connection with a structure, at the time this section became effective, are insufficient to meet the requirements for the use with which they are associated, or where no such parking has been provided, said structure may be altered or enlarged, or such use may be extended or intensified only if additional automobile parking spaces are provided to meet the standards for said use in conformity with the requirements set forth in this section for the enlargements, extension or addition proposed. 
3.  Where calculations of the number of spaces required results in a fractional number, the next higher whole number shall be used. 
4.  In cases of mixed use in a building or on a lot, the total requirements for off-street parking shall be the sum of the requirements for the various uses computed separately. 
5.  When a garage is specifically required, or provided to meet required parking, entry doors shall be maintained in an operable condition at all times and no structural alteration or permanent obstruction shall be permitted within the required parking area that would reduce the number of required parking spaces. Use of garages shall be limited to vehicular and general storage purposes only and shall not conflict with any applicable building, housing or fire codes.

17.70.120 - Minor modifications. 
A.  Notwithstanding any provision of this Chapter 17.70 or Chapter 17.76 to the contrary, when the strict application of the zoning code results in practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships with respect to a particular piece of property which is not enjoying the privileges commonly enjoyed by other properties in the same vicinity and zone, where there are unique circumstances applicable to the site that merit some relief from zoning development standards and the deviation does not create an adverse impact on the surrounding neighborhood, and when it is in the public interest, the planning director may consider and render decisions on minor modifications in the provisions of this title, limited to the items listed below. No publishing, posting or mailing of notice is required, nor is a public hearing required. 
1.  Reduction of minimum lot area and/or lot dimensions, by not more than twelve (12) percent for up to twenty (20) percent of the lots in a subdivision. However, such modifications are not permitted for lot area in the R-O 6000 zone, and the dwelling unit on such a lot shall meet all setback and coverage requirements. 
2.  Reduction in front, side or rear yard setback by not greater than ten percent of code-required minimum. 
3.  Increase in fence height not greater than ten percent above code-required maximum. 
4.  Reduction in required off-street parking, by not greater than five percent of code-required minimum. 
5.  Increase in building height not greater than five percent above code-required maximum. 
6.  Modification of allowable sign area not greater than ten percent above Code-required maximum. 
7.  Modification of allowable paving and hardscape in the front yard of residential zones not greater than ten percent above code-required maximum. 
8.  Modification of allowable size of accessory structure not greater than ten percent above code-required maximum, and minimum distance between accessory structures and other buildings not greater than ten percent of code-required minimum, in the residential zones. 
The director shall, not later than sixty (60) days from receipt of a complete application, render a decision and prepare written findings as to whether the minor modification meets the criteria of this section and notify the applicant by first class mail. The director may deny, approve or approve the minor modification with conditions to protect the surrounding area.

A.  Intent and Purpose. To provide flexibility in the placement and interrelationship of structures and uses subject to architectural review; to provide for the implementation of sound site plan design concepts while maintaining the overall intensity of land use and density of population; to review the site plan of those uses which are not intrinsically objectionable to the predominant use category of the district, but which have inherent characteristics which, if not properly handled, have potentials for becoming detrimental to the health, safety, or general welfare of the public, or to neighboring land uses; to determine whether or not a proposed development will properly comply with the architectural guidelines of the city and the provisions and development standards required by this chapter or as prescribed by the planning director, or other authorized agent; to improve the quality of development and to provide a mechanism whereby the city can insure well-designed development. 
B.  Submission of Site Plan. Any use, development of land, structure, building or modification of standards requiring the submission of a site plan for architectural review shall not be established, modified or otherwise altered. No certificate of occupancy shall be issued until all of the requirements of this section have been met. Continued conformance with such a plan and such requirements shall be a condition of any certificate of occupancy. 
C.  Required Plans or Documents. 
1.  A site plan for any use, development of land, structure, building or modification of standards that involves architectural review. 
2.  Such other forms or documents as are necessary to determine compliance with the provisions of this chapter or any conditions that the planning director or planning commission may impose in granting an approval of the requested use, development or modification.

Chapter 17.74 - CONDITIONAL USES 
 
17.74.010 - Conditional uses. 
A.  Intent and Purpose. To provide for the proper location of certain uses which, because of unusual effects or characteristics, including large land area, potential intensity or public concern, cannot be automatically permitted in, nor absolutely prohibited from, some or all zone classifications without imposition of specific conditions; to ensure that the location of these uses will be in accordance with the objectives of the general plan and the intent and purpose of the applicable zoning district; to provide sufficient and adequate safeguards and conditions to ensure that the conditional use will be operated and maintained in a manner not detrimental to the public health, safety and welfare, or harmful to neighboring property and improvements. 
B.  DefinitionConditional Use.

A.  This section applies to: 
1.  Establishments that do not currently but propose to sell liquor; 
2.  Establishments that currently sell liquor but which propose to change the type of liquor to be sold by changing the type of retail liquor license within a license classification;

a.  An increase in floor area used for the display of liquor; or 
b.  A ten-percent increase in facing/shelving used for the display of liquor; and 
B.  Prior to approving a conditional use permit for either (i) on-sale liquor sales in conjunction with a bona fide eating establishment located anywhere in the city, or (ii) on-sale or off-sale liquor sales located in the "Pueblo Viejo" area of the city (as identified in the City's General Plan), the planning commission must make the findings set forth in Section 17.74.020. For purposes of this section, "bona fide eating establishment" means an establishment engaged in the following: 
1.  The sale of food and non-alcoholic beverages for consumption on or off the premises; and 
2.  the sale of liquor/alcoholic beverages for consumption on premises only; and 
3.  Where at least twenty (20) percent of the gross floor area of the building is designed, equipped and used exclusively for the storage and preparation of food and non-alcoholic beverages for consumption; and 
4.  Where at least fifty (50) percent of the gross floor area of the building is designed, equipped and used exclusively for seating of patrons for the purpose of serving meals. "Meals" shall mean the usual assortment of foods commonly ordered at various hours of the day for breakfast, lunch or dinner, and not merely appetizers or snacks. "Patrons" shall mean persons who come to a bona fide public eating establishment for the purpose of actually ordering and obtaining a meal therein; and

Where not more than twenty (20) percent of the gross floor area, or one thousand five hundred (1,500) square feet, whichever is less, is dedicated to a bar or the storage, sales and display of liquor/alcoholic beverages and said area is separated by physical barriers from the main seating area for serving meals. 
C.  Prior to approving a conditional permit for any other type of liquor sales use, the planning commission must make the findings set forth in Section 17.74.020, plus the following additional findings: 
1.  With respect to liquor, on-sale establishments: 
a.  The establishment does not fall within seven hundred (700) feet, measured from property line to property line, of a use for religious worship, school (public or private), park, playground, residential or any similar sensitive use; and 
b.  The establishment does not fall within seven hundred (700) feet, measured from property line to property line, of an existing liquor, on-sale use; and 
i.  The planning commission may find that the public benefit outweighs the distance restrictions of subsections (a) and/or (b) above, upon additional findings that: 
(A)  The establishment provides a substantial benefit to the immediate neighborhood not provided by another existing establishment within the restricted distance; and 
(B)  Not greater than five percent of the sales floor area or 1,000 square feet, whichever is less, shall be used for the display or sale of alcoholic beverages; 
c.  That the requested establishment at the proposed location will not adversely affect the economic welfare of the nearby community; and 
d.  That the exterior appearance of the structure of the proposed establishment will not be inconsistent with the exterior appearance of commercial structures already constructed or under construction within the immediate neighborhood as to cause blight, deterioration, or substantially diminish or impair the property values within the neighborhood. 
2.  With respect to liquor, off-sale establishments: 
a.  The establishment does not fall within seven hundred (700) feet, measured from property line to property line, of a use for religious worship, school (public or private), park, playground, residential or any similar sensitive use; and 
b.  The establishment does not fall within seven hundred (700) feet, measured from property line to property line, of an existing liquor, off-sale use; and 
i.  The planning commission may find that the public benefit outweighs the distance restrictions of subsections (a) and/or (b) above, upon additional findings that: 
(A)  The establishment provides a substantial benefit to the immediate neighborhood not provided by another existing establishment within the restricted distance; and 
(B)  Not greater than five percent of the sales floor area or one thousand (1,000) square feet, whichever is less, shall be used for the display or sale of alcoholic beverages; 
c.  That the requested establishment at the proposed location will not adversely affect the economic welfare of the nearby community; and 
d.  That the exterior appearance of the structure of the proposed establishment will not be inconsistent with the exterior appearance of commercial structures already constructed or under construction within the immediate neighborhood so as to cause blight or deterioration, or substantially diminish or impair the property values within the neighborhood. 
D.  Additionally, if the California Department of Alcoholic Beverage Control (ABC) notifies the City that the proposed establishment is either (1) subject to the State law moratorium/limit on the number of liquor licenses that may be issued within the city under California Business and Professions Code Section 23817.7 or, (2) is in an area of "undue concentration" of liquor licenses, as defined in California Business and Professions Code Section 23958.4; the planning commission must additionally find that the public convenience or necessity nonetheless justifies the issuance of the liquor license to the establishment.

2.  That there are special circumstances applicable to the subject property such as size, shape, topography, location or surroundings, that do not apply generally to other property in the same zone and vicinity; 
3.  That such variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right or use generally possessed by other property in the. same zone and vicinity, but which, because of such special circumstances and practical difficulties or unnecessary hardships is denied to the property in question; 
4.  That the granting of such variance will not be materially detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to the property or improvements in the same zone or vicinity in which the property is located, and; 
5.  That the granting of the variance will not adversely effect any element of the general plan. 
C.  Conditions. In granting the permissible variance, the commission may attach such additional conditions and safeguards as are deemed necessary to protect the surrounding area including, but not limited to the following: 
1.  Requirement of yards greater than the minimum required by this chapter. 
2.  Requirement of screening of parking, recreation or storage areas or other portions of the subject property from adjoining premises or from any street by walls, fences, plantings or other devices. 
3.  Modification of the exterior features or appearance of any structure where necessary to preserve property values. 
4.  Limitation of size and extent of facilities, machine capacity, number of employees or occupants, and method or times of operation. 
5.  Regulation of number, design and location of access drives or other traffic features. 
6.  Requirement of off-street parking or other special features beyond the minimum required by this chapter or applicable codes or regulations. 
7.  Utilities.

11.  A time period within which the proposed variance shall be utilized plus any specified period for the life of the variance. 
12.  A bond or deposit of money for completion of street improvements and other facilities or to guarantee the change or removal of any designated use or structure within a specified period of time, to assure faithful performance on the part of the applicant. 
13.  Regulation of fences and/or walls shall pertain to the height thereof, materials used and visibility through and around said fence and walls. 
D.  Time LimitsDetermination. The commission shall make determination within sixty (60) days of the filing date or such longer period up to an additional sixty (60) days as may be mutually agreed upon in writing between the commission and the applicant. 
E.  Effective DateNo Appeal Filed. 
1.  If no appeal is filed, the determination of the commission shall become effective upon the close of the appeal filing period (fifteen (15) days). 
2.  If an appeal is filed, see Section 17.70.070. 
3.  If the commission fails to act on the matter, see Section 17.70.070. 
(Prior code § 080.61)  
17.76.030 - Transfer of jurisdiction. 
A.  Commission Fails to Act. If the commission fails to act within the sixty-day prescribed time period or after any authorized extension period, the applicant may file a request for transfer of jurisdiction. The request shall be filed by mail, or at the public counter of the department within ten (10) days from the expiration of the authorized time period. The commission shall forward the application, with the file and any relevant information to the council for determination of the original application. If the applicant fails to file a request for transfer of jurisdiction, the original application shall be deemed denied and is not subject to appeal. 
B.  ProcedureTransfer of Jurisdiction. When a matter is transferred the council shall be governed by the same procedural and time requirements as apply to an original proceeding. When the council assumes jurisdiction, the commission shall lose jurisdiction in the matter. The director shall make such investigations and furnish such reports as the council may request. However, the matter may be remanded by the council in which case the commission shall regain jurisdiction. If the file is remanded, the time period shall not exceed that allowed to the council on transfer. If after a remand and expiration of the time specified, the commission still fails to act, the original application shall be deemed denied and is not subject to appeal. 
C.  Council Fails to Act. If the council fails to act on a variance application transferred to it, the original application shall be deemed denied and no appeal may be taken. 
D.  Effective DateTransfer of Jurisdiction. 
1.  If the case was determined by the commission on remand and there was no appeal, decision is effective on the expiration of the appeal filing period (fifteen (15) days). 
2.  If the case was determined by the council, its decision is final on the date of mailing of its determination and findings to the applicant. 
(Prior code § 080.62)

A.  Appellants. An appeal may be filed by the applicant, by any person aggrieved, or by any officer, board, department or bureau of the city. 
B.  ProcedureAppeal. 
1.  When an appeal is filed, the commission shall transmit its record of the mater to the council. 
2.  If the original applicant or the appellant wishes to offer into the proceedings any new evidence or testimony, a written summary stating why such evidence or testimony could not have been presented during the original consideration shall be filed. If the council determines that such evidence could not reasonably have been presented earlier and is of such nature as might reasonably have led to a different determination, the matter shall be remanded to the commission. The commission shall reopen the matter and make a determination before expiration of the time period allotted to the council. 
3.  If the planning commission fails to act on remand after appeal, the matter is deemed denied and is not subject to further appeal. 
C.  Time LimitCouncil Action. The council shall act on appeals concerning variances within sixty (60) days or within such extended period of time up to an additional sixty (60) days, as may be mutually agreed upon by the applicant or the appellant and the council. 
D.  Council Failure to Act on Appeal. If the council fails to act on an appeal concerning variances within the time limit specified, the action of the planning commission on the matter shall be final. 
E.  Effective DateAppeal. 
1.  A determination by the council on appeals concerning variances shall become effective on the date of mailing of the council's determination. 
2.  A determination by the commission on remand is not subject to appeal and shall become effective on the date of mailing of the determination. 
(Prior code § 080.63)  
17.76.050 - Post-determination procedures. 
A.  Expiration of Variance. 
1.  A variance shall expire and shall become void one year following the date on which the variance became effective, unless prior to the expiration of one year, a building permit is filed and construction is commenced and diligently pursued toward completion, or a certificate of occupancy is issued. 
2.  A variance that has not been exercised may be renewed for an additional period of one year if an application stating reasons for renewal is made prior to one year after the effective date of the variance. 
B.  Revocation of Variance. A variance that has been exercised may be revoked by the commission if one or more conditions are not complied with. An appeal from the commission's decision to revoke a variance may be taken to the council, subject to provisions of Section 17.76.030. The council's decision is final. 
C.  PermitsBuilding Department. Upon the effective date of any variance authorization and subject to all conditions thereof, the building department may issue permits. 
D.  Variances Granted Prior to Effective Date. 
1.  All use variances granted and exercised prior to the effective date of this chapter, plus subsequent amendments, may be continued provided no new structure is erected, no existing structure is enlarged and no existing use is extended. 
2.  If any use variance granted prior to the effective date of this chapter has never been exercised or if once exercised and the use or development authorized has been discontinued or removed from the premises for a period of at least six months, such variance shall no longer be of any force and effect, and, the respective ordinance granting such variance is repealed. 
E.  Change of Conditions and Minor Extensions. A subsequent change in the conditions of a variance which has been granted by the commission may be authorized by the planning director without a hearing, provided the change does not increase the density, nor decrease the number of parking stalls, nor substantially alter the intensity of operation beyond what was originally approved by the commission. 
F.  ReapplicationVariance. At least one year shall have elapsed since the effective date of disapproval of the application or revocation of variance before filing a new application seeking substantially the same variance for any of the same property.

C.  To coordinate reviews of projects among city staff, city departments, and outside agencies; 
D.  To familiarize project proponents with the regulations and procedures that apply to the project; 
E.  To provide project proponents with an early indication of whether a proposed development will be recommended for approval by staff; 
F.  To avoid significant investment in the design of a project without preliminary directions from city staff; and to identify issues that may arise during review of the projects (e.g., conformance with applicable design guidelines, conformance with goals, policies, and objectives of the general plan, environmental requirements and possible recommended mitigation measures, possible recommended conditions of approval, and requirements for public improvements). 
(Ord. 1004-(2) § 4 (part), 2008)  
17.77.020 - Applicability. 
A.  Pre-application review shall be required for projects subject to one or more of the following approvals: 
1.  Projects involving a specific plan adoption, specific plan amendment, or planned development overlay; 
2.  Projects involving a general plan amendment, or change of zone; 
3.  Projects involving new construction of more than five thousand (5,000) square feet of commercial or institutional building area if not within the boundaries of an adopted specific plan; 
4.  Projects involving four or more dwelling units; 
5.  New construction of more than five hundred (500) square feet of building area within the boundaries of the Pueblo Viejo Master Plan; 
6.  New construction located within the boundaries of an adopted specific plan, if the review is required by the director; 
7.  Projects involving service stations, auto repair facilities, car washes, drive-thru businesses, auto dismantling, salvage yards, and outdoor storage uses;

B.  Optional Review. A project proponent may voluntarily submit a request for a pre-application review for any project involving a discretionary land use entitlement, change of zone request, or a tentative map. 
C.  Director-Required Review. The director reserves the right to require pre-application review for any project involving multiple-agency coordination and discretionary land use entitlements, where the proposed land uses have the potential to cause adverse impacts upon surrounding property owners. The director shall issue findings in writing requiring pre-application review, pursuant to this subsection. 
(Ord. 1004-(2) § 4 (part), 2008)  
17.77.030 - Procedure. 
A.  Procedure. Once the director determines that a request for pre-application review is complete, the director or designee shall process the request in the following manner. 
1.  Submittal Requirements. All requests for pre-application review shall be accompanied by a form to be provided by the community development department, twelve (12) copies of a site plan as specified in Chapter 17.62 of this title, and the required processing fee. Additional graphic materials may be requested by the director as part of the initial review of the pre-application submittal. 
2.  Notice. The director or designee shall send a written notice, with a project description and copy of site plan, to all affected city departments, outside agencies and special districts, informing of the time and place of the scheduled pre-application review. 
3.  Meeting. The pre-application review shall be conducted at a meeting in which the applicant for a project is invited and city departments and outside agencies are in attendance. 
4.  Scheduling. The director shall set the time and place of the pre-application review meeting, to be conducted within three weeks of receipt of a complete application. 
5.  Responsible Staff. The city manager, or designee, shall determine which city departments and outside agencies shall participate in the pre-application meeting. The director shall designate the staff person(s) responsible for scheduling and conducting the pre-application meeting. 
6.  Written Report. A written report from the director outlining the results of the pre-application review shall be provided to the applicant within thirty (30) days of the meeting.

(Ord. 1004-(2) § 4 (part), 2008)  
17.77.040 - Pre-application review meeting. 
A.  Case Manager. The city manager shall appoint a case manager for the project, which shall be the primary liaison responsible for overseeing the project through the city's review and approval process. The case manager may be from the planning staff, economic development staff, public works staff, or redevelopment/housing staff, depending on the major entitlements needed and/or areas of expertise required for processing of the project. 
B.  Coordination. The staff person assigned to conduct the meeting shall provide an overview of procedures, introduce the case manager assigned to the project, engage the applicant and agencies in discussion, and conclude the meeting. At the initiation of the meeting, the applicant shall present a brief overview of the development proposal. All staff and agencies shall be prepared to discuss the proposal in detail and identify any major issues that may arise if the proposal is processed. 
C.  Duration. The meeting shall be limited to one hour in duration. If additional time is required, this can be arranged at an additional cost to the applicant. If, at the end of the session, the status of certain issues remains unresolved, staff shall identify those issues and/or include any additional recommendations or study requests specified in the written report. 
D.  Disclaimer. Neither the pre-application meeting, the written report, nor information or pertinent policies provided by the city departments shall be construed as a city recommendation for approval or disapproval of the application/project. 
(Ord. 1004-(2) § 4 (part), 2008)  
17.77.050 - Contents of written report. 
A.  Report Contents. The written report required under Section 17.77.030(A)(6) shall contain a letter from the director and copies of all staff and agency comments on the development proposal that were received as part of the pre-application review. Although the contents of the written report will depend on the type of proposal, its proposed location, the background information provided by the applicant, and other factors, the report shall generally provide the applicant with the following types of information: 
1.  Any applications which must be filed to process the proposal as well as any timing requirements associated with filing such applications. Applications which may be required include but are not limited to the following: general plan amendments, specific plans, changes of zone, and tentative maps. 
2.  Any special studies which must be filed to process the proposal as well as any timing requirements associated with filing such special studies. Special studies which may be required include but are not limited to the following: fiscal impact, private debt burden, biological, archeological, paleontological, geological, flood, traffic, air quality study and noise studies. 
3.  Any special plans which must be filed to process the proposal. Special plans which may be required include but are not limited to the following: conceptual grading plans, parks improvement plans, construction staging plans, dust control plans, and streetscape elevation renderings. 
4.  Current fees including but not limited to the following: application fees, mitigation fees (e.g., signal mitigation fees or area drainage fees), and special district fees administered by the city (e.g., MSHCP fees, TUMF fees). 
5.  Any major environmental issues associated with the proposal, including the possible need for an EIR subject to the anticipated environmental assessment. 
6.  Any major design considerations associated with the proposal (e.g., grading and drainage design, ingress/egress designs, limitations on density, requirements for public parks). 
7.  The availability of water, sewer, and fire flow rate. 
8.  The concerns remaining for the proposal, if any. 
9.  The changes that staff will require before making an approval recommendation, or a statement that an approval recommendation will not be made given the proposal's present configuration. 
10.  Findings required for the necessary permit or approval. 
(Ord. 1004-(2) § 4 (part), 2008)  
17.77.060 - Validity of agency comments. 
A.  Agency Comments. No issues other than those identified in the written report shall be raised by staff during processing of the development proposal unless there are changed circumstances or new information identified during the processing of entitlement applications. The written report shall be valid for two years from the date thereof, unless a shorter period is specified in the written report. 
B.  Changed Circumstances. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, where the director, department head, or agency representative subsequently determine that conditions have changed or that the existing information does not fully address all significant concerns, staff may require an additional study or studies not specified in the pre-application written report. Similarly, city and special district policies may change during the report's two year life, and policy recommendations, which were valid when the written report was issued, may or may not be valid when the development proposal is filed and processed. In such cases, the development application will be subject to City and special district policies in effect at the time of filing or hearing, whichever is appropriate. State and federal policies and laws unknown or not effective at the time of pre- application review may also affect the subsequent application. 
C.  Amended Recommendations. Notwithstanding the provisions of this section, the written report shall not in any manner whatsoever bind any city hearing body and shall not preclude such hearing body from requiring additional information or studies or from making additional recommendations in the course of the decision making process. 
(Ord. 1004-(2) § 4 (part), 2008)  
17.77.070 - Revisions. 
A.  Revisions. The pre-application written report shall apply to the development proposal described in the request for pre-application and discussed at the pre-application review meeting. Substantial revisions to the proposal after issuance of the written report which do not conform to the agency comments shall invalidate the written report. 
B.  New Project. To process a substantially revised proposal, a new request for pre-application review and new fee will be required of the applicant. For purposes of this section, the director shall determine whether or not revisions made are substantial and constitute a new project. 
(Ord. 1004-(2) § 4 (part), 2008)  
Chapter 17.78 - NONCONFORMING USES AND STRUCTURES 
 
17.78.010 - Nonconforming uses, lots, structures, and characteristics of use. 
A.  Purpose and Intent. Within the zones established by this chapter or amendments that may later be adopted there may exist: 
1.  Lots; 
2.  Structures; 
3.  Uses of land and structures; and 
4.  Characteristics of use, which were lawful before this chapter was passed or amended, but which would be prohibited, regulated, or restricted under the terms of this chapter to permit these nonconformities to continue until they are removed, but not to encourage their survival. It is the further intent of this chapter that nonconformities shall not be enlarged upon, expanded or extended, nor be used as grounds for adding other structures or uses prohibited elsewhere in the same zone. 
Nonconforming uses are declared by this chapter to be incompatible with permitted uses in the zones involved. A nonconforming use of a structure, a nonconforming use of land, or a nonconforming use of a structure and land in combination, shall not be extended or enlarged after passage of the Ordinance by attachment on a building or premises of additional signs intended to be seen from off the premises, or by the addition of other uses, of a nature which would be prohibited generally in the district involved. 
B.  Buildings Under Construction. To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction, or designated use of any building on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter and upon which actual building construction has been carried on diligently. Actual construction is defined to include the placing of construction materials in permanent position and fastened in a permanent manner. Where excavation or demolition or removal of an existing building has been substantially begun preparatory to rebuilding, such excavation or demolition or removal shall be deemed to be actual construction, provided that work shall be carried on diligently. 
C.  Nonconforming Lots of Record. In any zone in which single-family dwellings are permitted, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any single lot of record at the effective date of adoption of Ordinance No. 71 (October 7, 1953), notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this chapter. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for area or width, or both, that are generally applicable in the district, provided that yard dimensions and requirements other than those applying to area or width, or both, of the lot shall conform to the regulations for the district in which such lot is located. Variance of yard requirements shall be obtained only through action of the planning commission. 
D.  Nonconforming Uses of Land (or Land with Minor Structures Only). Where, at the time of passage of this chapter, lawful use of the land exists which would not be permitted by the regulations imposed by this chapter, and where such use involves no individual structure with a replacement cost exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000.00), the use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, provided: 
1.  No such nonconforming use shall be enlarged or increased, nor extended to occupy a greater area of land than was occupied at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter; 
2.  No such nonconforming use shall be moved in whole or in part to any portion of the lot or parcel other than that occupied by such use at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter; 
3.  If any such nonconforming use of land ceases for any reason for a period of more than thirty (30) days, any subsequent use of such land shall conform to the regulations specified by this chapter for the zone in which such land is located; 
4.  No additional structure not conforming to the requirements of this chapter shall be erected in connection with such nonconforming use of land. 
E.  Nonconforming Structures. Where a lawful structure exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter that could not be built under the terms of this chapter by reasons of restrictions on area, lot coverage, height, yards, its location on the lot, or other requirements concerning the structure, such structure may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
1.  No such nonconforming structure may be enlarged or altered in a way which increases its nonconformity, but any structure or portions thereof may be altered to decrease its nonconformity. 
2.  Should such nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of a structure be destroyed by any means to an extent of more than fifty (50) percent of its replacement cost at time of destruction, it shall not be reconstructed except in conformity with the provisions of this chapter. 
3.  Should such structure be moved for any reason for any distance whatever, it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the zone in which it is located after it is removed. 
F.  Nonconforming Uses of Structures or of Structures and Premises in Combination. If lawful use involving individual structures with a replacement cost of one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) or more, or of structure and premises in combination, exists at the effective date of adoption or amendment of this chapter, that would not be allowed in the zone under the terms of this chapter, the lawful use may be continued so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
1.  No existing structure devoted to a use not permitted by this chapter in the zone in which it is located shall be enlarged, extended, constructed, reconstructed, moved, or structurally altered except in changing the use permitted in the zone in which it is located. 
2.  Any nonconforming use may be extended throughout any parts of a building which were manifestly arranged or designed for such use at the time of adoption or amendment of this chapter, but no such use shall be extended to occupy any land outside such building. 
3.  If no structural alterations are made, any nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises, may. under conditional use permit, be changed to another nonconforming use provided that the planning commission either by general rule or by making findings in the specific case, shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the zone than the existing nonconforming use. In permitting such change, the planning commission may require appropriate conditions and safeguards in accord with the provisions of this chapter. 
4.  Any structure, or structure and land in combination, in or on which a nonconforming use is superseded by a permitted use, shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the zone and the nonconforming use may not thereafter be resumed. 
5.  When a nonconforming use of a structure, or structure and premises in combination, is discontinued or abandoned for six consecutive months, or for eighteen (18) months during any three-year period (except when government action impedes access to the premises), the structure or structure and premises in combination, shall not thereafter be used except in conformity with . the regulations of the zone in which it is located. 
6.  Where nonconforming use status applies to a structure and premises in combination, removal or destruction of the structure shall eliminate the nonconforming status of the land. Destruction for the purpose of this subsection is defined as damage to an extent of more than fifty (50) percent of replacement cost at the time of destruction. 
G.  Repairs and Maintenance. On any nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming use, work may be done in any period of twelve (12) consecutive months on ordinary repairs, or on repair or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring, or plumbing, to an extent not exceeding ten (10) percent of the current replacement cost of the nonconforming structure or nonconforming portion of the structure, as the case may be, provided that the cubic content existing when it became nonconforming shall not be increased. 
If a nonconforming structure or portion of a structure containing a nonconforming use becomes physically unsafe or unlawful due to lack of repairs and maintenance and is declared by any duly authorized official to be unsafe or unlawful by reason of physical condition, it shall not thereafter be restored, repaired or rebuilt except in conformity with the regulations of the zone in which it is located. Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any building or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any official charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such official. 
H.  Uses Under Conditional Use Permit, Provision not Nonconforming Uses. Any use which is permitted as a conditional use in a zone under the terms of this chapter (other than a change through planning commission action from a nonconforming use to another use not generally permitted in the zone) shall not be deemed a nonconforming use in such zone, but shall without further action be considered a conforming use. 
(Prior code § 070.05)  
17.78.020 - Nonconformities. 
A.  Intent and Purpose. 
1.  To provide for the regulation of nonconforming uses and nonconforming development standards or performance standards. 
2.  To specify the circumstances and conditions under which nonconformities may continue to exist. 
3.  To limit the number and extent of nonconformities by prohibiting or limiting their enlargement or extension; their reestablishment after abandonment; and their alteration or restoration after partial destruction. 
4.  To discourage the survival of nonconformities where they adversely affect the intent and purpose of this chapter and the general plan or the maintenance, development, use, enjoyment or economic values of other property in the vicinity. 
5.  To set time limits on the continuance of nonconformities based upon the nature of the use, the character, age and value of the development, and the degree of friction or objectionableness. 
B.  Definitions. 
1.  Nonconformities. Nonconformities shall consist of three major classifications either singly or in combination: 
a.  Nonconforming uses, 
b.  Nonconforming development standards, and 
c.  Nonconforming performance standards. 
2.  Nonconforming Use. The use of land or structures, which use was previously lawful but which no longer complies with the applicable district regulations where the use or structure is located, either as of the effective date of this chapter or as a result of subsequent applicable amendments. 
3.  Nonconforming Use of Land. A type of nonconforming use where no structures or only minor structures are on the land. 
4.  Nonconforming Development Standards and Performance Standards. Land, activities and structures are subject to numerous standards, most of which are defined in physical terms and subject to measurement. A nonconforming standard of use occurs when a use or structure which was previously lawful no longer complies with certain standards, either as of the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, or as a result of subsequent applicable amendments. 
The applicable standards are: 
Development standards 
a.  Project area, minimum; 
b.  Project width, minimum; 
c.  Project building coverage, maximum; 
d.  Lot area, minimum; 
e.  Lot area per dwelling unit, minimum; 
f.  Lot width, minimum; 
g.  Lot coverage, maximum; 
h.  Location of structures; 
i.  Separation between buildings, minimum; 
j.  Setback, minimum; 
k.  Front yard, minimum; 
l.  Side yard (s), minimum; 
m.  Rear yard, minimum; 
n.  Height limits, maximum; 
o.  Gross floor area, maximum; 
p.  Open space; 
q.  Passageway; 
r.  Enclosures or screening; 
s.  Parking and loading requirements; and 
t.  Sign regulations. 
Industrial performances standards, minimum. 
5.  Nonconforming Lot. A specific type of nonconformity where the lot does not conform with the district regulations with respect to lot area or lot width or both. 
(Prior code § 080.70)  
17.78.030 - NonconformitiesGeneral provisions. 
A.  Calculation of Time Periods. Unless otherwise excepted, all time periods affecting nonconformities shall begin on the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, or subsequent amendments thereto, or changes in the zoning map, whichever is the cause of such nonconformity. Exceptions to the time period calculation are those periods affecting types of nonconformities which are slated for termination by age and type of structure rather than by the date of this chapter. 
B.  Contamination. Nonconformities may be continuously maintained provided there is no alteration or addition to any structure, nor any enlargement of area, space or volume occupied by such nonconformity, except as otherwise provided in this chapter. 
C.  Maintenance. Ordinary repairs and maintenance may be made to a nonconformity, subject to the following provisions: 
1.  Maintenance shall not include structural alterations except those required by law, or except those to make the structure and use conform to the standards and use regulations of the district in which it is located. 
2.  In any period of twelve (12) consecutive months, work may be done on any structure which is subject to nonconformity regulations, on ordinary repairs, or on repairs or replacement of nonbearing walls, fixtures, wiring or plumbing, to an extent not exceeding the latest assessed valuation of the structure. In no case, however, shall the cubic content of the structure as it existed when it became subject to nonconformity be increased. 
3.  Nothing contained in these provisions shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoration to a safe condition of any structure or part thereof declared to be unsafe by any officer of the city charged with protecting the public safety, upon order of such officer. 
D.  Enlargement, Extension or Relocation. A nonconformity shall not be enlarged in volume or extended or relocated beyond the area it occupies unless its enlargement or extension are all made to conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located or unless specifically excepted, and subject to the following provisions: 
1.  Any exceptions to enlargement, extension or relocation shall not be construed to extend the termination date, if any, of the subject nonconformity; 
2.  Where parking and loading requirements are the cause for nonconformity, the structure or use subject to nonconformity may not be enlarged or altered to create additional dwelling units, guest rooms, seating capacity or floor area, unless additional parking and loading requirements are supplied and maintained to meet the requirements of the enlargement or expansion, subject to Section 17.54.010. 
E.  Change of Use. A nonconforming use shall not be changed to another use except to a use permitted in the district in which the use is located, or to another nonconforming use of the same nature, or to a more restricted nonconforming use; provided that the planning commission either by general rule or by written findings in a specific case, shall find that the proposed use is equally appropriate or more appropriate to the district than the existing nonconformity. Such changes may be subject to conditions imposed by the commission through Section 17.72.010. A change to another nonconforming use shall riot be construed to extend the termination date, if any, of the original nonconformity. 
F.  Nonconforming Lot. 
1.  In the R-S or R-M zones a single-family dwelling and customary accessory structures may be erected on any lot which is only nonconforming with respect to lot area and lot width standards.

G.  Nonconformities Connected With Public Acquisitions. 
1.  Where a structure is located upon a lot, a portion of which is acquired for any public use (by condemnation, purchase, dedication, or otherwise) by any governmental entity, such structure may be maintained upon the remaining portion of said lot, and may thereafter be used, maintained or repaired without relocating or altering the same to comply with the development standards of this chapter. Further, if such structure is partially located upon the site being acquired for public use, it may be relocated upon the same lot or premises without observing the required yard space adjacent to the new lot line created by such acquisition, and without reducing the number of dwelling units to conform to the development standards of the district in which it is located. If only a portion of an existing structure, is acquired for public use, the repair, remodeling or reconstruction of the remainder of such structure which was made necessary by such acquisition, shall conform to the provisions of the building code. Any portion of the structure which is not required to be repaired, remodeled or reconstructed by reason of said acquisition, shall not be required to be made to conform to the provisions of the building code, unless it would otherwise be required to conform thereto independently of, and in the absence of said acquisition of only a portion of the structure. 
2.  If a lot does not comply with the development standards of the district due to an acquisition of a portion thereof for public use, or if a legally existing nonconforming lot is reduced in size due to an acquisition of a portion thereof for public use, the remainder of said lot not acquired for public use, so long as said remainder is not smaller in area or width than one-half of the minimum area or width required for the zone in which it is situated, may be utilized for the purposes in the same manner as though it lawfully exist. ed at the time the regulations with which it does not conform became effective; provided that this paragraph shall not affect any structure previously and legally existing on said remainder. 
H.  Structures Under Construction. Any structure under construction, for which a valid building permit has been issued prior to the date of this chapter, may be completed and used in accordance with the provisions of this chapter or any amendment thereto, provided:

2.  That such structure is completed within one year from said operative date; 
3.  That such structure is completed in accordance with the plans and specifications on which such building permit was issued. 
I.  Treatment of Nonconformities Caused by Prior Ordinances. (Note: To avoid granting longer life to existing nonconformities, many of which are due to expire, the city attorney should assist in drafting the provision dealing specifically with these.) 
J.  Restoration of Damaged Nonconformities. 
1.  A nonconformity which is damaged or partially destroyed by fire, explosion or natural disaster to the extent of not more than twice the latest assessed valuation prior to the damage, may be restored and the occupancy or use of such structure or part thereof, existing at the time of such partial destruction, may be continued or resumed, provided the following special requirements: 
a.  Such restoration is of equal or lesser degree of nonconformity; 
b.  The total cost of such restoration does not exceed twice the assessed valuation of the structure at the time of such damage;

(Ord. No. 1026. § 1, 1-12-11)  
17.86.080 - Design criteria. 
A.  Pre-existing Character. Wireless communication facility location and development shall preserve the pre-existing character of the site as much as feasible. 
B.  Landscaping and Vegetation. Existing landscaping and vegetation, including trees, foliage and shrubs, whether or not utilized for stealthing, shall be preserved or improved, and disturbance of the existing topography of the site shall be minimized, unless removing, altering or disturbing the vegetation would result in less visual impact of the wireless communication facility on the surrounding area. Additional landscaping shall be planted where such vegetation is necessary to provide stealthing or to block the line of sight between a facility and adjacent residentially-zoned properties. If landscaping is removed to install the facility, landscaping shall be replaced on the site at a 1.5:1 ratio for the landscaping removed. 
C.  Stealthing. All wireless communication facilities shall be stealthed from view to the greatest extent feasible, considering technological requirements, by means of placement, camouflage, color choice, architectural compatibility and other site characteristics. The applicant shall use the smallest and least visible antennae and supporting equipment possible to accomplish the owner/operator's coverage objectives. 
Blending/Stealthing Methods: 
1.  All stand-alone facilities, plus supporting equipment, shall be composed of nonreflective materials and painted a color generally matching the surroundings or background that minimizes their visibility, unless the FCC, FAA, or other government agency requires a different color. If a new stand-alone facility cannot be camouflaged in any other way, it shall be camouflaged as a tree (i.e., monopalm, monopine). Lattice towers, guyed towers and flagpoles shall not be permitted as new stand-alone facilities, except by waiver granted pursuant to Section 17.86.090 below. Visible ground-level equipment, structures and buildings shall be stealthed from view by landscape plantings, fencing or other appropriate stealthing means, and shall be treated with graffiti-resistant paint or coating. 
2.  Roof-mounted, top-mounted or side-mounted wireless communication facilities shall be constructed, painted, finished and fully stealthed to match the color and texture of the building, structure and/or wall on which they are mounted. Façade-mounted equipment shall be camouflaged by incorporating the antenna into the design elements of the building or structure and shall be painted and textured to match the existing structure. If possible, antennae should be located entirely within an existing or newly created architectural feature so as to be completely screened from view. In no case shall antennae extend more than twenty-four (24) inches out from the building face. 
Equipment buildings or stealthing enclosures mounted on a roof shall be architecturally consistent with the building, such as having a finish similar to the exterior building walls. Equipment for roof-, top- or side-mounted antennae may also be located within the building on which the antenna is mounted. 
3.  The city council may, by resolution, promulgate additional regulations that further define and clarify the stealthing requirements of this subsection (C), consistent with the intent and purpose of this chapter.
