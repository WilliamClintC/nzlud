WILLIAMS, CALIFORNIA - MUNICIPAL CODE 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of
Williams, California 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 12,
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 
  
PREFACE 
The Williams, California Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Municipal Code Corporation, its successor in interest. 
During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of Kenneth A. Wilson, City Attorney. 
The Code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the Code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 12, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List". 
A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific Code provisions by individual section numbers. 
This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ord. No. 236-19, passed July 17, 2019.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
This Code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this Code. 
Numbering System. 
The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the Code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This Code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, Code adoption and definitions. The titles in this Code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
Each section of the Code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the Code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
There are many tables of contents in this Code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the Code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
At the end of each Code section, you will find an "ordinance history note", which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
Beginning with Supplement No. 12, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
The statutory references direct the Code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
When a Code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" Code references in the new Code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the Code, under the tabbed divider "Tables". This table lists the prior Code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new Code section in the column labeled "Herein". 
As of Supplement No. 12, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
To find a specific ordinance in the Code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the Code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)". If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the Code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)". Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)", "(Pending)", "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)". 
Beginning with Supplement No. 12, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List". 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
Beginning with Supplement No. 12, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the Code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the Code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this Code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
The index will be updated as necessary when the Code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
Each supplement to the new Code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. This Instruction Sheet will tell the Code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the Code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the Code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
When originally published, the pages of this Code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. 25, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Number System". (Example: 31, 32, 32-1.) Backs of pages that are blank (in Codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM.

B.  The imposition of development impact fees is one of the preferred methods of ensuring that development bears a proportionate share of the cost of public facilities and service improvements necessary to accommodate such development. This must be done in order to promote and protect the public health, safety and welfare. 
C.  This chapter recognizes that all new development within the city will result in additional growth and that such growth will place additional burdens on various city facilities, infrastructure, and services. This chapter further recognizes the types of land development that will generate impacts necessitating the acquisition of land and construction of public facilities and expansion of services and infrastructure in order to meet and accommodate them. 
D.  All land uses within the city should bear a proportionate financial burden in the construction and improvement of public facilities and services necessary to serve them. 
E.  The development impact fees established by this chapter are based upon the costs which are generated through the need for new facilities and other capital acquisition costs required, incrementally, by new development within the City of Williams. 
F.  The fees established by this chapter do not exceed the reasonable cost of providing public facilities occasioned by development projects within the City of Williams. 
G.  The fees established by this chapter relate rationally to the reasonable cost of providing public facilities occasioned by development projects within the City of Williams. 
H.  The fees established by this chapter are consistent with the goals and objectives of the city's general plan and are designed to mitigate the impacts caused by new development throughout the city. Development impact fees are necessary in order to finance the required facilities and service improvements and to pay for new development's fair share of their construction costs.

A developer that has been required by the city to construct any facilities or improvements (or a portion thereof) described in Section 3.14.030 as a condition of approval of a development permit may request an in-lieu credit of the specific development impact fee(s) involved for the same development. Upon request, an in-lieu credit of fees shall be granted for facilities or improvements that mitigate all or a portion of the need therefor that is attributable to and reasonably related to the given development. 
2.  Only costs proportional to the amount of the improvement or facility that mitigates the need therefor attributable to and reasonably related to the given development shall be eligible for in-lieu credit, and then only against the specific fee(s) involved to which the facility or improvement relates. 
3.  Fees required under this chapter shall be reduced by the actual construction costs of the facilities or improvements that relate to said fees, as demonstrated by the applicant and reviewed and approved by the city. If the cost of the facilities or improvements is greater than the required relevant fees, this chapter does not create an obligation on the city to pay the applicant the excess amount. 
4.  An amount of in-lieu credit that is greater than the specific fee(s) required under this chapter may be reserved and credited toward the fee applicable to any subsequent phase of the same development, if determined appropriate by the city. The city may set a time limit for reservation of the credit. 
5.  Credits shall be calculated by the city in accordance with the city's fee schedule set forth in the resolution to be adopted pursuant to Section 3.14.030. 
B.  Developer construction of facilities exceeding needs related to development project. Whenever an applicant is required, as a condition of approval of a development permit, to construct any facility or improvement (or a portion thereof) described in the resolution adopted pursuant to Section 3.14.030 which facility or improvement is determined by the city to exceed the need therefor attributable to and reasonably related to the given development project, a reimbursement agreement with the applicant and a credit against the specific relevant fee which would otherwise be charged pursuant to this chapter on the development project, shall be offered. The credit shall be applied with respect to that portion of the improvement or facility that is attributable to and reasonably related to the need therefor caused by the development. The amount to be reimbursed shall be that portion of the cost of the improvement or facility that exceeds the need therefor attributable to and reasonably related to the given development. The reimbursement agreement shall contain terms and conditions mutually agreeable to the developer and the city, and shall be approved by the city attorney. 
C.  Site related improvements. Credit shall not be given for site-related improvements, including, but not limited to, traffic signals, right-of-way dedications, or providing paved access to the property, which are specifically required by the project in order to serve it and do not constitute facilities or improvements specified in the resolution referenced in Section 3.14.030 hereof. 
D.  Determination of credit. The developer seeking credit and/or reimbursement for construction of improvements or facilities, or dedication of land or rights-of-way, shall submit such documentation, including without limitation, engineering drawings, specifications, and construction cost estimates, and utilize such methods as may be appropriate and acceptable to the city administrator to support the request for credit or reimbursement. The city administrator shall determine the credit for construction of improvements or facilities based upon either these cost estimates or upon alternative engineering criteria and construction cost estimates if he or she determines that such estimates submitted by the developer are either unreliable or inaccurate. The city administrator shall determine whether facilities or improvements are eligible for credit or reimbursement. 
E.  Time for making claim for credit. Any claim for credit must be made no later than the application for a building permit. Any claim not so made shall be deemed waived. 
F.  Transferability of credit-council approval. Credits shall not be transferable from one project or development to another without the approval of the city council.

Determinations made by the city pursuant to the provisions of this section may be appealed to the city council by filing a written appeal (setting forth in detail the factual basis therefor) with the city clerk, together with a fee established by resolution of the city council, within ten calendar days of the determination of the city. The appeal shall be considered by the city council at a public hearing to be held, noticed and conducted within sixty days after the filing of the appeal. The decision of the city council on the appeal shall be final.

The ordinance codified in this chapter shall be known as the uniform transient occupancy tax ordinance of the city. 
(Ord. 2-82, 1982).  
3.24.020 - Definitions. 
Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this section govern the construction of this chapter. 
A.  "Hotel" means any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging house, rooming house, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, mobile home or house trailer at a fixed location, or other similar structure or portion thereof. 
B.  "Occupancy" means the use or possession or the right to the use or possession of any room or rooms or portion thereof in any hotel for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes. 
C.  "Operator" means the person who is the proprietor of the hotel whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his functions through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purposes of this chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both. 
D.  "Person" means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate, or any other group or combination acting as a unit. 
E.  "Rent" means the consideration charged, whether or not received for the occupancy of space in a hotel valued in money, goods, labor or otherwise including all receipts, cash, credit, and property and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever. 
F.  "Tax administrator" means the city clerk or her authorized agent. 
G.  "Transient" means any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other agreement for a period of thirty consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be transient until the period of thirty days has expired unless there is an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy. In determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to January 1, 1983 may be considered. 
(Ord. 2-82, 1982)  
3.24.030 - Tax imposed. 
For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to, and shall pay, a tax in the amount of ten percent of the rent charged by the operator. Said tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the city which is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the city. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient's ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the tax administrator may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the tax administrator. 
(Ord. 121-00 § 2, 2001; Ord. 41-88 § 2, 1988: Ord. 2-82, 1982)

B.  Any federal or State of California officer or employee when on official business; 
C.  Any officer or employee of a foreign government who is exempt by reason of express provision of federal law of international treaty. 
No exemption shall be granted except upon a claim therefor made at the time rent is collected and under penalty of perjury upon a form prescribed by the tax administrator. 
(Ord. 2-82, 1982)  
3.24.050 - Operator's duties. 
Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this chapter to the same extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The amount of the tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent charged and each transient shall receive a receipt for payment from the operator. No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner hereinafter provided. 
(Ord. 2-82, 1982)  
3.24.060 - Registration. 
Within thirty days after January 1, 1983, or within thirty days after commencing business, whichever is later, each operator of any hotel renting occupancy to transients shall register said hotel with the tax administrator and obtain from him a "transient occupancy registration certificate" to be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on the premises. Said certificate shall, among other things, state the following: 
A.  The name of the operation; 
B.  The address of the hotel; 
C.  The date upon which the certificate was issued; 
D.  "This Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate signifies that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax Ordinance by registering with the Tax Administrator for the purpose of collecting from transients the Transient Occupancy Tax and remitting said tax to the Tax Administrator. This certificate does not authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business or to conduct any lawful business in an unlawful manner, not to operate a hotel without strictly complying with all local applicable laws, including but not limited to those requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or office of this city. This certificate does not constitute a permit". 
(Ord. 2-82, 1982).  
3.24.070 - Reporting and remitting. 
Each operator shall, on or before thirty days after the end of each calendar month, make a return to the tax administrator on forms provided by him, of the total rents charged and received and the amount of tax collected for transient occupancies. At the same time as filing the return and within the same thirty-day period, the operator shall also remit the full amount of tax collected to the tax administrator. The tax administrator may establish shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder if he deems it necessary in order to insure collection of the tax, and he may require further information in return. Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business by the operator for any reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust for the account of the city until payment thereof is made to the tax administrator. 
(Ord. 95-96 § 1, 1996: Ord. 2-82, 1982).

C.  Fraud. If the tax administrator determines that the nonpayment of any remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of twenty-five percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties stated in Subsections A. and B. of this section. 
D.  Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the rate of one-half of one percent per month or fraction thereof on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until paid. 
E.  Penalties merged with tax. Every penalty imposed and such interest as accrues under the provisions of this section shall become a part of the tax herein required to be paid. 
(Ord. 2-82, 1982).  
3.24.090 - Failure to collect and report tax—Determination of tax by administrator. 
If any operator fails or refuses to collect said tax and to make within the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of said tax or any portion thereof required of this chapter, the tax administrator shall proceed in such manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to base his estimate of the tax due. As soon as the tax administrator procures such facts and information as he is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, he shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest, and penalties provided for by this chapter. In case such determination is made, the tax administrator shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States Mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his last known place of address. Such operator may within ten days after the serving of mailing of such notice make application in writing to the tax administrator for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest, and penalties, if any, determined by the tax administrator shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the tax administrator shall give not less than five days' written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in said notice why said amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest, and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest, and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing the tax administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest, and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen days unless an appeal is taken as provided in Section 3.24.100.

The council shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and the city clerk shall give notice in writing to such operator at his last known place of address. The findings of the council shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed above for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of notice. 
(Ord. 2-82, 1982).  
3.24.110 - Records. 
It shall be the duty of every operator liable for the collection and payment to the city of any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve for a period of three years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of such tax as he may have been liable for the collection of and payment to the city, which records the tax administrator shall have the right to inspect at all reasonable times. 
(Ord. 2-82, 1982).  
3.24.120 - Refunds. 
A.  Whenever the amount of any tax, interest, or penalty has been over paid or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city under this chapter it may be refunded as provided in Subsections B. and C. of this section provided a claim in writing thereof, stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded, is filed with the tax administrator within three years of the date of payment. The claim shall be on forms furnished by the tax administrator. 
B.  An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner prescribed by the tax administrator that the person from whom the tax has been collected was not a transient; provided, however, that neither a refund, nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to the transient or credited to rent subsequently payable by the transient to the operator. 
C.  A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid or paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city by filing a claim in the manner provided in Subsection A. of this section, but only when the tax was paid by the transient directly to the tax administrator, or when the transient having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the satisfaction of the tax administrator that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax. 
D.  No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless the claimant established his right thereto by written records showing entitlement thereto. 
(Ord. 2-82, 1982).  
3.24.130 - Actions to collect. 
Any tax required to be paid by any transient under the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the transient to the city. Any such tax collected by an operator which has not been paid to the city shall be deemed a debt owed by the operator to the city. Any person owing money to the city under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to an action brought in the name of the city for recovery of such amount. 
(Ord. 2-82, 1982).  
3.24.140 - Violations—Misdemeanor—Penalty. 
Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter is guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punishable therefor by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars or by imprisonment in the county jail for a period of not more than six months or by both such fine and imprisonment. 
Any operator or other person who fails or refuses to register as required herein or to furnish any return required to be made, or who fails or refuses to furnish a supplemental return or other data required by the tax administrator, or who renders a false or fraudulent report or claim with intent to defeat or evade the determination of any amount due required by this chapter to be made, is guilty of a misdemeanor and is punishable as aforesaid.

If the licensee fails to appear at the time and place set for the hearing in the order to show cause, without good cause shown for such failure, the city administrator or city clerk may issue his order revoking the license upon the same grounds as those grounds upon which the order to show cause was issued and the order of revocation shall be final as of the day it bears date and licensee shall forthwith surrender this license to the city administrator or city clerk. If the licensee appears at the time and place set for the hearing, he may present evidence to show why the license should not be revoked, which evidence need not be limited to that evidence which is admissible in a court of law.

Such notice and request must be in writing and must be filed and actually received by the clerk within fifteen days after the date appearing on the order of revocation made by the city clerk or city administrator.

A.  Name and address of licensee; 
B.  Number and date of issuance of license; 
C.  Date or order of revocation of license by city clerk or city administrator;

Thereafter the licensee shall present its evidence in support of the retention of its license. Evidence produced before the council shall not be limited to that evidence which would be admissible in a court of law, but shall be limited to such evidence as is relevant and material to those grounds upon the basis of which the order of revocation was previously made. Any relevant evidence may be admitted if it is the sort of evidence on which responsible persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs. The council shall act solely on the basis of the evidence properly admitted into the record of proceedings. All testimony shall be taken under oath or affirmation and each witness shall be subject to the cross-examination of the opposing party. Any party to such hearing who wishes the proceedings to be reported by a stenographic reporter shall make all arrangements necessary for the production of such reporter at the hearing and shall pay the cost thereof. 
At the conclusion of the presentation of evidence by the parties, the city council shall render its decision upon the basis of its announced findings of fact, either setting aside the revocation order previously made or affirming such revocation order and ordering the immediate surrender of the license by the licensee to the city clerk. The license shall be deemed revoked and of no further legal force or effect immediately upon the rendition by the city council of its order affirming the order of revocation previously made. 
In the event the licensee fails, without good cause shown therefor, to appear before the city council at the time and place set for the hearing, the city council shall make its order affirming the order of revocation and thereupon the license shall cease to be of any further legal force, effect, significance or validity and shall be forthwith surrendered by the licensee to the city clerk.

The intent of this chapter is to regulate adult-oriented businesses which, because of their very nature, may have many of the recognized significant secondary effects on the community which include, but are not limited to: depreciated property values and increased vacancies in residential and commercial areas in the vicinity of the adult-oriented businesses; higher crime rates, noise, debris or vandalism in the vicinity of adult-oriented businesses; and blighting conditions such as low level maintenance of commercial premises and parking lots which thereby have a deleterious effect upon adjacent areas, as set forth in more detail in the ordinance adopting this chapter. Special regulation of these uses is necessary to insure that these adverse effects will not contribute to the blighting or downgrading of the neighborhoods in the vicinity of the adult-oriented businesses. It is neither the intent nor effect of this chapter to impose limitations or restrictions on the content of any communicative material. Similarly, it is neither the intent nor effect of this section to restrict or deny access by adults to sexually oriented materials or merchandise protected by the First Amendment, or to deny access by the distributors or exhibitors of adult-oriented business to their intended market. Nothing in this chapter is intended to authorize, legalize or permit the establishment, operation or maintenance of any business, building or use which violates any city ordinance or any statute of the state of California regarding public nuisances, unlawful exposure, sexual conduct, lewdness or obscene or harmful matter or the exhibition or public display thereof.

(Ord. 154-07 § 3(part), 2007).  
6.32.020 - Vicious and potentially dangerous animal classification procedure. 
A.  Animal control officers are authorized to determine whether any animal has engaged in the behaviors specified in Section 6.32.010. 
B.  When an animal control officer has reason to believe that an animal is vicious or potentially dangerous, the officer shall conduct an investigation to determine whether there is sufficient evidence to support classifying the animal as a vicious or potentially dangerous animal. The evidence shall include observations and testimony by animal control officers or other witnesses who personally observed the animal's behavior. The evidence may include testimony about the animal's upbringing and the owner's or keeper's control of the animal. 
C.  If the animal control officer determines sufficient evidence exists to classify an animal as vicious or potentially dangerous, he or she must consider the existence of any mitigating circumstances described in Section 6.32.120 or in an administrative regulation promulgated by the city manager, if one exists, before reaching a determination; however, the existence of mitigating circumstances shall not require the officer to refrain from classifying an animal vicious or potentially dangerous. 
D.  When a vicious or potentially dangerous animal classification determination is based solely on the uncorroborated testimony of the victim or a witness other than a law enforcement officer, the testimony must be contained in a written statement signed under penalty of perjury. 
E.  Once the animal control officer determines an animal should be classified under Section 6.32.010, he or she must serve the owner or keeper of the animal with a notice of classification. 
F.  The city administrator may establish administrative regulations for the classification of vicious or potentially dangerous animals.

The request must be delivered to the city clerk. The request must state in detail the factual basis to contest the action and describe in detail any claimed affirmative defense or mitigating circumstance. 
B.  If a timely request for hearing is submitted in accordance with subsection A, the city clerk shall schedule a hearing under Section 6.32.050 within ten calendar days of receiving the request, or as soon as practical thereafter. Notice of the hearing may be served on both the owner and/or keeper by depositing same in the United States Postal Service mail, first class mail, postage prepaid, at Williams, California.

The hearing may be continued from time to time. 
C.  Failure of the owner or keeper to appear at the hearing after notice has been served shall be deemed a waiver of the right to a hearing and an admission by the owner or keeper that the animal is potentially dangerous or vicious. Such failure to appear shall also constitute a failure to exhaust available administrative remedies. 
D.  Unless otherwise provided, the city bears the burden of proof at the hearing. The owner or keeper has the burden of proof to demonstrate the existence of any affirmative defense or any mitigating circumstance that may apply. 
E.  The hearing shall not be conducted according to the formal rules of evidence. Any relevant evidence shall be admitted if it is the type of evidence on which reasonable persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs, regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule which might make improper the admission of such evidence over the objection in civil actions in courts of competent jurisdiction in this state. However, irrelevant or unduly repetitious evidence may be excluded.

6.32.100 - Seizure and impoundment. 
A.  An animal classified as vicious under Section 6.32.020 shall be impounded as soon as practical after service of the classification notice.

The notice may be served as provided in Section 6.32.040, must describe the requirement not complied with, and must notify the owner or keeper of the right to a hearing before the animal's destruction and the process for requesting a hearing. 
1.  Demonstrate an intention and an ability to immediately comply with this article's requirements for keeping a potentially dangerous animal;

3.  Render efficient service, making repairs promptly and interrupting service only for good cause and for the shortest time possible. Planned interruptions, insofar as possible, shall be preceded by notice given to subscribers twenty-four hours in advance and shall occur during periods of minimum use of the system. 
4.  Maintain an office in the city, which office shall be open during all the usual business hours, with its telephone listed in directories of the telephone company serving the city, and be so operated that complaints and requests for repairs or adjustment may be received at any time, day or night, seven days a week, or provide a local telephone directory listing and "toll free" telephone service maintained on a seven-day, twenty-four hour basis for the receipt of consumer complaints. 
5.

a.  Public schools and community colleges within the city; and 
b.  Buildings owned and controlled by the city, used for public purposes and not for residential use (fire and police stations excepted). 
E.  Compatibility and connectibility. 
1.  It is the desire of the city that all cable television systems franchised hereunder shall, insofar as financially and technically possible, be compatible one with another and with systems adjacent to the city. 
2.  Wherever it is financially and technically feasible, the grantee shall so construct, operate and modify the system so as to tie the same into all other systems within and adjacent to the city. 
F.  Uses permitted. Any franchise granted pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall authorize and permit the grantee to engage in the business of operating and providing a cable television system in the city, and for that purpose to erect, install, construct, repair, replace, reconstruct, maintain and retain in, on, over, under, upon, across and along any street, such poles, wires, cable, conductors, ducts, conduit, vaults, manholes, amplifiers, and appliances, attachments, and other property as may be necessary and appurtenant to the cable television system; and, in addition, so to use, operate, and provide similar facilities or properties rented or leased from other persons, firms or corporations, including but not limited to any public utility or other grantee franchised or permitted to do business in the city.

B.  The percentage payments shall be made in the manner and at times directed in said franchise or in a council resolution fixing franchise fees and adopting rules for service and rate regulation. 
C.  No acceptance of any payment shall be construed as a release or as an accord and satisfaction of any claim the city may have for further or additional sums payable under this chapter or for the performance of any other obligation hereunder.

B.  The city may terminate any franchise granted pursuant to the provisions of this chapter in the event of the willful failure, refusal or neglect by grantee to do or comply with any material requirement or limitation contained in this chapter, or any material rule or regulation of the council or chief administrative officer validly adopted pursuant to this chapter. 
C.  The chief administrative officer may make written demand that the grantee do or comply with any such requirement, limitation, term, condition, rule or regulation. If the failure, refusal or neglect of the grantee continues for a period of thirty days following such written demand, the chief administrative officer may place his request for termination of the franchise upon the next regular council meeting agenda.

E.  If such failure, refusal or neglect by the grantee was with just cause, the council shall direct the grantee to comply within such time and manner and upon such terms and conditions as are reasonable. 
F.  If the council shall determine such failure, refusal or neglect by the grantee was without just cause, then the council may, by resolution, declare that the franchise of such grantee shall be terminated and forfeited unless there be compliance by the grantee within such period as the council may fix. 
G.  The termination and forfeiture of any franchise shall in no way effect any of the rights of the city under the franchise of any provision of law. 
H.  In the event of any holding over after expiration of any franchise granted hereunder, without the prior consent of the city, expressed by resolution, the grantee shall pay to the city reasonable compensation and damages, of not less than one hundred percent of its gross revenue during said period.

Footnotes: 
--- (4) --- 
Editor's note— Ord. No. 199-13, § 6(exh. B), adopted Feb. 20, 2013, amended Art. II in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Art. II, §§ 8.16.110—8.16.220, pertained to similar subject matter and derived from: Ord. 151-06 § 1(part), 2006; Ord. 153-06 § 1(part), 2006; and Ord. No. 189-11, §§ 2, 3, adopted Jan. 18, 2012. 
 
8.16.110 - Notice to abate nuisance conditions. 
A.  When the enforcement officer finds that a nuisance condition exists upon any premises in the city, he or she may, or upon the direction of the city council shall, serve a notice to abate upon the owner or responsible party in possession or having control of the premises upon which the condition exists, directing him/her to abate or cause the nuisance condition(s) upon the premises to be abated on or before a specified compliance date. The notice shall also state that the responsible party may file a written request for a hearing with the city clerk to dispute the alleged conditions within fifteen days of the notice. 
B.  The enforcement officer shall post one copy of the notice in a conspicuous place on the property in question and shall deliver one copy of the notice to the owner or responsible party in possession or control of the property upon which the nuisance condition exists either in person or by certified mail, with a return receipt requested. 
C.  The failure of the owner or responsible party to actually receive the notice shall not affect in any manner the validity of any proceedings pursuant to this chapter. 
D.  In the event the responsible party files a timely request for hearing, the city clerk and hearing officer shall schedule the hearing. The hearing shall be conducted within forty-five days of receipt of the request unless otherwise agreed to in writing by the parties. The city clerk shall send written notice of the location, time and date of the hearing at least ten days in advance of the hearing date. 
E.  In the event the responsible party fails to appeal the notice, the nuisance conditions shall be deemed confirmed. Such failure shall also constitute a failure to exhaust available administrative remedies. 
(Ord. No. 199-13, § 6(exh. B), 2-20-2013)  
8.16.120 - Manner of conducting abatement hearing. 
In the event a hearing is timely requested pursuant to Section 8.16.110, the hearing shall be conducted pursuant to the following procedures: 
A.  At the time and place designated in the notice of hearing, the hearing officer shall hear and consider all relevant evidence, including but not limited to, applicable staff reports, oral evidence, physical evidence and documentary evidence regarding the alleged nuisance, and proposed method of abatement. The hearing may be continued from time to time. 
B.  Failure of the owner or responsible party to appear at the hearing shall be deemed a waiver of the right to a hearing and an admission by the owner or responsible party of the existence of the nuisance condition charged. In the event of such failure to appear, the hearing officer may order that the nuisance condition be abated by the enforcement officer. Such failure to appear shall also constitute a failure to exhaust available administrative remedies. 
C.  The city shall bear the burden of proof to demonstrate, by a preponderance of the evidence, that a nuisance exists and that the proposed mechanism for abatement is appropriate. The city need not demonstrate that the proposed mechanism for abatement is either the most appropriate or least expensive. 
D.  The hearing shall not be conducted according to the formal rules of evidence. Any relevant evidence shall be admitted if it is the type of evidence on which reasonable persons are accustomed to rely in the conduct of serious affairs, regardless of the existence of any common law or statutory rule which might make improper the admission of such evidence over objection in civil actions in courts of competent jurisdiction in this state. However, irrelevant or unduly repetitious evidence may be excluded. 
E.  Prior to conclusion of the hearing, if the owner or responsible party is present, the hearing officer may request the owner or responsible party to sign a consent to enter and perform work. The permission given shall be used only if the nuisance condition is determined to exist and is not abated by the schedule of correction specified in the hearing officer's decision. 
F.  If the owner or responsible party does not provide written consent, entry onto the property may be made by obtaining verbal permission from the owner or a responsible party, or by means of an inspection warrant, or by any other lawful manner. 
(Ord. No. 199-13, § 6(exh. B), 2-20-2013)  
8.16.130 - Issuance of decision, findings and order. 
A.  Within ten days after the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer shall issue a written decision. The decision shall set forth the factual findings made by the hearing officer, a conclusion as to whether a nuisance condition exists, the manner of abatement, including an order that such nuisance (if one is found to exist) be abated by the city and a schedule of correction or the date by which the abatement shall be completed. 
B.  If the hearing officer determines that a nuisance exists which has not been corrected within the time period specified in the notice to abate nuisance conditions, the hearing officer shall so find in the decision, and may include in the decision any or all of the following: 
1.  An order to correct, including a schedule of correction where appropriate;

Upon receipt of the hearing officer's decision if: (i) no schedule of correction has been issued; or (ii) upon the failure of the property owner to comply with such schedule if a schedule was included, if the nuisance condition has not been abated the enforcement officer shall forthwith abate, or cause to be abated, the nuisance condition upon the premises. The enforcement officer is authorized to enter upon private property for this purpose, consistent with the provisions of the U.S. Constitution. 
The cost of abatement shall become a personal obligation of the property owner and responsible party and may be collected in any legal manner, expressly including as lien or special assessment pursuant to the procedures set forth in this chapter.

B.  Any owner or responsible party may also request the city to abate a declared nuisance condition on his/her/its property. However, the owner or responsible party making the request shall be responsible for the payment of all penalties, abatement costs and/or administrative costs incurred by the city. The request for the city to perform the abatement shall be in writing and include a written consent to enter and perform work. Any such request shall be deemed an agreement to pay for the costs of such abatement, including but not limited to any penalties, administrative costs, and an agreement that such costs may be collected as a lien upon the property.

B.  The administrative costs may include any and all costs incurred by the city in connection with the matter before the hearing officer, including but not limited to, costs of investigation, city staffing costs incurred in preparation for the hearing and for the hearing itself, including but not limited to the fees and costs of the city's consultants, and costs for all re-inspections necessary to enforce the notice to abate nuisance conditions.

The responsible party may be invoiced for the total. If payment is not received, the itemized report shall be submitted in writing to the city clerk no sooner than twenty days of the invoice date.

E.  All abatement costs shall bear interest at the rate of ten percent per annum from the date of abatement. 
(Ord. No. 199-13, § 6(exh. B), 2-20-2013)

In the event the city decides to collect abatement costs as a lien, it shall impose such lien pursuant to this section: 
A.  Upon receipt of the itemized report, the city clerk, or his or her designee, shall serve notice of the lien in the same manner as summons in a civil action in accordance with Code of Civil Procedure section 415.10 et seq. If the owner of record, after diligent search cannot be found, the notice may be served by posting a copy thereof in a conspicuous place upon the property for a period of ten days and publication thereof in a newspaper of general circulation in Colusa County. The period of notice commences upon the first day of publication and terminates at the end of the tenth day, including therein the first day. Publication shall be made on each day on which the newspaper is published during the ten-day period. 
B.  The notice shall inform the owner of the pending lien and inform the property owner of the public hearing where the city council will consider imposing the itemized report as a lien against the property. The hearing shall be conducted no less than ten days from service of the notice. 
C.  At the hearing and after considering the relevant evidence, the city council may adopt a resolution confirming the itemized report and directing the city clerk to record a lien against the property in the Colusa County Recorder's office and, from the date of recording, shall have the force, effect and priority of a judgment lien. 
D.  The lien shall identify:

2.  The city as the agency on whose behalf the lien is imposed; 
3.  The date of the abatement order or citation;

F.  A lien may be foreclosed by an action brought by the city for a money judgment. 
G.  The city may recover from the property owner any costs incurred in the processing and recording of the lien and providing notice to the property owner as part of its foreclosure action to enforce the lien. 
(Ord. No. 199-13, § 6(exh. B), 2-20-2013)  
8.16.180 - Special assessment procedure. 
In the event the city decides to collect abatement costs as a special assessment, it shall impose such special assessment pursuant to this section: 
A.  The enforcement officer or other authorized city official shall keep an itemized report of the costs incurred by the city in the abatement of any public nuisance in addition to any accrued fees and penalties due. The property owner may be invoiced for the total. If payment is not received, the itemized report shall be submitted in writing to the city clerk no sooner than fifteen days of the invoice date. Any such report may include the abatement costs, fees and penalties for any number of properties and abatements, whether or not such properties are contiguous. 
B.  If the invoice is not timely paid, the city clerk shall provide written notice to the property owner by certified mail, if the property owner's identity can be determined from the county assessor's or county recorder's records. The notice shall inform the owner of the pending special assessment, including the information set forth in Subsection C, and the date, time and location of the public hearing where the city council will consider imposing the itemized report as a special assessment against the property. The hearing shall be conducted no less than ten days from service of the notice. 
C.  At the hearing and after considering the relevant evidence, the city council may adopt a resolution confirming the itemized report and assessing the report as a special assessment against the property. The city clerk shall then provide all documentation necessary to the county to enter such assessment. After entry, the assessment may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes are collected, and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary municipal taxes. The property may be sold after three years by the tax collector for unpaid delinquent assessments. The tax collector's power of sale shall not be affected by the failure of the property owner to receive notice. All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of municipal taxes shall be applicable to the special assessment. However, if any real property to which the cost of abatement relates has been transferred or conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for value, or if a lien of a bona fide encumbrancer for value has been created and attaches thereon, prior to the date on which the first installment of the taxes would become delinquent, then the cost of abatement shall not result in a lien against the real property but instead shall be transferred to the unsecured roll for collection. 
D.  Subject to the requirements applicable to the sale of property pursuant to Section 3691 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, the city may conduct a sale of vacant residential developed property for which the payment of that assessment is delinquent. 
E.  Notices or instruments relating to the special assessment shall be entitled to recordation. 
(Ord. No. 199-13, § 6(exh. B), 2-20-2013)

9.04.010 - Purpose. 
Minors, due to their lack of experience and knowledge in making critical decisions regarding the safety of themselves and others, are particularly vulnerable to the dangers that are present at public places and business establishments at night because of criminal activity perpetrated against and by minors. Minors' particular vulnerability to these dangers creates a compelling governmental interest in providing a higher degree of protection for minors during nighttime hours. For these reasons, and because the experience of the city and the experiences of other cities in California and in the United States have shown that juvenile curfews effectively reduce the amount of crime perpetrated against and by minors at night, the city adopts this nighttime juvenile curfew.

Chapter 9.16 - SPECIAL EVENTS 
Sections: 
 
9.16.010 - Intent and purpose. 
The intent of this chapter is to provide a regulatory framework for permitting special events. The use of city streets or other city-owned or controlled property and private property by large groups causes wear and tear on such property. Further, it requires city staff time to provide traffic enforcement and to ensure proper crowd control. Such uses also subject neighboring residents to excessive noise and traffic, particularly when the property or facility is small or the use is intense. As such, the purpose of this chapter is to ensure that special events are conducted so as not to violate any other ordinance or regulation of the city or cause any detrimental effects to surrounding properties and the community. The provisions set forth in this chapter shall establish criteria for characterizing events as "special events" and standards and conditions for approving and permitting such special events. 
It is also the intent of the city council to protect the rights of its citizens to engage in protected free speech and expressive activities. Consequently, it is not the intent of this chapter to regulate conduct, the sole or principal objective of which is the expression, dissemination or communication by verbal, visual, literary or auditory means of opinion, views or ideas, which are protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution or Article 1, Section 2 of the California Constitution. 
(Ord. No. 171-09, § 1, 11-4-2009)  
9.16.020 - Special events defined. 
A.  As hereinafter mentioned in this chapter, "special event" means, including but without limitation, any assembly or congregation of persons, display, entertainment or demonstration, that is likely to meet any one or more of the following criteria: 
1.  Be attended by fifty people or more; or 
2.  Obstructs, delays or interferes with the normal flow of pedestrian or vehicular traffic, or otherwise fails to comply with traffic laws and controls. 
B.  In order to estimate the necessary level of public services necessary for each special event, the city administrator shall characterize each event as provided in this section. All special events shall fall within one of the following categories: 
1.  A category one event is generally any special event that is reasonably expected to attract between fifty and ninety-nine people. 
2.  A category two event is generally any special event that is reasonably expected to attract between one hundred and one to four hundred and ninety-nine people. 
3.  A category three event is generally any special event that is reasonably expected to attract more than five hundred people.

C.  The city administrator shall, for good cause, consider an application that is filed after the filing deadline if there is sufficient time to process and investigate the application and obtain police and other city services for the event.

9.16.070 - Action on application.

Denials shall be based on one or more of the grounds specified in Section 9.16.080 of this chapter.

B.  The city administrator, upon concurrence of the chief of police and fire chief, shall approve, conditionally approve, or deny, all category two and three event applications no later than fifteen calendar days after the city administrator receives a complete application.

(Ord. No. 171-09, § 1, 11-4-2009)  
9.16.080 - Grounds for denial of application for permit. 
A.  The city administrator shall approve an application for a permit unless he/she determines, from a consideration of the application and other pertinent information, that: 
1.  Information contained in the application, or supplemental information requested from the applicant, is false in any material detail; 
2.  The application is incomplete or the applicant failed to complete the application after having been notified of the additional information or documents required; 
3.  The applicant undertook a prior special event without a required permit or otherwise in violation of this chapter; 
4.  The applicant failed to pay the additional costs of a prior special event charged pursuant to Subsection 9.16.140C. of this chapter; 
5.  Another permit application has been received prior in time, or has already been approved, to hold another event at the time and place requested by the applicant, or so close in time and/or place as to cause undue traffic congestion, or the city's police department is unable to meet the needs for police services for both events; 
6.  The concentration of persons, animals and vehicles at the site of the event, or the assembly and disbanding areas around the event, will either prevent proper police, fire or emergency medical services to areas contiguous to the event or will exceed the capabilities of the police, fire or emergency medical services needed to adequately protect the participants from the conduct of others; 
7.  The size of the event will require diversion of so great a number of city police officers and other public employees to ensure that participants stay within the boundaries or route of the event, or to protect participants in the event, as to prevent normal protection to the rest of the city. Nothing herein authorizes denial of a permit when additional peace officers or approved private security forces to supplement these peace officers or approved private security forces would be available to the city, if requested by the city in advance of the event. Nothing herein authorizes denial of a permit because of the need to protect participants from the conduct of others, if reasonable conditions can be imposed to allow for adequate protection of participants with the number of police officers available to police the event; 
8.  The location of the event will substantially interfere with any construction or maintenance work scheduled to take place upon or along the city streets or a previously granted encroachment permit; 
9.  The event will occur at a time when a school is in session at a route or location adjacent to the school or class thereof, and the noise created by the activities of the event would substantially disrupt the educational activities of the school or class thereof; 
10.  Given the name of the special event, and/or the past history of the applicant, sponsors and/or participants, the city administrator reasonably determines that the event presents a substantial risk to the health, safety and welfare of the participants and/or local residents that cannot be adequately mitigated using available public resources; or 
11.  The applicant failed to comply with the California Fire Code and/or the state fire marshal requirements during previous special events. 
B.  When the grounds for denial specified in Subsection A. of this section can be corrected by altering either the staffing for, or the date, time, duration, route or location of the event, the city administrator shall, instead of denying the application, conditionally approve the application upon the applicant's written acceptance of conditions for permit issuance. The conditions imposed shall provide for only such modifications of the applicant's proposed event as are necessary to achieve compliance with this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 171-09, § 1, 11-4-2009)  
9.16.090 - Permit conditions. 
The city administrator may condition the issuance of a permit by imposing reasonable restrictions on the time, place and manner of conducting the event as are necessary or appropriate to protect persons and property, and to control traffic, provided that such restrictions shall not unreasonably interfere with the right of free speech. Such conditions may include, but are not limited to the following: 
A.  Alteration of the staffing for, or the date, time, route or location of the event; 
B.  Conditions concerning accommodation of pedestrian or vehicular traffic, including restricting the event to only a portion of a street; 
C.  Requirements for provision of first aid and sanitary facilities, including the presence of emergency medical services personnel for all category two or three events; 
D.  Requirements for use of event monitors and providing notice of permit conditions to participants; 
E.  Approval of any proposed private security forces;

H.  Requirements for use and provision of garbage containers, cleanup and restoration of city property; 
I.  Restrictions on the time and use of amplified sound; 
J.  Permit applications for block parties may be conditioned on notice and approval by at least fifty percent of the residents on the affected street(s); 
K.  Compliance with any relevant ordinance or law, including obtaining any legally required permit or license; 
L.  Adequate proof of payment of the public service fees pursuant to Section 9.16.140 of this chapter; and 
M.  Adequate proof of compliance with the cleanup requirements set forth in Section 9.16.150 of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 171-09, § 1, 11-4-2009)  
9.16.100 - Appeal procedure—Waivers. 
A.  The applicant may appeal to the city council the refusal to consider a late application, the denial or conditional approval of a permit, any condition imposed on a permit not required by state or federal law, or a determination that the applicant's insurance coverage does not comply with the requirements specified in Section 9.16.130 of this chapter. 
B.  The applicant may request a waiver from the city council regarding the amount of fees imposed pursuant to Section 9.16.140 of this chapter, cleanup deposits imposed pursuant to Section 9.16.150 of this chapter, or the indemnification/bond requirement imposed pursuant to 9.16.120 of this chapter if a nonprofit organization sponsors or co-sponsors the special event with the city or other public agency, or if the primary purpose of the event is First Amendment expression and the cost of paying the fees, posting a bond, or entering into an indemnification agreement is or may be so financially burdensome that it would constitute an unreasonable burden on the exercise of rights protected by the First Amendment. 
C.  All appeals and/or requests for waivers shall be filed with the city clerk no later than five days following the notice of decision by the city administrator. 
D.  Any hearing before the city council shall be held, and final decision rendered, no later than fifteen calendar days following the appeal filing.

B.  Notwithstanding Subsection A. of this section, the city administrator shall not withhold the issuance of a permit if the applicant has requested a waiver from the city council pursuant to Section 9.16.100 for a special event in which the primary purpose is First Amendment expression. In such cases, a permit shall be issued that is conditioned on the applicant's compliance with the city council's fee determination prior to the event. 
(Ord. No. 171-09, § 1, 11-4-2009)  
9.16.120 - Indemnification agreement. 
Prior to the issuance of a permit, the applicant shall execute an agreement to reimburse the city for all the costs and expenses that the city incurs as a result of the event, insofar as permitted by law. The agreement shall provide that the applicant agrees to defend, protect, indemnify and hold the city, its officers, employees and agents, free and harmless from and against any and all claims, damages, expenses, loss or liability of any kind or nature whatsoever arising out of, or resulting from, the alleged acts or omissions of applicant, its officers, agents or employees, in connection with the permitted event or activity. 
(Ord. No. 171-09, § 1, 11-4-2009)

The insurance policy shall also be endorsed to state that coverage shall not be suspended, voided, cancelled or terminated by either party, reduced in coverage or in limits except after thirty days prior written notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, has been given to the city; and 
2.  In addition to any other remedy the city may have, if the permittee fails to maintain the insurance coverage as required in this section, the city may, in its sole and absolute discretion, obtain such insurance coverage that the permittee fails to maintain in a form and amount substantially the same as is required herein. The permittee shall be required to reimburse the city for such insurance prior to the next event held pursuant to its annual permit. 
D.  The city administrator shall approve all deductibles on the policy. 
E.  The requirement as to types, limits, and the city's approval of insurance coverage that the permittee maintains are not intended to, and shall not in any manner, limit or qualify the liabilities and obligations that the permittee assumes pursuant to this chapter. 
F.  A copy of the policy or a certificate of insurance, together with all necessary endorsements, must be filed with the city administrator no less than ten days before the date of the event, unless the city administrator, for good cause, waives the filing deadline.

B.  If following the initial review, the issuing agency is satisfied that the violation did not occur, that the registered owner was not responsible for the violation, or that extenuating circumstances make dismissal of the citation appropriate in the interest of justice, the issuing agency shall cancel the notice of violation or notice of delinquent violation. The issuing agency shall advise the processing agency, if any, of the cancellation. The issuing agency or the processing agency shall mail the results of the initial review to the person contesting the notice, and, if following that review, cancellation of the notice does not occur, include a reason for that denial, notification of the ability to request an administrative hearing, and notice of the procedure for waiving prepayment of the penalty based upon an inability to pay.

(Ord. No. 215-16, § 3, 2-17-2016)  
10.33.110 - Hearing procedural matters and conduct. 
A.  The administrative hearing procedure shall include the following: 
1.  The person requesting the hearing shall have the choice of a hearing by mail or in person. An in-person hearing shall be conducted within the jurisdiction of the issuing agency. If an issuing agency contracts with an administrative provider, hearings shall be held within the jurisdiction of the issuing agency or within the county of the issuing agency. 
2.  If the person requesting the hearing is a minor, that person shall be permitted to appear at a hearing or admit responsibility for the parking violation without the necessity of the appointment of a guardian. The processing agency may proceed against the minor in the same manner as an adult. 
3.  The hearing shall provide an independent, objective, fair and impartial review of contested parking violations. 
4.  The officer issuing the citation shall not be required to appear at the hearing. The contestant shall appear at the hearing, unless a hearing by mail has been designated by the contestant in the hearing request form. If the contestant does not appear at the hearing, the contest shall be decided by the hearing officer based on the citation, the record of the administrative review, and any other relevant material in the record, taking into account the reasons specified by the contestant in the hearing request form. 
5.  The hearing officer shall write pertinent information into the record during the in-person hearing. The hearing record, and any supporting documentation will remain with the case file. If the contestant appeals the hearing officer's decision to the court, the entire case file will be forwarded to the court. The hearing records for those cases not appealed to the court will be retained by the city per the city's record retention policy. 
6.  At the commencement of the hearing, the hearing officer shall: 
a.  Make a pre-hearing statement, briefly explaining the nature of the civil proceedings, the manner of conducting the hearing and the limits on the introduction of evidence, the process of rendering a decision, the effects of the decision in terms of collection remedies available to the city, the right of the contestant to appear to the court for a de novo hearing, and any other matters in the hearing officer's discretion; 
b.  Read the citation into the record; 
c.  Administer an oath to the contestant and any prospective witnesses; 
d.  Record the name and address of the contestant; and 
e.  Write the registered owner's name and address; and the contestant's relationship to the registered owner, if applicable. 
7.  Proof requirements - validity of citation for the issuing agency will be as follows: 
a.  The issuing agency bears the burden of proof, by a preponderance of the evidence that the citation meets statutory requirements for validity. 
b.  If the parking citation, or a copy thereof, contains all of the items specified in California Vehicle Code Section 40202 and if the issuing agency has included in the record the information received from the DMV identifying the registered owner of the vehicle, the citation and such information shall be prima facie evidence of the facts contained therein, and of the parking violation. The issuing agency shall not be required to produce any other information in order to establish the parking violation. 
c.  If the non-property citation, or a copy thereof, contains all of the items specified in Subsection 10.33.040.C, such information shall be prima facie evidence of the facts contained therein, and of the non-property violation. 
d.  The contestant may introduce credible relevant rebuttal evidence relating to the validity of the citation. 
8.  Proof requirements - contestant's defenses will be as follows: 
a.  The contestant bears the burden of proof, by a preponderance of the evidence, that although the citation is facially valid, a viable defense exists which would preclude the contestant's liability for the penalty, or that a viable defense exists which would limit the contestant's liability for late payment penalties. 
b.  Non-receipt of the notice of violation itself, if based on sufficient credible evidence, may constitute a defense to late payment penalties based on nonpayment of the notice of violation, however, is not a defense to late response to the notice of delinquent parking violation. The defense of non-receipt of the notice of violation is not available to the registered owner, where the person operating the vehicle at the time of the citation was not the registered owner. Clear proof of timely payment of the citation is a defense to late payment penalties. 
c.  Defenses relating to the merits of the citation must be established by the contestant by credible evidence. Such defenses may include, but are not limited to, signage matters (missing, obscured or defaced signs), where the contestant demonstrates that it was impossible for him or her to become aware of the applicable parking restrictions; of the exercise of due diligence in efforts to replace the permit or placard; mechanical breakdown of the vehicle, where the vehicle was not illegally parked prior to the breakdown, where the violation in fact results from the breakdown and reasonable steps were taken to remove the vehicle prior to the occurrence of the violation. Personal reasons, inconvenience, lack of funds, forgetfulness, failure to observe signs, lack of available parking elsewhere, lack of knowledge of the applicable restrictions, and similar or related matters are not under any circumstances a defense to liability for the parking penalties. No defense which was not included in the statement of reasons contained in the contestant's appeal hearing request will be considered. 
9.  The rules of evidence for civil court proceedings shall not apply in hearings conducted pursuant to this procedure. Evidence relevant to the issues raised by the contestant's statement of reasons, and to the validity of the citation itself under California Vehicle Code Section 40202, will be received. Determinations of credibility of evidence are committed to the sound discretion of the hearing officer. 
10.  Other than the citation and the DMV information, the hearing officer shall receive into the record the issuing agency's record from the administrative review, together with relevant testimony, documentation and other material which is submitted by a party. Credibility determinations, together with determinations as to the weight to be assigned to evidence, are committed to the sound discretion of the hearing officer. The hearing officer, may, but is not required to, admit evidence in the form of declarations of witnesses, submitted by the contestant. Such declarations shall not be admitted unless presented in the form required for statements under California Code of Civil Procedure Section 2015.5, and shall contain the statements required by California Code of Civil Procedure 437c(d). 
11.  The contestant may present witnesses in support of the contestant's contentions. The hearing officer, after conducting the initial procedures of the hearing, may exclude witnesses until their turn to testify occurs. The hearing officer may limit the number of witnesses in the interest of preventing cumulative or repetitive testimony. 
12.  The hearing officer may conduct such cross-examination of the contestant or any witness, as in the hearing officer's sole and exclusive discretion is warranted under all of the circumstances. 
13.  The hearing officer shall make a decision on liability for the parking penalties based on the testimony and other evidence in the record. 
14.  The hearing officer shall enter the disposition on the hearing record, and enter the total amount of the parking penalties. The decision, including the rationale therefor, shall be placed in written form. 
15.  The decision may be personally delivered to the contestant by the hearing officer but a written decision shall be sent to the contestant via first-class mail for the record. 
16.  The decision shall be the final decision of the city. The decision shall set forth the time limits for the contestant to file for judicial review in the Colusa County Superior Court, and a notice that if no such review is sought within the applicable time limitation, the decision shall be final for all purposes. 
(Ord. No. 215-16, § 3, 2-17-2016)  
10.33.120 - Hearing officer's decision. 
A.  The hearing officer's decision following the administrative hearing may be personally delivered to the person by the hearing officer or sent by first-class mail, and, if the notice is not cancelled, include a written reason for that denial. If the administrative citation is upheld, the fine amount on deposit with the city shall be retained by the city. 
B.  Following a determination by the hearing officer that a person has committed the violation, the hearing officer may, consistent with the written guidelines established by the issuing agency, allow payment of the parking penalty in installments, or an issuing agency may allow for deferred payment or allow for payments in installments, if the person provides evidence satisfactory to the hearing officer or the issuing agency, as the case may be, of an inability to pay the parking penalty in full. 
C.  If the hearing officer determines the administrative citation should be canceled or reduced and the fine was deposited with the city, then the city shall promptly refund the amount of the deposited fine or excess, as the case may be, together with interest at the average rate earned on the city's investment portfolio for the period of time that the fine amount was held by the city. 
(Ord. No. 215-16, § 3, 2-17-2016)  
10.33.130 - Recovery of administrative citation parking fines and costs. 
A.  The city may collect any past due administrative citation fine or late payment penalty and interest by use of all available legal means. Without limiting the generality of the forgoing, all such fines or late payments shall constitute civil debts and may be recovered in an action at law. 
B.  The city may file an itemization of unpaid parking penalties and service fees with the department of motor vehicles for collection with the registration of the vehicle pursuant to Vehicle Code Section 4760 or proceed under one of the options available per Vehicle Code Sections 40220, 40221 or 40222 in order to collect an unpaid parking penalty. 
(Ord. No. 215-16, § 3, 2-17-2016)  
10.33.140 - Right to judicial review. 
A.  Within thirty calendar days after the mailing or personal delivery of the final decision described in Subsection 10.33.120.A, the contestant may seek review by filing an appeal to be heard by the superior court where the same shall be heard de novo, except that the contents of the processing agency's file in the case shall be received in evidence. A copy of the notice of violation or, if the citation was issued electronically, a true and correct abstract containing the information set forth in the notice of violation shall be admitted into evidence as prima facie evidence of the facts stated therein. A copy of the notice of appeal shall be served in person or by first-class mail upon the processing agency by the contestant. For purposes of computing the thirty-calendar-day period, Section 1013 of the Code of Civil Procedure shall be applicable. A proceeding under this subdivision is a limited civil case. 
B.  The fee for filing the notice of appeal is as provided in Section 70615 of the Government Code. The court shall request that the processing agency's file on the case be forwarded to the court, to be received within fifteen calendar days of the request. The court shall notify the contestant of the appearance date by mail or personal delivery. The court shall retain the fee under Section 70615 of the Government Code regardless of the outcome of the appeal. If the court finds in favor of the contestant, the amount of the fee shall be reimbursed to the contestant by the processing agency. Any deposit of parking penalty shall be refunded by the processing agency in accordance with the judgment of the court. 
C.  The conduct of the appeal under this section is a subordinate judicial duty that may be performed by traffic trial commissioners and other subordinate judicial officials at the direction of the presiding judge of the court. 
D.  If notice of appeal of the processing agency's decision is filed within the period set forth in Subsection A, the decision shall be deemed final. 
E.  If the parking penalty has not been deposited and the decision is against the contestant, the processing agency shall, after the decision becomes final, proceed to collect the penalty pursuant to Section 10.33.130.

13.08.390 - Pretreatment of wastewater. 
A.  All pretreatment systems or devices required by this chapter or any permit issued under this chapter shall be approved by the city engineer and must meet the standards of this section, but such approval shall not absolve the discharger of the responsibility of meeting any effluent limitation required by the city. All pretreatment systems judged by the city engineer to require engineering design shall have plans prepared and signed by an engineer of suitable discipline licensed in the state of California. 
B.  This chapter refers to and enforces the pretreatment standards established by the federal Environmental Protection Agency pursuant to Section 107(b) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act Amendments of 1972. 
C.  Normally, a gravity separation interceptor, equalizing tank, neutralization chamber and control manhole will be required, respectively, to remove prohibited settleable and floatable solids, to equalize wastewater streams varying greatly in quantity and/or quality, to neutralize low or high pH flow and to facilitate inspection, flow measurement and sampling. 
D.  Floor drains from commercial or manufacturing buildings, warehouses or multi-use structures shall not discharge directly to the sewer, but shall first discharge to a gravity separation interceptor. 
E.  Grease, oil, and sand interceptors shall be provided by the waste discharger when, in the opinion of the city engineer, they are necessary for the proper handling of liquid wastes containing grease in excessive amounts, or any flammable wastes, sand, or other harmful ingredients. All interceptors shall be of a type and capacity approved by the city engineer, and shall be so located as to be readily and easily accessible for cleaning and inspection. 
(Ord. 67-91 § 4(part), 1991).  
13.08.400 - General. 
A.  The design and construction of all sewers, connections to sewers, pretreatment facilities and appurtenances which are directly or indirectly connected to the sewer system shall be in accordance with all state laws, city ordinances, standard specifications, and in accordance with generally accepted engineering and construction practices. Any public works to be constructed shall be designed by a properly licensed engineer licensed to practice in California and a licensed contractor. 
B.  Separate sewer connections are required for each separate building whether or not such building is on the same or a different lot or parcel of land. Exceptions may be made by city administrator where several single family, multi-family, commercial or industrial units are constructed within several buildings on the same parcel of land, where the city administrator determines that such land can be adequately served by a single private sewer main. If the land is later divided, then separate laterals shall be provided for each building or several buildings on each separate parcel of land or for each air space unit unless the private sewer main has been legally made the responsibility of the property or unit owner(s). Such property owner or owners association will be responsible for construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair, of the private sewer main. Such private sewer main shall be connected to the city sewer main at a single location, and a manhole or clean out shall be provided on the private main at or near the point of connection with the city sewer system, normally near the property line. All such private sewer mains and all such laterals thereto shall be installed at the expense of the property owner or developer. The property owner will be responsible for construction, reconstruction, maintenance and repair. For private sewer mains, the property owner or owners association shall apply for, and be responsible for a single billing for the service. Where such connections preexist these regulations, they must be permitted until sale of the parcel, at which time a separate lateral sewer shall be provided for the sold parcel. 
C.  Old lateral sewers may be used in connection with new buildings only when they are found, upon examination and test by the city administrator, to meet all requirements of this chapter and the standard specifications. 
D.  In all buildings in which any sewer is too low to permit gravity flow to the public sewer, sanitary wastewater carried by such building sewer shall be lifted by artificial means, approved by the city administrator and discharged to the public sewer at the expense of the owner. Adequate backflow prevention devices shall be installed by the applicant. 
E.  The connection of the building sewer into the public sewer shall be made at the lateral or "T" branch, if such lateral "T" branch is available at a suitable location. Where no properly located "T" branch is available, a neat hole may be cut into the public sewer to receive the building or lateral sewer, with entry in the downstream direction at an angle of forty-five degrees. A wye saddle shall be used for the connection and in no case shall the pipe protrude inside the main sewer. A smooth, neat joint shall be made, and the connection made secure and watertight, including by encasement in concrete, if so determined by the engineer. The connection to the public sewer shall be made in the presence of the city engineer and under his supervision and direction. Any cutting of sewer mains shall be done only by city personnel, cost borne by applicant. Any damage to the sewer system shall be repaired at the cost of the applicant to the satisfaction of the city administrator. All excavations for a lateral sewer installation shall be adequately guarded with barricades or lights so as to protect the public from hazard. Streets, sidewalks, parkways and other property damaged in the course of the work shall be restored in a manner satisfactory to the city administrator. 
F.  For buildings which require a pretreatment system or device, all domestic or sanitary wastewater from restrooms, showers, drinking fountains, kitchen area, etc., shall be kept separate from all industrial wastewater until the industrial wastewater have passed through any required pretreatment system or device. A control manhole of a design approved by the city engineer shall be furnished and installed by certain designated industrial wastewater dischargers to facilitate inspection, sampling and flow measurements by personnel of the city. This control manhole shall be located off the industrial premise or if within plant fence, a special locked gate provided, with keys to the gate lock given to the city. Unrestricted access to this control manhole shall be available to authorized personnel of the city at all times. The control manhole may be used as a junction manhole for domestic wastewater and industrial wastes provided the junction occurs downstream of the sampling or flow measuring point. 
G.  Each discharger shall provide protection from accidental discharge of prohibited materials or other wastes regulated by this chapter. Where necessary, or as directed by the city administrator, retention basins, dikes, storage tanks or other devices designed to eliminate, neutralize, offset or otherwise negate the effects of prohibited materials or waste discharges in violation of this chapter shall be installed. 
H.  Lateral sewers shall be maintained by the owner of the property served from the building being served up to the front property line, providing a cleanout accessible to maintenance forces is available. If not available the owner shall maintain the lateral to its connection to the public main. 
I.  All lateral sewers shall be tested by means approved by the city engineer, in the presence of the city engineer. All lines showing excessive leakage shall be repaired or replaced at the expense of the person doing the work and shall be done at the direction and to the satisfaction of the city engineer. 
(Ord. 67-91 § 4(part), 1991).  
13.08.410 - Wastewater sampling. 
A.  Any person discharging under an industrial wastewater discharge permit shall annually or at such other periodic intervals specified in the permit make measurements of flow rates, flow volume, COD, BOD, grease and nonfilterable residue, and such measurements of other constituents believed necessary or appropriate by the city administrator, unless specifically relieved of such obligation by the city administrator. All sampling, analyses and flow measurements of industrial wastewater shall be performed by a state certified independent laboratory or by a laboratory of the industrial discharger approved by the city administrator. If performed by city's personnel, an appropriate charge shall be paid by the discharger requesting the tests. Prior to submittal to the city of data developed in the laboratory of an industrial discharger, the results shall be verified by a responsible administrative official of the industrial discharger under the penalty of perjury. 
B.  All wastewater analyses shall be conducted in accordance with the appropriate procedure contained in Standard Methods. If no appropriate procedure is contained therein, the standard procedure of the industry or a procedure judged satisfactory by the city administrator. Any independent laboratory or discharger performing tests shall furnish any required test data or information on the test methods or equipment used, if requested to do so by the city administrator. 
C.  All dischargers making periodic measurements shall furnish and install at the control manhole or other appropriate location a calibrated flume, weir, flow meter, or similar device approved by the city engineer and suitable to measure the industrial wastewater flow rate and total volume. A flow indicating, recording and totalizing register may be required by the city engineer. In lieu of wastewater flow measurements, the city engineer may accept records of water usage and adjust the flow volumes by suitable factors to determine peak and average flow rates for the specific industrial wastewater discharge. 
D.  The sampling, analysis and flow measurement procedures, equipment and results shall be subject at any time to inspection by the city. Sampling and flow measurement facilities shall be such as to provide safe access to city personnel. 
E.  The minimum requirement for such periodic measurements shall be at least one twenty-four hour measurement per year. Representative samples of the industrial wastewater shall be obtained at least once per hour over the twenty-four hour period, properly refrigerated, composited according to measured flow rates during the twenty-four hours and analyzed for the specific wastewater constituents. Dischargers required to sample on only a few days per year shall sample during the period of highest wastewater flow and wastewater constituent discharges. Industrial plants with large fluctuations in quantity or quality of wastewater may be required to provide continuous sampling and analyses for every working day. When required by the city administrator, dischargers shall install and maintain in proper order, automatic flow-proportional sampling equipment and/or automatic analysis and recording equipment. 
(Ord. 67-91 § 4(part), 1991).  
13.08.420 - Accidental discharges. 
A.  Dischargers shall notify the city administrator immediately when there is any accidental discharges of wastes in violation of this chapter or any permit issued under this chapter so that countermeasures may be taken by the city to minimize damage to the sewer system. Such notification will not relieve dischargers of liability for any expense, loss or damage to the sewer system, or for any fines imposed on the city on account thereof by any state or federal regulatory agencies. 
B.  In the event of accidental discharge in violation of this chapter, the discharger shall furnish the city administrator, within fifteen days of the date of occurrence, a detailed written statement describing the causes of the accidental discharge and the measures being taken to prevent future occurrence. 
C.  In order that employees of industrial dischargers be more fully informed of city requirements, copies of these regulations shall be permanently posted on bulletin boards of dischargers together with the industrial wastewater discharge permit and such other industrial wastes information and notices which may be furnished by the city from time to time directed toward more effective water pollution control.

Former Ch. 15.30, §§ 15.30.010—15.30.240, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from: Ord. 37-87, ;s 3(part), 1987; Ord. 107-98, §§ 2—8, 1998; and Ord. No. 132-03, § 2, 2003. 
 
15.30.010 - Statutory authorization. 
The Legislature of the State of California has in Government Code Sections 65302, 65560, and 65800 conferred upon local governments the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City Council of the City of Williams, California does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations. 
(Ord. No. 190-12, § 1(exh. A), 2-15-2012)  
15.30.020 - Findings of fact. 
A.  The flood hazard areas of the City of Williams are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
B.  These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities also contributes to flood losses. 
(Ord. No. 190-12, § 1(exh. A), 2-15-2012)  
15.30.030 - Statement of purpose. 
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by legally enforceable regulations applied uniformly throughout the community to all publicly and privately owned land within flood-prone, mudslide [i.e., mudflow] or flood-related erosion areas. These regulations are designed to: 
A.  Protect human life and health; 
B.  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
C.  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
D.  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
E.  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
F.  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage; 
G.  Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and 
H.  Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. 
(Ord. No. 190-12, § 1(exh. A), 2-15-2012)  
15.30.040 - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes regulations to: 
A.  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities; 
B.  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
C.  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel floodwaters; 
D.  Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
E.  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas.

"Flood boundary and floodway map (FBFM)" means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the floodway. 
"Flood insurance rate map (FIRM)" means the official map on which the Federal Emergency Management Agency or Federal Insurance Administration has delineated both the areas of special flood hazards and the risk premium zones applicable to the community. 
"Flood insurance study" means the official report provided by the Federal Insurance Administration that includes flood profiles, the flood insurance rate map, the flood boundary and floodway map, and the water surface elevation of the base flood. 
"Flood-related erosion" means the collapse or subsidence of land along the shore of a lake or other body of water as a result of undermining caused by waves or currents of water exceeding anticipated cyclical level or suddenly caused by an unusually high water level in a natural body of water, accompanied by a severe storm, or by an unanticipated force of nature, such as a flash flood or an abnormal tidal surge, or by some similarly unusually and unforeseeable event which results in flooding. 
"Flood-related erosion area" or "flood-related, erosion-prone area" means a land area adjoining the shore of a lake or other body of water, which due to the composition of the shoreline or bank and high water levels or wind-driven currents, is likely to suffer flood-related erosion damage. 
"Flood-related erosion area management" means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood-related erosion damage, including but not limited to, emergency preparedness plans, flood-related erosion control works, and floodplain management regulations. 
"Floodplain or flood-prone area" means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source - See "Flooding." 
"Floodplain administrator" is the community official designated by title to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations. 
"Floodplain management" means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to, emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans. 
"Floodplain management regulations" means this chapter and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other application of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state or local regulations in any combination thereof which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. 
"Floodproofing" means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents. For guidelines on dry and wet floodproofing, see FEMA Technical Bulletins TB 1-93, TB 3-93, and TB 7-93.

"Floodway fringe" is that area of the floodplain on either side of the "regulatory floodway" where encroachment may be permitted. 
"Fraud and victimization" as related to Section 15.30.270 of this chapter, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the City Council of the City of Williams will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty to one hundred years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates. 
"Functionally dependent use" means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking facilities, port facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers, and ship building and ship repair facilities, and does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities.

"Hardship" as related to Section 15.30.270 of this chapter means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The City Council of the City of Williams requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. 
"Highest adjacent grade" means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
"Historic structure" means any structure that is: 
1.  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register;

d.  The standards for utilities in Section 15.30.180. 
"Manufactured home" means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle". 
"Manufactured home park or subdivision" means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
"Market value" shall be determined by estimating the cost to replace the structure in new condition and adjusting that cost figure by the amount of depreciation which has accrued since the structure was constructed. 
1.  The cost of replacement of the structure shall be based on a square foot cost factor determined by reference to a building cost estimating guide recognized by the building construction industry. 
2.  The amount of depreciation shall be determined by taking into account the age and physical deterioration of the structure and functional obsolescence as approved by the floodplain administrator, but shall not include economic or other forms of external obsolescence. 
Use of replacement costs or accrued depreciation factors different from those contained in recognized building cost estimating guides may be considered only if such factors are included in a report prepared by an independent professional appraiser and supported by a written explanation of the differences. 
"Mean sea level" means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, North American Vertical Datum (NAVD) of 1988, or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a community's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
"Mudslide" describes a condition where there is a river, flow or inundation of liquid mud down a hillside, usually as a result of a dual condition of loss of brush cover and the subsequent accumulation of water on the ground, preceded by a period of unusually heavy or sustained rain. 
"Mudslide (i.e., mudflow) prone area" means an area with land surfaces and slopes of unconsolidated material where the history, geology, and climate indicate a potential for mudflow.

"Remedy a violation" means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with state or local floodplain management regulations, or if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structure or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of this chapter or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing state or federal financial exposure with regard to the structure or other development. 
"Riverine" means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc. 
"Sheet flow area" - See "Area of shallow flooding." 
"Special flood hazard area (SFHA)" means an area in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. It is shown on an FHBM or FIRM as zone A, AO, A1-A30, AE, A99, or, AH. 
"Start of construction" includes substantial improvement and other proposed new development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty days from the date of the permit. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufacture home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
"Structure" means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground; this includes a gas or liquid storage tank or a manufactured home.

2.  Flood-related damages sustained by a structure on two separate occasions during a ten-year period for which the cost of repairs at the time of each such event, on the average, equals or exceeds twenty-five percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. This is also known as "repetitive loss." 
"Substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the "start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage", regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
1.  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations or state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
2.  Any alteration of a "historic structure," provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a "historic structure." 
"Variance" means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter. 
"Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided.

(Ord. No. 190-12, § 1(exh. A), 2-15-2012)  
15.30.130 - Designation of the floodplain administrator. 
The city administrator is hereby appointed to administer, implement, and enforce this chapter by granting or denying development permits in accord with its provisions. 
(Ord. No. 190-12, § 1(exh. A), 2-15-2012)  
15.30.140 - Duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator. 
The duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator shall include, but not be limited to the following: 
A.  Permit review. Review all development permits to determine: 
1.  Permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied, including determination of substantial improvement and substantial damage of existing structures; 
2.  All other required state and federal permits have been obtained; 
3.  The site is reasonably safe from flooding; 
4.  The proposed development does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a floodway has not been designated. This means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the City of Williams; and 
5.  All letters of map revision (LOMR's) for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMR's). Approved CLOMR's allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the "start of construction" definition. 
B.  Development of substantial improvement and substantial damage procedures. 
1.  Using FEMA publication FEMA 213, "Answers to Questions About Substantially Damaged Buildings," develop detailed procedures for identifying and administering requirements for substantial improvement and substantial damage, to include defining "market value." 
2.  Assure procedures are coordinated with other departments/divisions and implemented by community staff. 
C.  Review, use and development of other base flood data. When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Section 15.30.070, the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or state agency, or other source, in order to administer Sections 15.30.170 through 15.30.240. 
NOTE: A base flood elevation shall be obtained using one of two methods from the FEMA publication, FEMA 265, "Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A Areas - A Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base (100-year) Flood Elevations", dated July 1995. 
D.  Notification of other agencies. 
1.  Alteration or relocation of a watercourse: 
a.  Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of Water Resources prior to alteration or relocation; 
b.  Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency; and 
c.  Assure that the flood-carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained. 
2.  Base flood elevation changes due to physical alterations: 
a.  Within six months of information becoming available or project completion, whichever comes first, the floodplain administrator shall submit or assure that the permit applicant submits technical or scientific data to FEMA for a letter of map revision (LOMR). 
b.  All LOMR's for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMR's). Approved CLOMR's allow construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the "start of construction" definition. 
Such submissions are necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain management requirements are based on current data. 
3.  Changes in corporate boundaries: Notify FEMA in writing whenever the corporate boundaries have been modified by annexation or other means and include a copy of a map of the community clearly delineating the new corporate limits. 
E.  Documentation of floodplain development. Obtain and maintain for public inspection and make available as needed the following: 
1.  Certification required by Subsection 15.30.170.C.1 and Section 15.30.200 (lowest floor elevations); 
2.  Certification required by Subsection 15.30.170.C.2 (elevation or floodproofing of nonresidential structures); 
3.  Certification required by Subsections 15.30.170.C.3 (wet floodproofing standard); 
4.  Certification of elevation required by Subsection 15.30.190.A.3 (subdivisions and other proposed development standards); 
5.  Certification required by Subsection 15.30.220.B (floodway encroachments); and 
6.  Maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
F.  Map determination. Make interpretations where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in Section 15.30.160. 
G.  Remedial action. Take action to remedy violations of this chapter as specified in Section 15.30.080. 
H.  Biennial report. Complete and submit biennial report to FEMA. 
I.  Planning. Assure community's general plan is consistent with floodplain management objectives herein. 
J.  Nonconversion of enclosed areas below the lowest floor. To ensure that the areas below the BFE shall be used solely for parking vehicles, limited storage, or access to the building and not be finished for use as human habitation without first becoming fully compliant with the floodplain management ordinance in effect at the time of conversion, the floodplain administrator shall: 
1.  Determine which applicants for new construction and/or substantial improvements have fully enclosed areas below the lowest floor that are five feet or higher; 
2.  Enter into a "nonconversion agreement for construction within flood hazard areas" or equivalent with the City of Williams. The agreement shall be recorded with the Colusa County Recorder as a deed restriction. The nonconversion agreement shall be in a form acceptable to the floodplain administrator and county counsel; and 
3.  Have the authority to inspect any area of a structure below the base flood elevation to ensure compliance upon prior notice of at least seventy-two hours. 
(Ord. No. 190-12, § 1(exh. A), 2-15-2012)

"Accessory structures" used solely for parking (two-car detached garages or smaller) or limited storage (small, low-cost sheds), as defined in Section 15.30.050, may be constructed such that its floor is below the base flood elevation (BFE), provided the structure is designed and constructed in accordance with the following requirements: 
a)  Use of the accessory structure must be limited to parking or limited storage; 
b)  The portions of the accessory structure located below the BFE must be built using flood-resistant materials; 
c)  The accessory structure must be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse and lateral movement; 
d)  Any mechanical and utility equipment in the accessory structure must be elevated or floodproofed to or above the BFE; 
e)  The accessory structure must comply with floodplain encroachment provisions in Section 15.30.220; and 
f)  The accessory structure must be designed to allow for the automatic entry of floodwaters in accordance with Subsection 15.30.170.C.3. 
2.  Detached garages and accessory structures not meeting the above standards must be constructed in accordance with all applicable standards in Section 15.30.170. 
6.  Crawl space construction. This subsection applies to buildings with crawl spaces up to two feet below grade. Below grade crawl space construction in accordance with the requirements listed below will not be considered basements. 
a.  The building must be designed and adequately anchored to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy. Crawl space construction is not allowed in areas with flood velocities greater than five feet per second unless the design is reviewed by a qualified design professional, such as a registered architect or professional engineer; 
b.  The crawl space is an enclosed area below the BFE and, as such, must have openings that equalize hydrostatic pressures by allowing for the automatic entry and exit of floodwaters. For guidance on flood openings, see FEMA Technical Bulletin 1-93; 
c.  Crawl space construction is not permitted in V zones. Open pile or column foundations that withstand storm surge and wave forces are required in V zones; 
d.  Portions of the building below the BFE must be constructed with materials resistant to flood damage. This includes not only the foundation walls of the crawl space used to elevate the building, but also any joists, insulation, or other materials that extend below the BFE; and 
e.  Any building utility systems within the crawl space must be elevated above BFE or designed so that floodwaters cannot enter or accumulate within the system components during flood conditions. 
f.  Requirements for all below grade crawl space construction, in addition to the above requirements, to include the following: 
1.  The interior grade of a crawl space below the BFE must not be more than two feet below the lowest adjacent exterior grade (LAG), shown as D in figure 3 of Technical Bulletin 11-01; 
2.  The height of the below grade crawl space, measured from the interior grade of the crawl space to the top of the crawl space foundation wall must not exceed four feet (shown as L in figure 3 of Technical Bulletin 11-01) at any point; 
3.  There must be an adequate drainage system that removes floodwaters from the interior area of the crawl space within a reasonable period of time after a flood event, not to exceed seventy-two hours; and 
4.  The velocity of floodwaters at the site should not exceed five feet per second for any crawl space. For velocities in excess of five feet per second, other foundation types should be used. 
(Ord. No. 190-12, § 1(exh. A), 2-15-2012)  
15.30.180 - Standards for utilities.

(Ord. No. 190-12, § 1(exh. A), 2-15-2012)  
15.30.200 - Standards for manufactured homes. 
A.  All manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved, on sites located: (1) outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision; (2) in a new manufactured home park or subdivision; (3) in an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision; or (4) in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision upon which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, shall: 
1.  Within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's flood insurance rate map, be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest floor of the manufactured home is elevated two feet above the base flood elevation and be securely fastened to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
B.  All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the community's flood insurance rate map that are not subject to the provisions of Subsection A, will be securely fastened to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, and be elevated so that either the: 
1.  Lowest floor of the manufactured home is at least two feet above the base flood elevation; or 
2.  Manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than thirty-six inches in height above grade. 
Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest floor including basement shall be certified by a registered civil engineer or licensed land surveyor, and verified by the community building inspector to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator. 
(Ord. No. 190-12, § 1(exh. A), 2-15-2012)  
15.30.210 - Standards for recreational vehicles. 
A.  All recreational vehicles placed in zones A1-30, AH, and AE will either: 
1.  Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty consecutive days; or

3.  Meet the permit requirements of Section 15.30.150 of this chapter and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes in Subsection 15.30.200.A. 
(Ord. No. 190-12, § 1(exh. A), 2-15-2012)  
15.30.220 - Floodways. 
Since floodways are an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply: 
A.  Until a regulatory floodway is adopted, no new construction, substantial development, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within zones A1-30 and AE, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the City of Williams. 
B.  Within an adopted regulatory floodway, the City of Williams shall prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvements, and other development, unless certification by a registered civil engineer is provided demonstrating that the proposed encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
C.  If Subsections 15.30.220.A and B are satisfied, all new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Sections 15.30.170 through 15.30.240. 
(Ord. No. 190-12, § 1(exh. A), 2-15-2012)  
15.30.230 - Mudslide (i.e., mudflow) prone areas. 
A.  The floodplain administrator shall review permits for proposed construction of other development to determine if it is proposed within a mudslide area. 
B.  Permits shall be reviewed to determine that the proposed site and improvement will be reasonably safe from mudslide hazards. Factors to be considered in making this determination include, but are not limited to: 
1.  The type and quality of soils; 
2.  Evidence of groundwater or surface water problems; 
3.  Depth and quality of any fill; 
4.  Overall slope of the site; and 
5.  Weight that any proposed development will impose on the slope. 
C.  Within areas which may have mudslide hazards, the floodplain administrator shall require: 
1.  A site investigation and further review by persons qualified in geology and soils engineering; 
2.  The proposed grading, excavation, new construction, and substantial improvement be adequately designed and protected against mudslide damages; 
3.  The proposed grading, excavations, new construction, and substantial improvement not aggravate the existing hazard by creating either on-site or off-site disturbances; and 
4.  Drainage, planting, watering, and maintenance not endanger slope stability. 
(Ord. No. 190-12, § 1(exh. A), 2-15-2012)  
15.30.240 - Flood-related erosion-prone area. 
A.  The floodplain administrator shall require permits for proposed construction and other development within all flood-related erosion-prone areas known to the community. 
B.  Permit applications shall be reviewed to determine whether the proposed site alterations and improvements will be reasonably safe from flood-related erosion, and will not cause flood-related erosion hazards or otherwise aggravate the existing hazard. 
C.  If a proposed improvement is found to be in the path of flood-related erosion or would increase the erosion hazard, such improvement shall be relocated or adequate protective measures shall be taken to avoid aggravating the existing erosion hazard. 
D.  Within zone E on the flood insurance rate map, a setback is required for all new development from the ocean, lake, bay, riverfront or other body of water to create a safety buffer consisting of a natural vegetative or contour strip. This buffer shall be designated according to the flood-related erosion hazard and erosion rate, in relation to the anticipated "useful life" of structures, and depending upon the geologic, hydrologic, topographic, and climatic characteristics of the land. The buffer may be used for suitable open space purposes, such as for agricultural, forestry, outdoor recreation and wildlife habitat areas, and for other activities using temporary and portable structures only. 
(Ord. No. 190-12, § 1(exh. A), 2-15-2012)  
15.30.250 - Nature of variances. 
The issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only. Insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance. 
The variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners. 
It is the duty of the city council to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in this chapter are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. 
(Ord. No. 190-12, § 1(exh. A), 2-15-2012)  
15.30.260 - Conditions for variances. 
A.  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the procedures of Sections 15.30.130 through 15.30.240 of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
B.  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "historic structures" (as defined in Section 15.30.050 of this chapter) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
C.  Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
D.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the "minimum necessary" considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the city council need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the city council believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of this chapter. 
E.  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that: 
1.  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage; and 
2.  Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. It is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the Office of the County of Colusa Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land. 
F.  The floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(Ord. No. 190-12, § 1(exh. A), 2-15-2012)  
15.30.270 - Variance appeal board. 
A.  In passing upon requests for variances, the city council shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the: 
1.  Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
2.  Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
3.  Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property; 
4.  Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
5.  Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
6.  Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
7.  Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
8.  Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
9.  Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
10.  Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site; and 
11.  Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges. 
B.  Variances shall only be issued upon a: 
1.  Showing of good and sufficient cause; 
2.  Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional "hardship" to the applicant; and 
3.  Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance (see "Public safety and nuisance"), cause "fraud and victimization" of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
C.  Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of Subsections A through D are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance. 
D.  Upon consideration of the factors of Section 15.30.260 and the purposes of this chapter, the City of Williams may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

A.  The approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall confer a vested right to proceed with development in substantial compliance with the ordinances, policies, and standards described in California Government Code Section 66474.2. However, if Section 66474.2 of the California Government Code is repealed, the approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall confer a vested right to proceed with development in substantial compliance with the ordinances, policies, and standards in effect at the time the vesting tentative map is approved or conditionally approved. 
B.  Notwithstanding subsection A of this section, a permit, approval, extension, or entitlement may be made conditional or denied if any of the following are determined: 
1.  A failure to do so would place the residents of the subdivision or the immediate community, or both, in a condition dangerous to their health or safety, or both; 
2.  The condition or denial is required, in order to comply with state or federal law. 
C.  The rights referred to in this section shall expire if a final map is not approved prior to the expiration of the vesting tentative map as provided in Section 16.18.080. If the final map is approved, these rights shall last for the following periods of time: 
1.  An initial time period of one year from the date of recording of the final map. Where several final maps are recorded on various phases of a project covered by a single vesting tentative map, this initial time period shall begin for each phase when the final map for that phase is recorded.

(Ord. 24-86 § 1(part), 1986).  
16.18.100 - Development inconsistent with zoning—Conditional approval. 
A.  Whenever a subdivider files a vesting tentative map for a subdivision whose intended development is inconsistent with the zoning ordinance in existence at that time, that inconsistency shall be noted on the map. The city may deny such a vesting tentative map or approve it conditioned on the subdivider, or his or her designee, obtaining the necessary change in the zoning ordinance to eliminate the inconsistency. If the change in the zoning ordinance is obtained, the approved or conditionally approved vesting tentative map shall, notwithstanding Section 16.18.090A, confer the vested right to proceed with the development in substantial compliance with the change in the zoning ordinance and the map, as approved.

Chapter 16.36 - PARK AND RECREATION FACILITIES DEDICATION/FEE 
Sections: 
 
16.36.010 - Purpose and authority. 
This chapter is enacted pursuant to the authority granted by Section 66477 of the Government Code, and shall be implemented and construed in accordance with Section 66477. The park and recreational facilities for which dedication of land and/or payment of a fee is required by this chapter are in accordance with the recreation land use goal and policy of the general plan of the city. The continued increase in the development of residential dwelling units in the city, with the related increase in the population of the city, has created a need for updating the planning, acquisition, improvement and expansion of public parks, playgrounds and recreation facilities to serve the population of the city and the means of providing funds for such facilities. 
(Ord. 51-89 § 1(part), 1989).  
16.36.020 - Requirements. 
A.  As a condition of approval of a tentative subdivision map or parcel map, every residential developer or person who develops land for residential purposes shall dedicate a portion of such land, pay a fee in lieu thereof or a combination of both at the option of the city for the purpose of providing park and recreational facilities at the time and according to the standards and criteria contained in this chapter. 
B.  This chapter shall not apply to alterations or additions to an existing residential dwelling unit, provided such alteration or addition does not create an additional dwelling unit. 
(Ord. 139-05 § 2(part), 2005; Ord. 51-89 § 1(part), 1989).  
16.36.030 - General standard. 
It is found and determined that the public interest, convenience, health, welfare and safety require that five acres of property for each one thousand persons residing within the city be devoted to neighborhood and community parks. 
(Ord. 51-89 § 1(part), 1989).  
16.36.040 - Enforcement. 
The city administrator or his or her duly authorized representative shall be charged with the enforcement and implementation of this chapter. 
(Ord. 51-89 § 1(part), 1989).  
16.36.050 - Standards and formula for dedication of land. 
Where a park or recreational facility has been designated in the element of the general plan of the city, and is to be located in whole or in part within the proposed development to serve the immediate and future needs of the residents of the development, the developer shall dedicate land for a park and pay a fee for the development thereof. The amount of land to be provided shall be determined pursuant to the following standards and formula: 
A.  Area = 5.0 (D.F. × No. D.U.) 
1000 
B.  Definition of Terms. 
1.  "Area" means the area in acres required to be dedicated as park site. 
2.  "5.0" means park acreage standard obtained from Section 16.36.030. 
3.  "D.F." means population density factor obtained from Section 16.36.060. 
4.  "No. D.U." means number of residential dwelling units proposed in the development. 
C.  The developer shall, without credit, provide full street and utility improvements including, but not limited to, curbs, gutters, sidewalks, street paving, sewer, water and drainage improvements. The land to be dedicated and improvements to be made pursuant to this section shall be approved by the city. 
(Ord. 139-05 § 2(part), 2005; Ord. 51-89 § 1(part), 1989).  
16.36.060 - Population density factor. 
For purposes of this chapter, it is found and determined that the current density factor for the city is 3.03 persons per residential dwelling unit. As conditions in the city change over time, the city council by resolution may adjust the density factor to reflect such changes. 
(Ord. 51-89 § 1(part), 1989).  
16.36.070 - Formula for fees in lieu of land dedication. 
A.  General Formula. If there is no park and recreational facility designated in the city's general plan to be located in whole or in part within the proposed development, or if the proposed development contains fifty parcels of land or less, or if there is no site suitable to the city for a recreation facility in the development, the developer shall, in lieu of dedicating land, pay a fee equal to acquisition cost. Such fee is to be used for a park which will serve the residents of the area being developed. However, nothing in this section shall prohibit the dedication and acceptance of land for park and recreation purposes in developments of fifty parcels or less, where the developer proposed such dedication voluntarily and the land is acceptable to the city. 
B.  Fee = (5.0) (D.F.) (No. D.U.) × Cost 
1000 
C.  Definition of Terms. 
1.  "Fee" means the total amount of the fee for the development. 
2.  "5.0" means the park acreage standard obtained from Section 16.36.030. 
3.  "D.F." means the population density factor obtained from Section 16.36.060. 
4.  "No. D.U." means the number of residential dwelling units proposed in the development. 
5.  "Cost" means the park acquisition cost per acre obtained from Section 16.36.080. 
(Ord. 139-05 § 2(part), 2005; Ord. 51-89 § 1(part), 1989).  
16.36.080 - Park acquisition cost. 
For the purposes of this chapter, the park acquisition cost per acre shall be based on the fair market value as determined by the city administrator of land being dedicated, or for purposes of calculating a fee in lieu of dedication, the fair market value of land within the subdivision. The developer shall provide land sale information, a current appraisal, and/or other information on land value within the subdivision. The city administrator may consider the developer-provided information and/or other land value information in calculation of the fair market value. 
(Ord. 139-05 § 2(part), 2005: Ord. 51-89 § 1(part), 1989).  
16.36.090 - Determination of land or fee. 
A.  Whether the city accepts land dedication or elects to require payment of a fee in lieu thereof, or a combination of both, shall be determined by consideration of the following: 
1.  Compatibility of dedication with the city's general plan; 
2.  Topography, geology, access and location of land in the development available for dedication; 
3.  Suitability for patrol, supervision and maintenance; 
4.  Size and shape of the development and land available for dedication; 
5.  The feasibility of dedication; 
6.  Availability of previously acquired park property. 
B.  The city administrator shall make the initial determination as to whether land shall be dedicated, a fee shall be charged, or whether a combination of both land dedication and fee shall be required. A determination by the city administrator that a fee shall be charged shall be final and conclusive, unless appealed to the planning commission of the city. A determination by the city administrator that land shall be dedicated shall be in the form of a recommendation to the planning commission. 
(Ord. 51-89 § 1(part), 1989).  
16.36.100 - Procedure. 
A.  At the time of approval of the tentative subdivision map or parcel map, the city administrator or a duly authorized representative shall determine the land to be dedicated and/or the fees to be paid by the developer and whether or not the subdivision is eligible to be referred to the planning commission and the city council to determine if credit shall be given for private open space under Section 16.36.150 of this chapter. The developer shall dedicate the land and/or pay the fee without credit at the time of the filing of the final subdivision map or parcel map. 
B.  In the event credit is established, the amount of the credit shall be reimbursed upon a determination of the city administrator, or a duly authorized representative, that the open space and related facilities that qualified the subdivision or parcel map for credit have been completed per the approved plans. 
(Ord. 139-05 § 2(part), 2005: Ord. 51-89 § 1(part), 1989).  
16.36.110 - Industrial and commercial developments. 
The provisions of this chapter shall not apply to any industrial or commercial development or other development projects excluded under Government Code Section 66477.

16.36.120 - Schedule of development. 
The city administrator shall develop a schedule specifying how, when, and where the city shall use the land or fees, or both, to develop park and recreation facilities to serve the residents. 
(Ord. 51-89 § 1(part), 1989).  
16.36.130 - Use of fees and/or land. 
The land, fees, or combination thereof shall be used only for the purpose of developing new or rehabilitating existing neighborhood or community park or recreational facilities reasonably related to serving the subdivision. 
(Ord. 139-05 § 2(part), 2005).  
16.36.140 - Other applicable fees. 
Land dedication and/or fees required by this chapter are in addition to developer fees required by Chapter 17.86 of this code. 
(Ord. 139-05 § 2(part), 2005).  
16.36.150 - Credit for private open space. 
No credit shall be given for private open space in a subdivision except as follows: 
A.  Whenever any subdivision is to be developed as a condominium project, stock cooperative, or community apartment project, and private open space for park and recreation purposes is provided in the proposed subdivision and such space is to be privately owned and maintained by the future residents of the subdivision, partial credit, not to exceed fifty percent, may be applied against the requirement of land dedication or payment of fees in lieu thereof at the discretion of the city council if, upon the recommendation of the planning commission, the city council finds that it is in the public interest to do so and that all of the following standards are met: 
1.  That yards, court areas, setbacks, and other open areas required to be maintained by the city's zoning ordinances or building code shall not be included in the computation of such private open space; 
2.  That the private ownership and maintenance of the open space is adequately provided for by recorded written agreement, conveyance, or restrictions; 
3.  That the use of the private open space is restricted for park and recreational purposes by recorded covenant, which runs with the land in favor of the future owners of property and which cannot be defeated or eliminated without the consent of the city or its successor; 
4.  That the proposed private open space is reasonably adaptable for use for park and recreational purposes, taking into consideration such factors as size, shape, topography, geology, access, and location; and 
5.  That facilities proposed for the open space are in substantial accordance with the general plan. 
B.  Before credit is given, the planning commission shall make written findings that the above standards are met. 
(Ord. 139-05 § 2(part), 2005).  
16.36.160 - Credit for park improvements. 
If the developer provides park and recreational improvements to the dedicated land, the value of the improvements together with any equipment located thereon shall be a credit against the payment of fees or dedication of land required by this chapter. 
(Ord. 139-05 § 2(part), 2005).  
Chapter 16.38 - MERGER OF SUBSTANDARD LOTS 
Sections: 
 
16.38.010 - Standards to merge lots.

Chapter 17.01 - PURPOSE AND APPLICATION 
Sections: 
 
17.01.010 - Purpose and application of the Zoning Code. 
17.01.010.1 Generally. This chapter divides the city into zoning districts, and sets out which uses of land are permitted by right, conditionally permitted, and prohibited in each zoning district. It also provides limitations, separation, and special bulk standards for certain uses. 
17.01.010.2 Zoning districts. Section 17.01.020, "Zoning districts established", establishes the districts that set the character and type of development for each of the zoned areas of the city. The zoning district boundaries are shown on the official zoning map. 
17.01.010.3 Official zoning map. 
A.  Generally. Zoning districts are shown upon the map entitled "Official Zoning Map of the City of Williams" (referred to hereinafter as "zoning map") which is attached hereto and made part of this Zoning Code. At least two copies of the zoning map are on file and available for inspection during regular business hours at the city planning department ("department"). 
B.  Force and effect. The zoning map and all notations, references, and other information shown on it are a part of this Code and have the same force as the text of the ordinance. 
C.  Status of official zoning map. The zoning map that is on file at the department shall control in the event of a conflict between the map that is on file and any other reproduction of said map. 
D.  Effective date. This Code may be adopted before the zoning map. In such case, this Code will not become effective until the zoning map is adopted. 
E.  Interpreting the official zoning map. Where the zoning map appears to be unclear regarding district boundaries, the director shall make a determination using the following criteria: 
1.  Where zoning district boundary lines appear to follow existing rights-of-way, property lines, watercourses, or similar features, the zoning boundary shall be construed to follow the centerline of the feature. 
2.  Where the boundaries are indicated as approximately following property, street or alley lines, such lines shall be construed to be the boundaries. 
3.  In unsubdivided property and where a district boundary divides a lot, the location of the boundary, unless the same is indicated by dimensions, shall be determined by use of the scale appearing on the zoning map. 
4.  A symbol indicating the classification of property on the zoning map shall in each instance apply to the whole of the area within the district boundaries. 
5.  Where a public street, alley or parcel of land is officially vacated or abandoned, the regulations applicable to abutting property apply equally to the vacated or abandoned street or alley. 
F.  Conflicts resolved. In the event of a conflict between the district boundaries on the official zoning map and the zoning for property provided by a duly enacted rezoning ordinance adopted before the effective date, the zoning map shall control. 
17.01.010.4 Apparently undesignated land. It is the intent of the city council that all land other than streets and highways within the city be zoned. Any land that is not assigned a zoning district on the official zoning map is zoned agricultural/rural (AR). Street and highway rights-of-way shall remain undesignated. 
17.01.010.5 Prezoning. Any unincorporated property within the sphere of influence may be prezoned for the purpose of determining the zoning that will apply to such property in the event of subsequent annexation to the city. The initiation of such prezoning and its procedures shall be the same as rezoning for properties within the city limits. Upon the effective date of annexation of a parcel of land that has been prezoned, the prezoning designation shall become the official zoning designation for the property and reflected as such on the official zoning map. 
17.01.010.6 Zoning upon annexation. The city council may apply a zoning district to property upon annexation. Land that is not zoned otherwise during the annexation process is zoned agricultural/rural (AR) upon annexation until rezoned to another district. 
17.01.010.7 Permitted, limited, conditional, temporary and prohibited uses. Section 17.01.030, "Permitted, limited, conditional, temporary, and prohibited uses", establishes the uses that are permitted and prohibited in each zoning district. 
1.  Permitted uses. Permitted uses are those that achieve the purpose of the base zoning district and are allowed by right, subject to various standards of Title 17. 
2.  Limited uses. Limited uses are similar to permitted uses in that they are permitted by right, but due to unique characteristics, are subject to particular requirements or standards that differ from or exceed those required of permitted uses in the same zoning district. These uses, for example, may be subject to use limitations, separation, and special bulk standards that mitigate potentially negative impacts on city infrastructure or on other uses. These standards are set out in Section 17.01.040, Standards for limited and conditional uses. 
3.  Conditional uses. Conditional uses are subject to limitations, separation, and special bulk standards that mitigate potentially negative impacts on city infrastructure or on other uses. See Table 17.01.040.2, Limited and Conditional Use Standards. Other standards may also apply if they are determined to be necessary to mitigate potentially negative impacts. All standards that apply to conditional uses will be conditions of approval of the conditional use permit. See Subsection 17.05.260.1, Conditional use approvals. 
4.  Temporary uses. Temporary uses are subject to limitations that mitigate potentially negative impacts on city emergency services and on the quality of life of the city's residents. These standards are set out in Table 17.01.040.2, Limited and Conditional Use Standards. 
5.  Prohibited uses. Any use not allowed as a permitted, limited, or conditional use or otherwise determined to be prohibited in Section 17.01.030 of Title 17, unless the use is determined to be substantially similar to a permitted, limited, or conditional use in the same zoning district based on a determination made by the director in accordance with Section 17.01.030.8 (Unlisted uses) of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 194-12, § I, 7-25-2012)

E.  All lots that lawfully existed on the effective date of this Zoning Code are "conforming" with respect to lot width and lot area if they are located in the NC district. The lot width and lot area requirements of Table 17.01.020.2, Neighborhood Conservation Subdistricts, apply only to the subdivision or combination of existing lots or parcels within the NC district after the effective date. See example 17.01.020.2, Application of lot width and area requirements in the NC61-6 district. This example uses the requirements of the NC61-6 subdistrict for illustrative purposed only. All of the other NC subdistricts are applied in the same way. 
Example 17.01.020.2 
Application of Lot Width and Area Requirements in N61-6 District 
Lawfully Existing Lot #1: N61-6 District, 5,000 sq. ft. in area, 50 feet wide 	Lawfully Existing Lot #2: N61-6 District, 7,000 sq. ft. in area, 70 feet wide 	Lawfully Existing Lot #3: NC61-6 District, 12,200 sq. ft. in area, 120 feet wide 
This lot is "conforming" because it is lawfully existing on the effective date of this UDC. Since it is smaller than the minimum lot size and narrower than the minimum lot width, it cannot be subdivided further. 	This lot is "conforming" because it is lawfully existing on the effective date of this UDC. Even though it is more than twice as large as the minimum lot area for the N61-6 District, it cannot be subdivided unless the new lots are configured to meet the minimum lot width requirement. 	This lot is "conforming" because it is lawfully existing on the effective date of this UDC. This lot could be subdivided into two lots, provided that each lot meet the minimum lot area and minimum lot width requirements of the NC61-6 District. 
 
F.  Neighborhood conservation districts are not subject to the standards of Section 17.02.080, Residential district development standards, but are subject to the general residential standards of Section 17.01.050, Supplemental residential standards, except where specifically exempted within that section. 
(Ord. No. 194-12, § I, 7-25-2012)

Subsection 17.01.030.4, Residential and institutional uses, through Subsection 17.01.030.6, Industrial, agricultural, communications, and transportation, contain tables that set out which uses are permitted, limited, conditional and prohibited in each zoning district. Subsection 17.01.030.7, Temporary uses, sets out the same information for temporary uses. 
17.01.030.2 Table format. The tables in this section list uses in rows, organized by category. Zoning districts are arranged in columns. Where rows and columns intersect, a letter indicates if the use is permitted, limited, conditional or prohibited in the district. 
17.01.030.3 Symbols. All the tables in this section use the following symbols: 
A.  "P" means that the use is "Permitted", subject to the standards that apply to all permitted uses. The use is approved by the director. 
B.  "L" means that the use is a "Limited Use" which is permitted as of right and ministerially approved by the director, subject to: 
1.  The standards for permitted uses that are set out in this Zoning Ordinance; and 
2.  The applicable limited use standards for the specified use. 
C.  "C" means that the use is allowed as a "Conditional Use", which is approved by the planning and zoning commission subject to: 
1.  Standards for permitted uses that are set out in this Zoning Ordinance; 
2.  The applicable limited use standards for the specified use; 
3.  The conditional use standards of section TBD conditional use procedures, which apply to all conditional uses. 
D.  "-" means that the use is "Prohibited" in the specified zoning district. 
E.  "+", used in conjunction with other letters enumerated in this subsection, means that the use is subject to more than one set of standards (e.g., "L+D" means that limited use standards and design standards apply). 
17.01.030.4 Residential and institutional uses. 
A.  Table 17.01.030.4, Residential and Institutional Uses, sets out which residential and institutional uses are allowed in each zoning district:

17.01.040 - Standards for limited and conditional uses. 
17.01.040.1 Generally. The standards of Table 17.01.040.2, Limited and Conditional Use Standards, apply to uses that are specified in Tables 17.01.030.4, Residential and Institutional Uses, through Table 17.01.030.7, Temporary Uses, as "L" or "C." 
17.01.040.2 Limited and conditional use standards. The columns in Tables 17.01.040.2, Residential Limited and Conditional Use Standards through Table 17.01.040.10, Temporary Limited and Conditional Use Standards, establish the standards that apply to each of the limited and conditional uses. They are organized as follows: 
A.  Table headings. 
1.  Use category. The first column lists the use to which the standards specified in the same row apply. 
2.  District. The second column lists the district to which the standards specified in the same row apply. 
3.  Land area. The third column specifies the maximum or minimum area of the lot or parcel proposed for development upon which the use is proposed to be located. 
4.  Time limitations/compliance deadlines/age of structure. The fourth column specifies the maximum daily hours the use may operate, or the maximum number of days a use may operate in any given period. It identifies a deadline for compliance with standards. It sets a maximum age a structure may be. 
5.  Floor area. The fifth column specifies the maximum gross square footage that may be devoted to a use within a building plot. 
6.  Maximum building height. The sixth column specifies the maximum height of a proposed structure. These regulations are further restrictions of the district height regulations of Section 17.02.090, Residential lot, yard, and height standards and Subsection 17.02.100.1, Nonresidential lot, yard and height standards. 
7.  Required access. The seventh column specifies the road or roadway type from which the use must take access or restricts access to certain road classifications. 
8.  Other use limitations. The eighth column, other use limitations, specifies additional use restrictions. 
B.  A dash "-" in a table cell means that the requirement of the column does not apply to the use indicated in the row. 
C.  A number of uses are limited uses only in the business park district but are either permitted by right or prohibited in other districts. These uses are not included in the tables in this section. The restrictions for these uses are provided in Subsection 17.01.040.11, Use standards for limited uses in the business park district. 
17.01.040.3 Residential and institutional limited and conditional use standards. Table 17.01.040.3 Residential and Institutional Limited and Conditional Use Standards, sets out limitations and requirements for residential limited and conditional uses.

17.01.060 - Supplemental nonresidential standards. 
17.01.060.1 Exceptions to yard standards. 
A.  Generally. Table 17.01.060.1, Permitted Projections into Required Yards, sets out projections that may be located within required yards (between the setback lines and the lot lines). Measurements in the table are taken from the setback line (A); from the lot line (B); or into the right-of-way (C). If a measurement is indicated for "(A) Into Yard" and "(B) From Lot Line," then the measurement that results in the larger setback from the lot line controls. If a measurement is indicated for "(A) Into Yard" and "(C) Into Right-of-Way," then the measurement that allows the smallest encroachment into the right-of-way controls. 
B.  Right-of-way encroachment permit required. If a structure or portion thereof is permitted to project into the right-of-way in this section, then a right-of-way encroachment permit as provided in Chapter 12.14, Encroachments, of the City of Williams Code of Ordinances, shall be required prior to installation of the projection.

Sections: 
 
17.02.070 - Purpose and application of chapter. 
17.02.070.1 Purpose of chapter. 
A.  Generally. The purpose of this chapter is to establish the general standards for the intensity and character of development that is allowed within each zoning district. 
B.  Standards applicable to parcels proposed for development. This chapter establishes general regulations for the character of entire parcels proposed for development through the use of limitations on density (and, in some cases, intensity); minimum requirements for open space or landscaped surface area; a minimum area requirement for the parcel proposed for development; minimum requirements for the provision of utilities; the minimum required mix of housing types; and the averaging of lot sizes. 
C.  Standards applicable to individual lots. The character of development of individual lots is regulated by minimum requirements for building height, lot dimensions, setbacks, building coverage, and open space or landscaped surface ratios. This chapter also provides standards for the design and location of accessory uses and structures, and for common incidental uses of residential and nonresidential lots (e.g., parking of commercial vehicles). 
D.  Design of residential and nonresidential developments. Design standards have been established to address new development, alterations to existing development and signs. 
1.  The City of Williams recognizes its unique characteristics, such as spectacular natural vistas, historic ambiance, agricultural heritage and natural dynamic natural features which attract a significant number of visitors to the city and which enhance the quality of life of permanent residents. 
2.  The appearance of buildings, structures, and the land, as visible from public streets, places and ways, has a material and substantial relationship to property values and the taxability of property in the city. 
3.  To protect the economic welfare of the community, it is the policy of the city to protect, maintain and enhance the social and economic values created by past and present investments in the community by requiring all future development to respect these traditions and require that all buildings and structures placed on the land respect the natural land forms, and become a compatible part of the total community environment, both in the local neighborhood and the city as a whole. 
17.02.070.2 Application of chapter. 
A.  Generally. This subsection describes how the subsequent sections of this chapter are applied. 
B.  Residential district development standards. Section 17.02.080, Residential district development standards, provides the standards for density and open space for residential uses within each residential district. 
C.  Residential lot, yard and height standards. Section 17.02.090, Residential lot, yard and height standards, are applied to the development of individual lots in a new subdivision. 
D.  Nonresidential scale and parking regulations. Section 17.02.100, Nonresidential scale and parking regulations, provide standards for nonresidential site development and regulations for the exterior envelope of buildings. They apply to the development of buildings on the parcel or its individual lots. 
E.  Housing bonus. Section 17.02.110, Housing bonus, provides incentives for the development of affordable housing and for green development. It applies to all residential developments. 
F.  Landscaping and buffering. Section 17.02.120, Landscaping and buffering, provides standards for the provision of landscaping and buffering for all districts. 
G.  Design standards. 
1.  Subsection 17.02.090.9, Design of residential structures and Subsection 17.02.100.12, Design of nonresidential structures, apply to: 
a.  All structures and physical improvements; 
b.  Signs; 
c.  Repainting of buildings in the downtown and lots with frontage on the downtown fringe streets. 
2.  Exceptions shall include: 
a.  Individual-built single-family; 
b.  Two-family dwellings; and 
c.  Small residential development on individual lots. 
3.  The exception for the individual single-family and two-family dwellings, shall not apply: 
a.  When design review is required as a condition of a subdivision, use permit or other discretionary entitlement; or 
b.  When a developer proposes to construct three or more units. 
4.  The director may require minor or incidental design review where necessary to meet the intent of the design review. 
(Ord. No. 194-12, § I, 7-25-2012)  
17.02.080 - Residential district development standards. 
17.02.080.1 Residential development area and density standards. The columns in Table 17.02.080.1, Residential Development Area and Density Standards, establish the open space, density, utility, and minimum parcel areas that apply to each of the residential development types. They are applied as follows: 
A.  The first column, "District and Development Type", reflects the zoning districts and the residential development types that are permitted in the district. 
B.  The second column, "Min. OSR", reflects the minimum open space ratio. Open space is required only for development that contains five or more dwelling units. OSR is calculated as set out in Subsection 17.06300.3, Open space ratio. 
C.  The third column, "Gross Density", contains the maximum gross density. This is generally expressed in dwelling units per acre. Gross density is calculated as set out in Subsection 17.06.300.4, Density. 
D.  The fourth column, "Required Utilities", indicates if public water and sewer utilities are required or if private systems are permitted. The requirement for public utilities, either from the city or from an approved utility provider, is indicated by "public," whereas "private" indicates that on-site potable water and individual sewer systems are permitted. On sites where private systems are permitted, public systems may also be used. 
E.  The fifth column, "Min. Area of Parcel Proposed for Development", indicates the minimum area of the parcel proposed for development that is required for the development of the specified use.

17.02.080.2 Mix of housing types in planned residential (mixed housing) developments. 
A.  Housing type mix requirements. Table 17.02.080.2, Housing Type Mix Requirements, sets out the mix of housing types that is required for planned residential developments. When calculating the percentage of each housing type in a proposed development, normal rounding is used: 
Table 17.02.080.2 
Housing Type Mix Requirements 
Min. No. of 
Housing Types 	Max. % Any Housing Type 	Min. % Any Housing Type 1 
1 	100 	20 
2 	75 	25 
3 	55 	20 
4 	50 	12 
5 	30 	10 
TABLE NOTE: 
1  This requirement applies even if more than the minimum number of housing types are provided 
 
B.  Phasing. When a development is to be phased, the maximum residential development capacity of the entire site shall be used for calculating the required mix. When a parcel is to be subdivided and developed as multiple phases over time, the city may impose a mix based on the original property size to ensure an adequate mix of housing types. 
17.02.080.3 Residential lot averaging and distribution of averaged lots. 
A.  Applicability. Lot averaging shall be applied: 
1.  To a housing type when there are more than forty units of the housing type in a planned residential development (mixed housing). 
2.  To any single-family detached and single-family detached cluster development that contains more than forty dwelling units: 
3.  Lot area groups for each housing type are provided in the tables in Section 17.02.090, Residential lot, yard and height standards. 
4.  Where lot averaging is not required, but the tables in Section 17.02.090, Residential lot, yard and height standards, indicate three lot area groups, the average lot area group shall be used to establish minimum lot area and minimum lot depth for the housing type. 
B.  Identifying lots in each group. Lots within each size group are identified by lot width. Small lots shall meet the minimum lot width for small lots, and their lot width may be up to (but not including) the lot width of the average lot category. Average lots shall meet the minimum lot width for average lots, and their lot width may be up to (but not including) the lot width of the large lot category. Large lots must meet the minimum lot width for large lots, and their width is not limited. 
C.  Calculating the required number of lots of each lot area group. The tables in Section 17.02.090, Residential lot, yard, and height standards, provide for variable lot sizes, the column titled "percent in width type," indicates the minimum proportion of each lot area group that must be provided. The minimum number of small and average lots shall be rounded up to the nearest whole number. If the minimum proportions for small and average lots are met, the remainder of the lots may be large lots. 
D.  Distribution of averaged lots. Lots in the three lot area groups shall be distributed such that small lots, average lots, and large lots are mixed on each block or cul-de-sac spread through the development. Concentrating lots of a single lot area group in separate areas of a development is not permitted. 
(Ord. No. 194-12, § I, 7-25-2012)  
17.02.090 - Residential lot, yard and height standards. 
17.02.090.1 Single-family detached and single-family detached cluster standards. 
A.  Applicability. This section applies to the creation or alteration of lots in all single-family residential developments. 
1.  The setback requirements of this section apply to new construction and the alteration of single-family structures on all lots. 
2.  If an existing single-family structure in the NC district meets the setback provisions of Table 17.02.090.1A, Single-Family Detached Lot and Building Standards, Small Subdivisions, the setback restricts additions made to the structure after the effective date of this Zoning Code unless the proposed addition meets the provisions of Subsection 17.02.090.8, Special standards for neighborhood conservation district. 
3.  Subsection B., below, applies to: 
a.  All lot splits, lot combinations, and resubdivision of lots in the NC61-6, NC80-6, NC80-7, NC87-6, and NC1-1 districts; and 
b.  All single-family development in small subdivisions (of forty or fewer lots) in the R-S or R-U districts. 
4.  Subsection C., below, applies to all single-family development in large subdivisions (that include more than forty single-family lots) in the R-S or R-U districts. 
5.  Subsection D., below, applies to all single-family construction in the R-E and AR districts, regardless of whether lots are developed in a single subdivision or on a lot-by-lot basis. 
B.  Lot standards for small subdivisions. Lot and building standards for single-family detached units are set out in Table 17.02.090.1A, Single-Family Detached Lot and Building Standards; Small Subdivisions:

17.02.090.7 Special standards for neighborhood conservation district. 
A.  Generally. This section provides an alternative set of standards for development, redevelopment, and expansion of existing buildings (as indicated below) within the NC subdistricts when the new construction would encroach into the setbacks that are established by Table 17.02.090.1B, Single-Family Detached Lot and Building Standards; Small Subdivisions. See Figure 17.02.090.7, Single-Family Detached Lot Standards. 
Figure 17.02.090.7
Single-Family Detached Lot Standards 
The proposed addition (shown below) extends past the minimum general side setback line established in Table 17.02.090.1 A, Single-Family Detached Lot and Building Standards; Small Subdivisions. The alternative setback standards of this section will apply instead of the minimum general standards if all conditions of this section are met. 
  
B.  Alternative building setback standards; all setbacks. Alternative setbacks shall be applied only if it is demonstrated that the standards of the applicable subsection of this section are met, and the proposed construction: 
1.  Does not interfere with planned expansion of right-of-way, and if right-of-way expansion is planned, the application is evaluated as if the right-of-way has been expanded; 
2.  Does not result in interference with a utility easement; 
3.  Does not cause more or faster drainage onto abutting properties or rights-of-way than the condition that existed before the proposed construction; 
4.  Does not result in a nonconformity with respect to the building code on either the applicant's lot or the abutting property; 
5.  Is built to building code standards that would allow construction of the abutting lot to be built to the same standard along the same setback line; 
6.  Does not interfere with emergency access to the rear of the house; 
7.  Conforms to building coverage limitations of Table 17.02.090.1B, Single-family Detached Lot and Building Standards, Small Subdivisions; and 
8.  Does not reduce the area provided for parking to fewer than two paved off-street parking spaces (one or both may be in a garage or carport). 
C.  Alternative building setback standards; front setbacks. 
1.  New development; redevelopment; and building expansion. For new development, redevelopment, or building expansion, front setbacks may be reduced from the standards set out in Table 17.02.090.1B, Single-family Detached Lot and Building Standards, Small Subdivisions, if it is demonstrated that the proposed new front building setback: 
a.  Is equal to not more than ten percent less than the average actual setback of the other homes on the same side of the same block; and/or 
b.  For an attached or detached garage, is equal to the average actual front setback to an attached or detached garage with comparable garage door orientation with respect to the street on the same side of the same block. In no case shall the garage be set back less than twenty-one feet if it loads from the sideyard. 
2.  Building expansion only. For building expansions only, front setbacks may be reduced from the standards set out in Table 17.02.090.1B, Single-family Detached Lot and Building Standards, Small Subdivisions, if compliance with any of the following options is demonstrated: 
a.  Option #1. The reduction is ten percent or less of the required front setback, and the encroachment will not reduce the depth of a driveway to less than twenty-one feet in length to the edge of the sidewalk or ditch or street pavement, whichever edge is closest to the building; 
b.  Option #2. The reduction is more than ten percent of the required front setback, but less than twenty-five percent of the required front setback, and: 
i.  No garage doors that face the street are located in the reduced setback area; 
ii.  The improvement is not more than twenty feet in height; 
iii.  If the encroachment is more than ten feet wide (measured parallel to the front building line), then it is screened from view from the public right-of-way by a canopy tree or evergreen tree; and 
iv.  The encroachment is not more than thirty feet wide or fifty percent of the lot width, whichever is smaller. 
c.  Option #3. The existing building encroaches upon the setback set out in Table 17.02.090.1B, Single-family Detached Lot and Building Standards, Small Subdivisions, on the effective date, and: 
i.  The proposed construction will not reduce the depth of a driveway to less than twenty-one feet in length to the edge of the sidewalk or ditch or street pavement, whichever is closest to the building; 
ii.  The proposed construction will be set back not less than ninety percent of the setback to the existing building. 
D.  Alternative building setback standards; interior side setbacks. 
1.  New development; redevelopment; and building expansion. For new development, redevelopment, or building expansion, interior side setbacks may be reduced from the standards set out in Table 17.02.090.1B Single-family Detached Lot and Building Standards, Small Subdivisions, if it is demonstrated that the proposed side building setback is equal to not more than the average actual side building setback of the other homes on the same side of the same block. 
2.  Building expansion only. For building expansion only, interior side setbacks may be reduced from the standards set out in Table 17.02.090.1B, Single-family Detached Lot and Building Standards, Small Subdivisions, up to forty percent if it is demonstrated that the proposed construction meets all of the following standards: 
a.  Limit of encroachment. 
i.  If the lot that abuts the proposed building expansion is used for residential purposes, then: 
(a)  The building expansion shall be screened from view from the public street by at least one tree per story of the building expansion, unless it projects into the required side setback less than one foot further towards the lot line than the existing building; 
(b)  Building expansions shall be twelve feet in height or less; 
(c)  Building expansions shall be set back at least forty-two inches from the side lot line. 
ii.  If the lot that abuts the proposed building expansion is used for nonresidential purposes or permanent open space that is at least twenty feet in width, then the building expansion shall be set back at least forty-two inches from the side lot line. 
b.  Horizontal dimension. The building expansion, combined with the existing building, does not create a horizontal dimension of more than fifty feet without an offset in the building wall of at least three feet. 
c.  Windows. The building expansion shall not include a window that is located directly across from another window on a residential building that is closer than twenty feet away, unless: 
i.  The window is on the first floor and an opaque fence is installed between the two buildings to a height of six feet; or 
ii.  The window is not operational and is made of glass block or frosted glass, or other opaque material approved by the director. 
E.  Alternative building setback standards; rear setbacks. 
1.  Rear setbacks may be reduced on any lot in the NC district if it is demonstrated that the proposed rear building setback is equal to not more than ten percent less than the average actual setback of the other homes on the same side of the same block. 
2.  Rear setbacks may be reduced on lots with rear lot lines that abut permanent open space, and through lots with fences or walls that screen rear yards from major roadways, according to the following standards: 
a.  For one-story construction, or portions of construction, the rear setback may be reduced by up to fifty percent if it is demonstrated that the proposed construction is located behind an opaque fence or garden wall that is at least five feet in height, and one evergreen or canopy tree is planted in the rear yard for each twelve feet of width of the encroaching portion of the proposed construction. 
b.  For two-story construction, or portions of construction, the rear setback may be reduced up to thirty percent if it is demonstrated that the standards of Subsection E.2.a., above, are met.

17.02.110 - Housing bonuses. 
17.02.110.1 Purpose of chapter. 
A.  Generally. 
1.  The City of Williams desires to encourage better development design and buildings that are more sustainable in terms of energy consumption and carbon footprint. This section provides bonuses for development that achieve one or more of these community objectives. The bonuses are available as matter of right to developers that meet the standards of this section. 
2.  The City of Williams desires to support the development of affordable housing. The city uses the bonus provisions set by the State of California as a guide to encourage residential development that provides a percentage of its products for sale and for rent at affordable levels. 
B.  Green bonus. The bonus provisions set out in Subsection 17.02.110.2, Residential and nonresidential green bonus, are intended to provide incentives for the development of sites and buildings with low impact development techniques, green building materials and techniques, and renewable energy systems. 
C.  Housing bonus. The bonus provisions set out in Subsection 17.02.110.3, Residential density bonus, are intended to provide incentives for development of residential uses where a portion of the products for sale or rent provide needed housing for the residents of the City of Williams. 
17.02.110.2 Residential and nonresidential green building bonus. 
A.  Purpose. The City of Williams encourages the development of high-performance "green" buildings, which use less energy, water and natural resources; create less waste; and are healthier and more comfortable for the occupants. Bonuses are available to applicants who construct under the standards of this section. 
B.  Application. 
1.  Residential uses. Bonuses are available for residential and the residential portions of mixed use projects that demonstrate a commitment to development and redevelopment strategies referenced in this section. These bonuses increase the development potential of a parcel by increasing the density. 
2.  Nonresidential uses. Bonuses are available for nonresidential uses and the nonresidential portions of mixed use projects that demonstrate a commitment to green development and redevelopment strategies. These bonuses increase the development potential of a parcel proposed for development by reducing open space and parking requirements. 
C.  Green residential building bonus. If the project demonstrates that at a minimum five of the development and redevelopment strategies and five of the building strategies of Appendix C., Green Building Bonuses, will be employed during construction of the project, the permitted density of residential development may be increased by up to ten percent. 
D.  Green nonresidential building bonuses. 
1.  Open space offset. Buildings with green roofs shall be entitled to an offset of open space for the area of the green roof, up to fifteen percent of the area of open space required by Subsection 17.02.100.2, Nonresidential open space and building scale. 
2.  Parking. If the project demonstrates that at a minimum five of the development and redevelopment strategies and five of the building strategies of Appendix C., Green Building Bonuses, will be employed during construction of the project, the minimum number of parking spaces required may be reduced by up to ten percent. 
E.  Assignment of bonuses. 
1.  Concurrent with the application for site plan or plat review, the applicant shall provide a written document that lists and describes the strategies to be employed on the site and in the buildings. 
2.  Strategies eligible for bonuses are listed in Appendix C., Green Building Strategies. This appendix may be amended by the director to bring the list up to date with new technologies or approaches. 
3.  The bonus will be granted by the planning commission upon approval of a subdivision plat. Where platting or replatting is not required, or the property was platted prior to the bonus, the bonus will be granted by the director upon approval of a site plan.

17.02.120 - Landscaping and buffering. 
17.02.120.1 Purpose. The City of Williams recognizes that landscaping and tree protection protects the area's natural heritage, conserves water, moderates the heat island effect, reduces radiated heat due to increased shading, and reduces runoff. In bufferyards, landscaping mitigates conflicts between uses and minimizes the effects on the surrounding environment due to noise, dust, debris, artificial light intrusions, and other impacts of an adjoining or nearby use. The purpose of this section is to: 
A.  Provide the detailed landscaping standards for all development, including landscaping for street trees, buildings, residential lots, open spaces, parking lots and bufferyards; 
B.  Provide standards for installation and maintenance; 
C.  Promote the values and benefits of landscapes while recognizing the need to invest water and other resources as efficiently as possible; 
D.  Establish a structure for planning, designing, installing, maintaining and managing water efficient landscapes in new construction and rehabilitated projects; 
E.  Establish provisions for water management practices and water waste prevention for existing landscapes; and 
F.  Design, establish and maintain landscaping and irrigation in accordance with the California Water Conservation in Landscaping Act, Government Code Section 65591, as it may be amended from time to time. 
17.02.120.2 Application. 
A.  Generally. This section requires two general types of landscaping: development landscaping and bufferyards, as follows: 
1.  Development landscaping. Development landscaping is the landscaping that is required regardless of the location of the proposed development with respect to other development. There are four types of development landscaping: Lot and building landscaping; open space landscaping; parking lot landscaping; and street trees. 
2.  Bufferyard landscaping. Bufferyards are required based on the zoning, development type, or right-of-way type that abuts proposed development. Bufferyards may be required along district boundaries, along street and railroad rights-of-way, and along the boundaries of parking lots. Generally, bufferyards must be provided as required in this section. However, other sections of this Zoning Code may require additional buffering. 
B.  Applicability of standards. Except as provided in Subsection C., the standards of this subsection apply to all new development, redevelopment, or substantial improvements to existing sites or buildings. All landscaping and irrigation systems shall be designed in accordance with this chapter. With the exception of Subsection C., all new development projects, redevelopment projects, and replacement of landscaping shall: 
1.  Comply with water efficient landscape standards as provided under the California Water Conservation in Landscaping Act, Government Code Section 65591, as it may be amended from time to time; 
2.  Comply with Subsection 17.02.120.11, Water efficiency landscape standards; and 
3.  Be consistent with the design review manual. 
C.  Exceptions. The following are exceptions to the standards of this section: 
1.  Individual lots of record that are used for existing single-family or two-family dwellings unless a specific requirement is set out in this Subsection 17.02.090.7, Special standards for neighborhood conservation district. 
2.  Modifications to nonresidential buildings where the modification does not expand the use by more than ten percent or three thousand square feet, whichever is less. 
D.  Calculations. No area of a parcel proposed for development shall be counted more than once for the purposes of applying landscaping requirements. 
E.  Water efficient landscape standards. 
1.  The provisions of Subsection 17.02.120.11, Water efficiency landscape standards, apply to the following landscape projects: 
a.  New construction and rehabilitated landscapes for institutional, commercial and multifamily development projects with a landscape area equal to or greater than two thousand five hundred square feet which are otherwise subject to a building permit or development review. 
b.  Developer-installed, single-family residential landscapes and common areas of a project with a landscape area equal to or greater than two thousand five hundred square feet which are otherwise subject to a building permit or development review. Where model homes are included, the developer shall install at least two model homes with landscapes that comply with the requirements of this chapter and include signs and printed materials explaining design strategies and plant materials for water conservation. 
c.  New construction landscapes which are homeowner-provided and/or homeowner-hired in single-family residential projects with a total project landscape area equal to or greater than five thousand square feet requiring a building permit or development review. 
d.  Homeowners associations and common interest developments' architectural guidelines (i.e., CC&Rs) shall not prohibit or include conditions that have the effect of prohibiting the use of low water-using plants as a group. Further, the guidelines shall not prohibit the removal of turf, nor restrict or prohibit the reduction of turf in lieu of more water-efficient alternatives (Civil Code Section 1353.8). 
2.  The standards of Subsection 17.02.120.11, Water efficiency landscape standards do not apply to: 
a.  Registered local, state or federal historical sites; 
b.  Ecological restoration projects that do not require a permanent irrigation system; or 
c.  Plant collections, as part of botanical gardens and arboretums open to the public. 
17.02.120.3 Lot and building landscaping. 
A.  Lot landscaping that is consistent with the design review manual is required on lots within new residential subdivisions and on vacant single-family lots within developed subdivisions upon application for a building permit. This section does not apply to lots with existing single-family homes. 
B.  Building landscaping or hardscaping that complies with the design review manual is required around nonresidential, mixed use, and multifamily buildings, except in the C-D district. 
17.02.120.4 Open space landscaping. 
A.  Generally. Open space landscaping shall be installed on designated open space tracts. Open space tracts include all areas that are set aside pursuant to the required open space ratio, or otherwise designated as commonly owned open space even if not required by this Zoning Code. 
B.  Exceptions. 
1.  General exceptions. The area to which open space landscaping requirements applies does not include any open spaces that are in the following categories: 
a.  Areas that are not dedicated as open space tracts or under common ownership by a property owners' association. 
b.  Areas within required bufferyards, even if commonly owned, that meet the requirements of Subsection 17.02.120.7, Bufferyards. 
c.  Areas used as, and that are located within fifteen feet of, ball fields, playing courts, and similar play areas (including bleachers or seating areas for spectators), which are designed to be free of trees and landscaping. However, where the perimeter of such an active recreation area is within thirty feet of one or more residential lots, the perimeter shall be planted with a Type C Bufferyard. See Subsection 17.02.120.7, Bufferyards. 
d.  Parking areas for recreation facilities in the open space that meet the requirements of Subsection 17.02.120.5, Parking lot landscaping. 
e.  Waterbodies and wet detention basins. 
f.  Wooded areas that are designated as open space tracts. For the purposes of identification, the boundaries of the wooded areas follow the exterior canopy line. 
2.  Limited exceptions. The area within wetlands dedicated as open space is not required to be landscaped. However, invasive exotic species (if present) shall be removed and replaced with native wetland species unless the city finds that the cost of removal and replacement is unreasonably excessive in relation to the cost of the proposed development. Landscaping installed near wetlands shall be composed of species that are tolerant of a high water table. 
C.  Planting requirements. Plant and tree installation shall be conducted consistent with the city's design review manual. 
17.02.120.5 Parking lot landscaping. 
A.  Generally. Parking lot landscaping is required within and around parking lots that contain more than five parking spaces and shall be designed consistent with the city's design review manual. 
B.  Clearance for trees. There shall be a minimum of four feet open ground clearance around all trees to allow proper tree adaptability. 
C.  Exemptions. Farmsteads, farmworker housing, single-family dwellings, two-family dwellings, and emergency shelters are not required to provide parking lot landscaping. 
17.02.120.6 Street trees. 
A.  Generally. Street trees are trees that are planted within the street right-of-way, either in green strips between private property and the traveled portion of a roadway, tree grates in sidewalks, or medians. Street trees are required along both sides of all new streets in all zoning districts other than the C-D district: 
Figure 17.02.120.6
Street Trees 
Street trees are shown in shading 
  
B.  Types and species of street trees. 
1.  All street trees shall be canopy trees that are suitable for installation in the space within the right-of-way or within a tree grate, as applicable. Refer to the city's design review manual for recommended street tree selections. 
2.  Understory trees may be substituted for canopy trees, provided that: 
a.  One and six-tenths understory trees are provided for each canopy tree that would otherwise be required, and spacing between trees is proportionately reduced; and 
b.  The understory trees are used in areas where buildings are close to the roadway, such that the installation of canopy trees would create a likely conflict between the street trees and the nearby buildings. 
3.  The trees planted in a landscaped median shall be of a different species from those planted in the rights-of-way. If the parkways are planted with canopy trees, then medians may be planted with understory trees instead of canopy trees. 
C.  Location. 
1.  No street trees shall be planted under or within five lateral feet of any underground water line, sewer line, transmission line or other utility. 
2.  If street trees are to be located within a utility easement, the applicant shall notify the easement holder, who shall have authority to approve the location of the trees. 
D.  Spacing. 
1.  Minimum spacing. No trees may be planted closer than twenty-five feet together, except that special plantings may be clustered if the cluster does not negatively affect the continuing health of the clustered trees, and the cluster is approved in the landscape plan of the plat or land development. 
2.  Maximum spacing. Street trees shall be spaced not more than sixty feet on center for trees with large canopies (e.g., live oaks), or forty feet on center for trees with smaller canopies. If the parkway or median is more than sixteen feet in width and does not contain open ditch drainage, then canopy trees shall be installed in two rows, with trees staggered, each row spaced not more than sixty feet on-center. 
E.  Maintenance. Street trees required by this Zoning Code shall be maintained by a developer, lot owner, tenant, property owners' association or other entity having a legal interest in the ownership of the subdivision or lots in the subdivision. The entity that is in charge of the maintenance shall be indicated on the landscape plan, and documentation (e.g., covenants, conditions, and restrictions) shall be provided to the city that shows the legal obligation of the entity to perform the maintenance. 
F.  Replacement. If the city or a utility provider must remove street trees to access utilities for repair or maintenance, then the developer or property owners' association, if the project is built out, shall pay the cost of removal and shall replace the trees within thirty days of the completion of the work unless the city public works director determines that replacement would put utilities at material risk. 
17.02.120.7 Bufferyards. 
A.  Bufferyards are classified from less opaque ("Class A") to more opaque ("Class E"). The width and composition of bufferyards shall be as set out in Table 17.02.120.7A Bufferyard Classifications. Example plans and profiles for each bufferyard type are illustrated in Figure 17.02.120.7, Bufferyard Examples. 
Table 17.02.120.7A 
Bufferyard Classifications 
Type 	Width 	Required Plantings per 100 Linear Feet 	Berm or Opaque Wall or Fence

Table Notes: 
Tree and plant selections and design lay out for bufferyards shall be consistent with the City's Landscape Standards provided in the Design Review Manual. 
 
B.  Reduction of width. The width of a bufferyard may be reduced if the requirements of this subsection would result in an area of bufferyards that occupies more than twenty percent of the parcel proposed for development, the bufferyard width may be reduced to a width that results in a maximum bufferyard area of no more than twenty percent of the development. 
C.  Minimum width. No part of a required bufferyard shall be reduced to a width of less than three feet. 
D.  Bufferyard standards. Table 17.02.120.7B District Boundary Bufferyard Standards, sets out the classification of bufferyard that is required between zoning districts that are not separated by a public street. The table is a matrix in which all districts are shown. Rows show the zoning of the parcel proposed for development, and columns show the zoning of the adjoining land. Two letters are shown for each condition (for example, A and C). The bufferyard required for the proposed use is listed first. The letter listed second is the buffer that is required on the adjoining property. A "-" means that no bufferyard is required.

E.  Existing adjacent development without bufferyards. Where the adjoining property is already developed and does not have the required bufferyard, the proposed development shall provide a bufferyard of the next most opaque classification than the more opaque of the two bufferyards required (e.g., if the requirement is C/A, and the adjoining property is already developed and does not have a bufferyard, then the developer must install a Type D bufferyard). 
F.  Buffering existing residential development. The city may require an increase in the level of opacity of a bufferyard (e.g., from Type A to Type B) between new residential development and existing residential development, if: 
1.  The lot widths of the new development are less than eighty percent of the lot widths of the nearest lots of the existing development; 
2.  The building height of the new development is more than eight feet taller than the building height of the existing development; or 
3.  The housing types that are located on the lots that abut existing development are different from the housing types of the existing development (e.g., new townhome lots abutting existing single-family detached lots). 
G.  Existing trees, fences and walls. Existing trees, fences and walls may be counted towards bufferyard requirements, provided that the trees are in good health and are not invasive species, and the fences or walls are in good repair. 
H.  Existing landscaping credit. Credit shall be given for existing trees according to the standards of Subsection 17.02.120.8 Canopy tree preservation credit. 
I.  Bufferyards for roads and railroads. The bufferyard standards in Table 17.02.120.7C Bufferyard requirements for roads and railroads, address the type of bufferyard that is required along minor or major arterial, minor or major collector, local streets or railroads.

Chapter 17.04 - NONCONFORMING USES 
Sections: 
 
17.04.160 - Purpose and application of chapter. 
17.04.160.1 Purpose of chapter. Within the districts established by this Zoning Code or amendments thereto, there exist structures, land uses and characteristics of uses which were lawful prior to the adoption of or amendments to this Zoning Code, but which, by reason of such adoption or amendment, fail to conform to the present requirements of the zoning district. It is the purpose of this chapter to: 
A.  Permit the continued operation of such uses while guarding against such uses becoming a threat to more appropriate development; 
B.  Provide for the eventual elimination of those uses likely to be most objectionable to their neighbors, and which are deemed to be harmful to the community environment and not in the best public interest; and 
C.  Limit the number and extent of nonconforming structures by prohibiting their movement, alteration, or enlargement in a manner that would increase the discrepancy between existing conditions and standards prescribed in this Zoning Ordinance, and by regulating their restoration after major damage. 
17.04.160.2 Application of chapter. 
A.  Generally. This chapter applies to uses, buildings, structures, landscaping, parking, and lots that were lawfully constructed or established, but do not conform to the requirements of this Zoning Code. It does not apply to lots of record in the NC subdistricts, regardless of their size (such lots are "conforming"). 
B.  Continuation of existing uses and structures. Section 17.04.170, Continuation of existing uses and structures, applies to legally nonconforming uses and structures, which will remain in existence under the same conditions that were in place when they were constructed or established. 
C.  Nonconforming uses. Section 17.04.180, Nonconforming uses, sets out conditions for enlargement and alteration of buildings housing nonconforming uses, as well as for substitutions or alterations of uses that involve the use but not changes to the structure. The section also determines when a nonconforming use is required to cease operation. 
D.  Nonconforming structures. Section 17.04.190, Nonconforming structures, sets out conditions for enlarging, repairing, or altering a nonconforming structure, and for replacing a damaged nonconforming structure. The section also determines the point at which parking must be brought up to standards. 
E.  Effect of annexation. Section 17.04.200, Effect of annexation, addresses projects that are in process prior to annexation, and their status after annexation. 
(Ord. No. 194-12, § I, 7-25-2012)  
17.04.170 - Continuation of existing uses and structures. 
17.04.170.1 Existing uses and structures. Except as otherwise specified, any use, building, or structure existing when a zoning ordinance amendment rendered the use or structure nonconforming, may be continued, even though such use, building or structure may not conform with the provisions of this title for the district in which it is located; provided, that: 
A.  The use or structure was not established in violation of any zoning regulation previously in effect in the area which constitutes the city, unless such use or structure now conforms with this Zoning Code; and 
B.  Such use or structure does not constitute a nuisance. 
17.04.170.2 Conditional uses. Any use which was a permitted use until the date this Zoning Code changed the use to a use for which a conditional use permit is required in the applicable district shall be and remain a nonconforming use until a conditional use permit is obtained as provided in Subsection 17.05.260.1, Conditional use approvals. 
(Ord. No. 194-12, § I, 7-25-2012)  
17.04.180 - Nonconforming uses. 
17.04.180.1 Enlargement and alteration of nonconforming uses. Except for dwellings, no building existing on the date that this Zoning Code rendered the use nonconforming, that is devoted to a use not permitted in the zoning district in which such building is located, except when required to do so by law or order, shall be enlarged, extended, reconstructed, substituted or structurally altered, unless the use thereof is changed to a use permitted in the district in which such building or premises is located, and except as provided in Subsection 17.04.180.2 Substitution or alteration of a nonconforming use. 
17.04.180.2 Substitution or alteration of a nonconforming use. 
A.  Nonconforming uses shall not be reconstituted or substituted, or substantially altered, unless the use thereof is changed to a use permitted in the district in which such building, structure or land is located, or except upon approval of a conditional use permit by the planning commission pursuant to Subsection 17.05.260.1, Conditional use approval, and to the criteria of this subsection. The proposed alteration of a nonconforming use shall result in a lesser discrepancy between the existing conditions and the zoning requirements for the district based on the following criteria: 
1.  The new use serves a need which is directly related or complementary to permitted uses of the property; 
2.  The new use results in reduced parking, traffic or congestion problems; 
3.  The new use is not to be detrimental to the habitability of adjacent properties throughout the period of its continued use; and 
4.  The new use and resulting general appearance will not detract from the neighborhood character or desirability. 
B.  The planning director may approve a one-time expansion to a light industrial use that is legally nonconforming due to the fact that the property is not zoned for the existing use. Approvals shall be subject to the following: 
1.  The area of expansion shall be consistent with the design review manual; 
2.  Existing storage and areas of outdoor operation shall be fully screened; and 
3.  The site shall be brought up to standards in terms of complying with Subsection 17.03.150.1, Noise; Subsection 17.03.50.2, Vibration; and Subsection 17.03.150.3, Light and glare. 
17.04.180.3 Cessation of use. 
A.  If a nonconforming use ceases for a continuous period of six months, it shall be considered abandoned and shall thereafter be used only in accordance with the regulations for the zoning district in which it is located. 
B.  Abandonment or discontinuance shall include cessation of a use for any reason, regardless of intent to resume the use. 
C.  Nothing in this chapter shall prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of any part of any building or structure declared unsafe by proper authority. 
(Ord. No. 194-12, § I, 7-25-2012)  
17.04.190 - Nonconforming structures and parking. 
17.04.190.1 Replacement of damaged or destroyed nonconforming structures. 
A.  Any nonconforming building or structure that has been damaged by more than sixty percent of its then appraised value for tax purposes, exclusive of the foundations at the time of damage, shall not be restored or reconstructed and used as before such damage or destruction. 
B.  If less than sixty percent of the nonconforming building or structure is damaged above the foundation, it may be restored, reconstructed or used as before; provided, that all restoration or reconstruction shall be substantially completed within six months of such damage or destruction. 
C.  Increasing the square footage of a nonconforming residential structure does not constitute adding to or enlarging for purposes of this section; provided, that no additional dwelling unit is created and such increase otherwise conforms to applicable development standards. 
17.04.190.2 Repairs, alterations and relocation. 
A.  Repairs. Such repairs and maintenance work as required to keep the nonconforming building or structure in sound condition may be made. 
B.  Alterations. 
1.  In general. Enlargements or alterations may be made to a nonconforming structure only if the enlargements or alterations are consistent with all applicable district standards. 
2.  Single-family and duplex structures. Nonconforming single-family and duplex structures may be altered if the structure was legally built prior to the effective date the zoning ordinance amendment rendered the structure nonconforming. 
3.  Accessory structures and garages. Accessory structures, including garages, which were legally built prior to the date a zoning ordinance amendment rendered the structure nonconforming may be altered or expanded, provided the alterations comply with applicable parking requirements. Nonconforming garages or storage buildings may not be expanded to include a habitable space nor converted to a habitable space. 
C.  Relocation. A nonconforming structure shall not be moved unless it conforms to the standards of all applicable district standards at its new location. 
17.04.190.3 Nonconforming parking. 
A.  Single-family and duplex uses. 
1.  Single-family or duplex units which do not have the number or type of parking spaces required, but had the number and type of spaces required at the time the use was approved for construction, are not required to provide additional parking spaces unless additional bedrooms are constructed on the property. The resulting number of parking spaces, including both the existing, remaining parking and the additional parking, shall be in compliance with applicable parking requirements. 
2.  If additional parking is required to an existing unit, the additional parking may be covered or uncovered. 
3.  No existing garage may be converted to other uses or existing parking spaces removed unless the property will comply with applicable parking standards. 
B.  Multifamily uses. 
1.  Multifamily uses that do not have the number of parking spaces required, but had the number of spaces required at the time the use was approved for construction, are not required to provide additional parking spaces unless additional units are constructed on the property or existing units are expanded. 
2.  If units are added or expanded, additional parking shall be added so that the new or expanded units are in compliance with applicable parking standards. 
3.  No existing garage may be converted to other uses or existing parking spaces removed unless the property complies with parking standards of this Code.

e.  Varied elements. Such details may include trims, materials, color, window arrangement (grouping), window fenestration, doors, door lights, window and garage doors, porches, chimneys, bay windows, towers, and balconies, as necessary to create the required variation. The pattern book must include detailed elevations, lists of specific elements to be used, and an explanation of how the elements will be mixed to differentiate nearby buildings. 
f.  Averaged lot width. A pattern book may show that block faces will include lots of varying widths. 
5.  Light and air. The pattern of development, and the open space available on each lot and for the community are such that adequate light and air are provided for residents. 
6.  Pedestrian-orientation. The pattern book shall demonstrate that the residential areas of the development are designed for the comfort and convenience of the pedestrian, with continuous sidewalks; tree-lined, traffic-calmed streets; and architecture that provides street-level interest and accessibility.

The planning commission shall not grant a variance unless and until the following conditions are satisfied: 
1.  There are extraordinary and exceptional conditions pertaining to the subject property because of its size, shape, or topography that are not applicable to other lands or structures in the same district; 
2.  The need for a variance or the extraordinary and exceptional conditions do not result from the actions of the applicant; 
3.  Granting the variance will not confer on the applicant any special privilege that is denied to other lands or structures in the same district; 
4.  A literal interpretation of the provisions of this Zoning Code would deprive the applicant of rights commonly enjoyed by other residents of the district in which the property is located; 
5.  Granting of the variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of this Zoning Code and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare;

C.  Public hearings and legal notification required. The planning commission shall hold at least one public hearing prior to making its recommendation to the city council. The city council shall also hold at least one public hearing on the rezoning request prior to making its decision. Legal notifications for the public hearings shall follow the requirements listed in Appendix B. 
D.  Decision criteria. The city council may approve an application for rezoning after recommendation by the planning commission if: 
1.  The request is consistent with the policies in the general plan; 
2.  The request is consistent with the future land use map of the general plan; 
3.  Public facilities are in place or committed that will provide an acceptable and appropriate level of service for development under the requested zoning classification;

Chapter 17.06 - MEASUREMENTS, CALCULATIONS, WORD USAGE AND DEFINITIONS 
Sections: 
 
17.06.290 - Measurements. 
17.06.290.1 Open space. The following qualify as open space for the purposes of this Zoning Code: 
A.  Outdoor recreation areas. All forms of outdoor recreation areas count as open space, including passive areas and nature reserves, ball fields, tennis courts, swimming pools and golf courses. 
B.  Stormwater facilities. Open air stormwater facilities count as open space. These facilities may be permitted in floodplains even though they are protected from being part of the developed portion of the site. 
C.  Bufferyards. The required bufferyards count as open space. 
D.  Required landscape areas. Required landscape areas, such as parking lot landscaping areas, count as open space. However, landscaping of private lots in residential subdivisions is not counted as open space. 
E.  Agriculture. Agriculture counts as open space in cluster, planned, or conservation cluster development options when it is part of the development plan. 
F.  Resource protection areas. All areas that are protected natural resource count as open space. 
17.06.290.2 Width. 
A.  Generally. Lot width is the distance from one side lot line to the opposite side lot line at the front setback line. See Figure 17.06.290.2A, Measurement of Lot Width; Standard Lots: 
Figure 17.06.290.2A
Measurement of Lot Width; Standard Lots 
  
B.  Corner lots. Lot width (for regulatory purposes) is the distance from the interior side lot line to the side street lot line, measured at the front building line, minus the difference between the street yard setback and the side yard setback. See Figure 17.06.290.2B Measurement of Lot Width; Corner Lots: 
Figure 17.06.290.2B
Measurement of Lot Width; Corner Lots 
  
C.  Irregular lots. Lot width is the distance from one side lot line to the opposite side lot line along the tangent of the curve representing the front building line. See Figure 17.06.290.2C Measurement of Lot Width; Irregular Lots. Generally, the front building line is the front setback line. However, if an alternative front building line has been established on the plat of a subdivision that is more distant than the front setback line from the front property line, then the lot width is measured at the alternative front building line. 
Figure 17.06.290.2C
Measurement of Lot Width; Irregular Lots 
  
17.06.290.3 Setbacks. 
A.  Generally. Setbacks are measured from lot lines towards the center of the lot, as follows: 
1.  Front setbacks are measured from the front lot line. The front lot line is the lot line that abuts the right-of-way from which the lot takes its address. 
2.  Rear setbacks are measured from the rear lot line. The rear lot line is the lot line that is opposite from the front lot line. 
3.  Side setbacks are measured from side lot lines. Side lot lines are lot lines that intersect with front lot lines. 
B.  Flag lots. On flag lots, setbacks are measured as provided in subsection A., above, except that the front setback line is measured from the "shared lot line." See Figure 17.06.290.3, Setback Measurement: 
Figure 17.06.290.3
Setback Measurement 
  
17.06.290.4 Height. 
A.  Buildings. Building height is calculated by measuring the vertical distance from the average finished grade along the front building line to: 
1.  The highest peak or ridge line of the roof for pitched roof styles; or 
2.  The top of the parapet for flat roof styles. 
B.  Other structures. Structure height is calculated by measuring the vertical distance from the average finished grade around the base of the structure to the highest point on the structure. This measurement applies to: 
1.  Structures without roofs (e.g., fences); and 
2.  Amateur radio antennae, whether mounted on a roof, the ground, or another structure. 
C.  Specialized structures and building appurtenances. 
1.  Specialized structures and building appurtenances are not counted in the calculation of building height, provided that: 
a.  They project not more than: 
i.  Fifteen feet above the highest point on the building for buildings that are thirty-five feet in height or higher; or 
ii.  Seven feet above the highest point on the building for buildings that are less than two stories in height. 
b.  They occupy not more than ten percent of the total roof area of the building; and 
c.  They are not used for human habitation, commercial, or industrial purposes, except as incidental to the operation of the building. 
D.  Smokestacks and grain elevators. Smokestacks and grain elevators shall be permitted to a height of ninety feet in the AR, BP, and IN districts. In other districts, they are subject to Subsection C., above. 
17.06.290.5 Floor area. Floor area is measured as the horizontal area of all habitable building floors in square feet, measured from the outside face of all exterior walls.

17.06.300 - Calculations. 
17.06.300.1 Base site area. 
A.  Generally. Base site area is used to calculate gross density. See Subsection 17.06.300.4, Density. 
B.  Calculation. Base site area equals the total area of the parcel proposed for development (gross site area), minus the sum of the areas of the following: 
1.  Land within the planned right-of-way of existing streets or streets that are on the adopted thoroughfare plan of the City of Williams. 
2.  Land that is within major utility rights-of-way that are wider than fifty feet. 
3.  Land that is cut off from development by railroads, limited access highways, waterbodies, or wetlands and is not proposed for development. 
4.  Land that has previously been set aside as protected open space (e.g., subject to a conservation easement, plat restriction, or condition of development approval.). See Figure 17.06.300.1, Illustrative Calculation of Base Site Area: 
Figure 17.06.300.1
Illustrative Calculation of Base Site Area 
  
17.06.300.2 Net buildable area. 
A.  Generally. Net buildable area is used to identify the area of a parcel where development will occur and that is not in the protected open space. 
B.  Calculation. Net buildable area is equal to the lesser of: 
1.  Base site area (calculated as provided in Subsection 17.06.300.1, Base site area) minus areas of open water (streams are measured to the ordinary mean high water mark) and delineated wetlands that were not already subtracted from the area of the parcel proposed for development to calculate the base site area (e.g., wetlands or open water areas that are within previously dedicated conservation easements, or cut off from development by a limited access highway, are not subtracted more than once); or 
2.  The total area of the parcel proposed for development minus the area of open space required for the development type in Subsection 17.06.300.1, Residential area and density and parcel standards. See Figure 17.06.300.2, Illustrative Calculation of Net Buildable Area: 
Figure 17.06.300.2
Illustrative Calculation of Net Buildable Area 
Using a thirty percent open space ratio for illustrative purposes, the net buildable area for the illustration on the left is calculated as base site area minus areas of open water and delineated wetlands; and the net buildable area for the right-hand illustration on the right is calculated as the total area of the parcel proposed for development minus the area of required open space. 
  
17.06.300.3 Open space ratio. 
A.  Generally. OSR refers to open space, which is a measure of "green" space and areas of open water on a parcel proposed for development. 
B.  Calculation of requirement. This subsection sets out how to calculate how much commonly-owned open space is required in a residential development. 
1.  The amount of commonly-owned open space that is required in a residential development is calculated as the required OSR (see Table 17.02.080.1, Residential Area and Density Standards) times the total area of the parcel proposed for development. 
2.  The amount of open space that is required in a nonresidential development is calculated as the required OSR (see Table 17.02.100.2, Nonresidential Open Space and Building Scale) times the total area of the parcel proposed for development. 
3.  The required OSR is a minimum requirement. An increased OSR may result if the sum of the areas required for compliance with bufferyard requirements, natural resource protection requirements, stormwater management requirements, parking lot landscaping requirements, recreation requirements, and state or federal environmental laws is greater than the open space that would be required by application of the minimum OSR. 
C.  Calculation of compliance. This subsection sets out how to calculate the OSR of a proposed development, in order to determine whether it complies with the requirements of this Zoning Code. 
1.  The OSR of a parcel proposed for development is calculated by dividing the total amount of commonly-owned open space on the parcel by the total area of the parcel. See Figures 17.06.290.3A, Illustrative Measurement of Residential Open Space Ratio and 17.06.290.3B, Illustrative Measurement of Nonresidential Open Space Ratio. 
2.  Open spaces that qualify for the calculation of OSR include all areas of commonly-owned open space that are larger than three hundred twenty contiguous square feet in area, including but not limited to: 
a.  Bufferyards (whether required by this Code or not); 
b.  Areas of protected natural resources; 
c.  Stormwater management systems (except enclosed systems); 
d.  Passive recreation areas; and 
e.  Parking lot landscaping. 
3.  Open spaces that do not qualify for the calculation of OSR include any areas on private, buildable lots and any commonly-owned open space that is less than three hundred twenty contiguous square feet. 
Figure 17.06.300.3A
Illustrative Measurement of Residential Open Space Ratio 
EXAMPLE: 6 acres of Common Open Space divided by 12 acre Area of Parcel Proposed for Development equals 50% OSR 
  
Figure 17.06.300.3B
Illustrative Measurement of Nonresidential Open Space Ratio 
EXAMPLE: 5 acres of Bufferyards, Parking Lot Landscaping, and Drainage Facilities divided by 12 acre Area of Parcel Proposed for Development equals 41.7% LSR 
  
17.06.300.4 Density. Density is the number of dwelling units per acre of base site area (see Subsection 17.06.300.1, Base site area). An example calculation is provided in Figure 17.06.300.4 , Illustrative Density Calculations: 
Figure 17.06.300.4
Illustrative Density Calculations 
EXAMPLE: 28 Homes are planned for an 11-acre parcel. 
GROSS DENSITY The parcel proposed for development is 11 acres. 2.5 acres (including forest and open water) were previously dedicated as a conservation easement, and 0.2 acres within planned right-of-way of abutting street. There are no areas within major utility corridors or cut off from development. Therefore, the Base Site Area is 11 - 2.5 - 0.2, or 8.3 acres. 28 homes divided by 8.3 acres equals a gross density of approximately 3.38 units per acre. 
  
17.06.300.5 Lot area. Lot area is the area within the lot lines. See Figure 17.06.300.5, Illustrative Lot Area Calculation: 
Figure 17.06.300.5 
Illustrative Lot Area Calculation 
EXAMPLE The example at right is a rectangular lot. 
80 feet Wide TIMES 125 feet Deep 
EQUALS 10,000 square feet Lot Area 	  
 
17.06.300.6 Building coverage. 
A.  Building coverage. Building coverage is the total of areas taken on a horizontal plane at the main grade level of the principal building and all accessory buildings, exclusive of uncovered porches, terraces and steps. All dimensions are measured between the exterior faces of walls. 
B.  Building coverage ratio. Building coverage ratio is building coverage divided by lot area. See Figure 17.06.300.6, Building Coverage Ratio Illustration: 
Figure 17.06.300.6
Building Coverage Ratio Illustration 
  
17.06.300.7 Maximum applied water allowance. The maximum applied water allowance for existing landscapes shall be calculated as: MAWA = (0.8)(ETo)(LA)(0.62). 
17.06.300.8 Estimated total water use. The estimated total water use shall be calculated using the equation below:

The city planner shall review all development agreements at least every twelve months, or more frequently if the agreement provides, in order to determine whether the developer or successor-in-interest thereto has complied in good faith with its terms. A development agreement may prescribe a procedure for review other than that set forth in this section in the discretion of the city planner or city council. 
(b)  Finding of compliance . If the city planner finds the developer has complied in good faith with the terms of the development agreement, the city planner shall issue a certificate of compliance, which may be recorded by the developer. After expiration of the appeal period hereinafter specified, the review for the applicable period shall be final. 
(c)  Finding of non-compliance . If the city planner, on the basis of substantial evidence, finds the developer has not complied in good faith with the terms of the development agreement, the city planner shall specify in writing to the developer the respects in which the developer has failed to comply, and a reasonable time period for the developer to meet the terms of compliance. If the developer does not take the actions required by the city planner to achieve compliance within the prescribed time limits, the city planner may recommend that the city council modify or terminate the agreement as set forth below.

(e)  Referral to city council. The city planner may refer any review to be conducted by the planner hereunder to the city council. Such referral shall include a staff report describing the city planner's preliminary findings. Upon such referral, the city council shall conduct a noticed public hearing to determine the good faith compliance by the developer with the terms of the development agreement, and shall direct the issuance of a certificate of compliance upon a finding of good faith compliance, or make a determination of non-compliance on the basis of substantial evidence. Any such decision by the city council shall be final. 
(Ord. No. 220-17, 9-20-2017)  
17.09.110 - Cancellation or modification of development agreement. 
(a)  Change in law or regulations .

(b)  By mutual consent . Any development agreement may be cancelled or modified by mutual consent of the parties. Any proposal to cancel or modify a development agreement shall be heard and determined in accordance with the same procedures specified in this subchapter for approval of a development agreement. 
(c)  By the city. 
(1)  If, at any time during the term of a development agreement, the city planner or city council finds, on the basis of substantial evidence, that the developer is not in compliance with the terms and conditions of the agreement and such non-compliance has not been cured despite notice by the city planner to the developer of the manner in which the developer is out of compliance with the agreement and the required corrective measures, the city planner shall request that the city council conduct a public hearing at which the developer must demonstrate a good faith compliance with the terms of the development agreement. 
(2)  The city council shall conduct a noticed hearing on the recommendations of the city planner at which the developer and any other interested person shall be entitled to submit such evidence and testimony as may be relevant to the issue of the developer's good faith compliance. The burden of proof shall be on the developer. If the city council finds, based on substantial evidence, that the developer is not in compliance with the development agreement, it may either cancel the development agreement upon giving sixty days' notice to the developer, or allow the development agreement to be continued by imposition of new terms and conditions intended to remedy such non-compliance. The city council may impose such amended or additional conditions as it deems necessary to protect the interests of the city. The decision of the city council shall be final. 
(d)  Effect of cancellation or termination . In the event that a development agreement should be cancelled or otherwise terminated, all rights of the developer, property owner or successors in interest under the development agreement shall terminate unless otherwise provided in writing. Any and all benefits, including money or land, received by the city pursuant to the development agreement shall be retained by the city. The termination of a development agreement shall not, however, prevent the developer from completing a building or other improvements authorized pursuant to a valid building permit issued prior to the time of termination, but the city may take any action permitted by law to prevent, stop, or correct any violation of law occurring during and after construction, and the developer or any tenant shall not occupy any portion of the project or any building not authorized by a previously issued building permit.

Chapter 17.11 - SIGNS[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note— Ord. No. 212-15, § 1(Exh. A), adopted Jan. 20, 2016, amended Ch. 17.11 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Ch. 17.11, §§ 17.11.010—17.11.160, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from: Ord. 93-95 § 3(part), 1995; Ord. 109-98 § 2, 1998; Ord. 109-98 § 3, 1999; Ord. 135-04 § 2(part), 2004; Ord. 159-07 § 1, 2007; Ord. No. 172-10, § 2, 2010; and Ord. No. 194-12, §§ II—VII, 2012. 
 
17.11.010 - Purpose. 
A.  The purpose of this chapter is to provide minimum standards to safeguard life, health, property, aesthetics and public welfare and safety by regulating and controlling the type, size, number, design, quality of materials, construction, illumination, location and maintenance of all signs in the City of Williams. 
B.  By adopting this chapter, the city intends to balance several competing interests, including: 
1.  To regulate signs in a constitutional manner, with rules that do not regulate protected noncommercial speech by content or favor commercial speech over noncommercial speech; 
2.  To provide adequate opportunity for persons to express themselves by displaying an image or message on a sign; 
3.  To preserve and enhance the aesthetic, traffic safety and environmental values of our community; 
4.  To minimize distraction, obstruction or other impediments to traffic circulation which would be caused by excessive or inappropriately placed signage; 
5.  To safeguard and preserve the health, property, and public welfare of Williams's residents by regulating the physical design, location, and maintenance of signs. 
6.  To provide a method for abatement of illegal and abandoned signs; and 
7.  To implement the General Plan. 
(Ord. No. 212-15, § 1(Exh. A), 1-20-2016)  
17.11.020 - General principles. 
A.  Regulatory scope. This chapter, except for Section 17.11.130 which regulates signs on city property, regulates signs, as defined herein, which are located on or displayed from, private property located within the city as well as signs located on public property owned by public agencies other than the city, over which the city has land use regulatory authority. 
B.  Owner's consent. No sign may be displayed on private property without the consent of the property owner or person holding the present right of possession and control of the property, except that a landlord's consent is not required for a tenant to display signs as specified in Civil Code Section 1940.4. 
C.  Noncommercial messages. There is no location criterion for noncommercial messages that are protected by the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and/or the corollary provisions of the California Constitution. 
D.  Message substitution. Any constitutionally protected noncommercial message may be substituted for any duly permitted or allowed commercial message, or any duly permitted or allowed noncommercial message, provided, that the sign structure or mounting device is legal without consideration of message content. Such substitution of message may be made without any additional approval or permitting. 
E.  Permit generally required. Unless exempted from the sign permit requirement, all signs shall be installed or displayed only pursuant to a sign permit issued by the city. It is unlawful for any person, association, corporation or other entity to erect in any manner within the city a sign, except in conformance with the provisions of this chapter and all other applicable laws, rules and regulations and policies. 
F.  Discretionary approvals. Whenever a sign or a proposed sign is subject to any discretionary review, permit, or approval, such discretion may be exercised only as to the compatibility of the sign within its location, and other structural, architectural and locational factors and consistency with the city's design manual in accordance with Subsection 17.05.270.2.C. of the Zoning Ordinance. 
G.  Administrator interpretations. All interpretations of this chapter shall be exercised in light of message neutrality and message substitution policies. Where a particular type of sign is proposed, and the type is neither expressly allowed nor prohibited by this chapter, or whenever a sign does not qualify as a "structure" as defined in the building code, as adopted by the city, then the planning commission or planning director or his/her designee, as applicable, shall approve, conditionally approve or disapprove the application based on the most similar sign type, using physical and structural similarity, that is expressly regulated by this chapter. 
H.  Compatibility factors. In determining compatibility of a sign with its surrounding environment, the following criteria may be considered: (1) style or character of existing improvements upon the site and properties adjacent to the site; (2) visual elements such as construction materials, physical design details, and the number and spacing of signs in the area; (3) the sign's height, size and location, in relation to its proposed location and use; (5) potential effect of the proposed sign on driver and pedestrian safety; (6) potential blocking of view (whole or partial) of a structure or façade or public view of natural, historical or architectural significance; (7) potential obstruction of views of users of adjacent buildings to side yards, front yards, open space or parks; (8) potential negative impact on visual quality of public spaces, including but not limited to recreation facilities, public squares, plazas, courtyards and the like; (9) whether the sign structure will impose an aesthetically foreign or inharmonious element into the existing skyline or local viewscape. In addition, in accordance with Subsection 17.06.270.2.C. of the Zoning Ordinance, sign review must include evaluation for consistency with certain standards and guidelines contained in the city's design review manual. 
I.  Federally registered marks. The provisions of this chapter shall not require alteration of the display of any registered mark, or any trademark, service mark, trade name, or corporate name that may be associated with or incorporated into a registered mark, where such alteration would require the registered mark to be displayed in a manner differing from the mark as exhibited in the certificate of registration issued by the United States Patent and Trademark Office. However, the city does have discretion to regulate the size of the display in relation to compatibility factors. It is the responsibility of the applicant to establish that a proposed sign includes a registered mark.

2.  Comprehensive sign package. The planning director or designee shall consider and either approve or deny comprehensive sign packages according to the provisions of this chapter, and all other applicable laws, rules, regulations and policies, including all applicable health and safety codes. The planning director or designee may approve a comprehensive sign package application subject to such conditions, modifications or limitations as the planning director or designee deems appropriate to carry out the purposes and goals of this chapter. In accordance with the city's design review procedures, the comprehensive sign package may be subject to review by the design review committee and/or the planning commission. The planning director or designee may also refer comprehensive sign packages to the design review committee and/or planning commission if he/she finds that the proposal may conflict with the purposes and criteria set forth in this chapter. The design review committee, planning commission or planning director or designee as the case may be, may approve a comprehensive sign package if on the basis of the application, plans, materials, and testimony submitted, finds:

B.  Exempt signs. An exemption from a sign installation permit or comprehensive sign package shall not be deemed to grant authorization for the installation of any sign not in compliance with all requirements of this chapter or consistent with the design review manual, nor any provisions of the codes of the city. All signs that have an electrical system shall require an electrical permit issued by the building official. Some signs that may qualify to be exempt from permit requirements may be subject to approval by the planning director. However, if after initial review of a sign that may be listed as exempt is found not to be in compliance with this chapter and/or not consistent with the design review manual, the planning director may qualify the sign as subject to a sign installation permit. Signs that have been deemed subject to a sign installation permit are then subject to all provisions of Section 17.11.040 of this chapter.
