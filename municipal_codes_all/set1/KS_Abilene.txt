(a)   Declaration of Policy. The proper operation of our government requires that public officials and employees be independent, impartial and responsible to the people; that governmental decisions and policy be made in the proper channels and that the public have confidence in the integrity of its government. In recognition of those goals, there is hereby established a Code of Ethics for all officials and employees, whether elected or appointed, paid or unpaid. The purpose of this code is to establish ethical standards by setting forth those acts or actions that are incompatible with the best interests of the city.

(b)   Responsibility of Public Office. Public officials and employees are agents of public purpose and hold office for the benefit of the public. They are bound to uphold the Constitution of the United States and the Constitution of this State and to carry out impartially the laws of the nation, state, and city and thus to foster respect of all government. They are bound to observe in their official acts the highest standards of morality and to discharge faithfully the duties of their office regardless of personal considerations, recognizing that the long term public interest must be their primary concern. The official as well as private conduct of all officers and employees, particularly elected and appointive officers, has consequences for the level of trust citizens have in the honesty and integrity of the city government. Consequently conduct in both official capacities and private affairs must be above reproach.

(c)   Dedicated Service. All officials and employees of the city should be responsive to the political objectives expressed by the electorate and the programs developed to attain those objectives. Appointive officials and employees should adhere to the rule of work and performance established as the standard for their positions by the appropriate authority. Officials and employees should not exceed their authority or breach the law or ask others to do so, and they should work in full cooperation with other public officials and employees unless prohibited form so doing by law or by officially recognized confidentiality of their work.

(d)   Interest in Appointments. Canvassing of members of the Governing Body, directly or indirectly, in order to obtain preferential consideration in connection with any appointment to the municipal service shall disqualify the candidate for appointment, except with reference to positions filled by appointment by the Governing Body.

(e)   Use of Public Property. No official or employee shall request or permit the use of city-owned vehicles, equipment, materials or property for personal convenience or profit, except when such services are available to the public generally or are provided as city policy for the use of such official or employee in the conduct of official business.

(f)   Obligations to Citizens. No official or employee shall grant any special consideration, treatment, or advantage to any citizen beyond that which is available to every other citizen.

(g)   Conflict of Interest. No elected or appointive city official or employee, whether paid or unpaid, shall engage in any business or transaction or shall have a financial or other personal interest, direct or indirect, which is incompatible with the proper discharge of his or her duties in the public interest or would tend to impair his or her independence of judgment or action in the performance of his or her official duties or which can reasonably be expected to have results adverse to financial or other interests of the City.. Personal as distinguished from financial interest includes an interest arising from blood or marriage relationships or close business or political association. Specific conflicts of interest are enumerated below for the guidance of officials and employees:

(1)   Incompatible Employment. No elected or appointive city official or employee shall engage in or accept private employment or render services for private interests when such employment or service is incompatible with the proper discharge of his or her official duties or would tend to impair his or her independence of judgment or action in the performance of his or her official duties.

(2)   Disclosure of Confidential Information. No elected or appointive city official or employee, shall, without proper legal authorization, disclose confidential information concerning the property, government or affairs of the city. Nor shall he or she use such information to advance the financial or other private interest of himself, herself or others.

(3)   Gifts and Favors. No elected or appointive city official or employee shall accept any valuable gift, whether in the form of service, loan, thing or promise, from any person, firm or corporation known to be interested directly or indirectly in any manner whatsoever in business dealings with the city; nor shall any such official or employee accept any gift, favor or thing of value that may tend to influence such official or employee in the discharge of any duties, or grant in the discharge of any duties any improper favor, service, or thing of value. The prohibition against gifts or favor shall not apply to an occasional nonpecuniary gift of only nominal value, an award publicly presented in recognition of public service, or any gift which would have been offered or given if not an official or employee.

(4)   Representing Private Interest before City Agencies or Courts. No elected or appointive city official or employee whose salary is paid in whole or in part by the city shall appear in behalf of private interests before any agency of this city. No such elected or appointive city official or employee shall represent private interests in any action or proceeding against the interest of the city in any litigation to which the city is a party.

4.1 Franchise Fee.

(a)   Grantee shall pay to Franchising Authority a franchise fee equal to five percent {5%) of Gross Revenues received by Grantee on a quarterly basis; provided, however, that Grantee may credit against any such payments: (1) any tax, fee, or assessment of any kind imposed by Franchising Authority on a cable operator, or Subscriber, or both, solely because of their status as such; (2) any tax, fee, or assessment of general applicability which is unduly discriminatory against cable operators or Subscribers (including any such tax, fee, or assessment imposed, both on utilities and cable operators and their services), and (3) any other special tax, assessment, or fee such as a business, occupation, and entertainment tax. For the purpose of this Section, the 12-month period applicable under the Franchise for the computation of the franchise fee shall be a calendar year, unless otherwise agreed to in writing by Franchising Authority and Grantee.

4.2 Rates and Charges.

Grantee and Franchising Authority agree that in the case of a lawful revocation of the Franchise, at Grantee’s request, which shall be made in its sole discretion, Grantee shall be given a reasonable opportunity to effectuate a transfer of its Cable System to a qualified third party. Franchising Authority further agrees that during such a period of time, it shall authorize Grantee to continue to operate pursuant to the terms of its prior Franchise; however, in no event shall such authorization exceed a period of time greater than six (6) months from the effective date of such revocation. If, at the end of that time Grantee is unsuccessful in procuring a qualified transferee or assignee of its Cable System which is reasonably acceptable to Franchising Authority, Grantee and Franchising Authority may avail themselves of any rights they may have pursuant to federal or state law; it being further agreed that Grantee’s continued operation of its Cable System during the six (6) month period shall not be deemed to be a waiver, nor an extinguishment of, any rights of either Franchising Authority or Grantee.

SECTION 5. Compliance and Monitoring

5.1 Books and Records. Grantee agrees that Franchising Authority may review such of Grantee’s books and records, during normal business hours and on a non-disruptive basis, as are reasonably necessary to monitor compliance with the terms hereof. Such records include, but are not limited to, any public records required to be kept by Grantee pursuant to the rules and regulations of the FCC. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary set forth herein, Grantee shall not be required to disclose information which it reasonably deems to be proprietary or confidential in nature. Franchising Authority agrees to treat any information disclosed to it by Grantee as confidential, and to disclose it only to employees, representatives, and agents of Franchising Authority that have a need to know or in order to enforce the provisions hereof. Upon request of the Franchising Authority, Grantee shall file a current map or set of maps, showing the “standard design” and location of all CATV system equipment installed in the City.

SECTION 6. Insurance, Indemnification, and Bonds or Other Surety

6.1 Insurance Requirements. Grantee shall maintain in full force and effect during the term of the Franchise, at its own cost and expense, Comprehensive General Liability Insurance in the amount of $2,000,000 combined single limit for bodily injury and property damage.

6.3 Bonds and other Surety. Except as expressly provided herein, Grantee shall not be required to obtain or maintain bonds or other surety as a condition of being awarded the Franchise or continuing its existence. Franchising Authority acknowledges that the legal, financial and technical qualifications of Grantee are sufficient to afford compliance with the terms of the Franchise and the enforcement thereof. Grantee and Franchising Authority recognize that the costs associated with bonds and other surety may ultimately be borne by the Subscribers in the form of increased rates for Cable Service or other service. In order to minimize such costs, Franchising Authority agrees to require bonds and other surety only in such amounts and during such times as there is a reasonably demonstrated need therefore. Franchising Authority agrees that in no event, however, shall it require a bond or other related surety in an aggregate amount greater than $50,000, conditioned upon the substantial performance of the material terms, covenants, and conditions of the Franchise. Initially, no bond or other surety shall be required. In the event that one is required in the future, Franchising Authority agrees to give Grantee at least sixty (60) days prior written notice thereof stating the exact reason for the requirement. Such reason must demonstrate a change in Grantee’s legal, financial, or technical qualifications which would materially prohibit or impair its ability to comply with the terms of the Franchise or afford compliance therewith.

7.1 Notice of Violation. In the event that Franchising Authority believes the Grantee has not complied with the terms of the Franchise, it shall notify Grantee in writing of the exact nature of the alleged default.

7.3 Public Hearing. In the event that Grantee fails to respond to the notice described in Section 7 .1 pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 7 .2 or in the event that the alleged default is not remedied within sixty (60) days after Grantee is notified of the alleged default pursuant to Section 7.1, Franchising Authority shall schedule a public meeting to investigate the default. Such public meeting shall be held at the next regularly scheduled meeting of Franchising Authority which is scheduled at a time which is no fewer than five (5) business days there from. Franchising Authority shall notify Grantee of the time and place of such meeting and provide Grantee with an opportunity to be heard.

7.4 Enforcement. Subject to applicable federal and state law, in the event Franchising Authority determines, after such meeting, that Grantee is in default of any provision of the Franchise, Franchising Authority may in their discretion, choose one or more of the following:

(a)   Foreclose on all or any part of any security provided under the Franchise, if any, including, without limitation, any bonds or other surety; provided, however, that the foreclosure shall only be in such a manner and in such amount as Franchising Authority reasonably determines is necessary to remedy the default;

(b)   Commence an action at law for monetary damages or seek other equitable relief;

(c)   In the case of a substantial default of a material provision of the Franchise, declare the Franchise to be revoked; Seek specific performance of any provision which reasonably lends itself to such remedy, as an alternative to damages.

7.5 Acts of God. Grantee shall not be held in default of the provisions of the Franchise, nor suffer any enforcement or penalty relating thereto, where such alleged default is caused by strikes, acts of God, power outages, or other events reasonably beyond its ability to control.

SECITON 8. Miscellaneous Provisions

If the FCC or any other federal or state body or agency shall now or hereafter exercise any paramount jurisdiction over the subject matter of the Franchise, then to the extent such jurisdiction shall preempt and supersede or preclude the exercise of the like jurisdiction by Franchising Authority, the jurisdiction of Franchising Authority shall cease and no longer exist. The Franchising Authority and the Grantee agree to negotiate a new franchise ordinance in the event that preemption occurs.

SECTION 1-6 ZONING ADMINISTRATOR

1-601. Except as otherwise provided for herein, these Regulations shall be administered by the Zoning Administrator.

1-602. Office of the Zoning Administrator. A Zoning Administrator shall be appointed by the Governing Body. In the absence of said appointment, the City Manager or his or her designee shall have the authority to serve as the Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator shall be responsible for carrying out his or her duties under these Regulations.

h.    Provide such clerical, technical and consultative assistance as may be required by the Planning Commission, Board of Zoning Appeals and other boards, commission and officials in the exercise of their duties relating to these Regulations.

SECTION 1-7 OFFICIAL ZONING DISTRICT MAP

1-701.

a.    Adoption. The boundaries of the Zoning Districts established by these Regulations are shown on a map or series of maps designated the “Official Zoning District Map of Abilene, Kansas,” and as amended from time to time. The Official Zoning District Map, including all notations, references, data and other information shown on the Official Zoning District Map, is adopted and made a part of these Regulations as fully as if it were included in the pages of these Regulations. The Official Zoning District Map shall be maintained by the Zoning Administrator, in accordance with K.S.A. 12-753. In the case of any dispute regarding the zoning classification of property subject to these Regulations, the original maps maintained by the Zoning Administrator shall govern. The Zoning Administrator is responsible for producing all updates of the Official Zoning District Map.

b.    Floodplain Maps. The Floodplain Management Overlay (FP-O) District is established in Article 28. The FP-O District will be shown and identified on the Official Zoning District Map of the City. The Floodplain Maps, which are maintained by the Zoning Administrator, shall be read in conjunction with the Official Zoning District Map for areas lying within Regulatory Floodways and Regulatory Floodway Fringes. The Floodplain management regulations found in Article 28 apply in addition to the base district zoning regulations for areas within the Regulatory Floodway. Regulatory Floodway and Regulatory Floodway Fringe boundaries are the same as provided by the Federal Insurance Administration on the Dickinson County, Kansas and Incorporated Area Flood Insurance Rate Maps and in the Flood Insurance Study. Actual ground location of Regulatory Floodway and Regulatory Floodway Fringe boundaries shall be verified by the developer by field survey using the reference marks and/or vertical controls provided by the Federal Insurance Administration study.

c.    District Boundaries. Unless otherwise indicated on the Official Zoning District Map, district boundaries follow lot lines, the center lines of streets or alleys or the specified distance from such features, railroad right-of-way lines, or lot lines.

d.    Interpretation of Zoning District and Floodplain Boundaries.

(1)   Where uncertainty exists about the boundaries of a zoning district, or when the street or property existing on the ground is at variance with that shown on the Official Zoning District Map, the Zoning Administrator is authorized to determine the location of such boundaries. The Zoning Administrator's interpretation may be appealed to the Board of Zoning Appeals.

(2)   Where interpretation of Regulatory Floodway or Regulatory Floodway Fringe District boundaries is unclear or disputed, the Zoning Administrator will make the necessary interpretation. The Zoning Administrator’s interpretation may be appealed to the Board of Zoning Appeals. The Regulatory Flood elevation for the point in question will be the governing factor in locating the boundary.

SECTION 1-8 CONFLICTING PROVISIONS

1-801.

a.    Conflict with State or Federal Regulations. If the provisions of these Regulations are inconsistent with those of the State or Federal government, the more restrictive provision will control, to the extent permitted by law. The more restrictive provision is the one that imposes greater development restrictions or more stringent controls. Nothing in these Regulations shall be interpreted as requiring a violation of State or Federal law.

b.    Conflict with Other City Regulations. If the provisions of these Regulations are inconsistent with one another, or if they conflict with other City regulations, the more restrictive provision will control. The more restrictive provision is the one that imposes greater development restrictions or more stringent controls.

c.    Conflict with Private Agreements and Covenants. These Regulations are not intended to abrogate, annul, or otherwise interfere with any easement, covenant, or other private agreement or legal relationship otherwise in conformance with these Regulations.

SECTION 1-9 TRANSITIONAL PROVISIONS

1-901.

a.    Violations Continue. Any violation of the previous zoning regulations of the City will continue to be a violation under these Regulations and will be subject to penalties and enforcement under Article 30 unless the use or development activity is consistent with the express terms of these Regulations, in which case enforcement action will cease, except to the extent of collecting penalties for violations that occurred before the effective date. The adoption of these Regulations does not affect nor prevent any pending or future prosecution of, or action to abate, violations of the previous City laws that occurred prior to the effective date.

b.    Applications Submitted Before the Effective Date. Any use or development activity for which a complete application was submitted to the City before the effective date and pending approval on the effective date may, at the applicant’s option, be reviewed wholly under the terms of the City's zoning laws in effect immediately before the effective date. If approved, such uses or development activities may be carried out in accordance with the standards in effect at the time of application. Any re- application for an expired permit shall meet the standards in effect at the time of re-application.

c.    Permits Issued Before the Effective Date. Any use or development activity for which a permit was duly issued before the effective date may be completed in conformance with the issued permit and other applicable permits and conditions, and such regulations that were in effect at the time the permit was issued, even if such use or development activity does not fully comply with provisions of these Regulations. If the use or development activity is not commenced or completed in accordance with the applicable permit terms, the City may, upon receipt of a written request and payment of the required fee, grant one 6-month time extension. If the use or development activity is not commenced or completed within the time allowed under the original permit or any extension granted, then the use or development activity may be completed or occupied only in compliance with the requirements of these Regulations.

SECTION 1-10 SEVERABILITY

1-1001. If any portion of these Regulations is held to be invalid or unconstitutional by a court of competent jurisdiction, that portion held to be invalid or unconstitutional is to be deemed severed from these Regulations, and in no way will affect the validity of any other portion of these Regulations.

SECTION 1-11 ACTIVITIES GOVERNED BY THESE REGULATIONS

1-1101.

1-1102. Bulk Regulations: No building or other structure shall be erected or altered to exceed height or bulk requirements of these Regulations. Where the maximum structure height is given in both stories and feet, the lesser of the two requirements shall govern.

1-1103. Yard Regulations: No part of a yard or other open space required by these regulations shall be included as a part of a yard or other open space similarly required for any other building. Such yard shall be maintained for open space.

1-1104. Lot Regulations: Every building erected, enlarged or structurally altered shall be located on a lot as herein defined:

a.    No lot area shall be reduced or diminished so that yards or other open spaces shall be smaller than prescribed by these Regulations;

b.    No lot of record shall be reduced or diminished in size, nor shall the density of population be increased in any manner except in the conformity with these Regulations and regulations related thereto; and

c.    Where a lot or tract is used for other than a single-family dwelling, more than one principal use and structure may be located upon the lot or tract, but only when the building or buildings conform to all requirements for the district in which the lot or tract is located.

1-1105. Use Limitations: If a use of any structure is hereinafter changed to another, then the new use must comply with these Regulations.

1-1106. Accessory Structures or Uses: No accessory structures or uses as defined in these Regulations shall hereinafter be built, moved or remodeled, established, altered or enlarged unless such accessory structure or use is permitted by these Regulations.

1-1108. Home Occupations: No home occupation as defined in these Regulations shall be established, altered or enlarged in any residential district unless such home occupation:

a.    Complies with the conditions and restrictions imposed by these Regulation; and

b.    Is not listed as a prohibited home occupation in these Regulations.

1-1109. Signs: No sign shall be built, and no existing signs shall be moved or remodeled unless such sign complies or will thereafter comply with the requirements of these Regulations.

1-1110. Off-Street Parking and Loading: No structure shall be built or moved and no structure or land shall be used, occupied, or designed for use or occupancy unless the minimum off-street parking and off-street loading spaces required by these Regulations is provided. No structure or use already established on the effective date of these Regulations shall be enlarged unless the minimum off- street parking and loading spaces which would be required by these Regulations are provided for the whole structure or use as enlarged.

1-1111. Yard Requirements for Open Land: If a zoning lot is or will be occupied by a permitted use without structures, then the minimum setback and minimum side and rear yards that would otherwise be required for said zoning lots shall be provided and maintained unless some other provisions of these Regulations requires or permits a different minimum setback, front, side or rear yard. The front, side and rear yards shall not be required on zoning lots used for agricultural or garden purposes without structures, or on zoning lots used for open public recreation areas.

SECTION 4-2 “R-1” LOW DENSITY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT

4-201.

The district is intended to accommodate a low population density for specified types of dwelling units on large to medium sized lots with emphasis on adequate open space around buildings.

SECTION 4-3 “R-2” MEDIUM DENSITY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT

4-301.

This district allows for a moderate density for these types of dwelling units.

SECTION 4-4 “R-3” HIGH DENSITY RESIDENTIAL DISTRICT

4-401. The intent of the R-3 District is to provide for a full range of dwelling units, from one-family to apartments and for related residential and certain public uses and also related residential uses and certain public uses. This district is located primarily where moderate to high residential density will be compatible with surrounding uses and development patterns.

SECTION 4-5 “CS” COUNTRYSIDE DISTRICT

4-501. The intent of the CS District is to provide area to accommodate a rural residential lifestyle, with limited future residential development which will provide adequate open space even after full development. The district is intended for one-family detached dwellings and limited related residential and agricultural uses.

SECTION 4-6 “MHS” MANUFACTURED HOUSING SUBDIVISION DISTRICT

4-601. The intent of the MHS District is to provide area for low-density manufactured housing, recognizing the need and demand for alternative housing choices. This district also recognizes that alternative housing types often function best, and maintain optimum property value, when part of a well-planned development.

ARTICLE 7. COUNTRYSIDE DISTRICT (CS)

SECTION 7-1 INTENT

7-101. The “CS” Countryside District is intended to reduce the number of nonconforming properties, both undeveloped and developed, which would otherwise result from the application of these regulations to newly-annexed property and to properties in unincorporated Dickinson County which are within the City's zoning jurisdiction. The CS district will provide a rural residential lifestyle where residents have adequate open space by which to preserve that character. This district is particularly suited for cluster subdivisions developed in accordance with the City’s subdivision regulations.

The district is also intended to allow for limited future single-family residential development without encouraging the premature loss of open space or the loss of land used for agricultural purposes.

7-102. Following the effective date of these Regulations, to be eligible for zoning classification as Countryside, land should be considered on a section (640 acres) basis. Only sections of land which: (1) were comprised of 16 or more tracts, parcels or lots, and each conforming to the relevant zoning regulations and subdivision regulations in effect prior to the effective date of these Regulations and (2) have a minimum of three miles of public roads through or abutting the section, should be zoned Countryside. Land which does not itself meet the above criteria, but which is surrounded by sections of land zoned Countryside, may also be zoned Countryside.

7-103. New lots shall be created within the Countryside District only if constituting 10 or more acres, as provided in Section 7-5.

SECTION 7-2 PERMITTED USES

7-201. In the Countryside District no building, structure, land or premises shall be used and no building or structure shall be hereafter erected, constructed, reconstructed, moved or altered, except for the following uses:

SECTION 7-5 HEIGHT, AREA AND YARD

7-501. Height: Buildings or structures other than those actually used for agricultural purposes shall not exceed 35 feet and/or two and one-half (2 1/2) stories in height.

7-502. In the Countryside District, the minimum dimensions of lots and yards shall be as follows:

a.     Lot Area: For every lot created after _____________, 20__ , the minimum lot area shall be 10 acres with 600 feet or more of frontage on a public road. In cases where unusual lot configuration or dedications for public uses have created a lot of less than 10 acres, the Zoning Administrator shall determine whether the lot area nonetheless meets the spirit and intent of this requirement.

b.    Lot Dimensions: For every lot created after _____________, 20__ , the minimum width of a lot shall be 600 feet. The minimum depth of a lot shall be 600 feet. There shall not be a lot depth-to-width ratio greater than 4:1 (i.e. the depth of a lot cannot be greater than 4 times its width). In the event of unusual lot configurations, the Zoning Administrator shall determine whether the lot dimensions nonetheless meet the spirit and intent of this requirement.

SECTION 16-1 INTENT

16-101. It is the intent of the Planned Unit Development Overlay (PUD-O) District to encourage innovation in residential, commercial and industrial development by greater variety in type, design and layout of buildings, to encourage a more efficient use of land reflecting changes in the technology of land development; to encourage the expansion of urban areas incorporating the best features of modern design while conserving the value of the land; and to provide a procedure which relates the type, design and layout of development to the particular site and the particular demand at the time of development in a manner consistent with the preservation of property values within established neighborhoods.

The PUD-O District is an overlay zone. The developer shall submit preliminary and final development plans in accordance with the provisions and conditions set out in this Article.

SECTION 16-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS

16-201. A planned unit development shall be in general conformity with the provisions of the City’s Comprehensive Plan, and shall not have a substantially adverse effect on the development of the neighboring area. The plan shall consist of a preliminary plan for development of the entire tract and for a final plan of development for individual portions of the plan.

a.    Permitted uses. The applicant may propose any mixture of land uses including residential, commercial, and/or industrial uses.

b.    Size. The minimum size allowed for a planned unit development shall be two (2) acres.

c.    Bulk regulations including front, rear and side yard setbacks, and structure height. Generally consistent with the existing zoning district on the proposed site, but may be varied for a specific site as proposed by the developer when so approved.

d.    Parking. Off-street parking and loading areas shall be provided for all uses within the district in accordance with the requirements of these regulations, unless it is determined by the Planning Commission and the Governing Body that other parking ratios are more appropriate for a specific proposal.

SECTION 16-3 SPECIFIC STANDARDS AND CONDITIONS

16-301.

a.    The applicant shall satisfy the Planning Commission that he or she has the ability to carry out the proposed plan and shall prepare and submit a schedule of construction. The proposed construction shall begin within a period of eighteen (18) months following approval of a final plan by the Governing Body. The time period established for the commencing of the plan may be modified from time to time by the Planning Commission upon the showing of good cause by the developer. In the event the landowner shall fail to commence the planned unit development within eighteen (18) months after final approval has been granted by the Governing Body, such approval shall terminate and shall be deemed null and void unless such time period is extended by the Planning Commission upon written application by the landowners.

b.    The site shall be accessible from public roads that are adequate to carry the traffic that will be generated by the proposed development. The streets and driveways on the site of the development shall be adequate to serve the residents or occupants of the proposed development. Streets may be either public or private streets, however all private streets shall be of a size that will carry anticipated traffic and shall be paved. If it is determined that traffic control signals are required to prevent traffic hazards or congestion upon adjacent streets, the control signals shall be provided at the developer's expense.

c.    The development shall not impose an undue burden on public services and facilities.

d.    The application for a planned unit development shall be signed by all owners of the land at the time of application. The plan may have areas designated for sale after platting or development.

e.

(2)   Development means any man-made change to improved or unimproved real estate, including but not limited to buildings or other structures, levees, levee systems, mining , dredging, filling, grading, paving, excavation or drilling operations, or storage of equipment or materials.

(3)   Substantial improvement means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the start of construction of the improvement. This term includes structures, which have incurred substantial damage, regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either:

(i)    any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations of state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications that have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions, or

(ii)   Any alteration of a historic structure, provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure.

(4)   Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to pre-damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty (50) percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred.

(5)   Historic structure means any structure that is: (a) listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the department of interior) or preliminarily determined by the secretary of  the  interior as  meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register ; (b) certified or preliminarily determined by the secretary of the interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; (c) individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the secretary of the interior ; or (d) individually listed on a local inventory of historic places under a historic preservation program that has been certified either:

12-1402.   Critical drainage areas. Critic al drainage areas may be designated by the board of city commissioners following a report and recommendation from the planning commission. The city engineer shall identify areas that should be considered for designation as critical drainage areas. No development or substantial improvement may be undertaken within a critical drainage area without first obtaining a permit from the zoning administrator. The zoning administrator shall not approve any development which does not provide adequate drainage improvements so as not to inordinately expose the development as well as surrounding land to increased stormwater flooding. The drainage improvements shall be designed in accordance with criteria established by the city engineer. The city engineer shall review proposed drainage improvement plans and advise the zoning administrator if such plans comply with established criteria. The completion of said improvements shall be the responsibility of the applicant. This regulation shall not apply to any platted lot zoned single­ family residential, regardless of size, nor any platted lot containing less than ten thousand (10,000) square feet of land area, regardless of the zoning classification.

ARTICLE 21. NONCONFORMITIES

SECTION 21-1 GENERAL PROVISIONS

21-101. Nonconformities are of three types: nonconforming lots of record, nonconforming structures and nonconforming uses. Regulations governing nonconforming manufactured homes are set forth at Section 21-5. Types of nonconformities are defined as follows:

a.    Nonconforming lots of record: Means an unimproved lot which is part of a recorded subdivision or a parcel of land, the deed to which was recorded with the Dickinson County Register of Deeds prior to the City’s adoption of these Regulations and neither said lot nor parcel complies with the lot width and/or area requirements for the district in which it is located.

b.    Nonconforming structure: Means an existing structure which does not comply with the lot coverage, height or yard requirements which are applicable to new structures in the zoning district in which the structure is located.

c.    Nonconforming use: Means an existing, lawful use of a structure or land which does not comply with the use regulations applicable to new uses in the zoning district in which it is located.

SECTION 21-2 NONCONFORMING LOTS OF RECORD

21-201. The Zoning Administrator, upon request of the property owner, shall issue a zoning certificate for any nonconforming lot of record, provided that:

a.    The lot is shown by a recorded plat or deed to have been owned separately and individually from adjoining tracts of land at a time when the creation of a lot of such size and width at such location would not have been prohibited by any zoning regulations, and

b.    The lot has remained in separate and individual ownership from adjoining tracts of land continuously during the entire time that the creation of such lot has been prohibited by the applicable zoning regulations.

SECTION 21-3 NONCONFORMING STRUCTURES

21-301.

a.    Authority to continue. Any structure that is devoted to a use which is permitted in the zoning district in which it is located, but which is located on a lot which does not comply with the applicable intensity of use regulations and/or the applicable yard and height regulations, may be continued, so long as it remains otherwise lawful.

b.    Enlargement, repair, alterations. Any nonconforming principal structure may be enlarged, maintained, repaired or remodeled. No such enlargement, maintenance, repair or remodeling shall either create any additional nonconformity or increase the degree of existing nonconformity of all or any part of such structure. An enlargement which does not, in the Zoning Administrator’s determination, extend the nonconformity beyond the existing nonconformity shall not be an additional nonconformity or an increase in the degree of nonconformity.

c.    Damage or destruction. In the event that any nonconforming principal structure is damaged or destroyed, by any means, to the extent of more than fifty (50) percent of its fair market value, such structure shall not be restored unless it shall thereafter conform to the regulations for the zoning district in which it is located.

d.    Moving. No nonconforming structure shall be moved in whole or in part for any distance whatever, to any other location on the same lot or any other lot unless the entire structure shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the zoning district in which it is located after being moved.

SECTION 21-4 NONCONFORMING USES

21-401.

a.    Authority to continue. Any nonconforming use of part or all of a structure or any nonconforming use of land which was lawful and in existence at the effective date of these regulations may be continued, so long as otherwise lawful and so long as it is not specified to be terminated by these regulations.

b.    Ordinary repair and maintenance.

1.    Normal maintenance and incidental repair, or replacement, installation or relocation of walls, partitions, fixtures, wiring or plumbing, may be performed on any structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use.

2.    Nothing in these regulations shall be deemed to prevent the strengthening or restoring to a safe condition of a structure in accordance with an order of a public official who is charged with protecting the public safety and who declares such structure to be unsafe and orders its restoration to a safe condition.

c.    Extension. A nonconforming use shall not be extended, expanded, enlarged, or increased in intensity. Such prohibited activities shall include, without being limited to the following:

1.    Extension of such use to any structure or land area other than that actually physically occupied by such nonconforming use on the effective date of these regulations or on the effective date of subsequent amendments to these regulations that cause such use to become nonconforming.

2.    Extension of such use within a building or other structure to any portion of the floor area that was not actually physically occupied by such nonconforming use on the effective date of these regulations or on the effective date of subsequent amendments to these regulations that cause such use to become nonconforming; provided, however, that such use may be extended throughout any part of such building or other structure that is found by the Zoning Administrator to have been lawfully and manifestly designed or constructed for such use on such effective date.

d.    Enlargement. No structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use shall be enlarged or added to in any manner unless such structure and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to the regulations of the district in which it is located.

e.    Damage or destruction. In the event that any structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use is damaged or destroyed, by any means, to the extent of more than fifty (50) percent of its fair market value, such structure shall not be restored unless such structure and the use thereof shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which it is located.

f.     Moving. No structure that is devoted in whole or in part to a nonconforming use and no nonconforming use of land shall be moved in whole or in part for any distance whatever, to any other location on the same or any other lot, unless the entire structure and the use thereof or the use of land shall thereafter conform to all regulations of the zoning district in which it is located after being so moved.

g.    Change in use. Any change in use from nonconforming use to a different nonconforming use is prohibited if the Zoning Administrator determines that such a change would increase the degree of nonconformity with the applicable zoning regulations.

h.    Abandonment or discontinuance. When a nonconforming use is discontinued or abandoned for a period of twelve (12) consecutive months, such use shall not thereafter be reestablished or resumed, and any subsequent use or occupancy of such land or buildings shall comply with the regulations of the zoning district in which such land is located.

i.     Nonconforming accessory uses. No nonconforming use which is accessory to a principal nonconforming use shall continue after the abandonment or discontinuance of the principal nonconforming use.

Upon removal of a nonconforming manufactured home, unless another manufactured home, manufactured no more than fifteen (15) years previously, is moved onto the same lot within thirty (30) days from the date that the previous manufactured home was moved off the lot, such use is forfeited and shall not thereafter be reestablished.

b.    Any manufactured home moved in accordance with a. above shall be placed on a permanent, enclosed perimeter foundation within thirty (30) days from the date it is moved onto the lot.

c.    No manufactured home moved in accordance with a. above shall be moved onto a lot if such will result in an increase in nonconformity with respect to lot size, yard or bulk requirements.

d.    No manufactured home moved in accordance with a. above shall be moved onto a lot if its location shall place it within twenty feet (20') of a principal building or ten feet (10') of an accessory building.

e.    Upon proper application the Board of Zoning Appeals may grant an exception to the time requirements of subsections a. and b. above upon a finding by the Board of hardship for the party who would reside in the manufactured home upon its relocation.

21-502. Relocation of a nonresidential-design manufactured home as a replacement for another such home, when located on property in actual use as a manufactured home park, but not zoned as such as of the effective date of these regulations, is allowed in accordance with the following regulations:

ARTICLE 22. OFF-STREET PARKING, LOADING AND UNLOADING REGULATIONS

SECTION 22-1 PURPOSE

22-101.     These regulations require off-street parking proportional to the need created by each use in order to ensure functionally adequate, aesthetically pleasing, and secure off-street parking facilities. Regulations and standards are intended to ensure usefulness of parking and loading facilities, to protect public safety, and where appropriate, to limit potential adverse impacts on adjacent property.

SECTION 22-2 GENERAL PROVISIONS

22-201.     Applicability. Off-street parking facilities, as required in this Article, shall be provided for any new building and for any new use established, additions to existing use, or any change in manner of use which results in increased capacity. Additional parking need only be provided for the addition, enlargement, or change and not the entire building or use. No off-street parking facilities shall be required in the C-4 Central Business District.

22-202.     Maintenance. All existing and required parking facilities shall be maintained and shall not be reduced so long as the use requiring such parking remains.

22-203.     Utilization. Required off-street parking facilities shall be located on the same site as the use for which such facilities are required, except as authorized by Section 22-6. Such facilities shall be used exclusively for temporary parking of motor vehicles and shall not be utilized for sale or storage of merchandise, or for storage or repair of vehicles, equipment or trailers.

22-204.     Residential districts. Parking facilities which make provisions for more than three (3) vehicles shall not be located within the required front yard for the district.

22-205.     Computation. Where the determination of number of off-street parking spaces required results in a fractional part of a space, a fraction of one-half or more shall be counted as a full space and a fraction of less than one-half shall be disregarded. Where requirements are established on the basis of seats or person capacity, the provisions of the City-adopted building code applicable at the time shall be used to calculate maximum design capacity.

22-206.     Zoning Administrator. The Zoning Administrator is authorized to approve minor variations from the location, size and number of parking spaces otherwise required under this Article when, in his or her discretion, such variation does not violate the purpose of these regulations and does not harm public health, safety or welfare. The Zoning Administrator is specifically authorized to allow some required parking spaces on commercial properties to be used, for a fixed number of days, for temporary sales purposes, including but not limited to lawn and garden and other seasonal materials.

SECTION 22-3 LAYOUT AND DESIGN REQUIREMENTS

22-301.     Area size. Each required parking space shall consist of a rectangular area of not less than nine (9) feet in width, by nineteen (19) feet in length.

22-302.     Access. Except in R-1 and R-2 districts, each required off-street parking space shall open directly upon an aisle or driveway of such width and design as to provide safe and efficient means of vehicular access to such parking space. Streets and alleys shall be used only for access to and from parking facilities and shall not be used for maneuvering of vehicles. Any alley used for access to other than a single-family residence shall be paved according to City-adopted specifications.

22-303.     Design standards. Minimum parking facility design standards shall comply with Section 22-7.

22-304.     Driveways. Driveway location and spacing shall comply with the Corridor Management Policy Manual of the Kansas Department of Transportation. Site plans for commercial properties shall include a traffic impact analysis and an internal traffic circulation plan making full use of shared entrances.

22-305.     Surfacing. All off-street parking facilities, loading areas, vehicular storage areas and drives and access to and from such areas shall be surfaced and maintained with four (4) inches of asphalt, or concrete to create a permanent all-weather, dust-free surface. Such paving must be completed prior to occupancy of the facility that the paving is intended to serve, unless temporary occupancy approval is received from the Zoning Administrator. An exception to the surfacing requirements may be granted by the Board of Zoning Appeals in instances where the off-street areas take access from a graveled public street.

Gravel areas in existence prior to the effective date of these regulations may be maintained with six (6) inches of gravel, including base, as an alternative to these surfacing requirements.

The Zoning Administrator may, upon receiving a specific written request from an owner of a property, authorize temporary occupancy for a time period not to exceed twelve (12) months prior to accomplishing the required paving or a portion thereof.

In reviewing a request for temporary occupancy prior to accomplishing required paving, the Zoning Administrator shall consider the following criteria:

a.    Season of the year.

b.    Affect on the adjoining property.

c.    Surfacing of the connecting street.

d.    Surfacing of existing adjoining parking facilities.

Should the owner receive approval of the Zoning Administrator for a delay in paving, the owner shall, prior to occupancy, present written verification to the Zoning Administrator that guarantees all paving shall be complete prior to the deadline given by the Zoning Administrator.

22-306.     Lighting. Any lighting provided to illuminate any parking facility shall be designed and installed in such a manner as to reflect away from any residential use upon adjoining properties.

22-307.     Drainage. All parking facilities shall be graded and/or designed with storm drainage facilities so as to channel surface water away from adjoining properties and to an approved storm drainage system.

22-308.     Parking facilities in residential districts. Any parking facilities for eight (8) or more vehicles (1) when in residential zoning districts and (2) which are adjacent to a residential or manufactured home-zoned district, shall have a screened fence or wall to prevent the passage of vehicular lights and to prevent the blowing of debris. Such fence or wall shall be at least six (6) feet in height and have a visual density of not less than seventy percent (70%).

SECTION 22-4 PERMIT REQUIRED

ARTICLE 23. AIRPORT OVERLAY DISTRICT (AP-O)

SECTION 23-1 PURPOSE

23-101.     An airport hazard endangers the lives and property of users of the Abilene Municipal Airport and of occupants of land in its vicinity, and also, if of the obstruction type, in effect reduces the size of the area available for the landing, taking-off and maneuvering of aircraft, thus tending to destroy or impair the utility of the airport and the municipal investment of interest therein. Accordingly, it is hereby declared:

a.    The creation or establishment of an airport hazard is a public nuisance and an injury to the community served by the Abilene Municipal Airport;

b.    It is in the interest of public health, safety, and general welfare that the creation or establishment of airport hazards be prevented. Both the prevention of the creation or establishment of airport hazards and the elimination, removal or alteration, mitigation, or marking and lighting of existing airport hazards are public purposes for which the City may raise and expend public funds and acquire land or property purposes therein, as provided in K.S.A. 3-702.

25-401.     The Board of Zoning Appeals shall have the power to authorize in specific cases a variance from the specific terms of these regulations which will not be contrary to the public interest and where, owing to special conditions, a literal enforcement of the provisions of these regulations will, in an individual case, result in unnecessary hardship, provided the spirit of these regulations shall be observed, public safety and welfare secured, and substantial justice done. Such variance shall not permit any use not permitted by the zoning regulations in such district.

The board shall make a determination on each condition, and the finding shall be entered in the record:

1.    The variance requested arises from a condition which is unique to the property in question and which is not ordinarily found in the same zone or district; and is not created by action of the property owner or applicant.

2.    The granting of the permit for the variance will not adversely affect the rights of adjacent property owners or residents.

3.    The strict application of the provisions of the zoning regulations of which the variance is requested will constitute unnecessary hardship upon the property owner represented in the application.

4.    The variance desired will not adversely affect the public health, safety, morals, order, convenience, prosperity or general welfare.

5.    The granting of the variance desired will not be opposed to the general spirit and intent of the zoning regulations.

d.    Variance from the Floodplain Regulations: The Board shall have the authority to grant variances from the City of Abilene Floodplain Regulations provided, however, that in addition to the conditions established in this section, the board, in passing upon variance applications in the floodplain, shall consider those evaluations, factors, standards, and criteria specified in the City of Abilene Floodplain Zoning Regulations.

SECTION 25-11 ZONING ADMINISTRATOR; POWERS AND DUTIES

25-1101.   Administration of Regulations.

a.    The Zoning Administrator is the City’s officer responsible for carrying out the duties and responsibilities of administering the City’s zoning and subdivision regulations. In general the Zoning Administrator shall inspect structures and uses of land to determine compliance with the provisions of such regulations and any application made pursuant to those regulations.

b.    The Zoning Administrator shall:

1.    Compile and maintain the official text of the City’s zoning and subdivision regulations and the zoning maps and any amendments thereto.

2.    Receive, file, review, make recommendations on, and forward for action all applications for, and appeals of, rezonings, conditional use permits, subdivision plats and variances. The Zoning Administrator shall have such authority as is necessary to request and acquire from an applicant or appellant information needed for the processing of such applications and appeals, including land surveys.

3.    Maintain zoning and subdivision administration records.

4.    Issue permits and review permit applications made pursuant to the City’s zoning and subdivision regulations.

5.    Approve or disapprove requests for administrative variances in accordance with Section 25-10 of these Regulations.

6.    Provide such technical and secretarial assistance as is required by the Planning Commission, Board of Zoning Appeals and City Commission and other boards and commissions in the exercise of their duties relating to these Regulations.

7.    Advise the Planning Commission and the City Commission on the adequacy of the comprehensive plan and zoning and subdivision regulations, and at least annually make recommendations to the Planning Commission concerning the same.

8.    Ensure that public notice is provided for proceedings related to applications made pursuant to these Regulations.

9.    Advise the City Attorney of possible violations of these Regulations.

25-1102.   Investigation and Enforcement Procedure. The Zoning Administrator shall investigate, document, provide notice of violations, and provide technical advice to the City Commission regarding the enforcement of these Regulations. Documentation collected and retained under this Section comprises the public record and may be used to establish clear, satisfactory and convincing evidence necessary for prosecution.

a.    Investigation - Upon gaining knowledge of a potential violation of these Regulations, the Zoning Administrator shall cause to be made a record of all investigations necessary to substantiate that a violation continues to occur. The investigation record must include at a minimum the following documentation:

1.    Maps;

2.    Photos;

3.    Record of correspondences;

4.    Provisions of these Regulations being violated;

5.    Ownership information;

6.    Other documentation deemed necessary by the Zoning Administrator.

b.    Violation Notice - Once sufficient documentation has been assembled and a violation is deemed to exist by the Zoning Administrator, a “Notice of Violation” letter will be sent to the legal owner and lessee of the property on which the violation exists. The “Notice of Violation” letter must be sent by certified United States mail. In the event that the certified mail notice is not claimed, the notice must be hand delivered by the Abilene Police Department. The Notice of Violation letter must indicate:

1.    The nature and location of the violation;

2.    The provisions of these Regulations being violated;

3.    A description of actions that can be taken to correct the violation;

4.    A reasonable time period of not less than 10 days during which the violation may be voluntarily abated by the property owner; and

5.    A date or range of dates during which a site visit to verify the continued violation will occur. Such date must occur after the time frame given for voluntary corrective measures.

The Zoning Administrator or designee will visit the site of the violation and will verify the continued existence of the violation. Partial correction of the violation does not constitute a new violation regardless of the diminished scope and intensity of the violation. If said violation persists, a report and the record on the violation will be forwarded to the City Commission, City Attorney, City Manager and Planning Commission Chairman. Upon deliberation, the City Commission may seek judicial remedies provided in Article 30.

25-1103.   Right of Entry. The Zoning Administrator, or designee, shall have the right to enter upon any premises at any reasonable time for the purpose of carrying out his or her duties in the investigation and enforcement of these Regulations.

ARTICLE 26. AMENDMENT PROCEDURES

SECTION 26-1 GENERAL AUTHORITY AND PROCEDURE

26-101.     Who May Petition or Apply.

a.    Applications for amendments, revisions or changes in the zoning district boundary maps (rezonings) or for a Conditional Use Permit may be made by any person who owns the land for which such an amendment, revisions, change or Conditional Use Permit is sought, or by the owner's agent. If such application is made by the owner's agent, that agent shall enter upon the application the name and current mailing address of the owner and shall submit written authorization to act as agent for the owner prior to the setting of any public hearing.

b.    Applications for amendments, revisions or changes to the zoning regulations, the zoning district boundary maps and/or conditional use may also be made by the Planning Commission or the Governing Body. Any such proposed amendments, revisions, changes, or conditional use shall be submitted to the Planning Commission for recommendation and report with the final decision made by the Governing Body.

26-102.     Procedures for Consideration of Request for Amendments, Revisions or Changes.

a.    All applications or requests for amendments, revisions or changes to the zoning regulations, the zoning district boundary maps or for a Conditional Use Permit shall be made to the Zoning Administrator on such forms as provided and acceptable to the Zoning Administrator. The payment of any applicable fee shall be made at the time of the submission of the application.

       Immediately upon receipt of an application for rezoning or conditional use by the owner, or agent, and the payment of the appropriate fee, the Zoning Administrator shall note on the application the date of filing and make a permanent record thereof.

b.    All such proposed applications for amendment, revisions or changes to the zoning regulations and/or for a conditional use shall be submitted to the Planning Commission for recommendation. The Planning Commission shall hold a public hearing on the application and shall cause a written summary to be made of the proceedings. Notice of the hearing shall be published once in the official city newspaper at least 20 days prior to the date of the hearing. The date of newspaper publication and the date of the hearing shall not be included in the calculation of 20 days. Notice shall fix the time and place for the hearing, shall give the name and address of the applicant, and shall contain a statement regarding the proposed changes in regulations or restrictions, or proposed change in the boundary or classification of any zone or district, or the requested conditional use.

c.    If the application is not a general amendment, revision or change to the zoning regulations, but is for a rezoning or Conditional Use Permit affecting specific property, the property affected shall be designated by legal description and by a general description sufficient to identify the property under consideration. In addition to such publication notice, written notice of the proposed rezoning or conditional use shall be mailed at least 20 days before the public hearing to all owners of record of the property affected and all owners of record of lands located within at least 200 feet of the area proposed to be altered. In accordance with state law such notice shall extend 1000 feet in those areas where the notification area extends outside the corporate limits of the City. All notices shall include a statement that a complete legal description is available for public inspection in the office of the Zoning Administrator. When the notice has been properly addressed and deposited in the mail, failure of a party to receive such notice shall not invalidate any subsequent action taken by the Planning Commission and shall not invalidate any subsequent action taken by the Planning Commission or Governing Body. The applicant shall provide a list of the owners of record of said lands at the time of the filing of the application. The Zoning Administrator may require that such list be certified by a licensed abstractor.

d.    In the case of an application by the Planning Commission or the Governing Body, all the above stated requirements shall be followed except:

1.    No fee shall be required.

2.    If the application is for an amendment or revision to the text of the zoning regulations, notice of the public hearing shall not be required to be mailed to all affected persons; therefore, a certified list of the owners of land shall not be required.

26-103.     Public Hearing Before Planning Commission.  The Planning Commission shall hold the public hearing at the place and time so stated within the legal notice. The hearing may be adjourned from time to time, and at the conclusion of the hearing the Planning Commission shall take action on the request by preparing a recommendation either to approve, approve with conditions as authorized by these regulations, or disapprove the application. Any such action must be approved by a majority of the members of the Planning Commission present and voting at the hearing.

When the Planning Commission fails to make a recommendation on an application, the Planning Commission shall be deemed to have made a recommendation of disapproval. Any hearing may, for good cause at the request of the applicant, or in the discretion of the Planning Commission, be continued.

26-104.     Action by Planning Commission and Governing Body.

a.    Recommendations. Upon the conclusion of the public hearing, the Planning Commission shall prepare and adopt its recommendations and shall submit the same, together with a record of the hearing thereon, to the Governing Body. The recommendation may be for approval, disapproval or approval in part and reasons for the recommendations shall be included. If a motion for approval fails to gain approval for any reason, the application is deemed to have been denied and will be submitted to the Governing Body. If the recommendation is for approval, the recommendation made to the Governing Body shall be in the form of an ordinance.

b.    Amendments to text. When a proposed amendment would result in a change in the text of these regulations, but would not result in a change of zoning classification of any specific property, the recommendation of the Planning Commission shall contain a statement as to the nature and effect of such proposed amendment and its reasons for recommending approval or denial.

c.    Adoption of amendments. The Governing Body shall not consider an amendment which would result in a change of zoning classification for a specific property, or any application for a Conditional Use Permit, until its next regular meeting after the lapse of the fourteen (14) day protest period provided by state law. A proposed amendment which changes the text of the regulations but would not result in change of zoning classification of any specific property may be considered by the Governing Body without waiting for the lapse of the fourteen (14) day protest period. Upon receipt of the recommendation of the Planning Commission and any protest petitions that have been submitted, the Governing Body shall consider the application and may 1) approve the recommendation of the Planning Commission without change; 2) override the Planning Commission's recommendation by a 2/3 majority vote of the membership of the Governing Body; or 3) return such recommendation to the Planning Commission with a statement specifying the basis for the Governing Body’s failure to approve or disapprove. Upon return of a recommendation from the Planning Commission, the Governing Body may take whatever action it deems necessary. Whenever a proposed amendment is defeated by vote of the Governing Body, such amendment shall not thereafter be passed without a further public hearing and notice thereof as provided in this article.

d.    If such amendment or Conditional Use Permit affects the boundaries of any zone or district, the ordinance shall describe the boundaries as amended, or if provision is made for the fixing of the same upon the official maps which have been incorporated by reference, the amending ordinance shall define the change or the boundary as amended, shall order the official maps be changed to reflect such amendment or conditional use, shall amend the section of the ordinance incorporating the same and shall reincorporate such maps as amended.

e.    In its consideration of an amendment to a zoning classification or a Conditional Use Permit the Governing Body shall rely upon the record as prepared by the Planning Commission, such record to be supplemented only by information provided by City staff. Additional new information for Governing Body consideration shall be allowed only upon findings by the Governing Body that (1) good cause exists as to why the evidence or testimony sought to be presented to the Governing Body was not presented to the Planning Commission and (2) it is in the best interests of both the applicant and the public that the evidence or testimony be presented to the Governing Body rather than having the matter sent back to the Planning Commission for its consideration of the evidence or testimony.

26-105.     Protest Petition. Regardless of whether or not the Planning Commission recommends approval or disapproval of a proposed zoning amendment, revision, change, or Conditional Use Permit, if a protest petition against such amendment is filed in the office of the City Clerk within fourteen (14) days after the date of the conclusion of the public hearing pursuant to the publication notice, signed by the owners of twenty (20) percent or more of any real property proposed to be rezoned or by the owners of record of twenty (20) percent or more of the total area, excepting public streets and ways, which is located within the notification area described in Section 26-102, the ordinance adopting such amendment shall not be passed except by at least a 3/4 majority vote of all the members of the Governing Body.

26-106.     Limitations on Successive Applications. Provisions for a limitation on successive applications to the Planning Commission shall be as follows:

a.    No application for an amendment to these regulations including the zoning map shall be accepted by the Planning Commission if an application for the same amendment has been denied by the Planning Commission within the preceding twelve (12) months. The withdrawal of an application after it has been advertised for public hearing shall constitute a denial of the application just as if the public hearing had been held and concluded. For good cause shown by the applicant the Governing Body may waive the twelve (12) month requirement.

b.    Irrespective of the preceding subsection, an application for a rehearing may be accepted by the Planning Commission if in the judgment of the Planning Commission substantial justification is given. All such applications for a rehearing must be submitted to the secretary at least fifteen (15) days in advance of the next regularly scheduled meeting of the Planning Commission following the denial of the application. If the Planning Commission at such meeting determines that there has been substantial change or justification for a rehearing, the item will be advertised and a public hearing held at the next regular scheduled meeting of the Planning Commission.

26-107.     Posting of Sign. An applicant for a rezoning or for a Conditional Use Permit may be required by the Zoning Administrator to place a sign upon the lot, tract or parcel of land for which the application was filed. Said sign shall be furnished by the Zoning Administrator to the applicant and the applicant shall display the sign as instructed by the Zoning Administrator. Failure to comply with this requirement shall not deprive the Planning Commission of its jurisdiction or affect any decision, but may be due cause for the Planning Commission to refuse to hear the application or to adjourn the hearing or to require further notice.

26-108.     Factors to be Considered in a Rezoning. When a proposed amendment would result in a change of the zoning classification of any specific property, the recommendation of the Planning Commission, accompanied by a copy of the record of the hearing, shall contain statements as to the present classification, the classification under the proposed amendment, the reasons for seeking such reclassification, a summary of the facts presented, and a statement of the factors upon which the recommendation of the Planning Commission is based, using the following guidelines:

a.    Whether the change in classification would be consistent with the intent and purpose of these regulations.

b.    The character and condition of the surrounding neighborhood and its effect on the proposed change: This entails a description of the neighborhood as to existing land uses, intensity of development, age and general condition of structures.

c.    Whether the proposed amendment is made necessary because of changed or changing conditions in the area affected, and, if so, the nature of such changed or changing conditions.

d.    The current zoning and uses of nearby properties, and the effect on existing nearby land uses upon such a change in classification: The zoning surrounding the property at issue, along with the actual uses on those properties, is to be considered.

e.    Whether every use that would be permitted on the property as reclassified would be compatible with the uses permitted on other property in the immediate vicinity: Consideration is to be given as to whether each of the permitted uses under the proposed rezoning would be compatible with existing uses. The focus is upon issues which can be addressed via zoning, such as structure height, yards and setbacks, and minimum lot sizes.

f.     The suitability of the applicant’s property for the uses to which it has been restricted: How the property at issue is presently zoned, and the uses permitted under that zoning is to be considered, as well as whether those uses are appropriate given the zoning of the surrounding neighborhood. Also to be considered is whether the presently allowed uses are the only uses appropriate for the subject property.

g.    The length of time the subject property has remained vacant or undeveloped as zoned: Consideration is to be given as to whether the subject property is vacant because its present zoning is unsuitable, or whether it is vacant for reasons unrelated to zoning, e.g., a surplus of similarly-zoned property, problems with financing, lack of infrastructure or other development problems.

h.    Whether adequate sewer and water facilities, and all other needed public services exist or can be provided to serve the uses that would be permitted on the property if it were reclassified.

i.     The general amount of vacant land that currently has the same zoning classification proposed for the subject property, particularly in the vicinity of the subject property, and any special circumstances that make a substantial part of such vacant land available or not available for development.

j.     The recommendations of professional staff and advisors: Staff recommendations should be based upon the factors set out in this section, the adopted comprehensive plan, other adopted plans and reports, and the evidence in the record.

k.    Whether the proposed amendment would be in conformance to and further enhance the implementation of the City's Comprehensive Plan: The question here is whether the requested rezoning is consistent with the recommendations of the adopted comprehensive plan. If it is not, is the incompatibility because the plan is outdated or have conditions changed in the area or neighborhood of the subject property?

l.     Whether the relative gain to the public health, safety, and general welfare outweighs the hardship imposed upon the applicant by not upgrading the value of the property by such reclassification: This factor acknowledges that the basis for zoning is protection of public health, safety and welfare. Any rezoning request involves balancing the property owner's interests with the interests of the public.

m.   Such other factors as the Planning Commission may deem relevant from the facts and evidence presented in the application.

26-109.     Applications for Conditional Use Permit. Because of particular conditions associated with their activities, certain uses which might have an adverse effect upon nearby properties or upon the character and future development of a district are not permitted outright in districts, but are allowed as conditional uses when their proposed location is supplemented by additional requirements so as to make the use requested compatible with the surrounding property, the neighborhood and the zoning jurisdiction.

26-110.     Factors to be Considered in Permit Applications.

Application for review of construction, alteration, demolition or removal not requiring a building permit for which a certificate of appropriateness is required is required shall be initiated on a form prepared by the Heritage Commission.

29-903.     Determination by Heritage Commission:

a.    Any applicant may request a meeting with the Heritage Commission before the application is received or during the review of the application. The Commission shall consider the completed application at a regular or special meeting. To prevent unnecessary delay in construction, the Administrator may issue certificates of appropriateness for the renovation or reconstruction of any structure when such work substantially reproduces the existing design and is performed in the existing material. The chairman or vice-chairman shall cosign any certificates of appropriateness issued in this matter.

b.    The chairman of the Commission may appoint a subcommittee of four (4) of its members to review applications for a certificate of appropriateness for all types of actions except demolitions when delay to the next regular meeting would create an unnecessary inconvenience to the applicant. A certificate of appropriateness may be issued prior to the next regular meeting upon the signatures of all but one (1) of the members of that subcommittee.

c.    The Commission shall review the application and issue or deny the certificate of appropriateness within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the application. Written notice of the decision shall be provided to the applicant and the building inspection department within seven (7) days following the determination and shall be accompanied by a certificate of appropriateness in the case of approval.

29-904.     Denial of certificate of appropriateness:

a.    A denial of a certificate of appropriateness shall be accompanied by a statement of the reasons for the denial. The Heritage Commission shall make recommendations to the applicant concerning changes, if any, in the proposed project that would cause the Commission to reconsider its denial and shall confer with the applicant and attempt to resolve as quickly as possible the differences between the owner and the Commission. The applicant may resubmit an amended application or reapply for a building or demolition permit that takes into consideration the recommendations of the Commission.

b.    Any person dissatisfied with a determination by the Heritage Commission concerning a certificate of appropriateness may file an appeal to the City Commission within fourteen (14) days of the date of notification of that determination. The City Commission must act on this request within thirty (30) days of receipt and must hold a public hearing on the appeal.

29-905.     Standards for review: In considering an application for a certificate of appropriateness, the Heritage Commission shall be guided by the following general standards in addition to any design criteria in this Article and in the ordinances designating the landmark:

a.    Every reasonable effort shall be made to provide a compatible use for a property that requires minimal alteration of a building, structure, site or object and its environment, or to use a property for its originally intended purpose.

b.    The distinguishing original qualities of character of a building, structure or site and its environment shall not be destroyed. The removal or alteration of any historic material or distinctive architectural features should be avoided when possible.

c.    All buildings, structures and sites shall be recognized as products of their own time. Alterations that have no historical basis and that seek to create an earlier appearance shall be discouraged.

d.    Changes that may have taken place in the course of time are evidence of the history and development of a building, structure or site and its environment. These changes may have acquired significance in their own right and this significance shall be recognized and respected.

e.    Distinctive stylistic features or examples of skilled craftsmanship that characterize a building, structure or site shall be treated with sensitivity.

f.     Deteriorated architectural features shall be repaired rather than replaced, wherever possible. In the event replacement is necessary, the new material should match the material being replaced in composition, design, color, texture and other visual qualities. Repair or replacement of missing architectural features should be based on accurate duplication of feature, substantiated by historic, physical or pictorial evidence rather than on conjectural designs or the availability of different architectural elements from other buildings or structures.

g.    The surface cleaning of structures shall be undertaken with the gentlest means possible. Sandblasting and other cleaning methods that will damage the historic building materials shall not be undertaken.

h.    Every reasonable effort shall be made to protect and preserve archaeological resources affected by, or adjacent to, any project.

i.     Contemporary design for alterations and additions to existing properties shall not be discouraged when such alterations and additions do not destroy significant historical, architectural or cultural material, and such design is compatible with the size, scale, color, material and character of the property or neighborhood.

29-906.     Design Criteria:

a.    The purpose of the following design criteria is to encourage preservation of intact significant properties, restoration of significant properties, restoration of significant properties that have already undergone insensitive alterations, and new construction, as long as such compliments existing buildings and streetscapes. It is not the intention of these criteria to discourage new architectural styles.

b.    In considering any application for a certificate of appropriateness, the commission shall consider the standards for review listed in Section 29-905 above and the following design criteria:

1.    Alterations. Specific design criteria for exterior alterations of landmarks shall be based on the U.S. "Secretary of the Interior Standards for Rehabilitation", as published in Section 36, Code of Federal Regulation, Part 67, and "The Secretary of the Interior's Standards for the Treatment of Historic Property", as revised from time to time, and by further reference to such specific design criteria as the Commission may require for the designation of the landmark.

2.    New construction and additions to existing buildings:

(a)   The design for new construction shall be sensitive to and take into account the special characteristics that the district provisions are established to protect. Such consideration may include, but should not be limited to, building scale, height, orientation, site coverage, spatial separation from other buildings, façade and window patterns, entrance and porch size and general design, materials, textures, color, architectural details, roof forms, emphasis on horizontal or vertical elements, walls, fences, landscaping and other features deemed appropriate by the commission.

(b)   New buildings need not duplicate older styles of architecture but must be compatible with the architecture within the district. Styles of architecture will be controlled only to ensure that their exterior design, materials and color are in harmony with neighboring structures.

3.    Demolition, relocation and land surface change:

(a)   Demolition in whole or in part of individual landmarks shall ordinarily not be permitted. Exceptions are allowed only if a structure has been substantially damaged through fire, windstorm, flood or deterioration and if there is reasonable proof that it would not be economically or physically feasible to rehabilitate. Other exceptions may be allowed if a structure does not possess the integrity, originality, craftsmanship, age or historical significance to merit preservation. However, demolition of past additions which have not gained historical significance and which have disguised or sheathed original elements of facades are encouraged, as long as the intention is to restore such elements or facades.

(b)   Structures should not be removed from their original site. Exceptions will be allowed only if there is substantial evidence that it would not be practical or economical to utilize the building on its present site. If a structure lies in the path of a public improvement project involving the City of Abilene, and if the building is worthy of preservation by virtue of its integrity, originality, craftsmanship, age or historical significance, relocation may be considered as an alternative.

(c)   Substantial change of land surface within the boundaries of a landmark should not be permitted. Exceptions will be allowed only if there is substantial evidence that the change would not be detrimental to the historical and architectural character of surrounding structures or landscaping.

4.    Signage guidelines. The Heritage Commission shall receive copies of any request for permit, appeal or variance regarding a sign to be located on a landmark. The Commission shall review and approve such requests under the procedures set forth within this section for other permits, subject to the following guidelines:

(a)   Signs should be designed and placed so as to appear an integral part of the building design, in proportion to the structure and environment and to respect neighboring properties.

(b)   Obscuring or disrupting important design elements is discouraged. Signs should be designed with appropriateness relative to the services of the establishment served.

(c)   Signs should be maintained if they are determined to be an original part of the building or if they have acquired significance by virtue of their age design, materials, craftsmanship or historical significance.

(d)   Illumination of signs should be properly shielded or diffused so as to eliminate glare and be of a low enough wattage not to detract from or set apart the structure.

(e)   Descriptive signs as an integral part of the structure are encouraged. Such signs could include building dates, historic descriptions, commemorations, etc.

(f)   Freestanding signs may be considered if appropriate and necessary to preserve the character of the landmark.

5.    Accessory structures and landscaping:

(a)   Existing characteristics such as trees, walls, stairs, paving materials, fencing, walkways and other similar structures or site features that reflect the landmark’s history and development shall be retained.

(b)   Landscaping should be appropriate to the scale and the unique features of the landmark or historic district.

(c)   Accessory structures to a designated landmark shall be appropriate to and compatible with the architectural features of the primary structures.

c.    Within each of the designated categories, the design criteria will be applied more stringently to properties of greater significance than those with lesser significance as determined by their respective designation.

       The Heritage Commission may prepare and adopt more specific design guidelines as it deems necessary to supplement the provisions of this Article for the review of certificates of appropriateness. The City Commission must first approve such additional design guidelines before said guidelines shall become effective.

SECTION 29-10 CERTIFICATE OF ECONOMIC HARDSHIP

29-1001.   Purpose. A certificate of economic hardship serves as an alternative to and wherever a certificate of appropriateness would otherwise be required.

The Commission shall hold a public hearing concerning such applications within thirty (30) days of the receipt of application.

The Administrator shall assist all applicants in the preparation of applications for certificates of economic hardship. Every reasonable effort shall be made to limit the costs to the applicant and to assure efficient processing of the application. The Commission shall require the submission of financial documents, professional reports and expert testimony only when they are necessary to review an application.

d.    In the case of a proposed demolition, an estimate from an architect, developer, real estate consultant, appraiser or other real estate professional experienced in rehabilitation as to the economic feasibility of rehabilitation or reuse of the existing structure on the property.

e.    If the property is income-producing, the annual gross income from the property for the previous two (2) years; itemized operating and maintenance expenses for the previous two (2) years; and depreciation, deduction and annual cash flow before and after debt service, if any, during the same period.

f.     Remaining balance on any mortgage or other financing secured by the property and annual debt service, if any, for the previous two (2) years.

g.    All appraisals obtained within the previous two (2) years by the owner or applicant in connection with the purchase, financing or ownership of the property.

j      Real estate taxes for the previous two (2) years.

k.    Form of ownership or operation of the property, whether sole proprietorship, for profit or not-for-profit corporation, limited partnership, joint venture, or other.

l.     Any other information considered necessary by the Commission to a determination as to whether the property does yield or may yield a reasonable return to the owners. All personal financial documents and the information contained therein shall be considered proprietary and confidential, and shall be returned to the affected property owner upon said determination.

29-1003.   Determination: The Commission shall review all the evidence and information required of an applicant for a certificate of economic hardship and make a determination within forty-five (45) days of receipt of the application whether the denial of the application will deprive the owner of the property of reasonable use of, or reasonable economic return on the property. Written notice of the determination shall be provided in the same manner as notification of a determination concerning a certificate of appropriateness.

29-1004.   Appeal: Any person dissatisfied with a determination by the Heritage Commission concerning a certificate of economic hardship may file an appeal to the City Commission within fourteen (14) days of the date of notification of that determination.

Action on a final plat shall be taken by a majority vote of the Planning Commission membership, regardless of the number of Planning Commission members present and voting at the hearing. If the final plat is disapproved, the applicant shall be notified in writing of the reasons for such disapproval. If the Planning Commission fails to approve or disapprove a preliminary plat within the 60 day period, then the final plat shall be deemed approved and such approval endorsed on the plat by the Chairperson of the Planning Commission, unless the applicant shall have requested or consented to waive such time limitation. If the final plat is approved, the Chairperson of the Planning Commission shall date and endorse the original. An approved final plat shall be submitted to the Governing Body for its consideration of the dedications of streets and other public ways, drainage and utility easements, and any other land dedicated for public use. The Governing Body shall approve or disapprove such dedications within 30 days of the receipt of the approved final plat. The Governing Body may defer action for an additional 30 days for the purpose of allowing modifications to comply with the requirements of the Governing Body. No additional fees shall be assessed during this period. If the final plat is deferred or disapproved, the Governing Body shall advise the Planning Commission of the reasons for such action. Failure of the Governing Body to execute an acceptance of dedications shown on the plat shall be deemed a refusal of the proposed dedications.

2-406.       Acceptance of Dedications: A final plat that has been approved by the Planning Commission shall be submitted to the Governing Body for its acceptance of the dedication of streets and other public ways, service, and utility easements and any land dedicated for public purposes.

ARTICLE 3. LOT SPLITS

Section 3-1. Objective

3-101 The objective of this section is to provide for the division of a tract of land or lot, following the adoption of these regulations, into not more than two lots which meet the minimum size and area requirements to the zoning district in which said lots are located without having to comply with the platting requirements described in Section 2 of these Subdivision Regulations. The new lots cannot, thereafter, be further subdivided without replatting.

Section 3-2. Authorization for Approval of Lot Splits; Application Procedure

3-201.       Requests for lot split approval shall be made by the owner of the land to the Secretary of the Planning Commission. Four copies of a scale drawing of the lots involved If there are no structures thereon, or, if structures are located on any part of the lot being split, four copies of a survey of the lot(s) and the location of the structure(s) thereon together with the precise nature, location arid dimensions of the proposed lot split, shall accompany the application. The application shall be accompanied by the names and addresses of all persons to receive notices. Written notices shall be given to all owners of land within 200 feet of the property proposed to be split when such property is within the. city limits and to all owners of land within 1000 feet within unincorporated areas. If the property proposed to be split is located adjacent to or outside the city's limits. Such owners shall have 14 days from the date of notification to notify the Planning Commission of any protests they may have concerning the lot split. The 14-day waiting period may be waived upon submission in writing of statements from those to be notified that they have no objection to the proposed lot split.

Section 3-3. Approval Guidelines

3-301.       The division of lots pursuant to this section shall comply with applicable zoning laws, these Subdivision Regulations, and all other applicable regulations. No lot split shall be approved if one of the following applies:

1.    A new street or alley is needed or proposed;

2.    A vacation of streets, alleys, setback lines, access control or easements is required or proposed.

3.    If such action will result in significant increases in service requirements, e.g., utilities, schools, traffic control, streets, etc.; or will interfere with maintaining existing service levels, e.g., additional curb cuts, repaving, etc.

4.    There is less street or road right-of-way than required by these regulations unless such dedication can be made by separate instrument.

5.    Any easement requirements have not been satisfied.

6.    If such a split will result in a lot or tract without direct access to a public street.

7.    A substandard size lot or parcel will be created according to these Subdivision Regulations and the City of Abilene Zoning Regulations, except where a lot split will result in the substandard-sized portion being recombined with an abutting lot or parcel to produce a standard size lot, and where this recombination is duly filed and recorded with the Register of Deeds of Dickinson County.

3-302.       The Planning Commission may make such additional requirements as deemed necessary to carry out the intent and purposes of existing land development regulations and policy. Requirements may include, but not be limited to, installation of public facilities, dedication of right-of-way and easements.

Section 3-4. Staff Review and Action

3-401.       The Planning Commission shall, in writing, either approve with or without conditions or disapprove the lot split within 30 days of application. If approved, and after all conditions have been met, the Planning Commission shall sign and furnish a certificate of approval to be affixed to the lot split survey, and a certified copy thereof shall be filed with the Register of Deeds, the official designated to issue building or occupancy permits, and a copy shall be furnished to the applicant.

ARTICLE 4. SUBDIVISION DESIGN STANDARDS

Section 4-1. Applicability

4-101.       All subdivisions of land subject to these Subdivision Regulations shall conform to the following minimum design standards.

Section 4-2. Land in Floodway and Floodway Fringe Districts

4-201.       No land subject to the floodway and floodway fringe regulations adopted by ordinance by the City shall be subdivided for any use not permitted by the underlying zoning district as presented in the City of Abilene Zoning Regulations.

4-202.       Subdivisions subject to the floodway and floodway fringe regulations adopted by ordinance by the City shall be designed in accordance with standards established in the Floodway and Floodway Fringe Districts of the City of Abilene Zoning Regulations. Such subdivision proposals shall be designed to assure that all such proposals are consistent with the need to minimize flood damage, that all public utilities and facilities, such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems are located, elevated and constructed to minimize or eliminate flood damage, and that adequate drainage is provided so as to reduce exposure to flood hazards:

Section 4-3. Street Standards

4-301.       Conformance with the Comprehensive Plan: To provide reasonable vehicular movement, arterial streets and collector streets shall be properly integrated with the existing system of streets and highways, as well as with the proposed system of streets and highways presented in the city's comprehensive plan.

4-302.       Streets. Alleys and Public Ways.

(1)   Relationship to Adjoining Street Systems: The arrangement of streets in new subdivisions shall make provisions for the continuation of the principal existing streets in adjoining additions (or their proper projection where adjoining property is not subdivided) insofar as they may be necessary public requirements. The width of such streets in new subdivisions shall be not less than the minimum street widths established herein. Alleys, when required, and street arrangement must cause no hardship to owners of adjoining property when they plat their land and seek to provide for convenient access to it. Whenever there exists a dedicated or platted half street or alley adjacent to the tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street or alley shall be platted and dedicated. Intersections shall not be permitted. If they would intersect a street within 150 feet of another existing intersection.

(2)   Street Names: Streets that are obviously in alignment with other already existing and named streets shall bear the names of the existing streets.

(3)   Arterial Streets: An arterial or thoroughfare which primarily serves as a transportation line for vehicular traffic and which prohibits direct access from residential lots. An arterial may be classified as either a Major Arterial or a Minor Arterial, as defined in the Highway Functional Classification System of the U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration.

(4)   Urban Collector Street: A street intended to move traffic from local streets to arterial streets. An urban collector street serves a neighborhood or large subdivision and should be designed to discourage residential properties from facing onto it. An urban collector is classified as either a Major Collector or Minor Collector, as defined in the Highway Functional Classification System of the U.S. Department of Transportation, Federal Highway Administration.

(5)   Local Streets: Streets intended to provide access to the streets from individual properties. Local streets shall be so designed to discourage through or non-local traffic.

(6)   Cul-de-sacs: An adequate turnaround of not less than a 100-foot diameter right-of­ way which shall be provided at the closed end of a dead-end local street segment. Such local street segment shall not exceed 600 feet in length from the intersection of a cross street to the juncture with the cul-de-sac.

(7)   Right Angle Intersections: Under normal conditions, streets shall be laid out to intersect, as nearly as possible, at right angles. Where topography or other conditions justify a variation from the right angle intersection, the minimum angle shall be 60 degrees.

(8)   Streets Adjacent to a Railroad Right-of-Way. Limited Access Freeway. Principal Highway: Where lots front or side, but do not back on railroad rights-of-way, limited access freeways or principal highways, a marginal access street or frontage road may be required parallel and adjacent to the boundary of such rights-of-way. The distance from said rights-of­ way shall be determined, with due consideration to minimum distance required for approach connections to future grade separated intersections.

(9)   Half-Streets: Half-streets shall be avoided, except where they are essential to the reasonable development of the subdivision in conformity with the other requirements of these regulations; or, when the Planning Commission finds that it will be practical to require the dedication of the other half of the street when the adjoining property is subdivided. Whenever a half-street, or portion thereof; is existing and adjacent to a tract to be subdivided, the other half of the street shall be based on minimum requirements as set forth in subsection 11 of this section and shall be platted within such tract.

(10) Alleys: Alleys may be required in commercial, industrial, and residential areas. Alleys shall have a minimum right-of-way width of 20 feet. Dead-end alleys shall be avoided, wherever possible; if unavoidable, such alleys shall be provided with adequate turnaround facilities at the dead end.

5-203.       Default Proceedings: The Governing Body may find the subdivider not in default, extend the time limit, or:

a.    Should the Governing Body find the Subdivision Improvements Agreement to have been violated, it may liquidate the improvements guarantee, in whatever form it takes, and apply the proceeds of this guarantee to the construction of the improvements set out in the Subdivision Improvements Agreement.

b.    Should the proceeds of the guarantee not be sufficient to cover the costs of said improvements, the Governing Body may assess to the subdivider, property owners, or both, the construction costs of the improvements that exceed the amount provided by the subdivider. This may take form of a lien against the property covered in the Subdivision Improvements Agreement.

c.    Should the proceeds of the guarantee exceed the actual cost of the improvements, and any cost incurred in the default procedures, the City shall return the unexpended balance to the individual named on the Subdivision Improvements Agreement as the one having secured the guarantee.

5-204.       Guarantee Release: When all improvements have been completed and have been inspected, approved and accepted, the City shall authorize the release of the guarantee.
