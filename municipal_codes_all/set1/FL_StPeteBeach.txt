PREFACE 
This Code constitutes a complete recodification of the general and permanent ordinances of the City of St. Pete Beach, Florida. 
Source materials used in the preparation of the Code were the 1983 Code, as supplemented through May 21, 1996, and ordinances subsequently adopted by the city commission. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. The absence of such a note indicates that the section is new and was adopted for the first time with the adoption of the Code. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any section of the 1983 Code, as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
The chapters of the Code have been conveniently arranged in alphabetical order, and the various sections within each chapter have been catchlined to facilitate usage. Notes which tie related sections of the Code together and which refer to relevant state law have been included. A table listing the state law citations and setting forth their location within the Code is included at the back of this Code. 
Chapter and Section Numbering System 
The chapter and section numbering system used in this Code is the same system used in many state and local government codes. Each section number consists of two parts separated by a dash. The figure before the dash refers to the chapter number, and the figure after the dash refers to the position of the section within the chapter. Thus, the second section of chapter 1 is numbered 1-2, and the first section of chapter 6 is 6-1. Under this system, each section is identified with its chapter, and at the same time new sections can be inserted in their proper place by using the decimal system for amendments. For example, if new material consisting of one section that would logically come between sections 6-1 and 6-2 is desired to be added, such new section would be numbered 6-1.5. New articles and new divisions may be included in the same way or, in the case of articles, may be placed at the end of the chapter embracing the subject, and, in the case of divisions, may be placed at the end of the article embracing the subject. The next successive number shall be assigned to the new article or division. New chapters may be included by using one of the reserved chapter numbers. Care should be taken that the alphabetical arrangement of chapters is maintained when including new chapters. 
Page Numbering System 
The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. In the case of an appendix to the Code, the letter immediately to the left of the colon indicates the letter of the appendix. The following are typical parts of codes of ordinances, which may or may not appear in this Code at this time, and their corresponding prefixes:

Indexes 
The indexes have been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the indexes themselves which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes. 
Acknowledgments

(b)  Interference with administration. Except for the purpose of inquiries and investigations, the commission or its members shall deal with city officers and employees who are subject to the direction and supervision of the manager solely through the manager, and neither the commission nor its members shall give orders to any such officer or employee, either publicly or privately. Nothing in the foregoing is to be construed to prohibit individual members of the commission from closely scrutinizing by questions and personal observation, all aspects of city government operations so as to obtain independent information to assist the members in the formulation of sound policies to be considered by the commission. It is the express intent of this charter, however, that recommendations for improvement in city government operations by individual commissioners be made to and through the city manager, so that the manager may coordinate efforts of all city departments to achieve the greatest possible savings through the most efficient means available. 
(c)  City officers limited to one office; not to have interest in city contracts.

Sec. 3.11. - Emergency ordinances. 
To meet a public emergency affecting life, health, property or the public peace, the commission may adopt one or more emergency ordinances, but such ordinances may not levy taxes, grant, renew or extend a franchise, set service or user charges for any municipal services or authorize the borrowing of money except as provided under the emergency appropriations provisions of this charter.

An emergency ordinance may be adopted with or without amendment or rejected at the meeting at which it is introduced, but the affirmative vote of at least four (4) members of the commission shall be required for adoption. After its adoption the ordinance shall be published and printed as prescribed for other adopted ordinances. 
(c)  Effective date. Emergency ordinances shall become effective upon adoption or at such other date as may be specified in the ordinance. 
(d)  Repeal. Every emergency ordinance except emergency appropriations shall automatically stand repealed as of the sixty-first day following the date on which it was adopted, but this shall not prevent reenactment of the ordinance under regular procedures, or if the emergency still exists, in the manner specified in this section. An emergency ordinance may also be repealed by adoption of a repealing ordinance in the same manner specified in this section for adoption of emergency ordinances. 
(e)  Emergency appropriations. The commission may make emergency appropriations in the manner provided in this section. To the extent that there are no available unappropriated revenues to meet such appropriations, the commission may by such emergency ordinance authorize the issuance of emergency notes, which may be renewed from time to time, but the emergency notes and renewals of any fiscal year shall be paid not later than the last day of the fiscal year next succeeding that in which the emergency appropriation was made. 
State Law reference Emergency ordinances, F.S. § 166.041(1)(b).  
Sec. 3.12. - Budget adoption. 
The commission shall by ordinance adopt the budget on or before the thirtieth day of September of each year. If it fails to adopt the budget by this date, the commission by resolution may direct that the amounts appropriated for current operation for the current fiscal year shall be deemed adopted for the ensuing fiscal year for a period of fifteen (15) days and renewed by resolution each fifteen (15) days with all items in it prorated accordingly until such time as the commission adopts a budget for the ensuing fiscal year. An ordinance adopting an annual budget shall constitute appropriations of the amounts specified therein as expenditures from the funds indicated. 
Editor's note The procedure for adoption of budgets is mandated in F.S. § 200.065.  
Sec. 3.13. - Appropriation amendments during the fiscal year. 
(a)  Supplemental appropriations. If during the fiscal year revenues in excess of those estimated in the budget are available for appropriation, the commission by ordinance may make supplemental appropriations for the year up to the amount of such excess. 
(b)  Reduction of appropriations. If at any time during the fiscal year it appears probable to the manager that the revenues available will be insufficient to meet the amount appropriated, he shall report to the commission without delay, indicating the estimated amount of the deficit, any remedial action taken by him and his recommendations as to any other steps to be taken. The commission shall then take such further action as it deems necessary to prevent or minimize any deficit and for that purpose it may by ordinance reduce one or more appropriations. 
(c)  Limitations; effective date. No appropriation for debt service may be reduced or transferred and no appropriation may be reduced below any amount required by law to be appropriated or by more than the amount of the unencumbered balance thereof. The supplemental and emergency appropriations and reduction or transfer of appropriations authorized by this section may be made effective immediately upon adoption.  
Sec. 3.14. - Authentication, recording and disposition of Charter amendments, ordinances and resolutions. 
(a)  Authentication.

(1)  The substance of any ex parte communication with a local public official which relates to quasi-judicial action pending before the official is not presumed prejudicial to the action if the subject of the communication and identity of the person, group, or entity with whom the communication took place is disclosed and made a part of the record before the final action on the matter. 
(2)  A local public official may read a written communication from any person.

(3)  Local public officials may conduct investigations and site visits and may receive expert opinions regarding quasi-judicial action pending before them. Such activities shall not be presumed prejudicial to the action if the existence of the investigation, site visit, or expert opinion is made a part of the record before final action on the matter. 
(4)  Disclosure made pursuant to subsections (1), (2), and (3) of this section must be made before or during the public meeting at which a vote is taken on such matters, so that persons who have opinions contrary to those expressed in the ex parte communication are given a reasonable opportunity to refute or respond to the communication. 
(b)  In a quasi-judicial proceeding on local government land use matters, a person who appears before the decision-making body who is not a party or party-intervener shall be allowed to testify before the decision-making body, subject to control by the decision-making body, and may be requested to respond to questions from the decision-making body, but need not be sworn as a witness, is not required to be subject to cross-examination, and is not required to be qualified as an expert witness. The decision-making body shall assign weight and credibility to such testimony as it deems appropriate. A party or party-intervenor in a quasi-judicial proceeding on local government land use matters, upon request by another party or party-intervenor, shall be sworn as a witness, shall be subject to cross-examination by other parties or party-intervenors, and shall be required to be qualified as an expert witness, as appropriate. 
(c)  In a quasi-judicial proceeding on local government land use matters, a person may not be precluded from communicating directly with a member of the decision-making body by application of ex parte communication prohibitions. Disclosure of such communications by a member of the decision-making body is not required, and such nondisclosure shall not be presumed prejudicial to the decision of the decision-making body. All decisions of the decision-making body in a quasi-judicial proceeding on local government land use matters must be supported by substantial, competent evidence in the record pertinent to the proceeding, irrespective of such communications.

Cross reference Definitions generally, § 1-2.  
Sec. 10-27. - Authority. 
This article and this Code are both enacted pursuant to F.S. ch. 166 in the interest of the health, peace, safety, and general welfare of the people of the city. 
(Code 1983, § 25-16; Ord. No. 94-52, § 1, 11-15-94)  
Sec. 10-28. - Legislative findings. 
(a)  The concerns raised in the whereas clauses listed in Ordinance No. 94-52 and Ordinance No. 93-18 are incorporated in this article by reference. 
(b)  The concerns raised in the findings incorporated by reference in subsection (a) of this section raise substantial governmental concerns. 
(c)  Adult use establishments have operational characteristics which should be reasonably regulated in order to protect those substantial governmental concerns. 
(d)  A reasonable and simple licensure procedure is an appropriate mechanism to place the burden of that reasonable regulation on the owners and operators of the adult use establishments. Further, such a licensing procedure will place an incentive on the owner/operator to see that the adult use establishment is run in a manner that is consistent with the health, safety and welfare of its patrons and employees as well as the citizens of the city. It is appropriate to require reasonable assurances that the licensee is the actual owner/operator of the adult use establishment, fully in possession and control of the premises and the activities occurring therein. 
(e)  Adult use establishments are a pervasively regulated industry making reasonable inspections and administrative searches necessary to enforce regulatory standards. In particular, the city commission finds: 
(1)  Removal of doors on adult booths and requiring sufficient lighting in adult theaters advances the substantial governmental interest in curbing the illegal and unsanitary sexual activity occurring at adult theaters. 
(2)  The prevention of sexual contact between patrons and employees at adult use establishments is unrelated to the suppression of free expression, but serves to address the concerns raised in the findings contained in this section. Although the dancer's erotic message may be slightly less effective from three feet away, the ability to engage in the protected expression is not significantly impaired. 
(3)  Separating dancers from patrons and prohibiting dancers and patrons from engaging in sexual fondling and caressing in adult cabarets would reduce the opportunity for prostitution transactions and thus should deter prostitution. 
(4)  The barring of nudity in public places furthers a substantial governmental interest in protecting order and morality. This does not deprive one of freedom of expression of whatever erotic message conveyed; it simply makes the message slightly less graphic. 
(5)  Requiring that the facilities of adult theaters be constructed of materials that are easily cleanable, that the facilities be cleaned on a regular basis, and that the employees cleaning the facilities take reasonable precautions to avoid contact with possible disease transmitting media is reasonably related to the protection of both employees and patrons from sexually transmitted diseases. 
(6)  Requiring licensees of adult use establishments to keep information regarding current employees and certain past employees will help reduce the incidence of certain types of criminal behavior by facilitating the identification of potential witnesses or suspects and by preventing minors from working in such establishments. 
(7)  The disclosure of certain information by those persons ultimately responsible for the day-to-day operation and maintenance of the adult use establishment is substantially related to the significant governmental interest in the operation of such uses in a manner as to prevent the spread of sexually transmitted diseases and to reduce or eliminate the criminal activity associated with adult uses establishments. 
(8)  It is desirable in the prevention of the spread of communicable diseases and in the investigation of criminal activity to obtain a limited amount of information regarding certain employees who either engage in the conduct which this article is designed to prevent or are likely to be witnesses to such activity. 
(9)  A substantial rational relationship between sexually oriented businesses and sexually related crimes establishes a compelling justification for barring those prone to such crimes from the management of such businesses. 
(10)  The fact that an applicant for an adult use license has been convicted of a sexually related crime leads to a rational inference that the applicant is more likely to engage in conduct in contravention of this article. 
(11)  The barring of a person from participating in an adult use business shall cease when circumstances are indicated to the city that such persons are no longer criminally inclined. 
(12)  Barring of such individuals from management of adult uses for a period of years serves as a deterrent to and prevents the conduct which leads to the transmission of sexually transmitted diseases and to the promotion of that criminal activity associated with adult uses. 
(13)  Because the weight of evidence shows that while adult bookstores/video stores which only sell or rent adult material and have no adult booth/theater component have similar secondary effects as other adult uses, such bookstores do not promote the transmission of sexual diseases. An exemption of such limited adult establishments from the licensure requirements but not the locational requirements of this article is appropriate. 
(f)  The city commission desires to simplify the finding of all adult entertainment establishment regulations by combining them into one portion of the Code which is contained in this article. This will enable the city to provide a copy of all adult entertainment establishment related legislation by reference to one article of this Code. In order to ensure compliance with all requirements for enactment of ordinances relating to rezoning specific parcels of private real property or substantially changing permitted use categories in zoning districts, pursuant to F.S. § 166.041, the city commission has again reviewed all of the evidence previously presented to it with regard to enactment of Ordinance Nos. 93-18, 93-28 and 93-29 and fully and completely incorporates such ordinances fully in this article.

(Code 1983, § 25-6(c)(e); Ord. No. 94-52, § 1, 11-15-94)  
Sec. 10-150. - Issuance of certificate of compliance or noncompliance. 
(a)  Generally. Inspection in the review of the application as stated in this division shall be completed and the city shall issue, within 45 days, a certificate of compliance or a certificate of noncompliance. 
(b)  Certification of noncompliance. 
(1)  When it is found that the location proposed in the application does not meet the distance requirements of subsection 10-35(a) or is one where a valid adult use exists or is one where a valid adult use permit or valid certification of compliance has been issued for another adult use, the location of which is within the distance requirements of subsection 10-35(b) from the proposed location, the applicant shall be notified of the certification of noncompliance of the proposed location with the locational requirements of this article. 
(2)  Upon receipt of the certification of noncompliance, the applicant shall have ten days to appeal the decision on noncompliance pursuant to section 10-157.

(Code 1983, § 25-6(f)(1), (2); Ord. No. 94-52, § 1, 11-15-94)  
Sec. 10-151. - Conflicting applications. 
(a)  The city commission recognizes the potential of creating nonconformities by granting adult use business permits that conflict because the applications are submitted at the same time and the applicants seek permits for the same location or for a location, which, if permitted under this division, would render the other location unusable. The director of planning and development shall develop a system for tracking potentially conflicting applications and for ranking them by date and time of application/date of establishment. 
(b)  Between two applications being processed at the same time, which individually qualify under subsections 10-35(a) and (b) but would violate subsection 10-35(b) if both were to receive permits, the application which was completed at the earliest date, as provided in sections 10-147 and 10-148, shall be notified that the applicant's proposed location has been certified in compliance pursuant to subsection 10-150(c). Applications shall be processed on a first come, first served basis if properly received and properly completed. 
(c)  The conflicting applicant shall be notified of the application's certification of noncompliance pursuant to subsection 10-150(b) with the notation that the noncompliance was due to the earlier submittal of a conflicting application. 
(d)  The first applicant who has received the certification of compliance shall have 20 days to secure the adult use permit, signed by the director of planning and development. If the period of validity of the certification of compliance expires, pursuant to subsection 10-150(c)(2), the applicant must reapply. 
(e)  Any applicant who has received a certification of noncompliance pursuant to subsection 10-150(b) may use the applicant's prior application date in a resubmission for the purposes of establishing the prior date if the original application was made no more than seven months previous. Otherwise the applicant shall submit a new application.

(a)  The city shall be entitled to and shall, in fact, be obligated to issue a cease and desist order to any person holding a permit under this division, requiring the permit holder to immediately cease and desist operation of the adult entertainment establishment authorized in accordance with this article and, additionally and not as an alternative to the cease and desist order, the city shall revoke the permit of any permit holder for any one or more of the reasons set forth as follows: 
(1)  The owner or operator of the permitted business knowingly allowed a person under the age of 18 years of age to be an employee of the adult use business or should have known after reasonable inquiry that the employee was under the age of 18 years. 
(2)  The owner of the permitted business knowingly gave false, fraudulent or untruthful information on the application for such a permit. 
(3)  The conviction of the owner, manager, clerk or operator, partner, officer, director, or stockholder of any criminal violation related to the operation of the adult use business. 
(b)  The cease and desist order shall be issued in order to protect the health, welfare and safety of the citizens of the city from any of the secondary effects of the adult use. The order shall specify the reason for its issuance, and shall also set a time and place for a hearing before an administrative hearing officer, selected by the city manager, in order to determine whether or not the permit shall be revoked. The administrative hearing officer shall hold the hearing required under this subsection within ten business days from the date of the issuance of the cease and desist order. At the hearing, the city shall present such evidence as it deems appropriate to establish the nature of the offense and to establish the reasons for the cease and desist order. The permit holder shall present such evidence as he deems appropriate. Thereafter, the hearing officer shall determine whether to revoke the permit or to place such additional lawful restrictions on the permit holder as shall be necessary in order to ensure that no further violations of this article shall occur. A permit holder may continue to operate until the hearing officer has rendered a decision. A permit holder who continues to operate the adult entertainment facility after a revocation shall be subject to a fine of $500.00 for each day of the violation, which fine shall be determined by the hearing officer at a subsequent hearing. Any fine assessed by the hearing officer shall be recorded as a lien in the public records of the county and in any other county in which the permit holder may own real property or may operate an adult entertainment facility and shall be subject to enforcement and collection in the same manner as any mechanic's lien may be enforced in accordance with F.S. ch. 713, including the right to collect a reasonable attorney's fee. By applying for and accepting an adult use permit, the permit holder agrees to be bound by any and all decisions rendered by the hearing officer. The administrative hearing officer shall conduct a fair and impartial hearing, keeping in mind the requirement of providing due process of law to all parties. In any proceeding regarding revocation of a permit or regarding a cease and desist order, the burden of proof shall be with the city or the applicable city department.

Sec. 10-156. - Variances. 
(a)  If an applicant receives a certification of noncompliance because the location of the proposed adult use is in violation of the locational requirements of this article, and if the applicant wishes to seek a variance from these locational requirements, the applicant shall, not later than ten calendar days after receiving notice of the certification of noncompliance, file with department of planning and development a written request for a variance from the locational restrictions of section 10-35. 
(b)  If the written request is filed with the director of planning and development within the ten-day limit, the director shall schedule a hearing before the city's appropriate board of authority, which body shall consider the request for a variance. The department of planning and development shall set a date for the hearing within 60 days from the date the written request is received. 
(c)  The appropriate board of authority shall hear and consider evidence offered by any interested person in a public hearing scheduled with public notice. Public notice shall be pursuant to the requirements of the Government-In-The-Sunshine Manual. The appropriate board of authority may, in its discretion, grant a variance, with reasonable conditions, from the locational restrictions of section 10-35 if it makes the following findings: 
(1)  A sufficient physical barrier separates the adult use establishment, for which a variance is being sought, from the land use which has caused the adult use not to be in compliance with the distance requirement of this article, so as to substantially fulfill the purpose of the distance requirement. Such physical barriers include but are not limited to limited access streets or highways, walls, natural or manmade waterways. 
(2)  The strict application of this article will work an undue hardship unique to the applicant for a particular location. 
(3)  All other applicable sections of this article will be observed. 
(d)  The appropriate board of authority shall only grant a variance to this article by the affirmative vote of four members. Failure to reach a four-member vote shall result in a denial of the variance. The decision of the appropriate board of authority shall be final. 
(e)  If appropriate board of authority denies the variance, the applicant shall not be entitled to reapply until at least six months have elapsed since the date of the board's action. 
(f)  The grant of a variance does not exempt the applicant from any other sections of this article, other than the locational restrictions of section 10-35.

Sec. 10-188. - False statement or false information.

Sec. 10-189. - Investigation of applicant. 
Upon receipt of an application under this division properly filed with the department of planning and development and upon payment of the nonrefundable application fee, the department of planning and development shall immediately stamp the application as received and shall immediately thereafter send photocopies of the application to the chief of police. The police chief's representatives shall promptly conduct an investigation of the applicant, and of the individuals listed in the application pursuant to subsection 10-187(b) to ascertain the validity of the information provided in the application.

Sec. 10-190. - Issuance; denial. 
(a)  Time limits. Under this division, the department of planning and development shall grant or deny an application for a license within 45 days from the date of its proper filing. Upon the expiration of the 45th day, the applicant shall be permitted to begin operating the establishment for which a license is sought, without benefit of a license, unless and until the department of planning and development notifies the applicant of a denial of the application and states the reason for that denial. Failure to timely grant or deny an application for a license under this section allowing operation without benefit of a license shall not serve as a granting of a license, but shall serve to ripen an appropriate action to compel a decision on the application. All operations of the establishments authorized under this special provision shall conform to sections 10-33, 10-6710-70 and 10-22610-232 and division 3 of this article during the pendency of the application review. 
(b)  Issuance. If there is no basis for denial, pursuant to subsection (c) of this section, the department of planning and development shall grant the application, notify the applicant of the granting, and issue the license to the applicant upon payment of the appropriate annual license fee provided in section 10-193, with credit as provided in section 10-187(c). 
(c)  Denial. The department of planning and development shall deny the application for any of the following reasons: 
(1)  The application contains material false information or information material to the decision was omitted. Failure to list an individual required to be listed pursuant to subsection 10-187(b) and whose listing would result in a denial pursuant to subsections (c)(2) and (4) of this section is presumed to be a material false information for purposes of denial of the application. The certification that the licensee owns, possesses, operates and exercises control over the proposed or existing adult use establishment is a material representation for purposes of this section. 
(2)  The applicant or any of the other individuals listed pursuant to subsection 10-187(b)(1) holds or has held a license under this article or any other ordinance regulating adult uses in the city that has been suspended or revoked for reasons implicating the purposes and intent of this article. 
(3)  The granting of the application would violate a state or federal statute or city or applicable county ordinance or an order from a court of law. 
(4)  An applicant or any of the other individuals listed pursuant to subsection 10-187(b)(1) has been convicted of a specified criminal act: 
a.  For which: 
1.  Less that two years has elapsed since the date of conviction or the date of release from confinement imposed for the conviction, whichever is the later date, if the conviction is of a misdemeanor offense; 
2.  Less that five years has elapsed since the date of conviction or the date of release from confinement imposed for the conviction, whichever is the later date, if the conviction is of a felony offense; or 
3.  Less than five years has elapsed since the date of the last conviction or the date of release from confinement imposed for the conviction, whichever is the later date, if the convictions are of two or more misdemeanor offenses or combination of misdemeanor offenses occurring within any 24-month period. 
b.  The fact that a conviction is being appealed shall have no effect on the disqualification of the applicant, except that if a conviction is overturned this shall be treated as if there were no such conviction. 
c.  An applicant who has been convicted of a specified criminal act may seek to qualify for an adult use license only when the time period required by subsection (c)(4) of this section has elapsed. 
(5)  If the department of planning and development denies the application, the applicant shall be notified of the denial, and the reason for the denial shall be specified upon the application or in a separate writing. Notification shall be by certified mail and shall be sent to the address on the license application, which shall be considered the correct address for all notices. 
(6)  If a person applies for a license at a particular location within a period of six months from the date of denial of a previous application for a license at that location and there has not been an intervening change in the circumstances material to the decision regarding the former reason for denial, the application shall not be accepted for consideration. The burden of showing an intervening change of circumstances shall be on the applicant. 
(7)  The granting of a license does not act as a certification that the proposed adult use establishment meets all sections of this article or of any health or zoning statute, code, ordinance, or regulation. The adult use establishment and any proposed adult use establishment, once established, must meet all Code provisions required of all regulated businesses, including the provisions for adult uses of sections 10-226 and 10-22810-232 and division 3 of this article. 
(8)  Within 15 days after the mailing of a notice of denial of an application for a license or a notification of the revocation of a license, the applicant or licensee may take an appeal as provided in section 10-199. If the administrative hearing officer finds that the application should be approved, he shall so order and, upon payment of the appropriate license fee, the director of planning and development shall issue the license. If the administrative hearing officer finds that the license should not have been revoked, he shall notify the director of planning and development, who shall reissue the license.

This subsection shall not affect section 10-195. 
(d)  Renewals. All licenses issued under this division shall be renewed annually.

(Ord. No. 12-02, § 1(exh. A), 1-24-12)  
Sec. 22-276. - Special magistrate administrative division procedures. 
Alleged violations of any of those codes or ordinances of the City of St. Pete Beach as described herein may be filed with the special magistrate administrative division by those administrative officials, having the responsibility of enforcing the various codes or ordinances in force in St. Pete Beach. 
(1)  Except as set forth in subsections (3) and (4) below, if a violation of a code or ordinance is believed to exist, the enforcing department shall specify a reasonable time to correct the violation. Should the violation continue beyond the time specified for correction, the special magistrate administrative division shall give notice to the alleged violator that a code enforcement hearing will be conducted concerning the alleged violation as noticed. The notice shall state the time and place of the hearing, as well as the violation alleged to exist. If the violation is corrected and then repeated, or if the violation is not corrected by the time specified for correction by the code inspector, the case may be brought for hearing even if the violation has been corrected prior to hearing, and the notice of violation shall so state. 
(2)  Persons or entities who may be held responsible under this article for violation(s) of St Pete Beach Code(s) include: 
a.  The owner, agent, lessee, tenant, contractor, or any other person or legal entity using the land, building, or premises where such violation has been committed or shall exist. 
b.  Any person or legal entity who knowingly commits, takes part or assists in such violation. 
c.  Any person or legal entity who maintains any land, building, or premises in which such violation shall exist. 
(3)  If a repeat violation is found, the code inspector shall notify the violator but is not required to give the violator reasonable time to correct the violation. The code inspector, upon notifying the violator of a repeat violation, may request a hearing. The special magistrate administrative division shall give notice to the alleged violator as set forth in subsection (1) above. The case may be brought for hearing, and a fine may be imposed by the special magistrate, even if the repeat violation has been corrected prior to hearing, and the notice shall so state. 
(4)  If the code inspector has reason to believe a violation or the condition causing the violation presents a serious threat to the public health, safety, and welfare or if the violation is irreparable or irreversible in nature, the code inspector shall make reasonable effort to notify the violator and may immediately request a code enforcement hearing. 
(5)  If the owner of property which is subject to a code enforcement proceeding transfers ownership of such property between the time the notice of violation was served and the time of the hearing, such owner shall: 
a.  Disclose, in writing, the existence and the nature of the proceeding to the prospective transferee. 
b.  Deliver to the prospective transferee a copy of the notices and other materials relating to the code enforcement proceeding received by the transferor. 
c.  Disclose, in writing, to the prospective transferee that the new owner will be responsible for compliance with the applicable code and with orders issued in the code enforcement proceeding. 
d.  File a notice with the special magistrate administrative division of the transfer of the property, with the identity and address of the new owner and copies of the disclosures made to the new owner, within five days after the date of the transfer. 
A failure to make the disclosures described in subsections a., b. and c. before the transfer creates a rebuttable presumption of fraud. If the property is transferred before the hearing, the hearing shall not be dismissed, but the new owner shall be provided a reasonable period of time to correct the violation before the hearing is held. 
(Ord. No. 12-02, § 1(exh. A), 1-24-12)  
Sec. 22-277. - Conduct of hearing by special magistrate. 
(a)  Upon request of the code inspector or at such other times as may be necessary, a hearing before the special magistrate may be convened. Minutes shall be kept of all code enforcement hearings, and all hearings shall be open to the public. The special magistrate administrative division shall provide all clerical and administrative support reasonably necessary to conduct these hearings. 
(b)  Where proper notice of the hearing has been provided to the alleged violator pursuant to section 22-282 of this article, a hearing may proceed even in the absence of the alleged violator. 
(c)  At such hearing, the burden of proof shall be upon the code enforcement division to show by a preponderance of the evidence that a violation exists, or in the case of a repeat violation, existed on the date that the code inspector gave notice to the violator of a repeat violation pursuant to subsection 22-276(3) of this article. 
(d)  All testimony shall be under oath and shall be recorded. The formal rules of evidence shall not apply but fundamental due process shall be observed and shall govern the proceedings. Upon determination of the special magistrate, irrelevant, immaterial or unduly repetitious evidence may be excluded, but all other evidence of a type commonly relied upon by reasonably prudent persons in the conduct of their affairs shall be admissible, whether or not such evidence would be admissible in a trial in the courts of Florida. Any part of the evidence may be received in written form. 
(e)  The special magistrate may inquire of or question any witness present at the hearing. The alleged violator (hereinafter also referred to as respondent), respondent's attorney, code enforcement officers, or an attorney representing the division shall be permitted to inquire of or question any witness present at the hearing. The special magistrate may consider testimony presented by code enforcement officers, the respondent or any other witnesses. 
(f)  At the conclusion of the hearing, the special magistrate shall render his or her decision (order) based on evidence entered into the record. The decision shall then be transmitted to the respondent in the form of a written order including findings of fact, and conclusions of law consistent with the record. The order shall be transmitted by mail to the respondent within ten days after the hearing. The order may include a notice that it must be complied with by a specified date and that a fine and costs may be imposed and, under the circumstances set forth in subsection 22-276(3) of this article, the cost of repairs or other corrective action may be included along with the fine if the order is not complied with by said date. A certified copy of such order may be recorded in the public records of the county and shall constitute notice to any subsequent purchasers, successors in interest, or assigns if the violation concerns real property, and the findings therein shall be binding upon the violator and, if the violation concerns real property, any subsequent purchasers, successors in interest, or assigns. If an order is recorded in the public records pursuant to this paragraph and the order is complied with by the date specified in the order, the special magistrate shall issue an order acknowledging compliance that shall be recorded in the public records. A hearing is not required to issue such an order acknowledging compliance. 
(g)  If St. Pete Beach prevails in prosecuting a case before the special magistrate, it shall be entitled to recover all costs incurred. Whether and to what extent such costs are imposed shall be within the discretion of the special magistrate but shall not exceed the actual costs incurred. 
(Ord. No. 12-02, § 1(exh. A), 1-24-12)  
Sec. 22-278. - Special magistrate powers and duties. 
Special magistrates shall have the following powers and duties to: 
(1)  Hold hearings pursuant to section 22-277 of this article. 
(2)  Subpoena alleged violators and witnesses to its hearings. Subpoenas may be served by a sheriff or other authorized persons consistent with Rule 1.410(d) Florida Rules of Civil Procedure, upon request, by the special magistrate. 
(3)  Subpoena records, surveys, plats and other documentary materials. 
(4)  Take testimony under oath. 
(5)  Make findings of fact and conclusions of law as are necessary to enforce the provisions of the St. Pete Beach Code of Ordinances and Land Development Code and issue orders having the full force and effect of law to command whatever steps are necessary to bring a violation into compliance. 
(6)  Assess fines pursuant to section 22-279 of this article, including costs relating to the prosecution of cases before the special magistrate in those cases where the governing body prevails. 
(7)  Lien property pursuant to section 22-279 of this article. 
(8)  Assess costs pursuant to section 22-279 of this article. 
(9)  Assess costs pursuant to subsection 22-279(1) of this article. 
(Ord. No. 12-02, § 1(exh. A), 1-24-12)  
Sec. 22-279. - Administrative fines; costs; liens. 
(a)  The special magistrate, upon notification by a code inspector that a code enforcement order has not been complied with within the set time, may order the violator to pay a fine in an amount specified in this section for each day the violation continues past the date for compliance set forth in the order or upon notification by a code inspector that a repeat violation has occurred in the case of a repeat violation, for each day the repeat violation continues, beginning with the date the repeat violation is found to have occurred by the code inspector. In addition, if the violation is a violation described in subsection 22-276(4) of this article, the special magistrate shall notify the city manager, which may make all reasonable repairs or other corrective actions which are required to bring the property into compliance, or otherwise secure the property, and charge the violator with the reasonable costs of the repairs or other corrective actions along with the fine imposed pursuant to this section. Making such repairs does not create a continuing obligation on the part of the local governing body to make further repairs or to maintain the property and does not create any liability against the local governing body for damages to the property if such repairs were completed in good faith. If a finding of a violation or a repeat violation has been made as provided in this part, a hearing shall not be necessary for issuance of the order imposing the fine. An order imposing a fine shall be sent to the property owner with a notice that the owner may request a hearing to challenge the fine amount within 20 days of the order. Orders imposing fines shall not be filed as liens until the latter of the expiration of such 20-day notice period, or the completion of such timely requested challenge. A challenge to an order imposing a fine shall be limited to a consideration of only such new findings necessary to impose an appropriate fine and create a lien. 
(b)  A fine imposed pursuant to this section shall not exceed $250.00 per day for a first violation and shall not exceed $500.00 per day for a repeat violation and, in addition, may include all costs of repairs or other corrective action pursuant to subsection (a) of this section. If, after due notice and hearing, the special magistrate finds a violation to be irreparable or irreversible in nature, the special magistrate may impose a fine not to exceed $5,000.00 per violation or as otherwise authorized by Florida State Statute. In determining the amount of fine, if any, the special magistrate shall consider the following factors: 
(1)  The gravity of the violation; 
(2)  Any actions taken by the violator to correct the violation; and 
(3)  Any previous violations committed by the violator. 
(c)  The special magistrate may, in its discretion, adopt a consent order proposed by the enforcing department setting forth agreed terms for payment of any fine in lieu of execution or foreclosure as set forth in subsection (d), below. 
(d)  A certified copy of an order imposing a fine, or a fine plus repair costs, may be recorded in the public records in the Office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court in and for Pinellas County, Florida. Once recorded the certified copy of an order shall constitute a lien against the land on which the violation(s) exists and upon any other real or personal property owned by the violator; and it shall be enforceable in the same manner as a court judgment by the sheriffs of this state, including execution and levy against the personal property of the violator, but such order shall not be deemed to be a court judgment except for enforcement purposes. A fine imposed pursuant to this section shall continue to accrue until the violator comes into compliance or until judgment is rendered in a suit to foreclose on a lien, filed pursuant to this section, whichever comes first. Once recorded the lien shall be superior to any mortgages, liens, or other instruments recorded subsequent to the filing of the code enforcement lien. 
(e)  After three months from the filing of any such lien which remains unpaid, the city may foreclose the lien in the same manner as mortgage liens are foreclosed. Such lien shall bear interest at the rate allowable by law from the date of compliance set forth in the recorded order acknowledging compliance. The local governing body shall be entitled to collect all costs incurred in recording and satisfying a valid lien. No lien created pursuant to the provisions of this article may be foreclosed on real property that is a homestead under Article X, Section 4, of the Florida Constitution. 
(Ord. No. 12-02, § 1(exh. A), 1-24-12)  
Sec. 22-280. - Other legal remedies. 
In addition to the administrative penalties and enforcement procedures provided in this article, the board may institute any lawful civil action or proceeding to prevent, restrain, or abate violations of codes or ordinances or through its agents issue cease and desist orders. An enforcing department shall have the authority to issue cease and desist orders in the form of written official notices given to the owner of the subject building, property, or premises, or to his agent, lessee, tenant, contractor, or to any person using the land, building or premises where such violation has been committed or shall exist. Any failure to comply with a cease and desist order issued by an enforcing department shall be regarded, during any penalty setting phase, as an exaggerating circumstance by the special magistrate should any process relative to section 22-279 of this article result from the violation that is the subject of the cease and desist order. 
(Ord. No. 12-02, § 1(exh. A), 1-24-12)  
Sec. 22-281. - Appeals. 
Any aggrieved party, including the City of St. Pete Beach, may appeal an order of the special magistrate to a court of competent jurisdiction within 30 days of the execution of the order to be appealed. The city may assess a reasonable charge for the preparation of the record to be paid by the petitioner in accordance with F.S. § 119.07.

(a)  All notices required by this article shall be provided to the alleged violator by:

(2)  Hand delivery by the sheriff or other law enforcement officer, code inspector, or other person designated by the board; 
(3)  Leaving the notice at the violator's usual place of residence with any person residing therein who is above 15 years of age and informing such person of the contents of the notice; or 
(4)  In the case of commercial premises, leaving the notice with the manager or other person in charge. 
(b)  In addition to providing notice as set forth in subsection (a), at the option of the special magistrate administrative division, notice may also be served by publication or posting, as follows: 
(1)  Such notice shall be published once during each week for four consecutive weeks (four publications being sufficient) in a newspaper of general circulation in Pinellas County. The newspaper shall meet such requirements as are prescribed under F.S. ch. 50, for legal and official advertisements. 
(2)  Proof of publication shall be made as provided in F.S. §§ 50.041 and 50.051. 
(c)  In lieu of publication as described in subsection a., such notice may be posted at least ten days prior to the hearing, or prior to the expiration of any deadline contained in the notice, in at least two locations, one of which shall be the property upon which the violation is alleged to exist and the other of which shall be at the bulletin board of the City of St Pete Beach City Hall Building. Proof of posting shall be by affidavit of the person posting the notice, which affidavit shall include a copy of the notice posted and the date and places of its posting. 
(d)  Notice by publication or posting may run concurrently with, or may follow, an attempt or attempts to provide notice by hand delivery or by mail as required under subsection (a) of this section. 
Evidence that an attempt has been made to hand deliver or mail notice as provided in subsection (a) of this section, together with proof of publication or posting as provided in subsection (b) of this section, shall be sufficient to show that the notice requirements of this part have been met, without regard to whether or not the alleged violator actually received such notice. 
(Ord. No. 12-02, § 1(exh. A), 1-24-12)  
Sec. 22-283. - Procedure to request that a fine or lien imposed pursuant to section 22-279 be reduced; conditions and criteria therefor. 
(a)  The owner of real property against which a fine or lien has been imposed pursuant to section 22-279 of this article may apply to the special magistrate, through the city manager or his designee, for a satisfaction of such fine or lien with less than full payment thereof. No such application shall be considered by the special magistrate until the applicant has first shown that: 
(1)  All ad valorem property taxes, special assessments, county and city utility charges and other government and city-imposed liens against the subject real property have been paid; 
(2)  The applicant is not personally indebted to the city for any reason; and 
(3)  All city code violations have been corrected under necessary permits issued therefor. 
(b)  In considering an application to reduce a fine or lien imposed pursuant to section 22-279 of this article, no satisfaction thereof shall be approved by the special magistrate with less than full payment thereof, unless the special magistrate shall make a specific finding that no violation of any city ordinance exists on the subject real property. 
(c)  The balance of any fine or lien imposed pursuant to section 22-279 of this article that is reduced by the special magistrate shall be paid on terms as approved by the special magistrate. 
(d)  If the property for which the application for a fine reduction is being considered is owned by a government or quasi-government entity, the special magistrate may reduce such fine even if the violation has not been corrected.

(2)  Rollbacks and refunds. If the city commission determines that the initial basic cable rates as submitted exceed the reasonable rate standard or that the cable operator's cost-of-service showing justified lower rates, the city commission may order the rates reduced in accordance with subsection (g) or (h) of this section, as applicable.

The business or property owner shall be responsible for compliance with this article by solicitors employed by or representing him, in addition to the citation to be issued to the solicitor.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 
 
Sec. 66-26. - Definitions. 
(a)  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Accumulated contributions means a member's own contributions with interest at the rate of five percent per annum compounded annually as of October 1 each year that the contributions are in the fund on all contributions retroactive to the date when contributions began. For those members who purchase credited service with interest or at no cost to the system, any payment representing the amount attributable to member contributions based on the applicable member contribution rate, and any payment representing interest and any required actuarially calculated payments for the purchase of such credited service, shall be included in accumulated contributions, without the crediting of interest of five percent per annum. 
Actuarial equivalent means a benefit or amount of equal value, based upon the RP 2000 Combined Healthy Unisex Mortality Table and an interest rate equal to the investment return assumption set forth in the last actuarial valuation report approved by the board. This definition may only be amended by the city pursuant to the recommendation of the board using the assumptions adopted by the board with the advice of the plan's actuary, such that actuarial assumptions are not subject to city discretion. 
Average final compensation means 1/12 of the average salary of the five best years of the last ten years of credited service prior to retirement, termination, or death, or the career average as a full-time general employee, whichever is greater. A year shall be 12 consecutive months. 
Beneficiary means the person entitled to receive benefits under this article at the death of a member who has been designated in writing by the member and filed with the board. If no such designation is in effect or if no person so designated is living at the time of death of the member, the beneficiary shall be the estate of the member. 
Board means the board of trustees, which shall administer and manage the system provided in this article and serve as trustees of the fund. 
City means City of St. Pete Beach, Florida. 
Code means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time. 
Credited service means the total number of years and fractional parts of years of service as a general employee and member contributions to the plan from the date when contributions were first required, omitting intervening years or completed months when such member was not employed by the city as a general employee. A member may voluntarily leave his accumulated contributions in the fund for a period of five years after leaving the employ of the city pending the possibility of being reemployed as a general employee, without losing credit for the time that he was a member of the system. If a non-vested member is not reemployed as a general employee with the City of St. Pete Beach within five years, his accumulated contributions, if $1,000.00 or less, will be returned. If a member who is not vested is not reemployed within five years, his accumulated contributions, if more than $1,000.00, will be returned only upon the written request of the member and upon completion of a written election to receive a cash lump sum or to rollover the lump sum amount on forms designated by the board. If a vested member does not remain employed for a period of three years after reemployment within five years, his accumulated contributions will be returned only upon his written request. However, the credited service shall not be deemed to be interrupted by and a member shall receive credited service for periods during which the member is on an authorized leave of absence for a period not to exceed one year, but only if the member deposits into the fund, within 90 days after his return, the same sum that he would have contributed if he had been a general employee during his absence, plus an amount of interest equal to the actuarial valuation interest rate assumption in effect on the date of redeposit, plus payment of costs for all professional services rendered to the board in connection with the purchase of the periods of credited service for authorized leave time. 
Beginning January 1, 2009, to the extent required by section 414(u)(12) of the code, an individual receiving differential wage payments (as defined under section 3401(h)(2) of the code) from an employer shall be treated as employed by that employer, and the differential wage payment shall be treated as compensation for purposes of applying the limits on annual additions under section 415(c) of the code. This provision shall be applied to all similarly situated individuals in a reasonably equivalent manner. 
Leave conversions of unused accrued paid time off shall not be permitted to be applied toward the accrual of credited service either during each plan year of a member's employment with the city or in the plan year in which the member terminates employment. 
Fund means the trust fund established in this article as part of the system. 
General employee means any actively employed person in the regular full-time service of the city, including those in their initial probationary employment period, but excluding certified police officers and certified firefighters employed by the city. 
Member means an actively employed general employee who fulfills the prescribed participation requirements. Benefit improvements which, in the past, have been provided for by amendments to the system adopted by city ordinance, and any benefit improvements which might be made in the future shall apply prospectively and shall not apply to members who terminate employment or who retire prior to the effective date of any ordinance adopting such benefit improvements, unless such ordinance specifically provides to the contrary. 
Plan year means the 12-month period beginning October 1 and ending September 30 of the following year. 
Retiree means a member who has entered retirement status. 
Retirement means a member's separation from city employment with eligibility for immediate receipt of benefits under the system. 
Salary, for credited service prior to October 1, 2012, shall mean basic earnings received by an employee as compensation for services to the city as a general employee, excluding overtime, standby time, call-back bonus pay, accrued sick leave, sick leave award time, holiday bonus pay, accrued vacation pay and other bonuses and including tax deferred, tax sheltered and tax exempt items of income derived from elective employee payroll deductions or salary reductions. Salary shall also include bonus or premium pay received by a member when working temporarily in a higher pay grade. Compensation in excess of limitations set forth in section 401(a)(17) of the code as of the first day of the plan year shall be disregarded for any purpose, including employee contributions or any benefit calculations. The annual compensation of each member taken into account in determining benefits or employee contributions for any plan year beginning on or after January 1, 2002, may not exceed $200,000.00, as adjusted for cost-of-living increases in accordance with code section 401(a)(17)(B). Compensation means compensation during the fiscal year. The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to annual compensation for the determination period that begins with or within such calendar year. If the determination period consists of fewer than 12 months, the annual compensation limit is an amount equal to the otherwise applicable annual compensation limit multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the short determination period, and the denominator of which is 12. If the compensation for any prior determination period is taken into account in determining a member's contributions or benefits for the current plan year, the compensation for such prior determination period is subject to the applicable annual compensation limit in effect for that prior period. The limitation on compensation for an "eligible employee" shall not be less than the amount which was allowed to be taken into account under this article as in effect on July 1, 1993. "Eligible employee" is an individual who was a member before the first plan year beginning after December 31, 1995. Effective October 1, 2012, salary shall be defined in accordance with the provisions of section 66-116. 
Spouse means the member's or retiree's spouse under applicable law at the time benefits become payable. 
System means the city general employees' retirement system as contained in this article and all amendments thereto.

Sec. 66-27. - Membership. 
(a)  Conditions of eligibility. Conditions of eligibility of members in the general employees' retirement system shall be as follows: 
(1)  All members of the system on September 2, 1992 shall continue participating under this article. Beginning October 1, 1992, all current and future new general employees shall become members of this system as a condition of employment unless they are employed as the city manager or as "department directors," as defined in the City [of] St. Pete Beach Personnel Rules and Regulations Manual, and they elect not to participate, pursuant to subsection (2) below. 
(2)  Notwithstanding paragraph (1) above, employees in positions characterized as "department directors" may, upon employment, notify the board and the city, in writing, of their election to not be a member of the system. This election is an irrevocable, one-time election. Current employees of the city are not eligible for the opt-out provided for herein. In the event of any such election, they shall be barred from future membership in the system, and they shall become eligible for the city's deferred compensation plan under Internal Revenue Code section 457(b). Contributions to the plan in accordance with section 66-69 shall not be required, they shall not be eligible to be elected as a member trustee on the board or vote for a member trustee, and they shall not be eligible for any other benefits from the plan. 
(3)  Notwithstanding paragraph (1) above, employees in positions classified in the St. Pete Beach Personnel Rules and Regulations Manual as "managerial," "administrative," "professional," or "supervisory" (commonly referred to as "MAPS employees") may, upon employment, notify the board and the city, in writing of their election to opt out of participation in this plan. Current employees of the city are not eligible for the opt-out provided for herein. In the event of any such election, he shall be barred from future membership in the system. Contributions to the plan in accordance with section 66-69 shall not be required, he shall not be eligible to be elected as a member trustee on the board or vote for a member trustee, and he shall not be eligible for any other benefits from the plan. 
a.  MAPS employees who are active participants in this plan and who elect to opt out of this plan shall have the opportunity to make an irrevocable, one-time election to transfer assets into the city's money purchase plan. Such an election will result in any accumulated employee and employer contributions (for which it shall be assumed that there was an employer contribution equal to ten percent of each participant's compensation for each year of participation, prorated based on the number of months of actual participation, and on which no earnings, gains or losses shall be applied) made after employment and prior to opting out being transferred to that money purchase plan upon completion by the employee of the necessary administrative forms. In no event will the total amount transferred for any member opting out of the system be in excess of the actuarially determined amount that would result in any additional cost to the system. Money purchase plan participants shall be 100 percent vested in all such transferred amounts unless otherwise provided in the recipient plan, and notwithstanding anything in the system to the contrary, such participants shall have no further rights to any benefits under this plan. 
b.  Any and all elections under this section shall be effective on the first of the month following the date of the election. 
c.  Failure to make an election shall be treated as a deemed election to continue participating in the system and to keep such assets in the system. Any MAPS employees who elect to transfer into the money purchase plan, but who do not elect to transfer plan assets into the money purchase plan shall continue to earn service credit under the system for vesting purposes, but shall not earn additional service credit for benefit accrual purposes. 
d.  Former MAPS employees who are retired are not eligible to make this election. MAPS employees who are participating in the DROP as of the effective date of this section are treated as retirees under this plan, which means that such individuals are not entitled to elect to transfer funds into the money purchase pension plan. 
(b)  Designation of beneficiary. Each general employee shall complete a form prescribed by the board designating a beneficiary or beneficiaries.

It is intended that the system will constitute a qualified public pension plan under the applicable provisions of the Code for a qualified plan under Code Section 401(a) and a governmental plan under Code Section 414(d), as in effect on the effective date or amended under this article. Any modification or amendment of the system may be made retroactively, if necessary or appropriate, to qualify or maintain the system as a plan meeting the requirements of the applicable provisions of the Code, as in effect on the effective date or amended under this article, or any other applicable provisions of the U.S. federal tax law, as in effect on the effective date or amended or adopted under this article, and the regulations issued thereunder.

Sec. 66-29. - Repeal or termination of system. 
(a)  This article establishing the system and fund and subsequent ordinances pertaining to the system and fund may be modified, terminated, or amended, in whole or in part, provided that if this article or any subsequent ordinance shall be amended or repealed in its application to any person benefitting under this article, the amount of benefits which at the time of any such alteration, amendment, or repeal shall have accrued to the member or beneficiary shall not be affected thereby, except to the extent that the assets of the fund may be determined to be inadequate. 
(b)  If this article shall be repealed or if contributions to the system are discontinued or if there is a transfer, merger or consolidation of government units, services or functions as provided in F.S. ch. 121, the board shall continue to administer the system in accordance with this article, for the sole benefit of the members, any beneficiaries then receiving retirement allowances, and any future persons entitled to receive benefits under one of the options provided for in this article who are designated by any of such members. In the event of repeal, discontinuance of contributions, or transfer, merger or consolidation of government units, services or functions, there shall be full vesting (100 percent) of benefits accrued to the date of repeal, and the assets of the system shall be allocated in an equitable manner to provide benefits on a proportionate basis to the persons so entitled in accordance with the provisions thereof. 
(c)  The following shall be the order of priority for purposes of allocating the assets of the system as of the date of repeal of this article, or if contributions to the system are discontinued with the date of such discontinuation being determined by the board: 
(1)  Apportionment shall first be made in respect of each retiree receiving a retirement or disability benefit under this article on such date, each person receiving a benefit on such date on account of a retired or disabled (but since deceased) member, and each member who has, by such date, become eligible for normal retirement but has not yet retired, an amount which is the actuarial equivalent of such benefit, based upon the actuarial assumptions in use for the purposes of the most recent actuarial valuation, provided that, if such asset value shall be less than the aggregate of such amounts, such amounts shall be proportionately reduced so that the aggregate of such reduced amounts will be equal to such asset value. 
(2)  If there shall be any asset value remaining after the apportionment under subsection (c)(1) of this section, apportionment shall next be made in respect of each member in the service of the city on such date who is vested and who is not entitled to an apportionment under subsection (c)(1) of this section, in the amount required to provide the actuarial equivalent of the vested portion of the accrued normal retirement benefits (but not less than accumulated contributions), based on the credited service and average final compensation as of such date, and each vested former member then entitled to a deferred benefit who has not, by such date, begun receiving benefit payments, in the amount required to provide the actuarial equivalent of the vested portion of the accrued normal retirement benefit (but not less than accumulated contributions), provided that, if such remaining asset value shall be less than the aggregate of the amounts apportioned under this article, such latter amounts shall be proportionately reduced so that the aggregate of such reduced amounts will be equal to such remaining asset value. 
(3)  If there shall be any asset value after the apportionments under subsections (c)(1) and (2) of this section, apportionment shall be made in respect of each member in the service of the city on such date who is not entitled to an apportionment under subsections (c)(1) and (2) of this section in the amount equal to member's accumulated contributions, provided that, if such remaining asset value shall be less than the aggregate of the amounts apportioned under this article, such latter amount shall be proportionately reduced so that the aggregate of such reduced amounts will be equal to such remaining asset value. 
(4)  If there shall be any asset value remaining after the apportionments under subsections (c)(1), (2) and (3) of this section, apportionment shall lastly be made in respect of each member included in subsection (c)(3) of this section to the extent of the actuarial equivalent of the non-vested accrued normal retirement benefit, less the amount apportioned in subsection (c)(3) of this section, based on the credited service and average final compensation as of such date, provided that, if such remaining asset value shall be less than the aggregate of the amounts apportioned under this article, such amounts shall be reduced so that the aggregate of such reduced amounts will be equal to such remaining asset value.

The allocation of the fund provided for in this subsection may, as decided by the board, be carried out through the purchase of insurance company contracts to provide the benefits determined in accordance with this subsection. The fund may be distributed in one sum to the persons entitled to the benefits or the distribution may be carried out in such other equitable manner as the board may direct. The fund may be continued in existence for purposes of subsequent distributions. 
If, at any time during the first ten years after the effective date of the article originally establishing this system, the system shall be terminated or the full current costs of the system shall not have been met, anything in the system to the contrary notwithstanding, city contributions which may be used for the benefit of any one of the 25 highest paid members on the effective date, whose anticipated annual retirement allowance provided by the city's contributions at the member's normal retirement date would exceed $1,500.00, shall not exceed the greater of either (i) $20,000.00, or (ii) an amount computed by multiplying the smaller of $10,000.00 or 20 percent of such member's average final compensation during his last five years of service by the number of years of service since the effective date. If it shall be determined by statute, court decision, ruling by the commissioner of internal revenue or otherwise that the provisions of this paragraph are not then necessary to qualify the system under the Code, this paragraph shall be ineffective without the necessity of further amendment of this article. 
(d)  After all the vested and accrued benefits provided under this article have been paid and after all other liabilities have been satisfied, then and only then shall any remaining funds revert to the general fund of the city.

The contributions made by each member to the fund shall be designated as employer contributions pursuant to section 414(h) of the code. Such designation is contingent upon the contributions being excluded from the member's gross income for federal income tax purposes. For all other purposes of the system, such contributions shall be considered to be member contributions. 
(2)  Method. Such contributions shall be made by payroll deduction. 
(b)  City contributions. So long as this system is in effect, the city shall make quarterly contributions to the trust fund in an amount equal to the difference in each year, between the total aggregate member contributions for the year and the total cost for the year, as shown by the most recent actuarial valuation of the system. The total cost for any year shall be defined as the total normal cost plus the additional amount sufficient to amortize the unfunded past service liability as provided in part VII of F.S. ch. 112. 
(c)  Other. Private donations, gifts and contributions may be deposited to the fund, but such deposits must be accounted for separately and kept on a segregated bookkeeping basis. Funds arising from these sources may be used only for additional benefits for members, as determined by the board, and may not be used to reduce what would have otherwise been required city contributions.

The secretary of the board shall keep a record of all persons enjoying a pension under this article, in which it shall be noted the time when the pension is allowed and when the pension shall cease to be paid.

Secs. 66-7166-100. - Reserved.  
DIVISION 3. - BENEFITS 
 
Sec. 66-101. - Benefit amounts and eligibility. 
(a)  Normal retirement age and date. Under this article, a member's normal retirement date for members who retired, entered the DROP or terminated employment with the right to a deferred vested benefit prior to October 1, 2012; and members who are employed on September 30, 2012 and have attained age 55 or 25 years of credited service on that date shall be the earlier of the attainment of age 55 years, regardless of years of credited service, or the completion of 25 years of credited service, regardless of age. Each member shall become 100 percent vested in his accrued benefit at normal retirement age. A member's normal retirement date shall be the first day of the month coincident with or next following the date the member retires from the city after attaining normal retirement age. 
Normal retirement under the system is retirement from employment with the city on or after the normal retirement age and date. The normal retirement date for members who are employed on September 30, 2012 but have not attained age 55 or 25 years of credited service on that date, and members hired on or after October 1, 2012, shall be as provided in section 66-116; provided, members who are employed on September 30, 2012 but have not attained age 55 or 25 years of credited service on that date shall be eligible to receive their frozen accrued benefit through September 30, 2012 upon attaining age 55 or 25 years of credited service, and terminating city employment. Each member shall become 100 percent vested in his accrued benefit at normal retirement age. A member's normal retirement date shall be the first day of the month coincident with or next following the date the member retires from the city after attaining normal retirement age. 
(b)  Normal retirement benefit. A member retiring under this article on or after his normal retirement date shall receive a monthly benefit which shall commence on the first day of the month coincident with or next following his retirement date and be continued thereafter during member's lifetime, ceasing upon death, but with 120 monthly payments guaranteed in any event. The monthly retirement benefit for credited service earned prior to October 1, 2012 shall equal two and one-quarter percent of average final compensation for each year of credited service. In addition, all members retiring at early or normal retirement shall receive an additional $75.00 per month, unreduced for early retirement. The normal retirement benefit for credited service on and after October 1, 2012 shall be as provided in section 66-116. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, the normal retirement benefit of a member who is employed on September 30, 2012 and has attained age 55 or 25 years of credited service on that date shall equal 2.25 percent of average final compensation for all years of credited service. 
(c)  Early retirement date. A member may retire on his early retirement date, which shall be the first day of any month coincident with or next following the attainment of age 50 and the completion of ten years of credited service. Early retirement under the system is retirement from employment with the city on or after the early retirement date and prior to the normal retirement date. Effective October 1, 2012, there shall be no early retirement date or early retirement benefit; provided, members who are employed on September 30, 2012 but have not attained age 55 or 25 years of credited service on that date shall be eligible to receive their frozen accrued benefit through September 30, 2012 with the reduction provided in subsection (d)(2) below, upon attaining age 50 with ten years of credited service and terminating city employment. 
(d)  Early retirement benefit. A member retiring under this article on his early retirement date may receive either a deferred or an immediate monthly retirement benefit payable in the same form as for normal retirement as follows: 
(1)  A deferred monthly retirement benefit which shall commence on what would have been his normal retirement date had he remained a general employee and shall be continued on the first day of each month thereafter. The amount of each such deferred monthly retirement benefit shall be determined in the same manner as for retirement on his normal retirement date except that credited service and average final compensation shall be determined as of his early retirement date; or 
(2)  An immediate monthly retirement benefit which shall commence on his early retirement date and shall be continued on the first day of each month thereafter. The benefit payable shall be as determined in subsection (d)(1) of this section, reduced by 1/15 for each year by which the commencement of benefits precedes the member's normal retirement date. 
(e)  Cost-of-living adjustment. The monthly amount payable based on credited service prior to October 1, 2012 to a member and his joint pensioner or beneficiary, if applicable, who retires on or after such member's normal or early retirement date, not including terminated vested persons or disability retirees, shall be subject to an annual cost-of-living adjustment commencing on the first October 1 following ten complete years of receiving retirement income payments. The cost-of-living adjustment shall be three percent of the previous years' benefit amount. There shall be no cost of living adjustment applied to benefits based on credited service on or after October 1, 2012; provided, members who are employed on September 30, 2012 and have attained age 55 or 25 years of credited service on that date shall continue to be eligible for the cost of living adjustment provided in this subsection applied to benefits based on all periods of credited service. 
(f)  Required distribution date. The member's benefit under this section must begin to be distributed to the member no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age 70½ or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
(Code 1960, § 20-9; Ord. No. 81-51, §§ 13; Ord. No. 82-45, § 1; Ord. No. 82-46, § 1; Ord. No. 83-28, § 1; Code 1983, § 16-36; Ord. No. 92-22, § 6, 9-15-92; Ord. No. 95-10, § 5, 3-7-95; Ord. No. 98-53, § 2, 9-15-98; Ord. No. 99-29, § 1, 5-18-99; Ord. No. 03-24, § 1, 11-18-03; Ord. No. 10-26, § 1, 9-28-10; Ord. No. 12-25, § 4, 9-27-12; Ord. No. 19-10, § 5, 7-23-19)  
Sec. 66-102. - Preretirement death. 
Under this article, the beneficiary of any deceased member shall be entitled to an amount which is the actuarial equivalent of the value of the member's accrued benefit as of his date of death, payable over a term of not less than ten years, at the option of the beneficiary. The accrued benefit shall be based upon the average final compensation and credited service in effect on the date of death. 
(Code 1960, § 20-9; Ord. No. 81-51, §§ 13; Ord. No. 82-45, § 1; Ord. No. 82-46, § 1; Ord. No. 83-28, § 1; Code 1983, § 16-37; Ord. No. 92-22, § 7, 9-15-92; Ord. No. 95-10, § 6, 3-7-95; Ord. No. 03-24, § 1, 11-18-03; Ord. No. 10-26, § 1, 9-28-10)  
Sec. 66-103. - Disability. 
(a)  Generally. Any member with ten years or more credited service who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, because of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a general employee shall, upon establishing the same to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a monthly pension equal to two and one-quarter percent of his average final compensation multiplied by his total years of credited service. Subject to (a)(4) below, only active members of the system on the date the board determines entitlement to a disability benefit are eligible for disability benefits. 
(1)  Terminated persons, either vested or non-vested, are not eligible for disability benefits. 
(2)  If a member voluntarily terminates his employment, either before or after filing an application for disability benefits, he is not eligible for disability benefits. 
(3)  If a member is terminated by the city for any reason other than for medical reasons, either before or after he files an application for disability benefits, he is not eligible for disability benefits. 
(4)  The only exception to (1) above is: 
a.  If the member is terminated by the city for medical reasons and he has already applied for disability benefits before the medical termination, or; 
b.  If the member is terminated by the city for medical reasons and he applies within 30 days after the medical termination date. 
If either (4)a., or (4)b. above applies, the member's application will be processed and fully considered by the board. 
(b)  Conditions disqualifying disability benefits. Each member who is claiming disability benefits shall establish, to the satisfaction of the board, that such disability was not occasioned primarily by: 
(1)  Excessive or habitual use of any drugs, intoxicants or narcotics. 
(2)  Injury or disease sustained while willfully and illegally participating in fights, riots or civil insurrections. 
(3)  Injury or disease sustained while committing a crime. 
(4)  Injury or disease sustained while serving in any branch of the armed forces. 
(5)  Injury or disease sustained after his employment as a general employee with the city shall have terminated. 
(6)  Willful, wanton conduct or gross negligence of the member. 
(7)  Injury or disease sustained by the member while working for anyone other than the city and arising out of such employment. 
(8)  For general employees who become members of the system on or after January 1, 1995, a condition preexisting the general employee's membership in the system. Such members shall not be entitled to a disability pension, whether in line of duty or not in line of duty, because of or due to the aggravation of a specific injury, impairment or other medical condition preexisting at the time of membership in the system, provided that such preexisting condition and its relationship to a later injury, impairment or other medical condition be established by competent substantial evidence. Nothing in this subsection shall be construed to preclude a disability pension to a member who, after membership in the system, suffers an injury, impairment or other medical condition different from some other injury, impairment, or other medical condition existing at or prior to membership. 
(c)  Physical examination requirement. 
(1)  A member shall not become eligible for disability benefits until and unless he undergoes a physical examination by a qualified physician or surgeon, who shall be selected by the board for that purpose. The board shall not select the member's treating physician or surgeon for this purpose except in an unusual case where the board determines that it would be reasonable to do so. 
(2)  Any retiree receiving disability benefits under this article may be required by the board to submit sworn statements of his condition accompanied by a physician's statement (provided at the retiree's expense) to the board annually and may be required by the board to undergo additional periodic re-examinations by a qualified physician or physicians or surgeon or surgeons who shall be selected by the board, to determine if such disability has ceased to exist. If the board finds that the retiree is no longer permanently and totally disabled to the extent that he is unable to render useful and efficient service as a general employee, the board shall recommend to the city that the retiree be returned to performance of duty as a general employee, and the retiree so returned shall enjoy the same rights that he had at the time he was placed upon pension. If the retiree so ordered to return shall refuse to comply with the order within 30 days from the issuance thereof, he shall forfeit the right to his pension. 
(3)  The cost of the physical examination and reexamination of the member claiming or the retiree receiving disability benefits shall be borne by the fund. All other reasonable costs as determined by the board incident to the physical examination, such as but not limited to transportation, meals and hotel accommodations, shall be borne by the fund. 
(4)  If the retiree recovers from disability and reenters the service of the city as a general employee, his service will be deemed to have been continuous, but the period beginning with the first month for which he received a disability retirement income payment and ending with the date he reentered the service of the city will not be considered as credited service for the purposes of the system. 
(5)  The board shall have the power and authority to make the final decisions regarding all disability claims. 
(d)  Disability payments. The monthly benefit to which a member is entitled for the member's disability retirement shall be payable on the first day of the first month after the board determines such entitlement. However, the monthly retirement income shall be payable as of the date the board determined such entitlement and any portion due for a partial month shall be paid together with the first payment. The last payment will be: 
(1)  If the retiree recovers from the disability, the payment due next preceding the date of such recovery; or 
(2)  If the retiree dies without recovering from disability the payment due next preceding his death. 
Provided, however, the disability retiree may select, at any time prior to the date on which benefit payments begin, an optional form of benefit payment as described in subsection 66-105(a)(1) or (a)(2), which shall be the actuarial equivalent of the normal form of benefit. 
(e)  Workers' compensation. When a member is receiving a disability pension and workers' compensation benefits pursuant to F.S. ch. 440 for the same disability and the total monthly benefits received from both exceed 100 percent of the member's final monthly salary, excluding overtime, the disability pension benefit shall be reduced so that the total monthly amount received by the member does not exceed 100 percent of such salary. 
(Code 1960, § 20-9; Ord. No. 81-51, §§ 13; Ord. No. 82-45, § 1; Ord. No. 82-46, § 1; Ord. No. 83-28, § 1; Code 1983, § 16-38; Ord. No. 92-22, § 8, 9-15-92; Ord. No. 95-10, § 7, 3-7-95; Ord. No. 98-53, § 3, 9-15-98; Ord. No. 03-24, § 1, 11-18-03; Ord. No. 10-26, § 1, 9-28-10; Ord. No. 19-10, § 6, 7-23-19)  
Sec. 66-104. - Vesting. 
(a)  If a member terminates his employment as a general employee, either voluntarily or by discharge, and is not eligible for any retirement benefits under this system, the member shall be entitled to a percentage of the pension benefit accrued to his date of termination according to the following vesting schedule: 
Years of 
Credited Service 	Vested 
Percentage 
Less than 1 	0 
1 	10 
2 	20 
3 	30 
4 	40 
5 	50 
6 	60 
7 	70 
8 	80 
9 	90 
10 or more years 	100 
 
(b)  The vested portion of the accrued benefit shall be payable for life commencing at the member's election of the early or normal retirement date, provided he survives until benefit payments actually begin and provided he does not elect to withdraw his accumulated contributions from the fund upon termination. If such accumulated contributions are refunded, he shall forfeit all other entitlements under the system. However, the board may, in its sole discretion and according to uniform, nondiscriminatory guidelines, authorize an alternative form or method of payment provided actuarial equivalence is maintained. The benefit rate per year of service shall be the same as determined for early or normal retirement and shall depend upon the time of commencement of benefit payments. 
(c)  Member will be 100 percent vested in all benefits upon attainment of the plan's age and service requirements for the plan's normal retirement benefit; and 
(d)  A member will be 100 percent vested in all accrued benefits, to the extent funded, if the plan is terminated or experiences a complete discontinuance of employer contributions. 
(e)  Notwithstanding any other provision of this section 66-104, the provisions of this section shall apply to benefits accruing prior to October 1, 2012. Effective October 1, 2012, for benefits accruing on and after that date, vesting rights shall be as provided in section 66-116; provided, members who are employed on September 30, 2012 and have attained age 55 or 25 years of credited service on that date shall be entitled to a vested benefit in accordance with this section 66-104. 
(Code 1960, § 20-9; Ord. No. 81-51, §§ 13; Ord. No. 82-45, § 1; Ord. No. 82-46, § 1; Ord. No. 83-28, § 1; Code 1983, § 16-39; Ord. No. 92-22, § 9, 9-15-92; Ord. No. 03-24, § 1, 11-18-03; Ord. No. 10-26, § 1, 9-28-10; Ord. No. 12-25, § 5, 9-27-12)  
Sec. 66-105. - Optional forms of benefits. 
(a)  In lieu of the amount and form of retirement income payable for normal or early retirement as specified in this article, a member, upon written request to the board, may elect to receive a retirement income or benefit of equivalent actuarial value payable in accordance with one of the following options: 
(1)  A retirement income of a monthly amount payable to the retiree for his lifetime only. 
(2)  A retirement income of a modified monthly amount, payable to the retiree during the lifetime of the retiree and following the death of the retiree, 100 percent, 75 percent, 66 2/3 percent or 50 percent of such monthly amount payable to a joint pensioner for his lifetime. Except where the retiree's joint pensioner is his spouse, the payments to the joint pensioner as a percentage of the payments to the retiree shall not exceed the applicable percentage provided for in the applicable table in the Treasury Regulations. (See Q & A-2 of 1.401(a)(9)-6) 
(3)  If a member retires prior to the time at which Social Security benefits are payable, he may elect to receive an increased retirement benefit until such time as Social Security benefits shall be assumed to commence and a reduced benefit thereafter in order to provide, to as great an extent as possible, a more level retirement allowance during the entire period of retirement. The amounts payable shall be as recommended by the actuaries for the system, based upon the Social Security law in effect at the time of the member's retirement. 
(b)  The member, upon electing any option of this section, will designate the joint pensioner or beneficiary to receive the benefit, if any, payable under the system in the event of the member's death, and will have the power to change such designation from time to time. Such designation will name a joint pensioner or one or more primary beneficiaries where applicable. If the member has elected an option with a joint pensioner or beneficiary and the member's retirement income benefits have commenced, the member may thereafter change his designated beneficiary at any time, but may only change his joint pensioner if the designated joint pensioner and the member were married at the time of member's retirement and are divorced subsequent thereto and the joint pensioner is alive at the time of the change. In the absence of proof of good health of the joint pensioner being replaced, the actuary will assume that the joint pensioner has deceased for purposes of calculating the new payment. 
(c)  The consent of a member's or retiree's joint pensioner or beneficiary to any such change shall not be required. The rights of all previously designated beneficiaries to receive benefits under the system shall thereupon cease. 
(d)  Upon change of a retiree's joint pensioner in accordance with this section, the amount of the retirement income payable to the retiree shall be actuarially determined to take into account the age and sex of the former joint pensioner, the new joint pensioner and the retiree. Any such member shall pay the actuarial recalculation expenses. Each request for a change will be made in writing on a form prepared by the board and on completion will be filed with the board. If no designated beneficiary survives the retiree, such benefits as are payable for the death of the retiree subsequent to his retirement shall be paid as provided in section 66-106. 
(e)  Retirement income payments shall be made under the option elected in accordance with this section and shall be subject to the following limitations: 
(1)  If the member dies prior to his normal retirement date or early retirement date, whichever occurs first, no retirement benefit will be payable under the option to any person, but the benefits, if any, will be determined under section 66-102. 
(2)  If the designated beneficiary or joint pensioner dies before the member's retirement under the system, the option elected will be canceled automatically, and a retirement income of the normal form and amount will be payable to the member upon his retirement as if the election had not been made, unless a new election is made in accordance with this section or a new beneficiary is designated by the member prior to his retirement. 
(3)  If both the retiree and the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by member or retiree die before the full payment has been effected under any option providing for payments for a period certain and life thereafter, made pursuant to subsection (a)(1) of this section, the board may, in its discretion, direct that the commuted value of the remaining payments be paid in a lump sum and in accordance with section 66-106. 
(4)  If a member continues beyond his normal retirement date pursuant to subsection 66-101(a) and dies prior to his actual retirement and while an option made pursuant to this section is in effect, monthly retirement income payments will be made or a retirement benefit will be paid under the option to a beneficiary designated by the member in the amount computed as if the member had retired under the option on the date on which his death occurred. 
(5)  The member's benefit under this section must begin to be distributed to the member no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age 70½ or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
(f)  A retiree may not change his retirement option after the date of cashing or depositing his first retirement check. 
(g)  Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, the board in its discretion may elect to make a lump-sum payment to a member or a member's beneficiary in the event that the total commuted value of the monthly income payments to be paid do not exceed $1,000.00. Any such payment made to any person pursuant to the power and discretion conferred upon the board by the preceding sentence shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to such member and shall not be subject to review by anyone, but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons. 
(Code 1960, § 20-9; Ord. No. 81-51, §§ 13; Ord. No. 82-45, § 1; Ord. No. 82-46, § 1; Ord. No. 83-28, § 1; Code 1983, § 16-40; Ord. No. 92-22, § 10, 9-15-92; Ord. No. 95-10, § 8, 3-7-95; Ord. No. 03-24, § 1, 11-18-03; Ord. No. 06-26, § 2, 9-13-06; Ord. No. 10-26, § 1, 9-28-10)  
Sec. 66-106. - Beneficiaries. 
(a)  Each member or retiree subject to this article may, on a form provided for that purpose, signed and filed with the board, designate a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, which may be payable in the event of his death. Each designation may be revoked or changed by such member or retiree by signing and filing with the board a new designation-of-beneficiary form. Upon such change, the rights of all previously designated beneficiaries to receive any benefits under this system shall cease. 
(b)  If a deceased member or retiree failed to name a beneficiary in the manner prescribed in subsection (a) of this section or if the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) named by the member or retiree predeceases the member or retiree, the death benefit, if any, which may be payable under the system with respect to such deceased member or retiree shall be paid to the estate of the member or retiree and the board, in discretion, may direct that the commuted value of the remaining monthly income benefits be paid in a lump sum. 
(c)  Any payment made to any person pursuant to this section shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to the deceased member and any other persons with rights under the system and shall not be subject to review by anyone but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons ever interested hereunder. 
(Code 1960, § 20-9; Ord. No. 81-51, §§ 13; Ord. No. 82-45, § 1; Ord. No. 82-46, § 1; Ord. No. 83-28, § 1; Code 1983, § 16-41; Ord. No. 92-22, § 11, 9-15-92; Ord. No. 03-24, § 1, 11-18-03; Ord. No. 10-26, § 1, 9-28-10)  
Sec. 66-107. - Claims procedures. 
(a)  The board shall establish administrative claims procedures to be utilized in processing written requests ("claims"), on matters which affect the substantial rights of any person ("claimant"), including members, retirees, beneficiaries, or any person affected by a decision of the board. 
(b)  The board shall have the power to subpoena and require the attendance of witnesses and the production of documents for discovery prior to and at any proceedings provided for in the board's claims procedures. The claimant may request in writing the issuance of subpoenas by the board. A reasonable fee may be charged for the issuance of any subpoenas not to exceed the fees set forth in Florida Statutes. 
(Code 1960, § 20-9; Ord. No. 81-51, §§ 13; Ord. No. 82-45, § 1; Ord. No. 82-46, § 1; Ord. No. 83-28, § 1; Code 1983, § 16-42; Ord. No. 92-22, § 12, 9-15-92; Ord. No. 03-24, § 1, 11-18-03; Ord. No. 10-26, § 1, 9-28-10)  
Sec. 66-108. - Maximum pension. 
(a)  Basic limitation. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this system to the contrary, the member contributions paid to, and retirement benefits paid from, the system shall be limited to such extent as may be necessary to conform to the requirements of Code Section 415 for a qualified retirement plan. Before January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the limits specified in Code Section 415(b), subject to the applicable adjustments in that section. On and after January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the dollar amount specified in Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) ($160,000.00), subject to the applicable adjustments in Code Section 415(b) and subject to any additional limits that may be specified in this system. For purposes of this section, "limitation year" shall be the calendar year. 
(b)  Adjustments to basic limitation for form of benefit. If the form of benefit without regard to any benefit increase feature is not a straight life annuity, then the Code Section 415(b) limit applicable at the annuity starting date is reduced to an actuarially equivalent amount (determined using the assumptions specified in Treasury Regulation Section 1.415(b)-1(c)(2)(ii)) that takes into account the death benefits under the form of benefit. 
(c)  Benefits not taken into account. For purposes of this section, the following benefits shall not be taken into account in applying these limits: 
(1)  Any ancillary benefit which is not directly related to retirement income benefits; 
(2)  Any other benefit not required under Section 415(b)(2) of the Code and Regulations thereunder to be taken into account for purposes of the limitation of Code Section 415(b)(1). 
(d)  COLA effect. Effective on and after January 1, 2003, for purposes of applying the limits under Code Section 415(b) (the "limit"), the following will apply: 
(1)  A member's applicable limit will be applied to the member's annual benefit in the member's first calendar year of benefit payments without regard to any automatic cost of living adjustments; 
(2)  Thereafter, in any subsequent calendar year, a member's annual benefit, including any automatic cost of living increases, shall be tested under the then applicable benefit limit including any adjustment to the Code Section 415(b)(1)(A) dollar limit under Code Section 415(d), and the regulations thereunder; but 
(3)  In no event shall a member's benefit payable under the system in any calendar year be greater than the limit applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to Code Section 415(d) and the regulations thereunder. 
Unless otherwise specified in the system, for purposes of applying the limits under Code Section 415(b), a member's applicable limit will be applied taking into consideration cost of living increases as required by Section 415(b) of the Code and applicable Treasury Regulations. 
(e)  Other adjustments in limitations. 
(1)  In the event the member's retirement benefits become payable before age 62, the limit prescribed by this section shall be reduced in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to the provisions of Code Section 415(b) of the Code, so that such limit (as so reduced) equals an annual straight life benefit (when such retirement income benefit begins) which is equivalent to a $160,000.00 annual benefit beginning at age 62. 
(2)  In the event the member's benefit is based on at least 15 years of credited service as a full-time employee of the fire or police department of the city, the adjustments provided for in subsection (e)(1) above shall not apply. 
(3)  The reductions provided for in subsection (e)(1) above shall not be applicable to disability benefits pursuant to section 66-103, or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to section 66-102. 
(4)  In the event the member's retirement benefit becomes payable after age 65, for purposes of determining whether this benefit meets the limit set forth in subsection (a) herein, such benefit shall be adjusted so that it is actuarially equivalent to the benefit beginning at age 65. This adjustment shall be made in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate. 
(f)  Less than ten tears of participation. The maximum retirement benefits payable under this section to any member who has completed less than ten years participation shall be the amount determined under subsection (a) of this section multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of participation and the denominator of which is ten. The reduction provided by this subsection cannot reduce the maximum benefit below ten percent of the limit determined without regard to this subsection. The reduction provided for in this subsection shall not be applicable to pre-retirement disability benefits paid pursuant to section 66-103 or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to section 66-102. 
(g)  Participation in other defined benefit plans. The limit of this section with respect to any member who at any time has been a member in any other defined benefit plan as defined in Code Section 414(j) maintained by the city shall apply as if the total benefits payable under all city defined benefit plans in which the member has been a member were payable from one plan. 
(h)  Ten thousand dollar limit; less than ten years of service. Notwithstanding anything in this section 66-108, the retirement benefit payable with respect to a member shall be deemed not to exceed the limit set forth in this subsection (h) of section 66-108 if the benefits payable, with respect to such member under this system and under all other qualified defined benefit pension plans to which the city contributes, do not exceed $10,000.00 for the applicable limitation year or for any prior limitation year, and the city has not any at time maintained a qualified defined contribution plan in which the member participated; provided, however, that if the member has completed less than ten years of credited service with the city, the limit under this subsection (h) of section 66-108 shall be a reduced limit equal to $10,000.00 multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of credited service and the denominator of which is ten. 
(i)  Reduction of benefits. Reduction of benefits and/or contributions to all plans, where required, shall be accomplished by first reducing the member's benefit under any defined benefit plans in which member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be determined by the board and the plan administrator of such other plans, and next, by reducing or allocating excess forfeitures for defined contribution plans in which the member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be established by the board and the plan administrator for such other plans provided, however, that necessary reductions may be made in a different manner and priority pursuant to the agreement of the board and the plan administrator of all other plans covering such member. 
(j)  Service credit purchase limits. 
(1)  Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, if a member makes one or more contributions to purchase permissive service credit under the system, as allowed in sections 66-114 and 66-115, then the requirements of this section will be treated as met only if: 
a.  The requirements of Code Section 415(b) are met, determined by treating the accrued benefit derived from all such contributions as an annual benefit for purposes of Code Section 415(b), or 
b.  The requirements of Code Section 415(c) are met, determined by treating all such contributions as annual additions for purposes of Code Section 415(c). 
c.  For purposes of applying subsection (j)(1)a., the system will not fail to meet the reduced limit under Code Section 415(b)(2)(C) solely by reason of this subsection c., and for purposes of applying subsection (j)(1)b. the system will not fail to meet the percentage limitation under Section 415(c)(1)(B) of the Code solely by reason of this subsection c. 
(2)  For purposes of this subsection the term "permissive service credit" means service credit: 
a.  Recognized by the system for purposes of calculating a member's benefit under the plan. 
b.  Which such member has not received under the plan, and 
c.  Which such member may receive only by making a voluntary additional contribution, in an amount determined under the system, which does not exceed the amount necessary to fund the benefit attributable to such service credit. 
Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, such term may, if otherwise provided by the system, include service credit for periods for which there is no performance of service, and, notwithstanding clause (j)(2)b., may include service credited in order to provide an increased benefit for service credit which a member is receiving under the system. 
(3)  For purposes of applying the limits in this subsection (j), only and for no other purpose, the definition of compensation where applicable will be compensation actually paid or made available during a calendar year, except as noted below and as permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulations. Unless another definition of compensation that is permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulation, is specified by the system, compensation will be defined as wages within the meaning of Code Section 3401(a) and all other payments of compensation to an employee by an employer for which the employer is required to furnish the employee a written statement under Code Sections 6041(d), 6051(a)(3) and 6052 and will be determined without regard to any rules under Code Section 3401(a) that limit the remuneration included in wages based on the nature or location of the employment or the services performed (such as the exception for agricultural labor in Code Section 3401(a)(2). 
a.  However, for calendar years beginning after December 31, 1997, compensation will also include amounts that would otherwise be included in compensation but for an election under Code Sections 125(a), 402(e)(3), 402(h)(1)(B), 402(k), or 457(b). For calendar years beginning after December 31, 2000, compensation will also include any elective amounts that are not includible in the gross income of the employee by reason of Code Section 132(f)(4). 
b.  For limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2007, compensation for the calendar year will also include compensation paid by the later of two and one-half months after an employee's severance from employment or the end of the calendar year that includes the date of the employee's severance from employment if: 
1.  The payment is regular compensation for services during the employee's regular working hours, or compensation for services outside the employee's regular working hours (such as overtime or shift differential), commissions, bonuses or other similar payments, and, absent a severance from employment, the payments would have been paid to the employee while the employee continued in employment with the employer; or 
2.  The payment is for unused accrued bona fide sick, vacation or other leave that the employee would have been able to use if employment had continued. 
c.  Back pay, within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2(g)(8), shall be treated as compensation for the limitation year to which the back pay relates to the extent the back pay represents wages and compensation that would otherwise be included under this definition. 
(4)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the board may modify a request by a member to make a contribution to the system if the amount of the contribution would exceed the limits provided in Code Section 415 by using the following methods: 
a.  If the law requires a lump sum payment for the purchase of service credit, the board may establish a periodic payment deduction plan for the member to avoid a contribution in excess of the limits under Code Sections 415(c) or 415(n). 
b.  If payment pursuant to subsection (j)(4)a. will not avoid a contribution in excess of the limits imposed by Code Section 415(c), the board may either reduce the member's contribution to an amount within the limits of that section or refuse the member's contribution. 
(k)  Additional limitation on pension benefits. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary: 
(1)  The normal retirement benefit or pension payable to a retiree who becomes a member of the system and who has not previously participated in such system, on or after January 1, 1980, shall not exceed 100 percent of his average final compensation. However, nothing contained in this section shall apply to supplemental retirement benefits or to pension increases attributable to cost-of-living increases or adjustments. 
(2)  No member of the system shall be allowed to receive a retirement benefit or pension which is in part or in whole based upon any service with respect to which the member is already receiving, or will receive in the future, a retirement benefit or pension from a different employer's retirement system or plan. This restriction does not apply to social security benefits or federal benefits under Chapter 1223, Title 10, U.S. Code. 
(l)  Effect of direct rollover on 415(b) limit. If the plan accepts a direct rollover of an employee's or former employee's benefit from a defined contribution plan qualified under code section 401(a) which is maintained by the employer, any annuity resulting from the rollover amount that is determined using a more favorable actuarial basis than required under code section 417(e) shall be included in the annual benefit for purposes of the limit under code section 415(b). 
(Code 1960, § 20-9; Ord. No. 81-51, §§ 13; Ord. No. 82-45, § 1; Ord. No. 82-46, § 1; Ord. No. 83-28, § 1; Code 1983, § 16-45; Ord. No. 92-22, § 15, 9-15-92; Ord. No. 03-24, § 1, 11-18-03; Ord. No. 10-26, § 1, 9-28-10; Ord. No. 19-10, § 7, 7-23-19)  
Sec. 66-109. - Minimum distribution of benefits. 
(a)  General rules. 
(1)  Effective date. Effective as of January 1, 1989, the plan will pay all benefits in accordance with a good faith interpretation of the requirements of Code Section 401(a)(9) and the regulations in effect under that section, as applicable to a governmental plan within the meaning of Code Section 414(d). Effective on and after January 1, 2003, the plan is also subject to the specific provisions contained in this section. The provisions of this section will apply for purposes of determining required minimum distributions for calendar years beginning with the 2003 calendar year. 
(2)  Precedence. The requirements of this section will take precedence over any inconsistent provisions of the plan. 
(3)  TEFRA Section 242(b)(2) elections. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section other than this subsection (a)(3), distributions may be made under a designation made before January 1, 1984, in accordance with Section 242(b)(2) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA) and the provisions of the plan that related to Section 242(b)(2) of TEFRA. 
(b)  Time and manner of distribution. 
(1)  Required beginning date. The member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the member no later than the member's required beginning date which shall not be later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age 70½ or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
(2)  Death of member before distributions begin. If the member dies before distributions begin, the member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed no later than as follows: 
a.  If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died, or by a date on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained age 70½, if later, as the surviving spouse elects. 
b.  If the member's surviving spouse is not the member's sole designated beneficiary, then, distributions to the designated beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died. 
c.  If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the member's death, the member's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death. 
d.  If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the member but before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, this subsection (b)(2), other than subsection (b)(2)a., will apply as if the surviving spouse were the member. 
For purposes of this subsection (b)(2), distributions are considered to begin on the member's required beginning date or, if subsection (b)(2)d. applies, the date of distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (b)(2)a. If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the member before the member's required beginning date (or to the member's surviving spouse before the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (b)(2)a.) the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence. 
(3)  Death after distributions begin. If the member dies after the required distribution of benefits has begun, the remaining portion of the member's interest must be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution before the member's death. 
(4)  Form of distribution. Unless the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the first distribution calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with this section. If the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and Treasury regulations. Any part of the member's interest which is in the form of an individual account described in Section 414(k) of the Code will be distributed in a manner satisfying the requirements of Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and Treasury regulations that apply to individual accounts. 
(c)  Determination of amount to be distributed each year. 
(1)  General requirements. If the member's interest is paid in the form of annuity distributions under the plan, payments under the annuity will satisfy the following requirements: 
a.  The annuity distributions will be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not longer than one year. 
b.  The member's entire interest must be distributed pursuant to section 66-101, section 66-102, section 66-104, or section 66-105 (as applicable) and in any event over a period equal to or less than the member's life or the lives of the member and a designated beneficiary, or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the member or of the member and a designated beneficiary. The life expectancy of the member, the member's spouse, or the member's beneficiary may not be recalculated after the initial determination for purposes of determining benefits. 
(2)  Amount required to be distributed by required beginning date. The amount that must be distributed on or before the member's required beginning date (or, if the member dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under section 66-102) is the payment that is required for one payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., monthly. All of the member's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the member's required beginning date. 
(3)  Additional accruals after first distribution calendar year. Any additional benefits accruing to the member in a calendar year after the first distribution calendar year will be distributed beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues. 
(d)  General distribution rules. 
(1)  The amount of an annuity paid to a member's beneficiary may not exceed the maximum determined under the incidental death benefit requirement of Code Section 401(a)(9)(G), and effective for any annuity commencing on or after January 1, 2008, the minimum distribution incidental benefit rule under Treasury Regulation Section 1.401(a)(9)-6, Q&A-2. 
(2)  The death and disability benefits provided by the plan are limited by the incidental benefit rule set forth in Code Section 401(a)(9)(G) and Treasury Regulation Section 1.401-1(b)(1)(I) or any successor regulation thereto. As a result, the total death or disability benefits payable may not exceed 25 percent of the cost for all of the members' benefits received from the retirement system. 
(e)  Definitions. 
(1)  Designated beneficiary. The individual who is designated as the beneficiary under the plan and is the designated beneficiary under Section 401(a)(9) of the Code and Section 1.401(a)(9)-1, Q&A-4, of the Treasury Regulations. 
(2)  Distribution calendar year. A calendar year for which a minimum distribution is required. For distributions beginning before the member's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year which contains the member's required beginning date. For distributions beginning after the member's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin pursuant to section 66-102. 
(Code 1960, § 20-9; Ord. No. 81-51, §§ 13; Ord. No. 82-45, § 1; Ord. No. 82-46, § 1; Ord. No. 83-28, § 1; Code 1983, § 16-47; Ord. No. 92-22, § 17, 9-15-92; Ord. No. 95-10, § 10, 3-7-95; Ord. No. 03-24, § 1, 11-18-03; Ord. No. 06-26, § 3, 9-13-06; Ord. No. 10-26, § 1, 9-28-10)  
Sec. 66-110. - Direct transfers of eligible rollover distributions; elimination of mandatory distributions. 
(a)  Rollover distributions. 
(1)  General. This section applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 2002. Notwithstanding any provision of the system to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
(2)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
a.  Direct rollover means a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. 
b.  Distributee includes an employee or former employee. It also includes the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse. Effective January 1, 2007, it further includes a non-spouse beneficiary who is a designated beneficiary as defined by Code Section 401(a)(9)(E). However, a non-spouse beneficiary may rollover the distribution only to an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity established for the purpose of receiving the distribution and the account or annuity will be treated as an "inherited" individual retirement account or annuity. 
c.  Eligible retirement plan means an individual retirement account described in Section 408(a) of the Code; an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b) of the Code; an annuity plan described in Section 403(a) of the Code; effective January 1, 2002, an eligible deferred compensation plan described in Section 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by an eligible employer described in Section 457(e)(1)(A) of the Code and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan; effective January 1, 2002, an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of the Code; or a qualified trust described in Section 401(a) of the Code; or effective January 1, 2008, a Roth IRA described in Section 408A of the Code, that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. This definition shall also apply in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse. 
d.  Eligible rollover distribution means any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments, not less frequently than annually, made for the life or life expectancy of the distributee or the joint lives or joint life expectancies of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under Section 401(a)(9) of the Code; and the portion of any distribution that is not includible in gross income. Effective January 1, 2002, any portion of any distribution which would be includible in gross income as after-tax employee contributions will be an eligible rollover distribution if the distribution is made to an individual retirement account described in Section 408(a); to an individual retirement annuity described in Section 408(b); to a qualified defined contribution plan described in Section 401(a) or 403(a) that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible; or on or after January 1, 2007, to a qualified defined benefit plan described in Code Section 401(a) or to an annuity contract described in Code Section 403(b), that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of the distribution that is includible in gross income and the portion of the distribution that is not so includible. 
(b)  Rollovers or transfers into the fund. On or after January 1, 2002, the system will accept, solely for the purpose of purchasing credited service as provided herein, permissible member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans, member rollover cash contributions and/or direct cash rollovers of distributions made on or after January 1, 2002, as follows: 
(1)  Transfers and direct rollovers or member rollover contributions from other plans. The system will accept either a direct rollover of an eligible rollover distribution or a member contribution of an eligible rollover distribution from a qualified plan described in Section 401(a) or 403(a) of the Code, from an annuity contract described in Section 403(b) of the Code or from an eligible plan under Section 457(b) of the Code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state. The system will also accept legally permissible member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans. 
(2)  Member rollover contributions from IRAs. The system will accept a member rollover contribution of the portion of a distribution from an individual retirement account or annuity described in Section 408(a) or 408(b) of the Code that is eligible to be rolled over. 
(c)  Elimination of mandatory distributions. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, in the event this plan provides for a mandatory (involuntary) cash distribution from the plan not otherwise required by law, for an amount in excess of $1,000.00, such distribution shall be made from the plan only upon written request of the member and completion by the member of a written election on forms designated by the board, to either receive a cash lump sum or to rollover the lump sum amount. 
(Code 1960, § 20-9; Ord. No. 81-51, §§ 13; Ord. No. 82-45, § 1; Ord. No. 82-46, § 1; Ord. No. 83-28, § 1; Code 1983, § 16-50.4; Ord. No. 93-26, § 2, 9-21-93; Ord. No. 03-24, § 1, 11-18-03; Ord. No. 06-26, § 4, 9-13-06; Ord. No. 10-26, § 1, 9-28-10)  
Sec. 66-111. - Family and medical leave. 
Under this article, the fractional parts of the 24-month period ending each March 1 that a member is on leave without pay from the city pursuant to the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) shall be added to his credited service provided that: 
(1)  The member contributes to the fund the sum that he would have contributed, based on his salary and the member contribution rate in effect at the time that the credited service is requested, had he been a member of the system for the fractional parts of the 24 months ending each March 1 for which he is requesting credit plus amounts actuarially determined such that the crediting of service does not result in any cost to the fund plus payment of costs for all professional services rendered to the board in connection with the purchase of periods of credited service. 
(2)  The request for credited service for FMLA leave time for the 24-month period prior to each March 1 and payment of professional fees shall be made on or before March 31. 
(3)  Payment by the member of the required amount shall be made on or before April 30 for the preceding 24-month period ending March 1 and shall be made in one lump-sum payment upon receipt of which credited service shall be issued. 
(4)  Credited service purchased pursuant to this section shall count toward vesting. 
(Code 1960, § 20-9; Ord. No. 81-51, §§ 13; Ord. No. 82-45, § 1; Ord. No. 82-46, § 1; Ord. No. 83-28, § 1; Code 1983, § 16-50.5; Ord. No. 95-10, § 12, 3-7-95; Ord. No. 03-24, § 1, 11-18-03; Ord. No. 10-26, § 1, 9-28-10)  
Sec. 66-112. - Reemployment after retirement. 
(a)  Any retiree who is retired under this system may be reemployed by any public or private employer, and may receive compensation from that employment without limiting or restricting in any way the retirement benefits payable under this system. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, reemployment by the city shall be subject to the limitations set forth in this section. 
(b)  After normal retirement. Any retiree who is retired under normal retirement pursuant to this system and who is reemployed as a general employee after that retirement and, by virtue of that reemployment, is eligible to participate in this system, shall upon being reemployed continue receipt of benefits if he is at least age 62, otherwise the system shall discontinue receipt of benefits until he reaches age 62. Upon reemployment, the retiree shall be deemed to be fully vested and the additional credited service accrued during the subsequent employment period shall be used in computing a second benefit amount attributable to the subsequent employment period, which benefit amount shall be added to the benefit determined upon the initial retirement to determine the total benefit payable upon final retirement. Calculations of benefits upon retirement shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation, and credited service as of that date (not including any period of DROP participation) and the retirement benefit amount for any subsequent employment period shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation, and credited service as of the date of subsequent retirement (based only on the subsequent employment period). The amount of any death or disability benefit received as a result of a subsequent period of employment shall be reduced by the amount of accrued benefit eligible to be paid for a prior period of employment. The optional form of benefit and any joint pensioner selected upon initial retirement shall not be subject to change upon subsequent retirement except as otherwise provided herein, but the member may select a different optional form and joint pensioner applicable to the subsequent retirement benefit. 
(c)  Any retiree who is retired under normal retirement pursuant to this system and who is reemployed by the city after that retirement and, by virtue of that reemployment is ineligible to participate in this system, shall, during the period of such reemployment, continue receipt of benefits previously earned if he is at least age 62, otherwise the system shall discontinue receipt of benefits until he reaches age 62. Former DROP participants shall begin receipt of benefits under these circumstances. 
(d)  After early or disability retirement. Any retiree who is retired under early or disability retirement pursuant to this system and who subsequently becomes an employee of the city in any capacity shall discontinue receipt of benefits from the system. If by virtue of that reemployment, the retiree is eligible to participate in this system, the retiree shall be deemed to be fully vested and the additional credited service accrued during the subsequent employment period shall be used in computing a second benefit amount attributable to the subsequent employment period, which benefit amount shall be added to the benefit determined upon the initial retirement to determine the total benefit payable upon final retirement. Calculations of benefits upon retirement shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation, credited service and early retirement reduction factor as of that date and the retirement benefit amount for any subsequent employment period shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation (based only on the subsequent employment period), and credited service as of the date of subsequent retirement. The amount of any death or disability benefit received as a result of a subsequent period of employment shall be reduced by the amount of accrued benefit eligible to be paid for a prior period of employment. The optional form of benefit and any joint pensioner selected upon initial retirement shall not be subject to change upon subsequent retirement except as otherwise provided herein, but the member may select a different optional form and joint pensioner applicable to the subsequent retirement benefit. Retirement pursuant to an early retirement incentive program shall be deemed early retirement for purposes of this section if the member was permitted to retire prior to the customary retirement date provided for in the system at the time of retirement. 
(e)  Reemployment of terminated vested persons. Reemployed terminated vested persons shall not be subject to the provisions of this section until such time as they begin to actually receive benefits. Upon receipt of benefits, terminated vested persons shall be treated as normal or early retirees for purposes of applying the provisions of this section and their status as an early or normal retiree shall be determined by the date they elect to begin to receive their benefit. 
(f)  DROP participants. Retirees who were in the deferred retirement option plan shall, following termination of employment after DROP participation, have the options provided for in this section for reemployment. 
(Ord. No. 19-10, § 8, 7-23-19)  
Sec. 66-113. - Deferred retirement option plan. 
(a)  Definitions. As used in this section 66-113, the following definitions apply: 
(1)  DROP means the City of St. Pete Beach General Employees' Deferred Retirement Option Plan. 
(2)  DROP account means the account established for each DROP participant under subsection (c). 
(3)  Total return of the assets. For purposes of calculating earnings on a member's DROP account pursuant to subsection (c)(2)b.2., for each fiscal year quarter, the percentage increase (or decrease) in the interest and dividends earned on investments, including realized and unrealized gains (or losses), of the total plan assets. 
(b)  Participation. 
(1)  Eligibility to participate. In lieu of terminating his employment as a general employee, any member who is eligible for normal retirement under section 66-101(a), of the system may, prior to October 1, 2012, elect to defer receipt of such service retirement pension and to participate in the DROP. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the DROP shall be closed to new participants effective October 1, 2012, and no member may enter the DROP on or after that date; provided, a member who is employed on September 30, 2012 and has attained age 55 or 25 years of credited service on that date may enter and participate in the DROP on or after October 1, 2012 in accordance with the provisions of this section. 
(2)  Election to participate. A member's election to participate in the DROP must be made in writing in a time and manner determined by the board and shall be effective on the first day of the first calendar month which is at least 15 business days after it is received by the board. 
(3)  Period of participation. A member who elects to participate in the DROP under subsection (b)(2), shall participate in the DROP for a period not to exceed 60 months beginning at the time his election to participate in the DROP first becomes effective. An election to participate in the DROP shall constitute an irrevocable election to resign from the service of the city not later than the date provided for in the previous sentence. A member may participate only once. 
(4)  Termination of participation. 
a.  A member's participation in the DROP shall cease at the earlier of: 
1.  The end of his permissible period of participation in the DROP as determined under subsection (b)(3); or 
2.  Termination of his employment as a general employee. 
b.  Upon the member's termination of participation in the DROP, pursuant to subsection 1. above, all amounts provided for in this subsection (c)(2), including monthly benefits and investment earnings or losses or interest, as applicable, shall cease to be transferred from the system to his DROP account. Any amounts remaining in his DROP account shall be paid to him in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) when he terminates his employment as a general employee. 
c.  A member who terminates his participation in the DROP under subsection (b)(4) shall not be permitted to again become a participant in the DROP. 
(5)  Effect of DROP participation on the system. 
a.  A member's credited service and his accrued benefit under the system shall be determined on the date his election to participate in the DROP first becomes effective. The member shall not accrue any additional credited service or any additional benefits under the system (except for any additional benefits provided under any cost-of-living adjustment in the system) while he is a participant in the DROP. After a member commences participation, he shall not be permitted to again contribute to the system, nor shall he be eligible for disability, nor shall his estate or beneficiary be eligible for pre-retirement death benefits. 
b.  No amounts shall be paid to a member from the system while the member is a participant in the DROP. Unless otherwise specified in the system, if a member's participation in the DROP is terminated other than by terminating his employment as a general employee, no amounts shall be paid to him from the system until he terminates his employment as a general employee. Unless otherwise specified in the system, amounts transferred from the system to the member's DROP account shall be paid directly to the member only on the termination of his employment as a general employee. 
(c)  Funding. 
(1)  Establishment of DROP account. A DROP account shall be established for each member participating in the DROP. A member's DROP account shall consist of amounts transferred to the DROP under subsection (c)(2), and earnings or interest on those amounts. 
(2)  Transfers from retirement system. 
a.  As of the first day of each month of a member's period of participation in the DROP, the monthly retirement benefit he would have received under the system had he terminated his employment as a general employee and elected to receive monthly benefit payments thereunder shall be transferred to his DROP account, except as otherwise provided for in subsection (b)(4)b. A member's period of participation in the DROP shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of subsections (b)(3) and (b)(4), but in no event shall it continue past the date he terminates his employment as a general employee. 
b.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b)(4)b., a member's DROP account under this subsection (c)(2) shall be debited or credited with either: 
1.  Interest at an effective rate of seven and one-half percent per annum compounded monthly determined on the last business day of the prior month's ending balance and credited to the member's DROP account as of such date (to be applicable to all current and future DROP participants); or 
2.  Earnings, to be credited or debited to the member's DROP account, determined as of the last business day of each fiscal year quarter and debited or credited as of such date, determined as follows: 
The average daily balance in a member's DROP account shall be credited or debited at a rate equal to the actual net rate of investment return realized by the system for that quarter. "Net investment return" for the purpose of this paragraph is the total return of the assets in which the member's DROP account is invested by the board net of brokerage commissions, transaction costs and management fees. 
For purposes of calculating earnings on a member's DROP account pursuant to this subsection (c)(2)b.2., brokerage commissions, transaction costs, and management fees shall be determined for each quarter by the investment consultant pursuant to contracts with fund managers as reported in the custodial statement. The investment consultant shall report these quarterly contractual fees to the board. The investment consultant shall also report the net investment return for each manager and the net investment return for the total plan assets. 
Upon electing participation in the DROP, the member shall elect to receive either interest or earnings on his account to be determined as provided above. The member may, in writing, elect to change his election only once during his DROP participation. An election to change must be made prior to the end of a quarter and shall be effective beginning the following quarter. 
c.  A member's DROP account shall only be credited or debited with earnings or interest and monthly benefits while the member is a participant in the DROP. A member's final DROP account value for distribution to the member upon termination of participation in the DROP shall be the value of the account at the end of the quarter immediately preceding termination of participation for participants electing the net plan return and at the end of the month immediately preceding termination of participation for participants electing the flat interest rate return, plus any monthly periodic additions made to the DROP account subsequent to the end of the previous quarter or month, as applicable, and prior to distribution. If a member is employed by the city as a general employee after participating in the DROP for the permissible period of DROP participation, then beginning with the member's first month of employment following the last month of the permissible period of DROP participation, the member's DROP account will no longer be credited or debited with earnings or interest, nor will monthly benefits be transferred to the DROP account. All such non-transferred amounts shall be forfeited and continue to be forfeited while the member is employed by the city as a general employee. A member employed by the city as a general employee after the permissible period of DROP participation will still not be eligible for disability benefits, nor shall his estate or beneficiary be eligible for pre-retirement death benefits, nor will he accrue additional credited service. 
(d)  Distribution of DROP accounts on termination of employment. 
(1)  Eligibility for benefits. A member shall receive the balance in his DROP account in accordance with the provisions of this subsection (d) upon his termination of employment as a general employee. Except as provided in subsection (d)(5), no amounts shall be paid to a member from the DROP prior to his termination of employment as a general employee. 
(2)  Form of distribution. 
a.  Unless the member elects otherwise, distribution of his DROP account shall be made in a lump sum, subject to the direct rollover provisions set forth in subsection (d)(6). A member may elect, in such time and manner as the board shall prescribe, to receive the optional form of benefit described below. 
Until the value of the member's DROP account is completely depleted, payments in approximately equal quarterly or annual installments over a period, designated by the member, not to exceed the life expectancy of the last survivor of the member and his beneficiary. In the event that the member dies before all installments have been paid, the remaining balance in his DROP account shall be paid in an immediate cash lump sum to his beneficiary, or if none is designated, then to the member's estate. 
b.  Notwithstanding the preceding, if a member dies before his benefits commence, his DROP account shall be paid to his beneficiary in such optional form as his beneficiary may select. If no beneficiary designation is made, the DROP account shall be distributed to the member's estate. 
(3)  Date of payment of distribution. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection (d), distribution of a member's DROP account shall begin as soon as administratively practicable following the member's termination of employment. Distribution of the amount in a member's DROP account will not be made unless the member completes a written request for distribution and a written election, on forms designated by the board, to either receive a cash lump sum or a rollover of the lump sum amount. 
(4)  Proof of death and right of beneficiary or other person. The board may require and rely upon such proof of death and such evidence of the right of any beneficiary or other person to receive the value of a deceased member's DROP account as the board may deem proper and its determination of the right of that beneficiary or other person to receive payment shall be conclusive. 
(5)  Distribution limitation. Notwithstanding any other provision of subsection (d), all distributions from the DROP shall conform to the "minimum distribution of benefits" provisions as provided for herein. 
(6)  Direct rollover of certain distributions. This subsection applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 2002. Notwithstanding any provision of the DROP to the contrary, a distributee may elect to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid in a direct rollover as otherwise provided under the system in section 66-110. 
(e)  Administration of DROP. 
(1)  Board administers the DROP. The general administration of the DROP, the responsibility for carrying out the provisions of the DROP and the responsibility of overseeing the investment of the DROP's assets shall be placed in the board. The members of the board may appoint from their number such subcommittees with such powers as they shall determine; may adopt such administrative procedures and regulations as they deem desirable for the conduct of their affairs; may authorize one or more of their number or any agent to execute or deliver any instrument or make any payment on their behalf; may retain counsel, employ agents and provide for such clerical, accounting, actuarial and consulting services as they may require in carrying out the provisions of the DROP; and may allocate among themselves or delegate to other persons all or such portion of their duties under the DROP, other than those granted to them as trustee under any trust agreement adopted for use in implementing the DROP, as they, in their sole discretion, shall decide. A trustee shall not vote on any question relating exclusively to himself. 
(2)  Individual accounts, records and reports. The board shall maintain, or cause to be maintained, records showing the operation and condition of the DROP, including records showing the individual balances in each member's DROP account, and the board shall keep, or cause to be kept, in convenient form such data as may be necessary for the valuation of the assets and liabilities of the DROP. The board shall prepare or cause to be prepared and distributed to members participating in the DROP and other individuals or filed with the appropriate governmental agencies, as the case may be, all necessary descriptions, reports, information returns, and data required to be distributed or filed for the DROP pursuant to the code, the applicable portions of the act and any other applicable laws. 
(3)  Establishment of rules. Subject to the limitations of the DROP, the board from time to time shall establish rules for the administration of the DROP and the transaction of its business. The board shall have discretionary authority to construe and interpret the DROP (including but not limited to determination of an individual's eligibility for DROP participation, the right and amount of any benefit payable under the DROP and the date on which any individual ceases to be a participant in the DROP). The determination of the board as to the interpretation of the DROP or its determination of any disputed questions shall be conclusive and final to the extent permitted by applicable law. The board shall also oversee the investment of the DROP'S assets. 
(4)  Limitation of liability. 
a.  The trustees shall not incur any liability individually or on behalf of any other individuals for any act or failure to act, made in good faith in relation to the DROP or the funds of the DROP. 
b.  Neither the board nor any trustee of the board shall be responsible for any reports furnished by any expert retained or employed by the board, but they shall be entitled to rely thereon as well as on certificates furnished by an accountant or an actuary, and on all opinions of counsel. The board shall be fully protected with respect to any action taken or suffered by it in good faith in reliance upon such expert, accountant, actuary or counsel, and all actions taken or suffered in such reliance shall be conclusive upon any person with any interest in the DROP. 
(f)  General provisions. 
(1)  The DROP is not a separate retirement plan. Instead, it is a program under which a member who is eligible for normal retirement under the system may elect to accrue future retirement benefits in the manner provided in this section 66-108 for the remainder of his employment, rather than in the normal manner provided under the plan. Upon termination of employment, a member is entitled to a lump sum distribution of his or her DROP account balance or may elect a rollover. The DROP account distribution is in addition to the member's monthly benefit. 
(2)  Notional account. The DROP account established for such a member is a notional account, used only for the purpose of calculation of the DROP distribution amount. It is not a separate account in the system. There is no change in the system's assets, and there is no distribution available to the member until the member's termination from the DROP. The member has no control over the investment of the DROP account. 
(3)  No employer discretion. The DROP benefit is determined pursuant to a specific formula which does not involve employer discretion. 
(4)  IRC limit. The DROP account distribution, along with other benefits payable from the system, is subject to limitation under Internal Revenue Code section 415(b). 
(5)  Amendment of DROP. The DROP may be amended by an ordinance of the city at any time and from time to time, and retroactively if deemed necessary or appropriate, to amend in whole or in part any or all of the provisions of the DROP. However, except as otherwise provided by law, no amendment shall make it possible for any part of the DROP's funds to be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of persons entitled to benefits under the DROP. No amendment shall be made which has the effect of decreasing the balance of the DROP account of any member. 
(6)  Facility of payment. If the board shall find that a member or other person entitled to a benefit under the DROP is unable to care for his affairs because of illness or accident or is a minor, the board may direct that any benefit due him, unless claim shall have been made for the benefit by a duly appointed legal representative, be paid to his spouse, a child, a parent or other blood relative, or to a person with whom he resides. Any payment so made shall be a complete discharge of the liabilities of the DROP for that benefit. 
(7)  Information. Each member, beneficiary or other person entitled to a benefit, before any benefit shall be payable to him or on his account under the DROP, shall file with the board the information that it shall require to establish his rights and benefits under the DROP. 
(8)  Written elections, notification. 
a.  Any elections, notifications or designations made by a member pursuant to the provisions of the DROP shall be made in writing and filed with the board in a time and manner determined by the board under rules uniformly applicable to all employees similarly situated. The board reserves the right to change from time to time and manner for making notifications, elections or designations by members under the DROP if it determines after due deliberation that such action is justified in that it improves the administration of the DROP. In the event of a conflict between the provisions for making an election, notification or designation set forth in the DROP and such new administrative procedures, those new administrative procedures shall prevail. 
b.  Each member or retiree who has a DROP account shall be responsible for furnishing the board with his current address and any subsequent changes in his address. Any notice required to be given to a member or retiree hereunder shall be deemed given if directed to him at the last such address given to the board and mailed by registered or certified United States mail. If any check mailed by registered or certified United States mail to such address is returned, mailing of checks will be suspended until such time as the member or retiree notifies the board of his address. 
(9)  Benefits not guaranteed. All benefits payable to a member from the DROP shall be paid only from the assets of the member's DROP account and neither the city nor the board shall have any duty or liability to furnish the DROP with any funds, securities or other assets except to the extent required by any applicable law. 
(10)  Construction. 
a.  The DROP shall be construed, regulated and administered under the laws of Florida, except where other applicable law controls. 
b.  The titles and headings of the subsections in this section 66-113 are for convenience only. In the case of ambiguity or inconsistency, the text rather than the titles or headings shall control. 
(11)  Forfeiture of retirement benefits. Nothing in this section shall be construed to remove DROP participants from the application of any forfeiture provisions applicable to the system. DROP participants shall be subject to forfeiture of all retirement benefits, including DROP benefits. 
(12)  Effect of DROP participation on employment. Participation in the DROP is not a guarantee of employment and DROP participants shall be subject to the same employment standards and policies that are applicable to employees who are not DROP participants.

Sec. 66-114. - Prior government service. 
Unless otherwise prohibited by law, the years or fractional parts of years that a general employee who was previously a member, but who terminated employment and is not otherwise entitled to credited service for such previous period of employment as a general employee, or the years or fractional parts of years that a member previously served as an employee for any governmental agency in the United States, including but not limited to federal, state or local government service, and for which he does not otherwise qualify for and receive credit under this system, shall be added to his years of credited service provided that: 
(1)  The member contributes to the fund the sum that he would have contributed, based on his salary and the member contribution rate in effect at the time that the credited service is requested, had he been a member of the system for the years or fractional parts of years for which he is requesting credit plus amounts actuarially determined such that the crediting of service does not result in any cost to the fund plus payment of costs for all professional services rendered to the board in connection with the purchase of years of credited service. 
(2)  The request shall be made only once and made by the member on or before the later of 24 months from the effective date of the ordinance adopting this section or 18 months from the date of his employment or reemployment with the city. 
(3)  Payment by the member of the required amount shall be made within six months of his or her request for credit, but, in any event, prior to retirement, and shall be made in one lump sum payment upon receipt of which credited service shall be given. 
(4)  The maximum credit for service other than with the City of St. Pete Beach under this section when combined with credited service purchased pursuant to section 66-115, shall be five years and shall count for all purposes except vesting and eligibility for disability benefits. There shall be no maximum purchase of credited service pursuant to this section for service with the City of St. Pete Beach and credited service purchased shall count for all purposes including vesting but excluding eligibility for disability benefits. 
(5)  In no event, however, may credited service be purchased pursuant to this section for prior service with any other governmental agency, if such prior service forms or will form the basis of a retirement benefit or pension from a different employer's retirement system or plan as set forth in section 66-108, subsection (2). 
(Ord. No. 03-24, § 1, 11-18-03; Ord. No. 10-26, § 1, 9-28-10; Ord. No. 19-10, § 10, 7-23-19)

(1)  The member contributes to the fund the sum that he would have contributed, based on his salary and the member contribution rate in effect at the time that the credited service is requested, had he been a member of the system for the years or fractional parts of years for which he is requesting credit plus amounts actuarially determined such that the crediting of service does not result in any cost to the fund plus payment of costs for all professional services rendered to the board in connection with the purchase of years of credited service. 
(2)  The request shall be made only once and made by the member on of before 24 months from the effective date of the ordinance adopting this section or 18 months from the date of his employment with the city, whichever is later. 
(3)  Payment by the member of the required amount shall be made within six months of his request for credit, but not later than the retirement date, and shall be made in one lump sum payment upon receipt of which credited service shall be given.

(Ord. No. 03-24, § 1, 11-18-03; Ord. No. 10-26, § 1, 9-28-10)  
Sec. 66-116. - Benefits effective October 1, 2012. 
(a)  Effective October 1, 2012, all members employed on that date who have not attained age 55 or 25 years of credited service, and all members hired on or after that date, shall accrue benefits as provided in this section 66-116. The provision of this section shall not apply to members who have retired, separated from service with the city with the right to a deferred vested benefit, entered DROP or attained normal retirement eligibility prior to October 1, 2012.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 
 
Sec. 66-141. - Definitions. 
The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Accumulated contributions means a member's own contributions without interest. For those members who purchase credited service with interest or at no cost to the system, any payment representing interest and any required actuarially calculated payments for the purchase of such credited service, shall be included in accumulated contributions. 
Actuarial equivalent means a benefit or amount of equal value, based upon the RP 2000 Combined Healthy Unisex Mortality Table and an interest rate equal to the investment return assumption set forth in the last actuarial valuation report approved by the board. This definition may only be amended by the city pursuant to the recommendation of the board using the assumptions adopted by the board with the advice of the plan's actuary, such that actuarial assumptions are not subject to city discretion. 
Average final compensation means one-twelfth of the average salary of the five best years of the last ten years of credited service prior to retirement, termination, or death, or the career average as a full-time police officer, whichever is greater. A year shall be 12 consecutive months. 
Beneficiary means the person entitled to receive benefits under this article at the death of a member who has been designated in writing by the member and filed with the board. If no such designation is in effect or if no person so designated is living at the time of death of the member, the beneficiary shall be the estate of the member. 
Board means the board of trustees, which shall administer and manage the system provided in this article and serve as trustees of the fund. 
Code means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time. 
Credited service means the total number of years and fractional parts of years of service as a police officer with member contributions, when required, omitting intervening years or fractional parts of years when such member was not employed by the city as a police officer. A member may voluntarily leave his accumulated contributions in the fund for a period of five years after leaving the employ of the police department pending the possibility of being reemployed as a police officer, without losing credit for the time that he was a member of the system. If a vested member leaves the employ of the police department, his accumulated contributions will be returned only upon his written request.

If a member who is not vested is not reemployed within five years, his accumulated contributions, if more than $1,000.00, will be returned only upon the written request of the member and upon completion of a written election to receive a cash lump sum or to rollover the lump sum amount on forms designated by the board. Upon return of a member's accumulated contributions, all of his rights and benefits under the system are forfeited and terminated. Upon any reemployment a police officer shall not receive credit for the years and fraction parts of years of service for which he has withdrawn his accumulated contributions from the fund, unless the police officer repays into the fund the contributions he has withdrawn, with interest, as determined by the board, within 90 days after his reemployment.

(1)  The member is entitled to reemployment under the provisions of USERRA. 
(2)  The member returns to his employment as a police officer within one year from the earlier of the date of his military discharge or release from active service, unless otherwise required by USERRA. 
(3)  The maximum credit for military service pursuant to this paragraph shall be five years. 
(4)  This paragraph is intended to satisfy the minimum requirements of USERRA. To the extent that this paragraph does not meet the minimum standards of USERRA, as it may be amended from time to time, the minimum standards shall apply. 
In the event a member dies on or after January 1, 2007, while performing USERRA qualified military service, the beneficiaries of the member are entitled to any benefits (other than benefit accruals relating to the period of qualified military service) as if the member had resumed employment and then died while employed. 
Beginning January 1, 2009, to the extent required by section 414(u)(12) of the code, an individual receiving differential wage payments (as defined under section 3401(h)(2) of the code) from an employer shall be treated as employed by that employer, and the differential wage payment shall be treated as compensation for purposes of applying the limits on annual additions under section 415(c) of the code. This provision shall be applied to all similarly situated individuals in a reasonably equivalent manner. 
Leave conversions of unused accrued paid time off shall not be permitted to be applied toward the accrual of credited service either during each plan year of a member's employment with the city or in the plan year in which the member terminates employment. 
Eligible employee means an individual who was a member before the first plan year beginning after December 31, 1995.

Police officer means an actively employed full time person, employed by the city, including his initial probationary employment period, who is certified as a police officer as a condition of employment in accordance with F.S. § 943.1395, who is vested with authority to bear arms and make arrests, and whose primary responsibility is the prevention and detection of crime or the enforcement of the penal, traffic, or highway laws of the state. 
Retiree means a member who has entered retirement status. 
Retirement means a member's separation from city employment with eligibility for immediate receipt of benefits under the system.

Compensation in excess of the limitations set forth in section 401(a)(17) of the code as of the first day of the plan year shall be disregarded for any purpose, including employee contributions or any benefit calculations. The annual compensation of each member taken into account in determining benefits or employee contributions for any plan year beginning on or after January 1, 2002, may not exceed $200,000.00, as adjusted for cost-of-living increases in accordance with code section 401(a)(17)(B). Compensation means compensation during the fiscal year. The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to annual compensation for the determination period that begins with or within such calendar year. If the determination period consists of fewer than 12 months, the annual compensation limit is an amount equal to the otherwise applicable annual compensation limit multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the short determination period, and the denominator of which is 12. If the compensation for any prior determination period is taken into account in determining a member's contributions or benefits for the current plan year, the compensation for such prior determination period is subject to the applicable annual compensation limit in effect for that prior period. The limitation on compensation for an "eligible employee" shall not be less than the amount which was allowed to be taken into account under this article as in effect July 1, 1993.

(10)  Any overpayments or underpayments from the fund to a member, retiree or beneficiary caused by errors of computation shall be adjusted with interest at a rate per annum approved by the board in such a manner that the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which the member, retiree or beneficiary was correctly entitled, shall be paid.

Each member shall become 100 percent vested in his accrued benefit at normal retirement age. A member's normal retirement date shall be the first day of the month coincident with or next following the date the member retires from the city after attaining normal retirement age. 
(2)  The normal retirement date for members who are employed on January 31, 2013, but have not attained age 55 or 25 years of credited service on that date, and members hired on or after February 1, 2013, shall be as provided in section 66-229; provided, members who are employed on January 31, 2013 but have not attained age 55 or 25 years of credited service on that date shall be eligible to receive their frozen accrued benefit based on credited service prior to January 31, 2013, upon attaining age 55 or 25 years of credited service, or a reduced early retirement benefit based on their frozen accrued benefit upon attaining age 50 with ten years of credited service or 20 years of credited service.

A member retiring under this article on or after his normal retirement date shall receive a monthly benefit which shall commence on the first day of the month next following his retirement and shall be continued thereafter during member's lifetime, ceasing upon death, but with 120 monthly payments guaranteed in any event. The monthly retirement benefit shall be as follows: 
(1)  If a member was hired by the city as a police officer prior to October 1, 1981, the monthly retirement benefit shall be equal to three and two-tenths percent of average final compensation for each year of credited service prior to October 1, 1981, plus four percent of average final compensation for each year of credited service subsequent to October 1, 1981, provided that the maximum monthly retirement benefit shall not exceed 90 percent of average final compensation or the minimum monthly benefit required by F.S. ch. 185, whichever is greater.

The normal retirement benefit for credited service on and after February 1, 2013 shall be as provided in section 66-229. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, the normal retirement benefit of a member who is employed on January 31, 2013 and has attained age 55 or 25 years of credited service on that date shall equal three and two-tenths percent of average final compensation for each year of credited service. 
(c)  Early retirement date. A member may retire on his early retirement date, which shall be the first day of any month coincident with or next following the earlier of the attainment of age 50 and the completion of ten years of credited service or the completion of 20 years of credited service regardless of age. Early retirement under the system is retirement on or after the early retirement date and prior to the normal retirement date.

(d)  Early retirement benefit. A member retiring under this article on his early retirement date may receive a deferred or an immediate monthly retirement benefit payable for life as follows: 
(1)  A deferred monthly retirement benefit which shall commence on what would have been his normal retirement date had be remained a police officer and shall be continued on the first day of each month thereafter. The amount of each such deferred monthly retirement benefit shall be determined in the same manner as for retirement as his normal retirement date, except that credited service and average final compensation shall be determined as of his early retirement date; or 
(2)  An immediate monthly retirement benefit which shall commence on his early retirement date and shall be continued on the first day of each month thereafter. The benefit payable shall be as determined in subsection (d)(1) of this section, reduced by one-fifteenth for each of the first five years and one-thirtieth for each of the next five years by which the commencement of benefits precedes the member's normal retirement date three percent for each year by which the commencement of benefits precedes the date which would have been the member's normal retirement date had he continued employment as a police officer. 
(e)  Cost-of-living adjustment. Beginning October 1 following the date which is ten years from February 1, 1994 or ten years from the date which was a member's actual normal retirement, or which would have been a member's normal retirement date, whichever is later, and on each October 1 thereafter, all retirees receiving a normal, early or disability benefit, who retired prior to March 14, 2006, and beneficiaries receiving benefits by virtue of a deceased retired member, but not including terminated vested members and the beneficiaries of terminated vested members, shall have their benefits increased by three percent. This cost-of-living adjustment shall apply to all described retirees and beneficiaries, regardless of whether they retired before or after February 1, 1994, but prior to March 14, 2006.

The maximum additional state monies that can be used in each year for this benefit, enhancement is $23,162.00. There shall be no cost of living adjustment applied to benefits based on credited service on or after February 1, 2013; provided, members who are employed on January 31, 2013 and have attained age 55 or 25 years of credited service on that date shall continue to be eligible for the cost-of-living adjustment provided in this subsection applied to benefits based on all periods of credited service. 
(g)  Required distribution date. The member's benefit under this section must begin to be distributed to the member no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age 70½ or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city.

The beneficiary of any member who dies while actively employed and who, at the date of his death, was vested or eligible for early or normal retirement shall be entitled to a benefit as follows: 
(1)  If the member was vested, but not eligible for normal or early retirement, the spouse beneficiary shall receive a benefit payable for ten years, beginning on the date that the deceased member would have been eligible for early or normal retirement, at the option of the spouse beneficiary. The benefit shall be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation as of the date of his death and reduced as for early retirement, if applicable. The spouse beneficiary may also elect to receive an immediate benefit, payable for ten years, which is actuarially reduced to reflect the commencement of benefits prior to the early retirement date. 
(2)  If the deceased member was eligible for normal or early retirement, the spouse beneficiary shall receive a benefit payable for ten years, beginning on the first day of the month following the member's death or at the deceased member's otherwise normal or early retirement date, at the option of the spouse beneficiary.

(6)  If the surviving spouse beneficiary commences receiving a benefit under subsections (b)(1) or (b)(2) above, but dies before all payments are made, the actuarial value of the remaining benefit will be paid to the spouse beneficiary's estate in a lump sum. 
(c)  Deceased members vested or eligible for retirement with non-spouse beneficiary. This subsection applies only when the member's spouse is not the beneficiary or is not the sole designated beneficiary, but there is a surviving beneficiary. The beneficiary of any member who dies and who, at the date of his death was vested or eligible for early or normal retirement, shall be entitled to a benefit as follows: 
(1)  If the member was vested, but not eligible for normal or early retirement, the beneficiary will receive a benefit payable for ten years. The benefit will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died. The benefit will be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation and actuarially reduced to reflect the commencement of benefits prior to the normal retirement date. 
(2)  If the deceased member was eligible for normal or early retirement, the beneficiary will receive a benefit payable for ten years, beginning on the first day of the month following the member's death.

(Ord. No. 00-17, § 1, 4-18-00; Ord. No. 10-27, § 1, 9-28-10)  
Sec. 66-218. - Disability. 
(a)  Disability benefits in line of duty. Under this article, any member who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a police officer, which disability was directly caused by performance of his duty as a police officer, shall, upon establishing the disability to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a monthly pension determined as for normal retirement, taking into account his average final compensation and years of credited service at the date of disability, but in any event the minimum amount paid to the member shall be 50 percent of the average final compensation of the member. Terminated persons, either vested or nonvested, are not eligible for disability benefits. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if a member is terminated by the city for medical reasons, the terminated person may apply for a disability benefit if the application is filed with the board within 30 days from the date of termination. If a timely application is received, it shall be processed and the terminated person shall be eligible to receive a disability benefit if the board otherwise determines that he is totally and permanently disabled as provided for above. 
(b)  In line of duty presumptions. 
(1)  Presumption. Any condition or impairment of health of a member caused by hypertension or heart disease shall be presumed to have been suffered in line of duty unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence, provided that such member shall have successfully passed a physical examination upon entering into such service, including cardiogram, which examination failed to reveal any evidence of such condition, and provided, further, that such presumption shall not apply to benefits payable or granted in a policy of life insurance or disability insurance. 
(2)  Additional presumption. The presumption provided for in this subsection shall apply only to those conditions described in this subsection that are diagnosed on or after January 1, 1996. 
a.  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this subsection (b)(2), shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
1.  Body fluids means blood and body fluids containing visible blood and other body fluids to which universal precautions for prevention of occupational transmission of blood borne pathogens, as established by the Centers for Disease Control, apply. For purposes of potential transmission of meningococcal meningitis or tuberculosis, the term "body fluids" includes respiratory, salivary, and sinus fluids, including droplets, sputum, and saliva, mucous, and other fluids through which infectious airborne organisms can be transmitted between persons. 
2.  Emergency rescue or public safety member means any member employed full time by the city as a firefighter, paramedic, emergency medical technician, law enforcement officer, or correctional officer who, in the course of employment, runs a high risk of occupational exposure to hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis and who is not employed elsewhere in a similar capacity. However, the term "emergency rescue or public safety member" does not include any person employed by a public hospital licensed under F.S. ch. 395 or any person employed by a subsidiary thereof. 
3.  Hepatitis means hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis non-A, hepatitis non-B, hepatitis C, or any other strain of hepatitis generally recognized by the medical community. 
4.  High risk of occupational exposure means that risk that is incurred because a person subject to this subsection, in performing the basic duties associated with his employment: 
i.  Provides emergency medical treatment in a nonhealthcare setting where there is a potential for transfer of body fluids between persons; 
ii.  At the site of an accident, fire, or other rescue or public safety operation or in an emergency rescue or public safety vehicle, handles body fluids in or out of containers or works with or otherwise handles needles or other sharp instruments exposed to body fluids; 
iii.  Engages in the pursuit, apprehension, and arrest of law violators or suspected law violators and, in performing such duties, may be exposed to body fluids; or 
iv.  Is responsible for the custody and physical restraint when necessary of prisoners or inmates within a prison, jail, or other criminal detention facility, while on work detail outside the facility or while being transported and, in performing such duties, may be exposed to body fluids. 
5.  Occupational exposure means occupational exposure; in the case of hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis, means an exposure that occurs during the performance of job duties that may place a worker at risk of infection. 
b.  Presumption. Any emergency rescue or public safety member who suffers a condition or impairment of health that is caused by hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis, that requires medical treatment, and that results in total or partial disability or death shall be presumed to have a disability suffered in the line of duty, unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence; however, in order to be entitled to the presumption, the member must, by written affidavit as provided in F.S. § 92.50, verify by written declaration that, to the best of his knowledge and belief: 
1.  In the case of a medical condition caused by or derived from hepatitis, he has not: 
i.  Been exposed, through transfer of bodily fluids, to any person known to have sickness or medical conditions derived from hepatitis, outside the scope of his employment; 
ii.  Had a transfusion of blood or blood components, other than a transfusion arising out of an accident or injury happening in connection with his present employment, or received any blood products for the treatment of a coagulation disorder since last undergoing medical tests for hepatitis, which tests failed to indicate the presence of hepatitis; 
iii.  Engaged in unsafe sexual practices or other high risk behavior, as identified by the Centers for Disease Control or the Surgeon General of the United States or had sexual relations with a person known to him to have engaged in such unsafe sexual practices or other high risk behavior; or 
iv.  Used intravenous drugs not prescribed by a physician. 
2.  In the case of meningococcal meningitis, in the ten days immediately preceding diagnosis he was not exposed, outside the scope of his employment, to any person known to have meningococcal meningitis or known to be an symptomatic carrier of the disease. 
3.  In the case of tuberculosis, in the period of time since the member's last negative tuberculosis skin test, he has not been exposed, outside the scope of his employment, to any person known by him to have tuberculosis. 
c.  Immunization. Whenever any standard, medically recognized vaccine or other form of immunization or prophylaxis exists for the prevention of a communicable disease for which a presumption is granted under this subsection, if medically indicated in the given circumstances pursuant to immunization policies established by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the U.S. Public Health Service, an emergency rescue or public safety member may be required by the city to undergo the immunization or prophylaxis unless the member's physician determines in writing that the immunization or other prophylaxis would pose a significant risk to the member's health. Absent such written declaration, failure or refusal by an emergency rescue or public safety member to undergo such immunization or prophylaxis disqualifies the member from the benefits of the presumption. 
d.  Record of exposures. The city shall maintain a record of any known or reasonably suspected exposure of an emergency rescue or public safety member in its employ to the disease described in this subsection and shall immediately notify the member of such exposure. An emergency rescue or public safety member shall file an incident or accident report with the city of each instance of known or suspected occupational exposure to hepatitis infection, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis. 
e.  Required medical tests; preemployment physical. In order to be entitled to the presumption provided by this subsection: 
1.  An emergency rescue or public safety member must, prior to diagnosis, have undergone standard medically acceptable tests for evidence of the communicable disease for which the presumption is sought, or evidence of medical conditions derived therefrom, which tests fail to indicate the presence of infection. This subsection does not apply in the case of meningococcal meningitis. 
2.  On or after June 15, 1995, an emergency rescue or public safety member may be required to undergo a preemployment physical examination that tests for and fails to reveal any evidence of hepatitis or tuberculosis. 
(c)  Disability benefits not in line of duty. Any member with ten years or more credited service who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, by reason of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a police officer, which disability is not directly caused by the performance of his duties as a police officer, shall, upon establishing the disability to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a monthly pension determined as for normal retirement taking into account his average final compensation and years of credited service at the date of disability. Terminated persons, either vested or nonvested, are not eligible for disability benefits. Notwithstanding the previous sentence, if a member is terminated by the city for medical reasons, the terminated person may apply for a disability benefit if the application is filed with the board within 30 days from the date of termination. If a timely application is received, it shall be processed and the terminated person shall be eligible to receive a disability benefit if the board otherwise determines that he is totally and permanently disabled as provided for above. 
(d)  Conditions disqualifying disability benefits. Each member who is claiming disability benefits shall establish, to the satisfaction of the board, that such disability was not occasioned primarily by: 
(1)  Excessive or habitual use of any drugs, intoxicants, or narcotics. 
(2)  Injury or disease sustained while willfully and illegally participating in fights, riots or civil insurrections or while committing a crime. 
(3)  Injury or disease sustained while serving in any branch of the armed forces. 
(4)  Injury or disease sustained after his employment as a police officer with the city shall have terminated. 
(e)  Physical examination requirement. 
(1)  A member shall not become eligible for disability benefits until and unless he undergoes a physical examination by a qualified physician or surgeon, who shall be selected by the board for that purpose. The board shall not select the member's treating physician or surgeon for this purpose except in an unusual case where the board determines that it would be reasonable and prudent to do so. 
(2)  Any retiree receiving disability benefits under provisions of this article may be periodically reexamined by a qualified physician who shall be selected by the board, to determine if such disability has ceased to exist. If the board finds that the retiree is no longer permanently and totally disabled to the extent that he is unable to render useful and efficient service as a police officer, the board shall recommend to the city that the retiree be returned to performance of duty as a police officer, and the retiree so returned shall enjoy the same rights that the member had at the time he was placed upon pension. If the retiree so ordered to return shall refuse to comply with the order within 30 days from the issuance thereof, member shall forfeit the right to his pension. 
(3)  The cost of the physical examination or reexamination of the member claiming or the retiree receiving disability benefits shall be borne by the fund. All other reasonable costs as determined by the board incident to the physical examination, such as but not limited to, transportation, meals and hotel accommodations, shall be borne by the fund. 
(4)  If the retiree recovers from disability and reenters the service of the city as a police officer, his service will be deemed to have been continuous. But the period beginning with the first month for which he received a disability retirement income payment and ending with the date he reentered the service of the city will not be considered as credited service for the purposes of the plan. 
(5)  The board shall have the power and authority to make the final decisions regarding all disability claims. 
(f)  Disability payments. The monthly benefit to which a member is entitled for the member's disability retirement shall be payable on the first day of the first month after the board determines such entitlement. However, the monthly retirement income shall be payable as of the date the board determined such entitlement, and any portion due for a partial month shall be paid together with the first payment. The last payment will be: 
(1)  If the retiree recovers from the disability, the payment due next preceding the date of such recovery; or 
(2)  If the retiree dies without recovering from disability, the payment due next preceding his death or the 120th monthly payment, whichever is later. 
Provided, however, the disability retiree may select, at any time prior to the date on which benefit payments begin, an optional form of benefit payment as described in subsections 66-219(a)(1) or (a)(2), which shall be the actuarial equivalent of the normal form of benefit. 
(g)  Workers' compensation. When a member is receiving a disability pension and workers' compensation benefits pursuant to F.S. ch. 440, for the same disability, and the total monthly benefits received from both exceed 100 percent of the member's average monthly wage, as defined in F.S. ch. 440, excluding overtime, the disability pension benefit shall be reduced so that the total monthly amount received by the member does not exceed 100 percent of such average monthly wage. The amount of any lump sum workers' compensation payment shall be converted to an equivalent monthly benefit payable for ten years certain by dividing the lump sum amount by 83.9692. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the disability pension benefit be reduced below the greater of 42 percent of average final compensation and two percent of average final compensation times years of credited service. 
(Ord. No. 00-17, § 1, 4-18-00; Ord. No. 10-27, § 1, 9-28-10; Ord. No. 2017-26, § 4, 12-12-17)  
Sec. 66-219. - Optional forms of benefits. 
(a)  In lieu of the amount and form of retirement income payable for normal or early retirement as specified in this article, a member, upon request to the board, may elect to receive a retirement income or benefit of equivalent actuarial value payable in accordance with one of the following options: 
(1)  A retirement income of a larger monthly amount, payable to the retiree for his lifetime only. 
(2)  A retirement income of a modified monthly amount, payable to the retiree during the lifetime of the retiree, and following the death of the retiree, 100 percent, 75 percent, 66 2/3 percent, or 50 percent of such monthly amounts payable to a joint pensioner for his lifetime. Except where the retiree's joint pensioner is his spouse, the payments to the joint pensioner as a percentage of the payments to the retiree, shall not exceed the applicable percentage provided for in the applicable table in the Treasury Regulations (see Q & A-2 of 1.401(a)(9)-6). 
(3)  Such other amount and form of retirement payments or benefits as, in the opinion of the board, will best meet the circumstances of the retiree. 
(b)  The member, upon electing any option of this section, will designate the joint pensioner or beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, payable under the system in the event of the member's death, and will have the power to change such designation from time to time. Such designation will name a joint pensioner or one or more primary beneficiaries where applicable. A member may change his beneficiary at any time. If a member has elected an option with a joint pensioner and the member's retirement income benefits have commenced, the member may thereafter change his designated beneficiary at any time, but may only change his joint pensioner twice. Subject to the restriction in the previous sentence, a member may substitute a new joint pensioner for a deceased joint pensioner. In the absence of proof of good health of the joint pensioner being replaced, the actuary will assume that the joint pensioner has deceased for purposes of calculating the new payment. 
(c)  The consent of a member's or retiree's joint pensioner or beneficiary to any such change shall not be required. The rights of all previously designated beneficiaries to receive benefits under the system shall thereupon cease. 
(d)  Upon change of a retiree's joint pensioner in accordance with this section, the amount of the retirement income payable to the retiree shall be actuarially redetermined to take into account the age of the former joint pensioner, the new joint pensioner, and the retiree and to ensure that the benefit paid is the actuarial equivalent of the present value of the retiree's then current benefit at the time of the change. Any such retiree shall pay the actuarial recalculation expenses. Each request for a change will be made in writing on a form prepared by the board, and on completion will be filed with the board. In the event that no designated beneficiary survives the retiree, such benefits as are payable in the death of the retiree subsequent to his retirement shall be paid in section 66-220. 
(e)  Retirement income payments shall be made under the option elected in accordance with the provisions of this section and shall be subject to the following: 
(1)  If a member dies prior to his normal retirement date or early retirement date, whichever first occurs, no retirement benefit will be payable under the option to any person, but the benefits, if any, will be determined under this article. 
(2)  If the designated beneficiary (or beneficiaries) or joint pensioner dies before the member's retirement under the system, the option elected will be canceled automatically, and a retirement income of the normal form and amount will be payable to the member upon his retirement as if the election had not been made, unless a new election is made in accordance with this section or a new beneficiary is designated by the member prior to his retirement. 
(3)  If both the retiree and the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) designated by the member or retiree die before the full payment has been effected under any option providing for payments for a period certain and life thereafter, made pursuant to subsection (e)(1) of this section, the board of trustees may, in its discretion, direct that the commuted value of the remaining payments be paid in a lump sum and in accordance with section 66-220. 
(4)  If a member continues beyond his normal retirement date pursuant to subsection 66-216(a) and dies prior to his actual retirement and while an option made pursuant to this section is in effect, monthly retirement income payments will be made or a retirement benefit will be paid, under the option to a beneficiary designated by the member in the amount computed as if the member had retired under the option on the date on which his death occurred. 
(5)  The member's benefit under this section must begin to be distributed to the member no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age 70½ or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
(f)  A retiree may not change his retirement option after the date of cashing or depositing his first retirement check. 
(g)  Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, the board in its discretion may elect to make a lump sum payment to a member or a member's beneficiary in the event that the total commuted value of the monthly income payments to be paid do not exceed $1,000.00. Any such payment made to any person pursuant to the power and discretion conferred upon the board by the preceding sentence shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to such member and shall not be subject to review by anyone, but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons. 
(Ord. No. 00-17, § 1, 4-18-00; Ord. No. 06-27, § 2, 9-13-06; Ord. No. 10-27, § 1, 9-28-10)  
Sec. 66-220. - Beneficiaries. 
(a)  Under this article, each member or retiree may, on a form provided for that purpose, signed and filed with the board, designate a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, which may be payable for his death. Each designation may be revoked or changed by such member or retiree by signing and filing with the board a new designation of beneficiary form. Upon such change, the rights of all previously designated beneficiaries to receive any benefits under the system shall cease. 
(b)  If a deceased member or retiree failed to name a beneficiary in the manner prescribed in subsection (a) of this section or if the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) named by a deceased member or retiree predeceases the member or retiree, the death benefit, if any, which may be payable under the system with respect to such deceased member or retiree may be paid, in the discretion of the board to the estate of the member or retiree and the board, in its discretion, may direct that the commuted value of the remaining monthly income benefits be paid in a lump sum. 
(c)  Any payment made to any person pursuant to this section shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to the deceased member and any other persons with rights under the system and shall not be subject to review by anyone but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons ever interested hereunder. 
(Ord. No. 00-17, § 1, 4-18-00; Ord. No. 10-27, § 1, 9-28-10)  
Sec. 66-221. - Maximum pension. 
(a)  Basic limitation. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this system to the contrary, the member contributions paid to, and retirement benefits paid from, the system shall be limited to such extent as may be necessary to conform to the requirements of code section 415 for a qualified retirement plan. Before January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the limits specified in code section 415(b), subject to the applicable adjustments in that section. On and after January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the dollar amount specified in code section 415(b)(1)(A) ($160,000.00), subject to the applicable adjustments in code section 415(b) and subject to any additional limits that may be specified in this system. For purposes of this section, "limitation year" shall be the calendar year. 
(b)  Adjustments to basic limitation for form of benefit. If the form of benefit without regard to any benefit increase feature is not a straight life annuity, then the code section 415(b) limit applicable at the annuity starting date is reduced to an actuarially equivalent amount (determined using the assumptions specified in Treasury Regulation Section 1.415(b)-1(c)(2)(ii)) that takes into account the death benefits under the form of benefit. 
(c)  Benefits not taken into account. For purposes of this section, the following benefits shall not be taken into account in applying these limits: 
(1)  Any ancillary benefit which is not directly related to retirement income benefits; 
(2)  Any other benefit not required under section 415(b)(2) of the code and regulations thereunder to be taken into account for purposes of the limitation of code section 415(b)(1). 
(d)  COLA effect. Effective on and after January 1, 2003, for purposes of applying the limits under code section 415(b) (the "limit"), the following will apply: 
(1)  A member's applicable limit will be applied to the member's annual benefit in the member's first calendar year of benefit payments without regard to any automatic cost-of-living adjustments; 
(2)  Thereafter, in any subsequent calendar year, a member's annual benefit, including any automatic cost-of-living increases, shall be tested under the then applicable benefit limit including any adjustment to the code section 415(b)(1)(A) dollar limit under code section 415(d), and the regulations thereunder; but 
(3)  In no event shall a member's benefit payable under the system in any calendar year be greater than the limit applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to code section 415(d) and the regulations thereunder. 
Unless otherwise specified in the system, for purposes of applying the limits under code section 415(b), a member's applicable limit will be applied taking into consideration cost-of-living increases as required by section 415(b) of the code and applicable Treasury Regulations. 
(e)  Other adjustments in limitations. 
(1)  In the event the member's retirement benefits become payable before age 62, the limit prescribed by this section shall be reduced in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to the provisions of code section 415(b) of the code, so that such limit (as so reduced) equals an annual straight life benefit (when such retirement income benefit begins) which is equivalent to a $160,000.00 annual benefit beginning at age 62. 
(2)  In the event the member's benefit is based on at least 15 years of credited service as a full-time employee of the fire or police department of the city, the adjustments provided for in subsection (e)(1) above shall not apply. 
(3)  The reductions provided for in subsection (e)(1) above shall not be applicable to disability benefits pursuant to section 66-218, or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to section 66-217. 
(4)  In the event the member's retirement benefit becomes payable after age 65, for purposes of determining whether this benefit meets the limit set forth in subsection (a) herein, such benefit shall be adjusted so that it is actuarially equivalent to the benefit beginning at age 65. This adjustment shall be made in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate. 
(f)  Less than ten years of participation. The maximum retirement benefits payable under this section to any member who has completed less than ten years of participation shall be the amount determined under subsection (a) of this section multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's years of participation and the denominator of which is ten. The reduction provided by this subsection cannot reduce the maximum benefit below ten percent of the limit determined without regard to this subsection. The reduction provided for in this subsection shall not be applicable to pre-retirement disability benefits paid pursuant to section 66-218 or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to section 66-217. 
(g)  Participation in other defined benefit plans. The limit of this section with respect to any member who at any time has been a member in any other defined benefit plan as defined in code section 414(j) maintained by the city shall apply as if the total benefits payable under all city defined benefit plans in which the member has been a member were payable from one plan. 
(h)  Ten thousand dollar limit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the retirement benefit payable with respect to a member shall be deemed not to exceed the limit set forth in this section if the benefits payable, with respect to such member under this system and under all other qualified defined benefit pension plans to which the city contributes, do not exceed $10,000.00 for the applicable plan year and for any prior plan year and the city has not any time maintained a qualified defined contribution plan in which the member participated. 
(i)  Reduction of benefits. Reduction of benefits and/or contributions to all plans, where required, shall be accomplished by first reducing the member's benefit under any defined benefit plans in which member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be determined by the board and the plan administrator of such other plans, and next, by reducing or allocating excess forfeitures for defined contribution plans in which the member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be established by the board and the plan administrator for such other plans provided, however, that necessary reductions may be made in a different manner and priority pursuant to the agreement of the board and the plan administrator of all other plans covering such member. 
(j)  Service credit purchase limits. 
(1)  Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, if a member makes one or more contributions to purchase permissive service credit under the system, as allowed in sections 66-227 and 66-228, then the requirements of this section will be treated as met only if: 
a.  The requirements of code section 415(b) are met, determined by treating the accrued benefit derived from all such contributions as an annual benefit for purposes of code section 415(b), or 
b.  The requirements of code section 415(c) are met, determined by treating all such contributions as annual additions for purposes of code section 415(c). 
c.  For purposes of applying subsection (j)(1)a., the system will not fail to meet the reduced limit under code section 415(b)(2)(C) solely by reason of this subsection (j)(1)c., and for purposes of applying subsection (j)(1)b. the system will not fail to meet the percentage limitation under section 415(c)(1)(B) of the code solely by reason of this subsection (j)(1)c. 
(2)  For purposes of this subsection the term "permissive service credit" means service credit: 
a.  Recognized by the system for purposes of calculating a member's benefit under the plan; 
b.  Which such member has not received under the plan; and 
c.  Which such member may receive only by making a voluntary additional contribution, in an amount determined under the system, which does not exceed the amount necessary to fund the benefit attributable to such service credit. 
Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, such term may, if otherwise provided by the system, include service credit for periods for which there is no performance of service, and, notwithstanding clause (j)(2)b., may include service credited in order to provide an increased benefit for service credit which a member is receiving under the system. 
(3)  For purposes of applying the limits in this subsection (j), only and for no other purpose, the definition of compensation where applicable will be compensation actually paid or made available during a calendar year, except as noted below and as permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulations. Unless another definition of compensation that is permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulation, is specified by the system, compensation will be defined as wages within the meaning of code section 3401(a) and all other payments of compensation to an employee by an employer for which the employer is required to furnish the employee a written statement under code sections 6041(d), 6051(a)(3) and 6052 and will be determined without regard to any rules under code section 3401(a) that limit the remuneration included in wages based on the nature or location of the employment or the services performed (such as the exception for agricultural labor in code section 3401(a)(2)). 
a.  However, for calendar years beginning after December 31, 1997, compensation will also include amounts that would otherwise be included in compensation but for an election under code sections 125(a), 402(e)(3), 402(h)(1)(B), 402(k), or 457(b). For calendar years beginning after December 31, 2000, compensation will also include any elective amounts that are not includible in the gross income of the employee by reason of code section 132(f)(4). 
b.  For limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2007, compensation for the calendar year will also include compensation paid by the later of 2-1/2 months after an employee's severance from employment or the end of the calendar year that includes the date of the employee's severance from employment if: 
1.  The payment is regular compensation for services during the employee's regular working hours, or compensation for services outside the employee's regular working hours (such as overtime or shift differential), commissions, bonuses or other similar payments, and, absent a severance from employment, the payments would have been paid to the employee while the employee continued in employment with the employer; or 
2.  The payment is for unused accrued bona fide sick, vacation or other leave that the employee would have been able to use if employment had continued. 
c.  Back pay, within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2(g)(8), shall be treated as compensation for the limitation year to which the back pay relates to the extent the back pay represents wages and compensation that would otherwise be included under this definition. 
(4)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the board may modify a request by a member to make a contribution to the system if the amount of the contribution would exceed the limits provided in code section 415 by using the following methods: 
a.  If the law requires a lump sum payment for the purchase of service credit, the board may establish a periodic payment deduction plan for the member to avoid a contribution in excess of the limits under code sections 415(c) or 415(n). 
b.  If payment pursuant to subsection (j)(4)a. will not avoid a contribution in excess of the limits imposed by code section 415(c), the board may either reduce the member's contribution to an amount within the limits of that section or refuse the member's contribution. 
(k)  Additional limitation on pension benefits. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary: 
(1)  The normal retirement benefit or pension payable to a retiree who becomes a member of the system and who has not previously participated in such system, on or after January 1, 1980, shall not exceed 100 percent of his average final compensation. However, nothing contained in this section shall apply to supplemental retirement benefits or to pension increases attributable to cost-of-living increases or adjustments. 
(2)  No member of the system shall be allowed to receive a retirement benefit or pension which is in part or in whole based upon any service with respect to which the member is already receiving, or will receive in the future, a retirement benefit or pension from a different employer's retirement system or plan. This restriction does not apply to Social Security benefits or federal benefits under Chapter 1223, Title 10, U.S. Code. 
(l)  Effect of direct rollover on 415(b) limit. If the plan accepts a direct rollover of an employee's or former employee's benefit from a defined contribution plan qualified under code section 401(a) which is maintained by the employer, any annuity resulting from the rollover amount that is determined using a more favorable actuarial basis than required under code section 417(e) shall be included in the annual benefit for purposes of the limit under code section 415(b). 
(Ord. No. 00-17, § 1, 4-18-00; Ord. No. 03-22, § 2, 11-18-03; Ord. No. 10-27, § 1, 9-28-10; Ord. No. 2017-26, § 5, 12-12-17)  
Sec. 66-222. - Minimum distribution of benefits. 
(a)  General rules. 
(1)  Effective date. Effective as of January 1, 1989, the plan will pay all benefits in accordance with a good faith interpretation of the requirements of code section 401(a)(9) and the regulations in effect under that section, as applicable to a governmental plan within the meaning of code section 414(d). Effective on and after January 1, 2003, the plan is also subject to the specific provisions contained in this section. The provisions of this section will apply for purposes of determining required minimum distributions for calendar years beginning with the 2003 calendar year. 
(2)  Precedence. The requirements of this section will take precedence over any inconsistent provisions of the plan. 
(3)  TEFRA Section 242(b)(2) elections. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section other than this subsection (a)(4 3), distributions may be made under a designation made before January 1, 1984, in accordance with Section 242(b)(2) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA) and the provisions of the plan that related to Section 242(b)(2) of TEFRA. 
(b)  Time and manner of distribution. 
(1)  Required beginning date. The member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the member no later than the member's required beginning date which shall not be later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age 70½ or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
(2)  Death of member before distributions begin. If the member dies before distributions begin, the member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed no later than as follows: 
a.  If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died, or by a date on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained age 70½, if later, as the surviving spouse elects. 
b.  If the member's surviving spouse is not the member's sole designated beneficiary, then, distributions to the designated beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died. 
c.  If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the member's death, the member's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death. 
d.  If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the member but before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, this subsection (b)(2), other than subsection (b)(2)a., will apply as if the surviving spouse were the member. 
For purposes of this subsection (b)(2), distributions are considered to begin on the member's required beginning date or, if subsection (b)(2)d. applies, the date of distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (b)(2)a. If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the member before the member's required beginning date (or to the member's surviving spouse before the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (b)(2)a.) the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence. 
(3)  Death after distributions begin. If the member dies after the required distribution of benefits has begun, the remaining portion of the member's interest must be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution before the member's death. 
(3)  Form of distribution. Unless the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the first distribution calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with this section. If the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the code and Treasury Regulations. Any part of the member's interest which is in the form of an individual account described in section 414(k) of the code will be distributed in a manner satisfying the requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the code and Treasury Regulations that apply to individual accounts. 
(c)  Determination of amount to be distributed each year. 
(1)  General requirements. If the member's interest is paid in the form of annuity distributions under the plan, payments under the annuity will satisfy the following requirements: 
a.  The annuity distributions will be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not longer than one year. 
b.  The member's entire interest must be distributed pursuant to section 66-216, section 66-217, section 66-149, or section 66-219 (as applicable) and in any event over a period equal to or less than the member's life or the lives of the member and a designated beneficiary, or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the member or of the member and a designated beneficiary. The life expectancy of the member, the member's spouse, or the member's beneficiary may not be recalculated after the initial determination for purposes of determining benefits. 
(2)  Amount required to be distributed by required beginning date. The amount that must be distributed on or before the member's required beginning date (or, if the member dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under section 66-217) is the payment that is required for one payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., monthly. All of the member's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the member's required beginning date. 
(3)  Additional accruals after first distribution calendar year. Any additional benefits accruing to the member in a calendar year after the first distribution calendar year will be distributed beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues. 
(d)  General distribution rules. 
(1)  The amount of an annuity paid to a member's beneficiary may not exceed the maximum determined under the incidental death benefit requirement of code section 401(a)(9)(G), and effective for any annuity commencing on or after January 1, 2008, the minimum distribution incidental benefit rule under Treasury Regulation Section 1.401(a)(9)-6, Q&A-2. 
(2)  The death and disability benefits provided by the plan are limited by the incidental benefit rule set forth in code section 401(a)(9)(G) and Treasury Regulation Section 1.401-1(b)(1)(I) or any successor regulation thereto. As a result, the total death or disability benefits payable may not exceed 25 percent of the cost for all of the members' benefits received from the retirement system. 
(e)  Definitions. 
(1)  Designated beneficiary. The individual who is designated as the beneficiary under the plan and is the designated beneficiary under section 401(a)(9) of the code and Section 1.401(a)(9)-1, Q&A-4, of the Treasury Regulations. 
(2)  Distribution calendar year. A calendar year for which a minimum distribution is required. For distributions beginning before the member's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year which contains the member's required beginning date. For distributions beginning after the member's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin pursuant to section 66-217. 
(Ord. No. 00-17, § 1, 4-18-00; Ord. No. 06-27, § 3, 9-13-06; Ord. No. 10-27, § 1, 9-28-10)  
Sec. 66-223. - Direct transfers of eligible rollover distributions; elimination of mandatory distribution. 
(a)  Definitions. The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this section, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this subsection, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
(1)  Direct rollover means a payment by the plan to the eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee. 
(2)  Distributee includes an employee or former employee. It also includes, the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse. Effective January 1, 2007, it further includes a non-spouse beneficiary who is a designated beneficiary as defined by code section 401(a)(9)(E). However, a non-spouse beneficiary may rollover the distribution only to an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity established for the purpose of receiving the distribution and the account or annuity will be treated as an "inherited" individual retirement account or annuity. 
(3)  Eligible retirement plan means an individual retirement account described in section 408(a) of the code; an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b) of the code; an annuity plan described in section 403(a) of the code; effective January 1, 2002, an eligible deferred compensation plan described in section 457(b) of the code which is maintained by an eligible employer described in section 457(e)(1)(A) of the code and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan; effective January 1, 2002, an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the code; a qualified trust described in section 401(a) of the code; or effective January 1, 2008, a Roth IRA described in section 408A of the code, that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. This definition shall also apply for an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse. 
(4)  Eligible rollover distribution means any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments (not less frequently than annually) made for the life or life expectancy of the distributee or the joint lives or joint life expectancies of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under section 401(a)(9) of the code; and the portion of any distribution that is not includable in gross income. Effective January 1, 2002, any portion of any distribution which would be includible in gross income as after-tax employee contributions will be an eligible rollover distribution if the distribution is made to an individual retirement account described in section 408(a); to an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b); to a qualified defined contribution plan described in sections 401(a) or 403(a) that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible; or on or after January 1, 2007, to a qualified defined benefit plan described in code section 401(a) or to an annuity contract described in code section 403(b), that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of the distribution that is includible in gross income and the portion of the distribution that is not so includible. 
(b)  Payment. This section applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 2002. Notwithstanding any provision of the system under this article to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
(c)  Rollovers or transfers into the fund. On or after January 1, 2002, the system will accept, solely for the purpose of purchasing credited service as provided herein, permissible member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans, member rollover cash contributions and/or direct cash rollovers of distributions made on or after January 1, 2002, as follows: 
(1)  Transfers and direct rollovers or member rollover contributions from other plans. The system will accept either a direct rollover of an eligible rollover distribution or a member contribution of an eligible rollover distribution from a qualified plan described in sections 401(a) or 403(a) of the code, from an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the code or from an eligible plan under section 457(b) of the code which is maintained by a state, political subdivision of a state, or any agency or instrumentality of a state or political subdivision of a state. The system will also accept legally permissible member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans. 
(2)  Member rollover contributions from IRAs. The system will accept a member rollover contribution of the portion of a distribution from an individual retirement account or annuity described in sections 408(a) or 408(b) of the code that is eligible to be rolled over. 
(d)  Elimination of mandatory distributions. Notwithstanding any other provision herein to the contrary, in the event this plan provides for a mandatory (involuntary) cash distribution from the plan not otherwise required by law, for an amount in excess of $1,000.00, such distribution shall be made from the plan only upon written request of the member and completion by the member of a written election on forms designated by the board, to either receive a cash lump sum or to rollover the lump sum amount.

Sec. 66-224. - Family and Medical Leave Act. 
The fractional parts of the 24-month period ending each March 1 that a member is on leave without pay from the city pursuant to the Family Medical Leave Act (FMLA) shall be added to his credited service under this article, provided: 
(1)  The member contributes to the fund the sum that he would have contributed, based on his salary and the member contribution rate in effect at the time that the credited service is requested, had he been a member of the system for the fractional parts of the 24 months ending each March 1 for which he is requesting credit plus amounts actuarially determined such that the crediting of service does not result in any cost to the fund plus payment of costs for all professional services rendered to the board in connection with the purchase of periods of credited service. 
(2)  The request for credited service for FMLA leave time for the 24-month period prior to each March 1 and payment of professional fees shall be made on or before March 31. 
(3)  Payment by the member of the required amount shall be made on or before April 30 for the preceding 24-month period ending March 1 and shall be made in one lump sum payment upon receipt of which credited service shall be issued. 
(4)  Credited service purchased pursuant to this section shall count toward vesting. 
(Ord. No. 00-17, § 1, 4-18-00; Ord. No. 10-27, § 1, 9-28-10)  
Sec. 66-225. - Deferred retirement option plan. 
(a)  Definitions. As used in this section 66-225, the following definitions apply: 
(1)  "DROP" means the City of St. Pete Beach Police Officers' Deferred Retirement Option Plan. 
(2)  "DROP account" means the account established for each DROP participant under subsection (c). 
(3)  "Total return of the assets," for purposes of calculating earnings on a member's DROP account pursuant to subsection (c)(2)b.2., for each fiscal year quarter, the percentage increase (or decrease) in the interest and dividends earned on investments, including realized and unrealized gains (or losses), of the total plan assets. 
(b)  Participation. 
(1)  Eligibility to participate. In lieu of terminating his employment as a police officer, any member who is eligible for normal retirement under subsection 66-216(a), of the system may, prior to February 1, 2013 elect to defer receipt of such service retirement pension and to participate in the DROP. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the DROP shall be closed to new participants effective February 1, 2013, and no member may enter the DROP on or after that date; provided, a member who is employed on January 31, 2013 and has attained age 55 or 25 years of credited service on that date may enter and participate in the DROP on or after February 1, 2013 in accordance with the provisions of this section. 
(2)  Election to participate. A member's election to participate in the DROP must be made in writing in a time and manner determined by the board and shall be effective on the first day of the first calendar month which is at least 15 business days after it is received by the board. 
(3)  Period of participation. A member who elects to participate in the DROP under subsection (b)(2), shall participate in the DROP for a period not to exceed 60 months beginning at the time his election to participate in the DROP first becomes effective. An election to participate in the DROP shall constitute an irrevocable election to resign from the service of the city not later than the date provided for in the previous sentence. A member may participate only once. 
(4)  Termination of participation. 
a.  A member's participation in the DROP shall cease participating at the earlier of: 
1.  The end of his permissible period of participation in the DROP as determined under subsection (b)(3); or 
2.  Termination of his employment as a police officer. 
b.  Upon the member's termination of participation in the DROP, pursuant to subsection 1. above, all amounts provided for in subsection (c)(2), including monthly benefits and investment earnings or losses or interest, as applicable, shall cease to be transferred from the system to his DROP account. Any amounts remaining in his DROP account shall be paid to him in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) when he terminates his employment as a police officer. 
c.  A member who terminates his participation in the DROP under subsection (b)(4) shall not be permitted to again become a participant in the DROP. 
(5)  Effect of DROP participation on the system. 
a.  A member's credited service and his accrued benefit under the system shall be determined on the date his election to participate in the DROP first becomes effective. The member's salary for the purposes of calculating his average final compensation shall include any lump sum payments paid to the member and included as salary as defined herein, which amounts shall be paid by the city upon the member's entry into the DROP, as provided in the city's personnel rules and regulations. The member shall not accrue any additional credited service or any additional benefits under the system (except for any supplemental benefit payable to DROP participants or any additional benefits provided under any cost-of-living adjustment for retirees in the system) while he is a participant in the DROP. After a member commences participation, he shall not be permitted to again contribute to the system, nor shall he be eligible for disability, nor shall his estate or beneficiary be eligible for pre-retirement death benefits. 
b.  No amounts shall be paid to a member from the system while the member is a participant in the DROP. Unless otherwise specified in the system, if a member's participation in the DROP is terminated other than by terminating his employment as a police officer, no amounts shall be paid to him from the system until he terminates his employment as a police officer. Unless otherwise specified in the system, amounts transferred from the system to the member's DROP account shall be paid directly to the member only on the termination of his employment as a police officer. 
(c)  Funding. 
(1)  Establishment of DROP account. A DROP account shall be established for each member participating in the DROP. A member's DROP account shall consist of amounts transferred to the DROP under subsection (c)(2), and earnings or interest on those amounts. 
(2)  Transfers from retirement system. 
a.  As of the first day of each month of a member's period of participation in the DROP, the monthly retirement benefit he would have received under the system had he terminated his employment as a police officer and elected to receive monthly benefit payments thereunder shall be transferred to his DROP account, except as otherwise provided for in subsection (b)(4)b. A member's period of participation in the DROP shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of subsections (b)(3) and (b)(4), but in no event shall it continue past the date he terminates his employment as a police officer. 
b.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b)(4)b., a member's DROP account under this subsection (c)(2) shall be debited or credited with either: 
1.  Interest at an effective rate of 7-1/2 percent per annum compounded monthly determined on the last business day of the prior month's ending balance and credited to the member's DROP account as of such date (to be applicable to all current and future DROP participants); or 
2.  Earnings, to be credited or debited to the member's DROP account, determined as of the last business day of each fiscal year quarter and debited or credited as of such date, determined as follows: 
 The average daily balance in a member's DROP account shall be credited or debited at a rate equal to the net investment return realized by the system for that quarter. "Net investment return" for the purpose of this paragraph is the total return of the assets in which the member's DROP account is invested by the board net of brokerage commissions, transaction costs and management fees. 
 For purposes of calculating earnings on a member's DROP account pursuant to this subsection (c)(2)b.2., brokerage commissions, transaction costs, and management fees shall be determined for each quarter by the investment consultant pursuant to contracts with fund managers as reported in the custodial statement. The investment consultant shall report these quarterly contractual fees to the board. The investment consultant shall also report the net investment return for each manager and the net investment return for the total plan assets. 
Upon electing participation in the DROP, the member shall elect to receive either interest or earnings on his account to be determined as provided above. The member may, in writing, elect to change his election only once during his DROP participation. An election to change must be made prior to the end of a quarter and shall be effective beginning the following quarter. 
c.  A member's DROP account shall only be credited or debited with earnings or interest and monthly benefits while the member is a participant in the DROP. A member's final DROP account value for distribution to the member upon termination of participation in the DROP shall be the value of the account at the end of the quarter immediately preceding termination of participation for participants electing the net plan return and at the end of the month immediately preceding termination of participation for participants electing the flat interest rate return, plus any monthly periodic additions made to the DROP account subsequent to the end of the previous quarter or month, as applicable, and prior to distribution. If a member is employed by the city police department after participating in the DROP for the permissible period of DROP participation, then beginning with the member's first month of employment following the last month of the permissible period of DROP participation, the member's DROP account will no longer be credited or debited with earnings or interest, nor will monthly benefits be transferred to the DROP account. All such non-transferred amounts shall be forfeited and continue to be forfeited while the member is employed by the police department. A member employed by the police department after the permissible period of DROP participation will still not be eligible for disability benefits, nor shall his estate or beneficiary be eligible for pre-retirement death benefits, nor will he accrue additional credited service. 
(d)  Distribution of DROP accounts on termination of employment. 
(1)  Eligibility for benefits. A member shall receive the balance in his DROP account in accordance with the provisions of this subsection (d) upon his termination of employment as a police officer. Except as provided in subsection (d)(5), no amounts shall be paid to a member from the DROP prior to his termination of employment as a police officer. 
(2)  Form of distribution. 
a.  Unless the member elects otherwise, distribution of his DROP account shall be made in a cash lump sum. A member may elect, in such time and manner as the board shall prescribe, to receive the optional form of benefit described below. 
1.  Until the value of the member's DROP account is completely depleted, payments in approximately equal quarterly or annual installments over a period, designated by the member, not to exceed the life expectancy of the last survivor of the member and his beneficiary. In the event that the member dies before all installments have been paid, the remaining balance in his DROP account shall be paid in an immediate cash lump sum to his beneficiary, or if none is designated, then to the member's estate. 
2.  The purchase of a nonforfeitable fixed annuity payable in such form as the member may elect. Elections under this clause 2. shall be in writing and shall be made in such time or manner as the board shall determine. 
b.  Notwithstanding the preceding, if a member dies before his benefits commence, his DROP account shall be paid to his beneficiary in such optional form as his beneficiary may select. If no beneficiary designation is made, the DROP account shall be distributed to the member's estate. 
(3)  Date of payment of distribution. Except as otherwise provided in this subsection (d), distribution of a member's DROP account shall begin as soon as administratively practicable following the member's termination of employment. Distribution of the amount in a member's DROP account will not be made unless the member completes a written request for distribution and a written election, on forms designated by the board, to either receive a cash lump sum or a rollover of the lump sum amount. 
(4)  Proof of death and right of beneficiary or other person. The board may require and rely upon such proof of death and such evidence of the right of any beneficiary or other person to receive the value of a deceased member's DROP account as the board may deem proper and its determination of the right of that beneficiary or other person to receive payment shall be conclusive. 
(5)  Distribution limitation. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection (d), all distributions from the DROP shall conform to the "minimum distribution of benefits" provisions as provided for herein. 
(6)  Direct rollover of certain distributions. This subsection applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 2002. Notwithstanding any provision of the DROP to the contrary may elect to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid in a direct rollover as otherwise provided under the system in section 66-223. 
(e)  Administration of DROP. 
(1)  Board administers the DROP. The general administration of the DROP, the responsibility for carrying out the provisions of the DROP and the responsibility of overseeing the investment of the DROP's assets shall be placed in the board. The members of the board may appoint from their number such subcommittees with such powers as they shall determine; may adopt such administrative procedures and regulations as they deem desirable for the conduct of their affairs; may authorize one or more of their number or any agent to execute or deliver any instrument or make any payment on their behalf; may retain counsel, employ agents and provide for such clerical, accounting, actuarial and consulting services as they may require in carrying out the provisions of the DROP; and may allocate among themselves or delegate to other persons all or such portion of their duties under the DROP, other than those granted to them as trustee under any trust agreement adopted for use in implementing the DROP, as they, in their sole discretion, shall decide. A trustee shall not vote on any question relating exclusively to himself. 
(2)  Individual accounts, records and reports. The board shall maintain, or cause to be maintained, records showing the operation and condition of the DROP, including records showing the individual balances in each member's DROP account, and the board shall keep, or cause to be kept, in convenient form such data as may be necessary for the valuation of the assets and liabilities of the DROP. The board shall prepare or cause to be prepared and distributed to members participating in the DROP and other individuals or filed with the appropriate governmental agencies, as the case may be, all necessary descriptions, reports, information returns, and data required to be distributed or filed for the DROP pursuant to the code, the applicable portions of the Act and any other applicable laws. 
(3)  Establishment of rules. Subject to the limitations of the DROP, the board from time to time shall establish rules for the administration of the DROP and the transaction of its business. The board shall have discretionary authority to construe and interpret the DROP (including but not limited to, determination of an individual's eligibility for DROP participation, the right and amount of any benefit payable under the DROP and the date on which any individual ceases to be a participant in the DROP). The determination of the board as to the interpretation of the DROP or its determination of any disputed questions shall be conclusive and final to the extent permitted by applicable law. The board shall also oversee the investment of the DROP's assets. 
(4)  Limitation of liability. 
a.  The trustees shall not incur any liability individually or on behalf of any other individuals for any act or failure to act, made in good faith in relation to the DROP or the funds of the DROP. 
b.  Neither the board nor any trustee of the board shall be responsible for any reports furnished by any expert retained or employed by the board, but they shall be entitled to rely thereon as well as on certificates furnished by an accountant or an actuary, and on all opinions of counsel. The board shall be fully protected with respect to any action taken or suffered by it in good faith in reliance upon such expert, accountant, actuary or counsel, and all actions taken or suffered in such reliance shall be conclusive upon any person with any interest in the DROP. 
(f)  General provisions. 
(1)  The DROP is not a separate retirement plan. Instead, it is a program under which a member who is eligible for normal retirement under the system may elect to accrue future retirement benefits in the manner provided in this section 66-218 for the remainder of his employment, rather than in the normal manner provided under the plan. Upon termination of employment, a member is entitled to a lump sum distribution of his or her DROP account balance or may elect a rollover. The DROP account distribution is in addition to the member's monthly benefit. 
(2)  Notional account. The DROP account established for such a member is a notional account, used only for the purpose of calculation of the DROP distribution amount. It is not a separate account in the system. There is no change in the system's assets, and there is no distribution available to the member until the member's termination from the DROP. The member has no control over the investment of the DROP account. 
(3)  No employer discretion. The DROP benefit is determined pursuant to a specific formula which does not involve employer discretion. 
(4)  IRC limit. The DROP account distribution, along with other benefits payable from the system, is subject to limitation under Internal Revenue Code section 415(b). 
(5)  Amendment of DROP. The DROP may be amended by an ordinance of the city at any time and from time to time, and retroactively if deemed necessary or appropriate, to amend in whole or in part any or all of the provisions of the DROP. However, except as otherwise provided by law, no amendment shall make it possible for any part of the DROP's funds to be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of persons entitled to benefits under the DROP. No amendment shall be made which has the effect of decreasing the balance of the DROP account of any member. 
(6)  Facility of payment. If the board shall find that a member or other person entitled to a benefit under the DROP is unable to care for his affairs because of illness or accident or is a minor, the board may direct that any benefit due him, unless claim shall have been made for the benefit by a duly appointed legal representative, be paid to his spouse, a child, a parent or other blood relative, or to a person with whom he resides. Any payment so made shall be a complete discharge of the liabilities of the DROP for that benefit. 
(7)  Information. Each member, beneficiary or other person entitled to a benefit, before any benefit shall be payable to him or on his account under the DROP, shall file with the board the information that it shall require to establish his rights and benefits under the DROP. 
(8)  Prevention of eschea t. If the board cannot ascertain the whereabouts of any person to whom a payment is due under the DROP, the board may, no earlier than three years from the date such payment is due, mail a notice of such due and owing payment to the last known address of such person, as shown on the records of the board or the city. If such person has not made written claim therefor within three months of the date of the mailing, the board may, if it so elects and upon receiving advice from counsel to the DROP, direct that such payment and all remaining payments otherwise due such person be canceled on the records of the DROP. Upon such cancellation, the DROP shall have no further liability therefor except that, in the event such person or his beneficiary later notifies the board of his whereabouts and requests the payment or payments due to him under the DROP, the amount so applied shall be paid to him in accordance with the provisions of the DROP. 
(9)  Written elections, notification. 
a.  Any elections, notifications or designations made by a member pursuant to the provisions of the DROP shall be made in writing and filed with the board in a time and manner determined by the board under rules uniformly applicable to all employees similarly situated. The board reserves the right to change from time to time and manner for making notifications, elections or designations by members under the DROP if it determines after due deliberation that such action is justified in that it improves the administration of the DROP. In the event of a conflict between the provisions for making an election, notification or designation set forth in the DROP and such new administrative procedures, those new administrative procedures shall prevail. 
b.  Each member or retiree who has a DROP account shall be responsible for furnishing the board with his current address and any subsequent changes in his address. Any notice required to be given to a member or retiree hereunder shall be deemed given if directed to him at the last such address given to the board and mailed by registered or certified United States mail. If any check mailed by registered or certified United States mail to such address is returned, mailing of checks will be suspended until such time as the member or retiree notifies the board of his address. 
(10)  Benefits not guaranteed. All benefits payable to a member from the DROP shall be paid only from the assets of the member's DROP account and neither the city nor the board shall have any duty or liability to furnish the DROP with any funds, securities or other assets except to the extent required by any applicable law. 
(11)  Construction. 
a.  The DROP shall be construed, regulated and administered under the laws of Florida, except where other applicable law controls. 
b.  The titles and headings of the subsections in this section 66-225 are for convenience only. In the case of ambiguity or inconsistency, the text rather than the titles or headings shall control. 
(12)  Forfeiture of retirement benefits. Nothing in this section shall be construed to remove DROP participants from the application of any forfeiture provisions applicable to the system. DROP participants shall be subject to forfeiture of all retirement benefits, including DROP benefits. 
(13)  Effect of DROP participation on employment. Participation in the DROP is not a guarantee of employment and DROP participants shall be subject to the same employment standards and policies that are applicable to employees who are not DROP participants.

There shall be no maximum purchase of credited service with the City of St. Pete Beach and such service shall count for all purposes including vesting. 
(5)  In no event, however, may credited service be purchased pursuant to this section for prior service with any other municipal, county, or special law enforcement police department, if such prior service forms or will form the basis of a retirement benefit or pension from another retirement system or plan as set forth in subsection 66-221(k)(2). 
(Ord. No. 03-22, § 5, 11-18-03; Ord. No. 10-27, § 1, 9-28-10; Ord. No. 2017-26, § 7, 12-12-17)  
Sec. 66-227. - Military service prior to employment. 
The years or fractional parts of years that a member serves or has served on active duty in the military service of the Armed Forces of the United States, the United States Merchant Marine or the United States Coast Guard, voluntarily or involuntarily and honorably or under honorable conditions, prior to first and initial employment with the city police department shall be added to his years of credited service provided that: 
(1)  The member contributes to the fund the sum that he would have contributed, based on his salary and the member contribution rate in effect at the time that the credited service is requested, had he been a member of this system for the years or fractional parts of years for which he is requesting credit, plus amounts actuarially determined such that the crediting of service does not result in any cost to the fund plus payment of costs for all professional services rendered to the board in connection with the purchase of years of credited service.

(5)  Credited service purchased pursuant to this section shall count for all purposes, except vesting and eligibility for not-in-line of duty disability benefits. 
(Ord. No. 03-22, § 6, 11-18-03; Ord. No. 10-27, § 1, 9-28-10)  
Sec. 66-228. - Miscellaneous provisions. 
(a)  Interest of members in system. All assets of the fund are held in trust, and at no time prior to the satisfaction of all liabilities under the system with respect to retirees and members and their spouses or beneficiaries, shall any part of the corpus or income of the fund be used for or diverted to any purpose other than for their exclusive benefit. 
(b)  No reduction of accrued benefits. No amendment or ordinance shall be adopted by the city commission of the City of St. Pete Beach which shall have the effect of reducing the then vested accrued benefits of members or a member's beneficiaries. 
(c)  Qualification of system.

Any modification or amendment of the system may be made retroactively, if necessary or appropriate, to qualify or maintain the system as a plan meeting the requirements of the applicable provisions of the code as now in effect or hereafter amended, or any other applicable provisions of the U.S. Federal Tax Laws, as now in effect or hereafter amended or adopted, and the regulations issued thereunder. 
(d)  Use of forfeitures. Forfeitures arising from terminations of service of members shall serve only to reduce future city contributions. 
(e)  Prohibited transactions. Effective as of January 1, 1989, a board may not engage in a transaction prohibited by code section 503(b). 
(f)  USERRA. Effective December 12, 1994, notwithstanding any other provision of this system, contributions, benefits and service credit with respect to qualified military service are governed by code section 414(u) and the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act of 1994, as amended. To the extent that the definition of "credited service" sets forth contribution requirements that are more favorable to the member than the minimum compliance requirements, the more favorable provisions shall apply.

(1)  Member will be 100 percent vested in all benefits upon attainment of the plan's age and service requirements for the plan's normal retirement benefit; and 
(2)  A member will be 100 percent vested in all accrued benefits, to the extent funded, if the plan is terminated or experiences a complete discontinuance of employer contributions. 
(h)  Electronic forms. In those circumstances where a written election or consent is not required by the plan or the code, an oral, electronic, or telephonic form in lieu of or in addition to a written form may be prescribed by the board. However, where applicable, the board shall comply with Treasury Regulations Section 1.401(a)-21. 
(i)  Compliance with F.S. ch. 185. It is intended that the system will continue to qualify for funding under F.S. § 185.08. Accordingly, unless otherwise required by law, any provision of the system which violates the requirements of F.S. ch. 185, as amended from time to time, shall be superseded by and administered in accordance with the requirements of such chapter.

(b)  Benefit amounts and eligibility. 
(1)  Normal retirement age and date. A member's normal retirement age is the earlier of the attainment of age 60 and completion of ten years of credited service, or 30 years of credited service regardless of age. Provided, a member with ten or more years of credited service on January 31, 2013 shall be eligible for normal retirement at age 55 or upon completion of 25 years of credited service, regardless of age.

The monthly retirement benefit shall equal 1.25 percent of average final compensation for each year of credited service earned on or after February 1, 2013, up to a maximum of 75 percent of average final compensation. Provided, if a member's accrued benefit as of February 1, 2013 is 75 percent or more of average final compensation, the benefit percentage may not be reduced. 
(3)  No early retirement. A member may not receive an immediate or deferred retirement benefit under this section, prior to attaining his or her normal retirement date as defined in this section. 
(c)  COLA. Members accruing benefits under this section shall not be entitled to a cost-of-living adjustment.

(e)  Vesting. If a member terminates employment, either voluntarily or by lawful discharge, the member shall be entitled to the following: 
(1)  With less than ten years of credited service (including credited service earned prior to February 1, 2013), a member is entitled to a refund of member contributions without interest.

(Ord. No. 12-27, § 8, 12-27-12; Ord. No. 2017-26, § 8, 12-12-17)  
Sec. 66-230. - Share plan. 
(a)  Effective February 1, 2013, there is created a supplemental retirement benefit for the City of St. Pete Beach Police Officers in accordance with this section. The supplemental retirement benefit shall consist of an individual share account established for each police officer employed by the city on October 1, 2012, including DROP participants. The supplemental retirement benefit shall be funded solely by excess premium tax revenues received by the city pursuant to F.S. ch. 185, as provided in this section. The total initial amount to be allocated to the participants' share accounts as provided herein shall be the "total state monies reserve" reflected in the actuarial valuation report as of October 1, 2012. In the event the division of retirement determines that a lesser amount of F.S. ch. 185 monies are available to fund the share plan, the share plan shall be funded with the amount of F.S. ch. 185 revenues determined to be available by the division of retirement. Participants' share accounts shall be credited with premium tax revenues and investment earnings or losses, and distributed as follows: 
(1)  Crediting of excess premium tax monies. No later than April 1, 2013, a share account shall be established for each eligible member, and each share account shall be credited as follows. Each member who was employed as a police officer on October 1, 2012 shall receive one share for each complete month of credited service earned from January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2012, or date of DROP entry, whichever applies to each individual. The total number of shares thus determined shall be divided into the total amount of premium tax monies to be allocated to derive the initial value of each share. 
a.  Example: Officer (A) was employed January 1, 2006 and entered the DROP July 1, 2008. In the initial crediting of premium tax monies, this officer would receive 12 shares for 12 months of credited service in 2006, 12 shares for 12 months of credited service in 2007 and six shares for six months of credited service in 2008 before entering the DROP (Total: 30 shares). 
b.  Example: Officer (B) was employed January 1, 2006 and is still an active member of the system (non-DROP) on October 1, 2012. In the initial crediting of premium tax monies, this officer would receive one share for each month of credited service from January 1, 2006 through December 31, 2012 (Total: 72 shares). 
c.  Example: Officer (C) was employed in mid-November 2009 and is still an active member of the system (non-DROP) on December 31, 2012. In the initial crediting of premium tax monies, this officer would not receive a share for November 2009 since it was not a full month of credited service, but the officer would receive a share for each month thereafter through December 31, 2012 (Total: 37 shares). 
(3)  Investment earnings and losses. Effective January 1, 2014 and each January 1 thereafter, each participant's share account balance shall be credited or debited with earnings or losses at a rate equal to the fund's actual net rate of investment return for the plan year ending on the preceding September 30. There are no percentage gains guaranteed since all gains and losses are determined by the fund's market performance. 
(b)  Distribution of share accounts. Participants shall be eligible to receive a distribution of 100 percent of the balance in their share account, together with all applicable earnings and losses credited to their share account through the date of termination of employment. The designated beneficiary of a participant who dies while employed shall receive the accumulated total of the participant's share account balance and a participant who is awarded a disability benefit from the system shall receive the accumulated total of his/her share account balance. Payment of the share account balance shall be by lump sum, which shall consist of the accumulated total balance of the participant's share account, or, at the participant's direction, all or a portion of the share account balance may be rolled over to an IRA or another qualified plan in accordance with applicable law. The distribution of participants' share account funds is subject to the U.S. Internal Revenue Code, and distributions shall be made with any applicable taxes and penalties withheld as required by law.

(a)  The following words, terms and phrases, when used in this article, shall have the meanings ascribed to them in this section, except where the context clearly indicates a different meaning: 
Accumulated contributions means a member's own contributions without interest. For those members who purchase credited service with interest or at no cost to the system, any payment representing interest and any required actuarially calculated payments for the purchase of such credited service shall be included in accumulated contributions. 
Actuarial equivalent means a benefit or amount of equal value, based upon the RP 2000 Combined Healthy Unisex Mortality Table and an interest rate equal to the investment return assumption set forth in the last actuarial valuation report approved by the board. This definition may only be amended by the city pursuant to the recommendation of the board using the assumptions adopted by the board with the advice of the plan's actuary, such that actuarial assumptions are not subject to city discretion. 
Average final compensation means one-twelfth of the average salary of the five best years of the last ten years of credited service prior to retirement, termination, or death, or the career average as a full time firefighter, whichever is greater. A year shall be 12 consecutive months. 
Beneficiary means the person entitled to receive benefits under this article at the death of a member who has been designated in writing by the member and filed with the board. If no such designation is in effect or if no person so designated is living at the time of death of the member, the beneficiary shall be the estate of the member. 
Board means the board of trustees, which shall administer and manage the system provided in this article and serve as trustees of the fund. 
Code means the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as amended from time to time. 
Credited service means the total number of years and fractional parts of years of service as a firefighter with member contributions, when required, omitting intervening years or fractional parts of years when such member was not employed by the city as a firefighter. A member may voluntarily leave his accumulated contributions in the fund for a period of five years after leaving the employ of the fire department pending the possibility of being reemployed as a firefighter, and without losing credit for the time that he was a member of the system. If a vested member leaves the employ of the fire department his accumulated contributions will be returned only upon his written request. If a member who is not vested is not reemployed as a firefighter with the fire department within five years, his accumulated contributions, if $1,000.00 or less, shall be returned. If a member who is not vested is not reemployed within five years, his accumulated contributions, if more than $1,000.00, will be returned only upon the written request of the member and upon completion of a written election to receive a cash lump sum or to rollover the lump sum amount on forms designated by the board. Upon return of a member's accumulated contributions, all of his rights and benefits under the system are forfeited and terminated. Upon any reemployment, a firefighter shall not receive credit for the years and fractional parts of years of service for which he has withdrawn his accumulated contributions from the fund, unless the firefighter repays into the fund the contributions he has withdrawn, with interest, as determined by the board, within 90 days after his reemployment. 
The years or fractional parts of a year that a member performs "qualified military service" consisting of voluntary or involuntary "service in the uniformed services" as defined in the Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) (P.L. 103-353) after separation from employment as a firefighter with the city to perform training or service, shall be added to his years of credited service for all purposes, including vesting, provided that: 
(1)  The member is entitled to reemployment under the provisions of USERRA. 
(2)  The member returns to his employment as a firefighter within one year from the earlier of the date of his military discharge or his release from active service unless otherwise required by USERRA. 
(3)  The maximum credit for military service pursuant to this paragraph shall be five years. 
(4)  This paragraph is intended to satisfy the minimum requirements of USERRA. To the extent that this paragraph does not meet the minimum standards of USERRA, as it may be amended from time to time, the minimum standards shall apply. 
In the event a member dies on or after January 1, 2007, while performing USERRA qualified military service, the beneficiaries of the member are entitled to any benefits (other than benefit accruals relating to the period of qualified military service) as if the member had resumed employment and then died while employed. 
Beginning January 1, 2009, to the extent required by section 414(u)(12) of the code, an individual receiving differential wage payments (as defined under section 3401(h)(2) of the code) from an employer shall be treated as employed by that employer, and the differential wage payment shall be treated as compensation for purposes of applying the limits on annual additions under section 415(c) of the code. This provision shall be applied to all similarly situated individuals in a reasonably equivalent manner. 
Leave conversions of unused accrued paid time off shall not be permitted to be applied toward the accrual of credited service either during each plan year of a member's employment with the city or in the plan year in which the member terminates employment. 
Eligible employee means an individual who was a member before the first plan year beginning after December 31, 1995. 
Firefighter means an actively employed full-time person employed by the city, including his initial probationary employment period, who is certified as a firefighter as a condition of employment in accordance with F.S. § 633.408 and whose duty it is to extinguish fires, to protect life and to protect property. The term includes all certified, supervisory, and command personnel whose duties include, in whole or in part, the supervision, training, guidance, and management responsibilities of full-time firefighters, part-time firefighters, or auxiliary firefighters but does not include part-time firefighters or auxiliary firefighters. 
Fund means the trust fund established in this article as part of the system. 
Member means an actively employed firefighter who fulfills the prescribed membership requirements. Benefit improvements which, in the past, have been provided for by amendments to the system adopted by city ordinance and any benefit improvements which might be made in the future shall apply prospectively and shall not apply to members who terminate employment or who retire prior to the effective date of any ordinance adopting such benefit improvements, unless such ordinance specifically provides to the contrary. 
Plan year means the 12-month period beginning October 1 and ending September 30 of the following year. 
Retiree means a member who has entered retirement status. 
Retirement means a member's separation from city employment with eligibility for immediate receipt of benefits under the system. 
Salary for credited service prior to January 1, 2013 shall mean the total compensation for services rendered to the city as a firefighter reportable on the member's W-2 form, excluding single sum payments of accrued sick leave and vacation pay, plus all tax deferred, tax sheltered or tax exempt items of income derived from elective employee payroll deductions or salary reductions. Salary for credited service beginning January 1, 2013 and ending on the day prior to the effective date of this ordinance shall be defined in accordance with the provisions of section 66-339 of this chapter. Salary for credited service on or after the effective date of this ordinance shall mean the total compensation for services rendered to the city as a firefighter reportable on the member's W-2 form, excluding single sum payments of accrued sick leave and vacation pay and excluding overtime that exceeds 300 hours per fiscal year (over and above the regularly scheduled FSLA overtime), plus all tax deferred, tax sheltered or tax exempt items of income derived from elective employee payroll deductions or salary reductions. 
Compensation in excess of the limitations set forth in code section 401(a)(17) as of the first day of the plan year shall be disregarded for any purpose, including employee contributions or any benefit calculations. The annual compensation of each member taken into account in determining benefits or employee contributions for any plan year beginning on or after January 1, 2002, may not exceed $200,000.00, as adjusted for cost-of-living increases in accordance with code section 401(a)(17)(B). Compensation means compensation during the fiscal year. The cost-of-living adjustment in effect for a calendar year applies to annual compensation for the determination period that begins with or within such calendar year. If the determination period consists of fewer than 12 months, the annual compensation limit is an amount equal to the otherwise applicable annual compensation limit multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of months in the short determination period, and the denominator of which is 12. If the compensation for any prior determination period is taken into account in determining a member's contributions or benefits for the current plan year, the compensation for such prior determination period is subject to the applicable annual compensation limit in effect for that prior period. The limitation on compensation for an "eligible employee" shall not be less than the amount which was allowed to be taken into account hereunder as in effect on July 1, 1993. "Eligible employee" is an individual who was a member before the first plan year beginning after December 31, 1995. 
Spouse means the member's or retiree's spouse under applicable law at the time benefits become payable. 
System means the city firefighters' retirement system as contained in this article and all amendments thereto.

Sec. 66-252. - Benefit freeze and maximum benefit.

Such members shall be eligible to receive their frozen accrued benefit with no reduction upon termination of employment and attaining age 55 or upon completion of 25 years of credited service. Such members who attain age 50 with ten years of credited service, or 20 years of credited service regardless of age, shall be eligible to receive their frozen accrued benefit reduced by three percent for each year prior to the member's earliest applicable normal retirement date. 
(b)  The benefits of members who are employed and not participating in the DROP on December 31, 2012 shall be payable in two parts:

Beginning on the effective date of this ordinance, the maximum combined benefit under the system shall be 100 percent of average final compensation. 
(d)  Notwithstanding any other provision of the system, the benefits of members who have attained age 55 or 25 years of credited service as of December 31, 2012 shall not be frozen, and such members shall continue to accrue benefits in accordance with the provisions of the system in effect on December 31, 2012 for as long as they are employed in a position covered by the system.

Current employees of the city who are selected to become fire chief are not eligible for the opt-out provided for herein. In order to waive such participation, the fire chief shall notify the city manager and the board of trustees, in writing, of his decision to waive such participation.

(1)  Amount. Each member of the system who has attained age 55 or 25 years of credited service on December 31, 2012 shall be required to make regular contributions to the fund in the amount of 10.3 percent of his salary.

Member contributions withheld by the city on behalf of the member shall be deposited with the board of trustees immediately after each pay period. The contributions made by each member to the fund shall be designated as employer contributions pursuant to section 414(h) of the code. Such designation is contingent upon the contributions being excluded from the member's gross income for federal income tax purposes. For all other purposes of the system, such contributions shall be considered to be member contributions. 
(2)  Method. Such contributions shall be made by payroll deduction. 
(b)  State contributions.

So long as this system is in effect, the city shall make quarterly contributions to the fund in an amount equal to the difference in each year, between the total aggregated member contributions for the year, plus state contributions for such year, and the total cost for the year, as shown by the most recent actuarial valuation of the system, but in no event shall the city's annual contribution be less than two percent of the total salary of members. The total cost for any year shall be defined as the total normal cost plus the additional amount sufficient to amortize the unfunded past service liability as provided in part VII of F.S. ch. 112. 
(d)  Other. Private donations, gifts and contributions may be deposited to the fund, but such deposits must be accounted for separately and kept on a segregated bookkeeping basis. Funds arising from these sources may be used only for additional benefits for members, as determined by the board, and may not be used to reduce what would have otherwise been required city contributions.

(b)  If this article shall be repealed or if contributions to the system are discontinued or if there is a transfer, merger or consolidation of government units, services or functions as provided in F.S. ch. 121, the board shall continue to administer the system in accordance with this article, for the sole benefit of the then members, any beneficiaries then receiving retirement allowances, and any future persons entitled to receive benefits under one of the options provided for in this article who are designated by any of the members.

(1)  The board shall determine the date of distribution and the asset value required to fund all the nonforfeitable benefits after taking into account the expenses of such distribution. The board shall inform the city if additional assets are required, in which event the city shall continue to financially support the plan until all nonforfeitable benefits have been funded. 
(2)  The board shall determine the method of distribution of the asset value, whether distribution shall be by payment in cash, by the maintenance of another or substituted trust fund, by the purchase of insured annuities, or otherwise, for each firefighter entitled to benefits under the plan as specified in subsection (c)(3). 
(3)  The board shall distribute the asset value as of the date of termination in the manner set forth in this subsection, on the basis that the amount required to provide any given retirement income is the actuarially computed single-sum value of such retirement income, except that if the method of distribution determined under subsection (c)(2) involves the purchase of an insured annuity, the amount required to provide the given retirement income is the single premium payable for such annuity. The actuarial single-sum value may not be less than the firefighter's accumulated contributions to the plan, with interest if provided by the plan, less the value of any plan benefits previously paid to the firefighter. 
(4)  If there is asset value remaining after the full distribution specified in subsection (c)(3), and after the payment of any expenses incurred with such distribution, such excess shall be returned to the city, less return to the state of the state's contributions, provided that, if the excess is less than the total contributions made by the city and the state to date of termination of the plan, such excess shall be divided proportionately to the total contributions made by the city and the state. 
(5)  The board shall distribute, in accordance with subsection (c)(2), the amounts determined under subsection (c)(3). 
If, after 24 months after the date the plan terminated or the date the board received written notice that the contributions thereunder were being permanently discontinued, the city or the board of the fund affected has not complied with all the provisions in this section, the Florida Department of Management Services will effect the termination of the fund in accordance with this section.

The board may, upon written request by a retiree or by a dependent, when authorized by a retiree or the retiree's beneficiary, authorize the system to withhold from the monthly retirement payment those funds that are necessary to pay for the benefits being received through the city, to pay the certified bargaining agent of the city, to make payment to insurance companies for insurance premiums as permitted by F.S. ch. 175 and to make any payments for child support or alimony. 
(c)  Exemption from tax, non-assignability. Except as otherwise provided by law, the pensions, annuities or any other benefits accrued or accruing to any person under this article and the accumulated contributions and the cash securities in the fund created under this article are exempted from any state, county or municipal tax of the state and shall not be subject to execution, attachment, garnishment or any legal process whatsoever and shall be unassignable.

(1)  The board shall be vested with full legal title to said fund, subject, however, and in any event to the authority and power of the city commission to amend or terminate this fund, provided that no amendment or fund termination shall ever result in the use of any assets of this fund except for the payment of regular expenses and benefits under this system, except as otherwise provided herein.

(8)  The board shall not be required to make any inventory or appraisal or report to any court, nor to secure any order of court for the exercise of any power contained herein. 
(9)  Where any action which the board is required to take or any duty or function which it is required to perform, either under the terms herein or under the general law applicable to it as trustee under this article, can reasonably be taken or performed only after receipt by it from a member, the city, or any other entity, of specific information, certification, direction or instructions, the board shall be free of liability in failing to take such action or perform such duty or function until such information, certification, direction or instruction has been received by it. 
(10)  Any overpayments or underpayments from the fund to a member, retiree or beneficiary caused by errors of computation shall be adjusted with interest at a rate per annum approved by the board in such a manner that the actuarial equivalent of the benefit to which the member, retiree or beneficiary was correctly entitled, shall be paid. Overpayments shall be charged against payments next succeeding the correction or collected in another manner if prudent. Underpayments shall be made up from the fund in a prudent manner. 
(11)  The board shall sustain no liability whatsoever for the sufficiency of the fund to meet the payments and benefits provided for herein.

A member's normal retirement age is the earlier of the attainment of age 55 regardless of years of credited service or the completion of 25 years of credited service regardless of age for members who retired, entered the DROP or terminated employment with the right to a deferred vested benefit prior to January 1, 2013, and members who are employed on December 31, 2012 and have attained age 55 or 25 years of credited service on that date. Each member shall become 100 percent vested in his accrued benefit at normal retirement age. A member's normal retirement date shall be the first day of the month coincident with or next following the date the member retires from the city after attaining normal retirement age. 
(2)  Normal retirement under the system is retirement from employment with the city on or after the normal retirement date. The normal retirement date for members who are employed on December 31, 2012 but have not attained age 55 or 25 years of credited service on that date, and members hired on or after January 1, 2013, shall be as provided in section 66-339 of this chapter; provided, members who are employed on December 31, 2012 but have not attained age 55 or 25 years of credited service on that date shall be eligible to receive their frozen accrued benefit through December 31, 2012 upon attaining age 55 or 25 years of credited service, and terminating city employment. 
(b)  Normal retirement benefit. A member retiring hereunder on or after his normal retirement date shall receive a monthly benefit which shall commence on the first day of the month coincident with or next following his retirement and which shall be continued thereafter during the member's lifetime, ceasing upon death, but with 120 monthly payments guaranteed in any event. The monthly retirement benefit for credited service earned prior to January 1, 2013 shall equal 3.4 percent of average final compensation, for each year of credited service. The normal retirement benefit for credited service on and after January 1, 2013 shall be as provided in section 66-339 of this chapter. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection, the normal retirement benefit of a member who is employed on December 31, 2012 and has attained age 55 or 25 years of credited service on that date shall equal 3.4 percent of average final compensation for all years of credited service. 
(c)  Early retirement date. A member may retire on his early retirement date which shall be the first day of any month coincident with or next following the attainment of age 50 and the completion of ten years of credited service or the completion of 20 years of credited service regardless of age. Early retirement under the plan is retirement from employment with the city on or after the early retirement date and prior to the normal retirement date. Members who are employed on December 31, 2012 but have not attained age 55 or 25 years of credited service on that date shall be eligible to receive their frozen accrued benefit through December 31, 2012 with the three percent reduction provided in subsection (d) (2) below, upon attaining age 50 with ten years of credited service or 20 years of credited service regardless of age, and terminating city employment. For members terminating employment on or after the effective date of the ordinance from which this section derived, the early retirement date will be age 50 and the completion of ten years of credited service.

The amount of each such deferred monthly retirement benefit shall be determined in the same manner as for retirement as his normal retirement date except that credited service and average final compensation shall be determined as of his early retirement date; or 
(2)  An immediate monthly retirement benefit which shall commence on his early retirement date and shall be continued on the first day of each month thereafter. The benefit payable shall be as determined in subsection (d)(1) of this section, reduced by three percent for each year by which the commencement of benefits precedes the date which would have been the member's normal retirement date had he continued employment as a firefighter for those members terminating employment prior to January 1, 2013, and age 55 for those members terminating employment on or after the effective date of this ordinance. 
(e)  Cost-of-living adjustment. The monthly amount payable based on credited service prior to January 1, 2013 for any member who terminated prior to the effective date of this ordinance, or the entire benefit for those retirees who terminate employment after the effective date of this ordinance to any retiree, including current retirees, and his joint pensioner or beneficiary, if applicable, who retires on or after such member's normal or early retirement date, not including terminated vested persons or disability retirees, shall be subject to an annual cost-of-living adjustment commencing on the first October 1 following seven complete years of receiving retirement income payments. The cost-of-living adjustment shall be three percent of the previous years' benefit amount. For those retirees who terminate employment between January 1, 2013 and the effective date of this ordinance, there shall be no cost-of-living adjustment applied to benefits based on credited service on or after January 1, 2013; provided, members who are employed on December 31, 2012 and have attained age 55 or 25 years of credited service on that date shall continue to be eligible for the cost of living adjustment provided in this subsection applied to benefits based on all periods of credited service.

The spouse beneficiary of any member who dies and who, at the date of his death, was vested or eligible for early or normal retirement shall be entitled to a benefit as follows: 
(1)  If the member was vested, but not eligible for normal or early retirement, the spouse beneficiary shall receive a benefit payable for ten years, beginning on the date that the deceased member would have been eligible for early or normal retirement, at the option of the spouse beneficiary. The benefit shall be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation as of the date of his death and reduced as for early retirement, if applicable. The spouse beneficiary may also elect to receive an immediate benefit, payable for ten years, which is actuarially reduced to reflect the commencement of benefits prior to the early retirement date. 
(2)  If the deceased member was eligible for normal or early retirement, the spouse beneficiary shall receive payable for ten years, beginning on the first day of the month following the member's death or at the deceased member's otherwise normal or early retirement date, at the option of the spouse beneficiary. The benefit shall be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation as of the date of his death and reduced as for early retirement, if applicable. 
(3)  A spouse beneficiary may not elect an optional form of benefit, except that the beneficiary may elect to receive a lump sum payment pursuant to subsection 66-329(g). 
(4)  A spouse beneficiary may, in lieu of any benefit provided for in subsections (b)(1) or (b)(2) of this section, elect to receive a refund of the deceased member's accumulated contributions. 
(5)  Notwithstanding anything contained in this section to the contrary, in any event, distributions to the spouse beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died, or by a date selected pursuant to the above provisions in this section that must be on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained 70½. 
(6)  If the surviving spouse beneficiary commences receiving a benefit under subsections (1) or (2) above, but dies before all payments are made, the actuarial value of the remaining benefit will be paid to the spouse beneficiary's estate in a lump sum. 
(c)  Deceased members vested or eligible for retirement with non-spouse beneficiary. This subsection applies only when the member's spouse is not the beneficiary or is not the sole designated beneficiary, but there is a surviving beneficiary. The beneficiary of any member who dies and who, at the date of his death was vested or eligible for early or normal retirement, shall be entitled to a benefit as follows: 
(1)  If the member was vested, but not eligible for normal or early retirement, the beneficiary will receive a benefit payable for ten years. The benefit will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died. The benefit will be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation and actuarially reduced to reflect the commencement of benefits prior to the normal retirement date. 
(2)  If the deceased member was eligible for normal or early retirement, the beneficiary will receive a benefit payable for ten years, beginning on the first day of the month following the member's death. The benefit will be calculated as for normal retirement based on the deceased member's credited service and average final compensation as of the date of his death and reduced for early retirement, if applicable. 
(3)  A beneficiary may not elect an optional form of benefit, however the board may elect to make a lump sum payment pursuant to subsection 66-329(g). 
(4)  A beneficiary, may, in lieu of any benefit provided for in subsections (c)(1) or (c)(2) above, elect to receive a refund of the deceased member's accumulated contributions. 
(5)  If a surviving beneficiary commences receiving a benefit under subsections (c)(1) or (c)(2) above, but dies before all payments are made, the actuarial value of the remaining benefit will be paid to the surviving beneficiary's estate by December 31 of the calendar year of the beneficiary's death in a lump sum. 
(6)  If there is no surviving beneficiary as of the member's death, and the estate is to receive the benefits, the actuarial equivalent of the member's entire interest must be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death. 
(7)  The Uniform Lifetime Table in Treasury Regulations § 1.401(a)(9)-9 shall determine the payment period for the calendar year benefits commence, if necessary to satisfy the regulations. 
(Ord. No. 00-16, § 1, 4-18-00; Ord. No. 10-28, § 1, 9-28-10)  
Sec. 66-328. - Disability. 
(a)  Disability benefits in line of duty. Any member of the firefighters' retirement system who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, because of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a firefighter, which disability was directly caused by the performance of his duty as a firefighter, shall, upon establishing the disability to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a monthly pension determined as for normal retirement, taking into account his average final compensation and years of credited service at the date of disability, but in any event the minimum amount paid to the member shall be 42 percent of the average final compensation of the member. Eligibility requirements for disability benefits are set forth in subsection (h), below. 
(b)  In line of duty presumptions. 
(1)  Any condition or impairment of health of a member caused by hypertension or heart disease shall be presumed to have been suffered in the line of duty unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence, provided such member shall have successfully passed a physical examination upon entering into such service, which examination failed to reveal any evidence of such condition, and provided, further, that such presumption shall not apply to benefits payable or granted in a policy of life insurance or disability insurance. 
(2)  Additional presumption. The presumption provided for in this subsection (b)(2) shall apply only to those conditions described in this subsection that are diagnosed on or after January 1, 1996. 
a.  Definitions. As used in this subsection, the following definitions apply: 
1.  Body fluids means blood and body fluids containing visible blood and other body fluids to which universal precautions for prevention of occupational transmission of bloodborne pathogens, as established by the Centers for Disease Control, apply. For purposes of potential transmission of meningococcal meningitis or tuberculosis, the term "body fluids" includes respiratory, salivary, and sinus fluids, including droplets, sputum, and saliva, mucous, and other fluids through which infectious airborne organisms can be transmitted between persons. 
2.  Emergency rescue or public safety member means any member employed full-time by the city as a firefighter, paramedic, emergency medical technician, law enforcement officer, or correctional officer who, in the course of employment, runs a high risk of occupational exposure to hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis and who is not employed elsewhere in a similar capacity. However, the term "emergency rescue or public safety member" does not include any person employed by a public hospital licensed under F.S. ch. 395 or any person employed by a subsidiary thereof. 
3.  Hepatitis means hepatitis A, hepatitis B, hepatitis non-A, hepatitis non-B, hepatitis C, or any other strain of hepatitis generally recognized by the medical community. 
4.  High risk of occupational exposure means that risk that is incurred because a person subject to this subsection, in performing the basic duties associated with his employment: 
i.  Provides emergency medical treatment in a non-healthcare setting where there is a potential for transfer of body fluids between persons; 
ii.  At the site of an accident, fire, or other rescue or public safety operation or in an emergency rescue or public safety vehicle handles body fluids in or out of containers or works with or otherwise handles needles or other sharp instruments exposed to body fluids; 
iii.  Engages in the pursuit, apprehension, and arrest of law violators or suspected law violators and, in performing such duties, may be exposed to body fluids; or 
iv.  Is responsible for the custody, and physical restraint when necessary, of prisoners or inmates within a prison, jail, or other criminal detention facility, while on work detail outside the facility, or while being transported and, in performing such duties, may be exposed to body fluids. 
5.  Occupational exposure, in the case of hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis, means an exposure that occurs during the performance of job duties that may place a worker at risk of infection. 
b.  Presumption. Any emergency rescue or public safety member who suffers a condition or impairment of health that is caused by hepatitis, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis that requires medical treatment and that results in total or partial disability or death shall be presumed to have a disability suffered in the line of duty, unless the contrary is shown by competent evidence; however, in order to be entitled to the presumption, the member must, by written affidavit as provided in F.S. § 92.50, verify by written declaration that, to the best of his knowledge and belief: 
1.  In the case of a medical condition caused by or derived from hepatitis, he has not: 
i.  Been exposed, through transfer of bodily fluids, to any person known to have sickness or medical conditions derived from hepatitis, outside the scope of his employment; 
ii.  Had a transfusion of blood or blood components, other than a transfusion arising out of an accident or injury happening in connection with his present employment, or received any blood products for the treatment of a coagulation disorder since last undergoing medical tests for hepatitis, which tests failed to indicate the presence of hepatitis; 
iii.  Engaged in unsafe sexual practices or other high risk behavior, as identified by the Centers for Disease Control or the Surgeon General of the United States or had sexual relations with a person known to him to have engaged in such unsafe sexual practices or other high risk behavior; or 
iv.  Used intravenous drugs not prescribed by a physician. 
2.  For meningococcal meningitis, in the ten days immediately preceding diagnosis he was not exposed, outside the scope of his employment, to any person known to have meningococcal meningitis or known to be an asymptomatic carrier of the disease. 
3.  For tuberculosis, in the period of time since the member's last negative tuberculosis skin test, he has not been exposed, outside the scope of his employment, to any person known to him to have tuberculosis. 
c.  Immunization. Whenever any standard, medically recognized vaccine or other form of immunization or prophylaxis exists for the prevention of a communicable disease for which a presumption is granted under this subsection, if medically indicated in the given circumstances pursuant to immunization policies established by the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices of the U.S. Public Health Service, an emergency rescue or public safety member may be required by the city to undergo the immunization or prophylaxis unless the member's physician determines in writing that the immunization or other prophylaxis would pose a significant risk to the member's health. Absent such written declaration, failure or refusal by an emergency rescue or public safety member to undergo such immunization or prophylaxis disqualifies the member from the benefits of the presumption. 
d.  Record of exposures. The city shall maintain a record of any known or reasonably suspected exposure of an emergency rescue or public safety member in its employ to the disease described in this subsection and shall immediately notify the member of such exposure. An emergency rescue or public safety member shall file an incident or accident report with the city of each instance of known or suspected occupational exposure to hepatitis infection, meningococcal meningitis, or tuberculosis. 
e.  Required medical tests; preemployment physical. In order to be entitled to the presumption provided by this subsection: 
1.  An emergency rescue of public safety member must, prior to diagnosis, have undergone standard, medically acceptable tests for evidence of the communicable disease for which the presumption is sought or evidence of medical conditions derived therefrom, which tests fail to indicate the presence of infection. This subsection does not apply to meningococcal meningitis. 
2.  On or after June 15, 1995, an emergency rescue or public safety member may be required to undergo a preemployment physical examination that tests for and fails to reveal any evidence of hepatitis or tuberculosis. 
(c)  Disability benefits not in line of duty. Any member with ten years or more credited service who shall become totally and permanently disabled to the extent that he is unable, because of a medically determinable physical or mental impairment, to render useful and efficient service as a firefighter, which disability is not directly caused by the performance of his duties as a firefighter, shall, upon establishing the disability to the satisfaction of the board, be entitled to a monthly pension determined as for normal retirement taking into account his average final compensation and years of credited service at the date of disability. Eligibility requirements for disability benefits are set forth in subsection (h), below. 
(d)  Conditions disqualifying disability benefits. Each member who is claiming disability benefits shall establish, to the satisfaction of the board, that such disability was not occasioned primarily by: 
(1)  Excessive or habitual use of any drugs, intoxicants, or narcotics. 
(2)  Injury or disease sustained while willfully and illegally participating in fights, riots or civil insurrections or while committing a crime. 
(3)  Injury or disease sustained while serving in any branch of the armed forces. 
(4)  Injury or disease sustained after his employment as a firefighter with the city shall have terminated. 
(e)  Physical examination requirement. 
(1)  A member shall not become eligible for disability benefits until and unless he undergoes a physical examination by a qualified physician or surgeon, who shall be selected by the board for that purpose. The board shall not select the member's treating physician or surgeon for this purpose except in an unusual case where the board determines that it would be reasonable and prudent to do so. 
(2)  Any retiree receiving disability benefits under this article may be periodically reexamined by a qualified physician or surgeon who shall be selected by the board, to determine if such disability has ceased to exist. If the board finds that the retiree is no longer permanently and totally disabled to the extent that he is unable to render useful and efficient service as a firefighter, the board shall recommend to the city that the retiree be returned to performance of duty as a firefighter, and the retiree so returned shall enjoy the same rights that he had at the time he was placed upon pension. If the retiree so ordered to return shall refuse to comply with the order within 30 days from the issuance thereof, he shall forfeit the right to his pension. 
(3)  The cost of the physical examination or reexamination of the member claiming or the retiree receiving disability benefits shall be borne by the fund. All other reasonable costs as determined by the board incident to the physical examination, such as but not limited to, transportation, meals and hotel accommodations, shall be borne by the fund. 
(4)  If the retiree recovers from disability and reenters the service of the city as a firefighter, his service will be deemed to have been continuous, but the period beginning with the first month for which he received a disability retirement income payment and ending with the date he reentered service of the city will not be considered as credited service for the purposes of the plan. 
(5)  The board shall have the power and authority to make the final decisions regarding all disability claims. 
(f)  Disability payments. The monthly benefit to which a member is entitled for the member's disability retirement shall be payable on the first day of the first month after the board determines such entitlement. However, the monthly retirement income shall be payable as of the date of the board determined such entitlement, and any portion due for a partial month shall be paid together with the first payment. The last payment will be: 
(1)  If the retiree recovers from the disability, the payment due next preceding the date of such recover; or 
(2)  If the retiree dies without recovering from disability, the payment due next preceding his death or the 120th monthly payment, whichever is later. 
Provided, however, the disability retiree may select, at any time prior to the date on which benefit payments begin, an optional form of benefit payment as described in subsections 66-329(a)(1) or (a)(2), which shall be the actuarial equivalent of the normal form of benefit. 
(g)  Workers' compensation. When a retiree is receiving a disability pension and workers' compensation benefits pursuant to F.S. ch. 440 for the same disability, and the total monthly benefits received from both exceed 100 percent of the member's average monthly wage, as defined in F.S. ch. 440, excluding overtime, the disability pension shall be reduced so that the total monthly amount received by the member does not exceed 100 percent of such wage. The amount of any lump sum workers' compensation payment shall be converted to an equivalent monthly benefit payable for ten years certain by dividing the lump sum amount by 83.9692. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in no event shall the disability pension benefit be reduced below the greater of 42 percent of average final compensation and two percent of average final compensation times years of credited service. 
(h)  Eligibility for disability benefits. Subject to (h)(4) below, only active members of the system on the date the board determines entitlement to a disability benefit are eligible for disability benefits. 
(1)  Terminated persons, either vested or non-vested, are not eligible for disability benefits. 
(2)  If a member voluntarily terminates his employment, either before or after filing an application for disability benefits, he is not eligible for disability benefits. 
(3)  If a member is terminated by the city for any reason other than for medical reasons, either before or after he files an application for disability benefits, he is not eligible for disability benefits. 
(4)  The only exception to (1) above is: 
a.  If the member is terminated by the city for medical reasons and he has already applied for disability benefits before the medical termination, or; 
b.  If the member is terminated by the city for medical reasons and he applies within 30 days after the medical termination date. 
If either (4)a., or (4)b. above applies, the member's application will be processed and fully considered by the board. 
(Ord. No. 00-16, § 1, 4-18-00; Ord. No. 10-28, § 1, 9-28-10; Ord. No. 2017-16, § 6, 10-10-17; Ord. No. 19-11, § 2, 7-23-19)  
Sec. 66-329. - Optional forms of benefits. 
(a)  In lieu of the amount and form of retirement income payable for normal or early retirement as specified in this article, a member, upon written request to the board, may elect to receive a retirement income or benefit of equivalent actuarial value payable in accordance with one of the following options: 
(1)  A retirement income of a larger monthly amount, payable to the retiree for his lifetime only. 
(2)  A retirement income of a modified monthly amount, payable to the retiree during the lifetime of the retiree and following the death of the retiree, 100 percent, 75 percent, 66 2/3 percent, or 50 percent of such monthly amounts payable to the joint pensioner for his lifetime. Except where the retiree's joint pensioner is his spouse, the payments to the joint pensioner as a percentage of the payments to the retiree shall not exceed the applicable percentage provided for in the applicable table in the Treasury Regulations (see Q & A-2 of 1.401(a)(9)-6). 
(3)  Such other amount and form of retirement payments or benefits as, in the opinion of the board, will best meet the circumstances of the retiree. 
(b)  The member, upon electing any option of this section, will designate the joint pensioner or beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, payable under the system for the member's death and will have the power to change such designation from time to time. Such designation will name a joint pensioner or one or more primary beneficiaries where applicable. A member may change his beneficiary at any time. If a member has elected an option with a joint pensioner and the member's retirement income benefits have commenced, the member may thereafter change his designated beneficiary at any time, but may only change his joint pensioner twice. Subject to the restriction in the previous sentence, a member may substitute a new joint pensioner for a deceased joint pensioner. In the absence of proof of good health of the joint pensioner being replaced, the actuary will assume that the joint pensioner has deceased for purposes of calculating the new payment. 
(c)  The consent of a member's or retiree's joint pensioner or beneficiary to any such change shall not be required. The rights of all previously designated beneficiaries to receive benefits under the system shall thereupon cease. 
(d)  Upon change of a retiree's joint pensioner in accordance with this section, the amount of the retirement income payable to the retiree shall be actuarially redetermined to take into account the age of the former joint pensioner, the new joint pensioner, and the retiree and to ensure that the benefit paid is the actuarial equivalent of the present value of the retiree's then current benefit at the time of the change. Any such retiree shall pay the actuarial recalculation expenses. Each request for a change will be made in writing on a form prepared by the board and on completion will be filed with the board. If no designated beneficiary survives the retiree, such benefits as are payable for the death of the retiree subsequent to his retirement shall be paid as provided in section 66-330. 
(e)  Retirement income payments shall be made under the option elected in accordance with this section and shall be subject to the following limitations: 
(1)  If a member dies prior to his normal retirement date or early retirement date, whichever first occurs, no retirement benefit will be payable under the option to any person, but the benefits, if any, will be determined under section 66-327. 
(2)  If the designated beneficiary (or beneficiaries) or joint pensioner dies before the member's retirement under the system, the option elected will be canceled automatically, and a retirement income of the normal form and amount will be payable to the member upon his retirement as if the election had not been made, unless a new election is made in accordance with this section or a new beneficiary, is designated by the member prior to his retirement. 
(3)  If both the retiree and the beneficiary designated by member or retiree die before the full payment has been effected under any option providing for payments for a period certain and life thereafter, made pursuant to subsection (a) of this section, the board may, in its discretion, direct that the commuted value of the remaining payments be paid in a lump sum and in accordance with section 66-330. 
(4)  If a member continues beyond his normal retirement date pursuant to subsection 66-326(a) and dies prior to his actual retirement and while an option made pursuant to this section is in effect, monthly retirement income payments will be made or a retirement benefit will be paid under the option to a beneficiary designated by the member in the amount computed as if the member had retired under the option on the date on which his death occurred. 
(5)  The member's benefit under this section must begin to be distributed to the member no later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age 70½ or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
(f)  A retiree may not change his retirement option after the date of cashing or depositing his first retirement check. 
(g)  Notwithstanding anything in this section to the contrary, the board in its discretion, may elect to make a lump sum payment to a member or a member's beneficiary in the event that the total commuted value of the monthly income payments to be paid do not exceed $1,000.00. Any such payment made to any person pursuant to the power and discretion conferred upon the board by the preceding sentence shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to such member and shall not be subject to review by anyone, but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons. 
(Ord. No. 00-16, § 1, 4-18-00; Ord. No. 06-28, § 2, 9-13-06; Ord. No. 10-28, § 1, 9-28-10)  
Sec. 66-330. - Beneficiaries. 
(a)  Under this article, each member or retiree may, on a form provided for that purpose, signed and filed with the board, designate a beneficiary (or beneficiaries) to receive the benefit, if any, which may be payable for his death. Each designation may be revoked or changed by such member or retiree by signing and filing with the board a new designation of beneficiary form. Upon such change, the rights of all previously designated beneficiaries to receive any benefits under the system shall cease. 
(b)  If a deceased member or retiree failed to name a beneficiary in the manner prescribed in subsection (a) of this section or if the beneficiary (or beneficiaries) named by a deceased member or retiree predeceases the member or retiree, the death benefit, if any, which may be payable under the system with respect to such deceased member or retiree shall be paid to the estate of the member or retiree and the board, in its discretion, may direct that the commuted value of the remaining monthly income benefits be paid in a lump sum. 
(c)  Any payment made to any person pursuant to this section shall operate as a complete discharge of all obligations under the system with regard to the deceased member and any other persons with rights under the system and shall not be subject to review by anyone but shall be final, binding and conclusive on all persons ever interested hereunder. 
(Ord. No. 00-16, § 1, 4-18-00; Ord. No. 10-28, § 1, 9-28-10)  
Sec. 66-331. - Maximum pension. 
(a)  Basic limitation. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this system to the contrary, the member contributions paid to, and retirement benefits paid from, the system shall be limited to such extent as may be necessary to conform to the requirements of code section 415 for a qualified retirement plan. Before January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the limits specified in code section 415(b), subject to the applicable adjustments in that section. On and after January 1, 1995, a plan member may not receive an annual benefit that exceeds the dollar amount specified in code section 415(b)(1)(A) ($160,000.00), subject to the applicable adjustments in code section 415(b) and subject to any additional limits that may be specified in this system. For purposes of this section, "limitation year" shall be the calendar year. 
(b)  Adjustments to basic limitation for form of benefit. If the form of benefit without regard to any benefit increase feature is not a straight life annuity, then the code section 415(b) limit applicable at the annuity starting date is reduced to an actuarially equivalent amount (determined using the assumptions specified in Treasury Regulation Section 1.415(b)-1(c)(2)(ii)) that takes into account the death benefits under the form of benefit. 
(c)  Benefits not taken into account. For purposes of this section, the following benefits shall not be taken into account in applying these limits: 
(1)  Any ancillary benefit which is not directly related to retirement income benefits; 
(2)  Any other benefit not required under section 415(b)(2) of the code and regulations thereunder to be taken into account for purposes of the limitation of code section 415(b)(1). 
(d)  COLA effect. Effective on and after January 1, 2003, for purposes of applying the limits under code section 415(b) (the "limit"), the following will apply: 
(1)  A member's applicable limit will be applied to the member's annual benefit in the member's first calendar year of benefit payments without regard to any automatic cost-of-living adjustments; 
(2)  Thereafter, in any subsequent calendar year, a member's annual benefit, including any automatic cost-of-living increases, shall be tested under the then applicable benefit limit including any adjustment to the code section 415(b)(1)(A) dollar limit under code section 415(d), and the regulations thereunder; but 
(3)  In no event shall a member's benefit payable under the system in any calendar year be greater than the limit applicable at the annuity starting date, as increased in subsequent years pursuant to code section 415(d) and the regulations thereunder. 
Unless otherwise specified in the system, for purposes of applying the limits under code section 415(b), a member's applicable limit will be applied taking into consideration cost-of-living increases as required by section 415(b) of the code and applicable Treasury Regulations. 
(e)  Other adjustments in limitations. 
(1)  In the event the member's retirement benefits become payable before age 62, the limit prescribed by this section shall be reduced in accordance with regulations issued by the Secretary of the Treasury pursuant to the provisions of code section 415(b) of the code, so that such limit (as so reduced) equals an annual straight life benefit (when such retirement income benefit begins) which is equivalent to a $160,000.00 annual benefit beginning at age 62. 
(2)  In the event the member's benefit is based on at least 15 years of credited service as a full-time employee of the fire or police department of the city, the adjustments provided for in subsection (e)(1) above shall not apply. 
(3)  The reductions provided for in subsection (e)(1) above shall not be applicable to disability benefits pursuant to section 66-328, or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to section 66-327. 
(4)  In the event the member's retirement benefit becomes payable after age 65, for purposes of determining whether this benefit meets the limit set forth in subsection (a) herein, such benefit shall be adjusted so that it is actuarially equivalent to the benefit beginning at age 65. This adjustment shall be made in accordance with regulations promulgated by the Secretary of the Treasury or his delegate. 
(f)  Less than ten years of participation. The maximum retirement benefits payable under this section to any member who has completed less than ten years of participation shall be the amount determined under subsection (a) of this section multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the number of the member's participation and the denominator of which is ten. The reduction provided by this subsection cannot reduce the maximum benefit below ten percent of the limit determined without regard to this subsection. The reduction provided for in this subsection shall not be applicable to pre-retirement disability benefits paid pursuant to section 66-328 or pre-retirement death benefits paid pursuant to section 66-327. 
(g)  Participation in other defined benefit plans. The limit of this section with respect to any member who at any time has been a member in any other defined benefit plan as defined in code section 414(j) maintained by the city shall apply as if the total benefits payable under all city defined benefit plans in which the member has been a member were payable from one plan. 
(h)  Ten thousand dollar limit. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the retirement benefit payable with respect to a member shall be deemed not to exceed the limit set forth in this section if the benefits payable, with respect to such member under this system and under all other qualified defined benefit pension plans to which the city contributes, do not exceed $10,000.00 for the applicable plan year and for any prior plan year and the city has not any time maintained a qualified defined contribution plan in which the member participated. 
(i)  Reduction of benefits. Reduction of benefits and/or contributions to all plans, where required, shall be accomplished by first reducing the member's benefit under any defined benefit plans in which member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be determined by the board and the plan administrator of such other plans, and next, by reducing or allocating excess forfeitures for defined contribution plans in which the member participated, such reduction to be made first with respect to the plan in which member most recently accrued benefits and thereafter in such priority as shall be established by the board and the plan administrator for such other plans provided, however, that necessary reductions may be made in a different manner and priority pursuant to the agreement of the board and the plan administrator of all other plans covering such member. 
(j)  Service credit purchase limits. 
(1)  Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, if a member makes one or more contributions to purchase permissive service credit under the system, as allowed in sections 66-336 and 66-337, then the requirements of this section will be treated as met only if: 
a.  The requirements of code section 415(b) are met, determined by treating the accrued benefit derived from all such contributions as an annual benefit for purposes of code section 415(b); or 
b.  The requirements of code section 415(c) are met, determined by treating all such contributions as annual additions for purposes of code section 415(c). 
c.  For purposes of applying subsection (j)(1)a., the system will not fail to meet the reduced limit under code section 415(b)(2)(C) solely by reason of this subsection (j)(1)c., and for purposes of applying subsection (j)(1)b. the system will not fail to meet the percentage limitation under section 415(c)(1)(B) of the code solely by reason of this subsection c. 
(2)  For purposes of this subsection the term "permissive service credit" means service credit: 
a.  Recognized by the system for purposes of calculating a member's benefit under the plan; 
b.  Which such member has not received under the plan; and 
c.  Which such member may receive only by making a voluntary additional contribution, in an amount determined under the system, which does not exceed the amount necessary to fund the benefit attributable to such service credit. 
Effective for permissive service credit contributions made in limitation years beginning after December 31, 1997, such term may, if otherwise provided by the system, include service credit for periods for which there is no performance of service, and, notwithstanding clause (j)(2)b., may include service credited in order to provide an increased benefit for service credit which a member is receiving under the system. 
(3)  For purposes of applying the limits in this subsection (j), only and for no other purpose, the definition of compensation where applicable will be compensation actually paid or made available during a calendar year, except as noted below and as permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulations. Unless another definition of compensation that is permitted by Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2, or successor regulation, is specified by the system, compensation will be defined as wages within the meaning of code section 3401(a) and all other payments of compensation to an employee by an employer for which the employer is required to furnish the employee a written statement under code sections 6041(d), 6051(a)(3) and 6052 and will be determined without regard to any rules under code section 3401(a) that limit the remuneration included in wages based on the nature or location of the employment or the services performed (such as the exception for agricultural labor in code section 3401(a)(2). 
a.  However, for calendar years beginning after December 31, 1997, compensation will also include amounts that would otherwise be included in compensation but for an election under code sections 125(a), 402(e)(3), 402(h)(1)(B), 402(k), or 457(b). For calendar years beginning after December 31, 2000, compensation will also include any elective amounts that are not includible in the gross income of the employee by reason of code section 132(f)(4). 
b.  For limitation years beginning on and after January 1, 2007, compensation for the calendar year will also include compensation paid by the later of 2-1/2 months after an employee's severance from employment or the end of the calendar year that includes the date of the employee's severance from employment if: 
1.  The payment is regular compensation for services during the employee's regular working hours, or compensation for services outside the employee's regular working hours (such as overtime or shift differential), commissions, bonuses or other similar payments, and, absent a severance from employment, the payments would have been paid to the employee while the employee continued in employment with the employer; or 
2.  The payment is for unused accrued bona fide sick, vacation or other leave that the employee would have been able to use if employment had continued. 
c.  Back pay, within the meaning of Treasury Regulations Section 1.415(c)-2(g)(8), shall be treated as compensation for the limitation year to which the back pay relates to the extent the back pay represents wages and compensation that would otherwise be included under this definition. 
(4)  Notwithstanding any other provision of law to the contrary, the board may modify a request by a member to make a contribution to the system if the amount of the contribution would exceed the limits provided in code section 415 by using the following methods: 
a.  If the law requires a lump sum payment for the purchase of service credit, the board may establish a periodic payment deduction plan for the member to avoid a contribution in excess of the limits under code sections 415(c) or 415(n). 
b.  If payment pursuant to subsection (j)(4)a. will not avoid a contribution in excess of the limits imposed by code section 415(c), the board may either reduce the member's contribution to an amount within the limits of that section or refuse the member's contribution. 
(k)  Additional limitation on pension benefits. Notwithstanding anything herein to the contrary: 
(1)  The normal retirement benefit or pension payable to a retiree who becomes a member of the system and who has not previously participated in such system, on or after January 1, 1980, shall not exceed 100 percent of his average final compensation. However, nothing contained in this section shall apply to supplemental retirement benefits or to pension increases attributable to cost-of-living increases or adjustments. 
(2)  No member of the system shall be allowed to receive a retirement benefit or pension which is in part or in whole based upon any service with respect to which the member is already receiving, or will receive in the future, a retirement benefit or pension from a different employer's retirement system or plan. This restriction does not apply to Social Security benefits or federal benefits under Chapter 1223, Title 10, U.S. Code. 
(l)  Effect of direct rollover on 415(b) limit. If the plan accepts a direct rollover of an employee's or former employee's benefit from a defined contribution plan qualified under code section 401(a) which is maintained by the employer, any annuity resulting from the rollover amount that is determined using a more favorable actuarial basis than required under code section 417(e) shall be included in the annual benefit for purposes of the limit under code section 415(b).

Sec. 66-332. - Minimum distribution of benefits. 
(a)  General rules. 
(1)  Effective date. Effective as of January 1, 1989, the plan will pay all benefits in accordance with a good faith interpretation of the requirements of code section 401(a)(9) and the regulations in effect under that section, as applicable to a governmental plan within the meaning of code section 414(d). Effective on and after January 1, 2003, the plan is also subject to the specific provisions contained in this section. The provisions of this section will apply for purposes of determining required minimum distributions for calendar years beginning with the 2003 calendar year. 
(2)  Precedence. The requirements of this section will take precedence over any inconsistent provisions of the plan. 
(3)  TEFRA Section 242(b)(2) elections. Notwithstanding the other provisions of this section other than this subsection (a)(3), distributions may be made under a designation made before January 1, 1984, in accordance with Section 242(b)(2) of the Tax Equity and Fiscal Responsibility Act (TEFRA) and the provisions of the plan that related to Section 242(b)(2) of TEFRA. 
(b)  Time and manner of distribution. 
(1)  Required beginning date. The member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed, to the member no later than the member's required beginning date which shall not be later than April 1 of the calendar year following the later of the calendar year in which the member attains age 70½ or the calendar year in which the member terminates employment with the city. 
(2)  Death of member before distributions begin. If the member dies before distributions begin, the member's entire interest will be distributed, or begin to be distributed no later than as follows: 
a.  If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary, then distributions to the surviving spouse will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died, or by a date on or before December 31 of the calendar year in which the member would have attained age 70½, if later, as the surviving spouse elects. 
b.  If the member's surviving spouse is not the member's sole designated beneficiary, then, distributions to the designated beneficiary will begin by December 31 of the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which the member died. 
c.  If there is no designated beneficiary as of September 30 of the year following the year of the member's death, the member's entire interest will be distributed by December 31 of the calendar year containing the fifth anniversary of the member's death. 
d.  If the member's surviving spouse is the member's sole designated beneficiary and the surviving spouse dies after the member but before distributions to the surviving spouse begin, this subsection (b)(2), other than subsection (b)(2)a., will apply as if the surviving spouse were the member. 
For purposes of this subsection (b)(2), distributions are considered to begin on the member's required beginning date or, if subsection (b)(2)d. applies, the date of distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (b)(2)a. If annuity payments irrevocably commence to the member before the member's required beginning date (or to the member's surviving spouse before the date distributions are required to begin to the surviving spouse under subsection (b)(2)a.) the date distributions are considered to begin is the date distributions actually commence. 
(3)  Death after distributions begin. If the member dies after the required distribution of benefits has begun, the remaining portion of the member's interest must be distributed at least as rapidly as under the method of distribution before the member's death. 
(4)  Form of distribution. Unless the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company or in a single sum on or before the required beginning date, as of the first distribution calendar year distributions will be made in accordance with this section. If the member's interest is distributed in the form of an annuity purchased from an insurance company, distributions thereunder will be made in accordance with the requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the code and Treasury Regulations. Any part of the member's interest which is in the form of an individual account described in section 414(k) of the code will be distributed in a manner satisfying the requirements of section 401(a)(9) of the code and Treasury Regulations that apply to individual accounts. 
(c)  Determination of amount to be distributed each year. 
(1)  General requirements. If the member's interest is paid in the form of annuity distributions under the plan, payments under the annuity will satisfy the following requirements: 
a.  The annuity distributions will be paid in periodic payments made at intervals not longer than one year. 
b.  The member's entire interest must be distributed pursuant to section 66-326, section 66-327, section 66-262, or section 66-329 (as applicable) and in any event over a period equal to or less than the member's life or the lives of the member and a designated beneficiary, or over a period not extending beyond the life expectancy of the member or of the member and a designated beneficiary. The life expectancy of the member, the member's spouse, or the member's beneficiary may not be recalculated after the initial determination for purposes of determining benefits. 
(2)  Amount required to be distributed by required beginning date. The amount that must be distributed on or before the member's required beginning date (or, if the member dies before distributions begin, the date distributions are required to begin under section 66-327) is the payment that is required for one payment interval. The second payment need not be made until the end of the next payment interval even if that payment interval ends in the next calendar year. Payment intervals are the periods for which payments are received, e.g., monthly. All of the member's benefit accruals as of the last day of the first distribution calendar year will be included in the calculation of the amount of the annuity payments for payment intervals ending on or after the member's required beginning date. 
(3)  Additional accruals after first distribution calendar year. Any additional benefits accruing to the member in a calendar year after the first distribution calendar year will be distributed beginning with the first payment interval ending in the calendar year immediately following the calendar year in which such amount accrues. 
(d)  General distribution rules. 
(1)  The amount of an annuity paid to a member's beneficiary may not exceed the maximum determined under the incidental death benefit requirement of code section 401(a)(9)(G), and effective for any annuity commencing on or after January 1, 2008, the minimum distribution incidental benefit rule under Treasury Regulation Section 1.401(a)(9)-6, Q&A-2. 
(2)  The death and disability benefits provided by the plan are limited by the incidental benefit rule set forth in code section 401(a)(9)(G) and Treasury Regulation Section 1.401-1(b)(1)(I) or any successor regulation thereto. As a result, the total death or disability benefits payable may not exceed 25 percent of the cost for all of the members' benefits received from the retirement system. 
(e)  Definitions. 
(1)  Designated beneficiary. The individual who is designated as the beneficiary under the plan and is the designated beneficiary under section 401(a)(9) of the code and Section 1.401(a)(9)-1, Q&A-4, of the Treasury Regulations. 
(2)  Distribution calendar year. A calendar year for which a minimum distribution is required. For distributions beginning before the member's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year immediately preceding the calendar year which contains the member's required beginning date. For distributions beginning after the member's death, the first distribution calendar year is the calendar year in which distributions are required to begin pursuant to section 66-327. 
(Ord. No. 00-16, § 1, 4-18-00; Ord. No. 06-28, § 3, 9-13-06; Ord. No. 10-28, § 1, 9-28-10)  
Sec. 66-333. - Direct transfers of eligible rollover distributions; elimination of mandatory distributions.

(2)  Distributee includes an employee or former employee. It also includes, the employee's or former employee's surviving spouse and the employee's or former employee's spouse or former spouse. Effective January 1, 2007, it further includes a non-spouse beneficiary who is a designated beneficiary as defined by code section 401(a)(9)(E). However, a non-spouse beneficiary may rollover the distribution only to an individual retirement account or individual retirement annuity established for the purpose of receiving the distribution and the account or annuity will be treated as an "inherited" individual retirement account or annuity. 
(3)  Eligible retirement plan means an individual retirement account described in section 408(a) of the code; an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b) of the code; an annuity plan described in section 403(a) of the code; effective January 1, 2002, an eligible deferred compensation plan described in section 457(b) of the code which is maintained by an eligible employer described in section 457(e)(1)(A) of the code and which agrees to separately account for amounts transferred into such plan from this plan; effective January 1, 2002, an annuity contract described in section 403(b) of the code; or a qualified trust described in section 401(a) of the code; or effective January 1, 2008, a Roth IRA described in section 408A of the code, that accepts the distributee's eligible rollover distribution. This definition shall also apply in the case of an eligible rollover distribution to the surviving spouse. 
(4)  Eligible rollover distribution means any distribution of all or any portion of the balance to the credit of the distributee, except that an eligible rollover distribution does not include: any distribution that is one of a series of substantially equal periodic payments, not less frequently than annually, made for the life or life expectancy of the distributee or the joint lives or joint expectancies of the distributee and the distributee's designated beneficiary, or for a specified period of ten years or more; any distribution to the extent such distribution is required under section 401(a)(9) of the code and the portion of any distribution that is not includable in gross income. Effective January 1, 2002, any portion of any distribution which would be includible in gross income as after-tax employee contributions will be an eligible rollover distribution if the distribution is made to an individual retirement account described in section 408(a); to an individual retirement annuity described in section 408(b); to a qualified defined contribution plan described in sections 401(a) or 403(a) that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of such distribution which is includible in gross income and the portion of such distribution which is not so includible; or on or after January 1, 2007, to a qualified defined benefit plan described in code section 401(a) or to an annuity contract described in code section 403(b), that agrees to separately account for amounts so transferred (and earnings thereon), including separately accounting for the portion of the distribution that is includible in gross income and the portion of the distribution that is not so includible. 
(b)  Payment. This section applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 2002. Notwithstanding any provision of the system to the contrary that would otherwise limit a distributee's election under this section, a distributee may elect, at the time and in the manner prescribed by the board, to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid directly to an eligible retirement plan specified by the distributee in a direct rollover. 
(c)  Rollovers or transfers into the fund. On or after January 1, 2002, the system will accept, solely for the purpose of purchasing credited service as provided herein, permissible member requested transfers of funds from other retirement or pension plans, member rollover cash contributions and/or direct cash rollovers of distributions made on or after January 1, 2002, as follows: 
(1)  Transfers and direct rollovers or member rollover contributions from other plans.

Sec. 66-334. - Family and Medical Leave Act. 
The fractional parts of the 24-month period ending each March 1 that a member is on leave without pay from the city pursuant to the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) shall be added to his credited service under the system, provided that: 
(1)  The member contributes to the fund the sum that he would have contributed, based on his salary and the member contribution rate in effect at the time that the credited service is requested, had he been a member of the system for the fractional parts of the 24 months ending each March 1 for which he is requesting credit plus amounts actuarially determined such that the crediting of service does not result in any cost to the fund plus payment of costs for all professional services rendered to the board in connection with the purchase of periods of credited service. 
(2)  The request for credited service for FMLA leave time for the 24-month period prior to each March 1 and payment of professional fees shall be made on or before March 31.

(b)  Participation. 
(1)  Eligibility to participate. In lieu of terminating his employment as a firefighter, any member who is eligible for normal retirement under subsection 66-326(a) of this division, of the system may, prior to January 1, 2013, elect to defer receipt of such service retirement pension and to participate in the DROP. Notwithstanding any other provision of this section, the DROP shall be closed to new participants effective January 1, 2013, and no member may enter the DROP on or after that date; provided, a member who is employed on December 31, 2012 and has attained age 55 or 25 years of credited service on that date may enter and participate in the DROP on or after January 1, 2013 in accordance with the provisions of this section. 
(2)  Election to participate. A member's election to participate in the DROP must be made in writing in a time and manner determined by the board and shall be effective on the first day of the first calendar month which is at least 15 business days after it is received by the board. 
(3)  Period of participation. A member who elects to participate in the DROP under subsection (b)(2), shall participate in the DROP for a period not to exceed 60 months beginning at the time his election to participate in the DROP first becomes effective. An election to participate in the DROP shall constitute an irrevocable election to resign from the service of the city not later than the date provided for in the previous sentence. A member may participate only once. 
(4)  Termination of participation. 
a.  A member's participation in the DROP shall cease at the earlier of:

Upon the member's termination of participation in the DROP, pursuant to subsection (b)(4)a.1. above, all amounts provided for in subsection (c)(2), including monthly benefits and investment earnings or losses or interest, as applicable, shall cease to be transferred from the system to his DROP account. Any amounts remaining in his DROP account shall be paid to him in accordance with the provisions of subsection (d) when he terminates his employment as a firefighter. 
c.  A member who terminates his participation in the DROP under subsection (b)(4) shall not be permitted to again become a participant in the DROP. 
(5)  Effect of DROP participation on the system. 
a.  A member's credited service and his accrued benefit under the system shall be determined on the date his election to participate in the DROP first becomes effective. For purposes of determining the accrued benefit, the member's salary for the purposes of calculating his average final compensation shall include an amount equal to any lump sum payments which would have been paid to the member and included as salary as defined herein, had the member retired under normal retirement and not elected DROP participation. Member contributions attributable to any lump sums used in the benefit calculation and not actually received by the member shall be deducted from the first payments to the member's DROP account. The member shall not accrue any additional credited service or any additional benefits under the system (except for any supplemental benefit payable to DROP participants or any additional benefits provided under any cost-of-living adjustment for retirees in the system) while he is a participant in the DROP. After a member commences participation, he shall not be permitted to again contribute to the system, nor shall he be eligible for disability, nor shall his estate or beneficiary be eligible for pre-retirement death benefits. 
b.  No amounts shall be paid to a member from the system while the member is a participant in the DROP. Unless otherwise specified in the system, if a member's participation in the DROP is terminated other than by terminating his employment as a firefighter, no amounts shall be paid to him from the system until he terminates his employment as a firefighter. Unless otherwise specified in the system, amounts transferred from the system to the member's DROP account shall be paid directly to the member only on the termination of his employment as a firefighter. 
(c)  Funding. 
(1)  Establishment of DROP account. A DROP account shall be established for each member participating in the DROP. A member's DROP account shall consist of amounts transferred to the DROP under subsection (c)(2), and earnings or interest on those amounts. 
(2)  Transfers from retirement system. 
a.  As of the first day of each month of a member's period of participation in the DROP, the monthly retirement benefit he would have received under the system had he terminated his employment as a firefighter and elected to receive monthly benefit payments thereunder shall be transferred to his DROP account, except as otherwise provided for in subsection (b)(4)b. A member's period of participation in the DROP shall be determined in accordance with the provisions of subsections (b)(3) and (b)(4), but in no event shall it continue past the date he terminates his employment as a firefighter. 
b.  Except as otherwise provided in subsection (b)(4)b., a member's DROP account under this subsection (c)(2) shall be debited or credited with either: 
1.  Interest at an effective rate of 7-1/2 percent per annum compounded monthly determined on the last business day of the prior month's ending balance and credited to the member's DROP account as of such date (to be applicable to all current and future DROP participants); or 
2.  Earnings, to be credited or debited to the member's DROP account, determined as of the last business day of each fiscal year quarter and debited or credited as of such date, determined as follows: 
 The average daily balance in a member's DROP account shall be credited or debited at a rate equal to the net investment return realized by the system for that quarter. "Net investment return" for the purpose of this paragraph is the total return of the assets in which the member's DROP account is invested by the board net of brokerage commissions, transaction costs and management fees. 
 For purposes of calculating earnings on a member's DROP account pursuant to this subsection (c)(2)b.2., brokerage commissions, transaction costs, and management fees shall be determined for each quarter by the investment consultant pursuant to contracts with fund managers as reported in the custodial statement. The investment consultant shall report these quarterly contractual fees to the board. The investment consultant shall also report the net investment return for each manager and the net investment return for the total plan assets. 
Upon electing participation in the DROP, the member shall elect to receive either interest or earnings on his account to be determined as provided above. The member may, in writing, elect to change his election only once during his DROP participation. An election to change must be made prior to the end of a quarter and shall be effective beginning the following quarter. 
c.  A member's DROP account shall only be credited or debited with earnings or interest and monthly benefits while the member is a participant in the DROP. A member's final DROP account value for distribution to the member upon termination of participation in the DROP shall be the value of the account at the end of the quarter immediately preceding termination of participation for participants electing the net plan return and at the end of the month immediately preceding termination of participation for participants electing the flat interest rate return, plus any monthly periodic additions made to the DROP account subsequent to the end of the previous quarter or month, as applicable, and prior to distribution. If a member is employed by the city fire department after participating in the DROP for the permissible period of DROP participation, then beginning with the member's first month of employment following the last month of the permissible period of DROP participation, the member's DROP account will no longer be credited or debited with earnings or interest, nor will monthly benefits be transferred to the DROP account. All such non-transferred amounts shall be forfeited and continue to be forfeited while the member is employed by the fire department. A member employed by the fire department after the permissible period of DROP participation will still not be eligible for disability benefits, nor will he accrue additional credited service. 
(d)  Distribution of DROP accounts on termination of employment. 
(1)  Eligibility for benefits. A member shall receive the balance in his DROP account in accordance with the provisions of this subsection (d) upon his termination of employment as a firefighter. Except as provided in subsection (d)(5), no amounts shall be paid to a member from the DROP prior to his termination of employment as a firefighter. 
(2)  Form of distribution. 
a.  Unless the member elects otherwise, distribution of his DROP account shall be made in a cash lump sum. A member may elect, in such time and manner as the board shall prescribe, to receive the optional form of benefit described below. 
1.  Until the value of the member's DROP account is completely depleted, payments in approximately equal quarterly or annual installments over a period, designated by the member, not to exceed the life expectancy of the last survivor of the member and his beneficiary. In the event that the member dies before all installments have been paid, the remaining balance in his DROP account shall be paid in an immediate cash lump sum to his beneficiary, or if none is designated, then to the member's estate. 
2.  The purchase of a nonforfeitable fixed annuity payable in such form as the member may elect. Elections under this clause 2. shall be in writing and shall be made in such time or manner as the board shall determine. 
b.  Notwithstanding the preceding, if a member dies before his benefits commence, his DROP account shall be paid to his beneficiary in such optional form as his beneficiary may select. If no beneficiary designation is made, the DROP account shall be distributed to the member's estate.

Except as otherwise provided in this subsection (d), distribution of a member's DROP account shall begin as soon as administratively practicable following the member's termination of employment. distribution of the amount in a member's DROP account will not be made unless the member completes a written request for distribution and a written election, on forms designated by the board, to either receive a cash lump sum or a rollover of the lump sum amount. 
(4)  Proof of death and right of beneficiary or other person. The board may require and rely upon such proof of death and such evidence of the right of any beneficiary or other person to receive the value of a deceased member's DROP account as the board may deem proper and its determination of the right of that beneficiary or other person to receive payment shall be conclusive. 
(5)  Distribution limitation. Notwithstanding any other provision of this subsection (d), all distributions from the DROP shall conform to the "minimum distribution of benefits" provisions as provided for herein. 
(6)  Direct rollover of certain distributions. This subsection applies to distributions made on or after January 1, 2002. Notwithstanding any provision of the DROP to the contrary, a distributee may elect to have any portion of an eligible rollover distribution paid in a direct rollover as otherwise provided under the system in section 66-333. 
(e)  Administration of DROP. 
(1)  Board administers the DROP. The general administration of the DROP, the responsibility for carrying out the provisions of the DROP and the responsibility of overseeing the investment of the DROP's assets shall be placed in the board. The members of the board may appoint from their number such subcommittees with such powers as they shall determine; may adopt such administrative procedures and regulations as they deem desirable for the conduct of their affairs; may authorize one or more of their number or any agent to execute or deliver any instrument or make any payment on their behalf; may retain counsel, employ agents and provide for such clerical, accounting, actuarial and consulting services as they may require in carrying out the provisions of the DROP; and may allocate among themselves or delegate to other persons all or such portion of their duties under the DROP, other than those granted to them as trustee under any trust agreement adopted for use in implementing the DROP, as they, in their sole discretion, shall decide. A trustee shall not vote on any question relating exclusively to himself. 
(2)  Individual accounts, records and reports. The board shall maintain, or cause to be maintained, records showing the operation and condition of the DROP, including records showing the individual balances in each member's DROP account, and the board shall keep, or cause to be kept, in convenient form such data as may be necessary for the valuation of the assets and liabilities of the DROP. The board shall prepare or cause to be prepared and distributed to members participating in the DROP and other individuals or filed with the appropriate governmental agencies, as the case may be, all necessary descriptions, reports, information returns, and data required to be distributed or filed for the DROP pursuant to the Code, the applicable portions of the Act and any other applicable laws. 
(3)  Establishment of rules. Subject to the limitations of the DROP, the board from time to time shall establish rules for the administration of the DROP and the transaction of its business. The board shall have discretionary authority to construe and interpret the DROP (including but not limited to, determination of an individual's eligibility for DROP participation, the right and amount of any benefit payable under the DROP and the date on which any individual ceases to be a participant in the DROP). The determination of the board as to the interpretation of the DROP or its determination of any disputed questions shall be conclusive and final to the extent permitted by applicable law. The board shall also oversee the investment of the DROP'S assets. 
(4)  Limitation of liability. 
a.  The trustees shall not incur any liability individually or on behalf of any other individuals for any act or failure to act, made in good faith in relation to the DROP or the funds of the DROP. 
b.  Neither the board nor any trustee of the board shall be responsible for any reports furnished by any expert retained or employed by the board, but they shall be entitled to rely thereon as well as on certificates furnished by an accountant or an actuary, and on all opinions of counsel. The board shall be fully protected with respect to any action taken or suffered by it in good faith in reliance upon such expert, accountant, actuary or counsel, and all actions taken or suffered in such reliance shall be conclusive upon any person with any interest in the DROP. 
(f)  General provisions. 
(1)  The DROP is not a separate retirement plan. Instead, it is a program under which a member who is eligible for normal retirement under the system may elect to accrue future retirement benefits in the manner provided in this section 66-335 for the remainder of his employment, rather than in the normal manner provided under the plan. Upon termination of employment, a member is entitled to a lump sum distribution of his or her DROP account balance or may elect a rollover. The DROP account distribution is in addition to the member's monthly benefit. 
(2)  Notional account. The DROP account established for such a member is a notional account, used only for the purpose of calculation of the DROP distribution amount. It is not a separate account in the system. There is no change in the system's assets, and there is no distribution available to the member until the member's termination from the DROP. The member has no control over the investment of the DROP account. 
(3)  No employer discretion. The DROP benefit is determined pursuant to a specific formula which does not involve employer discretion. 
(4)  IRC limit. The DROP account distribution, along with other benefits payable from the system, is subject to limitation under Internal Revenue Code Section 415(b). 
(5)  Amendment of DROP. The DROP may be amended by an ordinance of the city at any time and from time to time, and retroactively if deemed necessary or appropriate, to amend in whole or in part any or all of the provisions of the DROP. However, except as otherwise provided by law, no amendment shall make it possible for any part of the DROP's funds to be used for, or diverted to, purposes other than for the exclusive benefit of persons entitled to benefits under the DROP. No amendment shall be made which has the effect of decreasing the balance of the DROP account of any member. 
(6)  Facility of payment. If the board shall find that a member or other person entitled to a benefit under the DROP is unable to care for his affairs because of illness or accident or is a minor, the board may direct that any benefit due him, unless claim shall have been made for the benefit by a duly appointed legal representative, be paid to his spouse, a child, a parent or other blood relative, or to a person with whom he resides. Any payment so made shall be a complete discharge of the liabilities of the DROP for that benefit. 
(7)  Information. Each member, beneficiary or other person entitled to a benefit, before any benefit shall be payable to him or on his account under the DROP, shall file with the board the information that it shall require to establish his rights and benefits under the DROP. 
(8)  Written elections, notification. 
a.  Any elections, notifications or designations made by a member pursuant to the provisions of the DROP shall be made in writing and filed with the board in a time and manner determined by the board under rules uniformly applicable to all employees similarly situated. The board reserves the right to change from time to time the manner for making notifications, elections or designations by members under the DROP if it determines after due deliberation that such action is justified in that it improves the administration of the DROP. In the event of a conflict between the provisions for making an election, notification or designation set forth in the DROP and such new administrative procedures, those new administrative procedures shall prevail. 
b.  Each member or retiree who has a DROP account shall be responsible for furnishing the board with his current address and any subsequent changes in his address. Any notice required to be given to a member or retiree hereunder shall be deemed given if directed to him at the last such address given to the board and mailed by registered or certified United States mail. If any check mailed by registered or certified United States mail to such address is returned, mailing of checks will be suspended until such time as the member or retiree notifies the board of his address. 
(9)  Benefits not guaranteed. All benefits payable to a member from the DROP shall be paid only from the assets of the member's DROP account and neither the city nor the board shall have any duty or liability to furnish the DROP with any funds, securities or other assets except to the extent required by any applicable law. 
(10)  Construction. 
a.  The DROP shall be construed, regulated and administered under the laws of Florida, except where other applicable law controls. 
b.  The titles and headings of the subsections in this section 66-335 are for convenience only. In the case of ambiguity or inconsistency, the text rather than the titles or headings shall control. 
(11)  Forfeiture of retirement benefits. Nothing in this section shall be construed to remove DROP participants from the application of any forfeiture provisions applicable to the system. DROP participants shall be subject to forfeiture of all retirement benefits, including DROP benefits. 
(12)  Effect of DROP participation on employment. Participation in the DROP is not a guarantee of employment and DROP participants shall be subject to the same employment standards and policies that are applicable to employees who are not DROP participants.

(1)  The firefighter contributes to the fund the sum that he would have contributed, based on his salary and the member contribution rate in effect at the time that the credited service is requested, had he been a member of this system for the years or fractional parts of years for which he is requesting credit, plus amounts actuarially determined such that the crediting of service does not result in any cost to the fund plus payment of costs for all professional services rendered to the board in connection with the purchase of years of credited service. 
(2)  Multiple requests to buy credited service may be made at any time prior to retirement, but no purchase of credited service of less than one year is permitted, unless the total qualified time to be purchased is less than one year. 
(3)  Payment by the firefighter of the required amount shall be made within six months of his request for credit and prior to retirement and shall be made in one lump sum payment upon receipt of which credited service shall be given. 
(4)  The maximum credit under this section combined with section 66-336, shall be four years of credited service and shall count for all purposes except vesting. Credited service with the City of St. Pete Beach shall count towards vesting also. 
(5)  In no event, however, may credited service be purchased pursuant to this section for prior service with any other municipal, county fire department, if such prior service forms or will form the basis of a retirement benefit or pension from another retirement system or plan as set forth in subsection 66-331(k)(2). 
(Ord. No. 01-47, § 2, 12-18-01; Ord. No. 05-29, § 2, 9-27-05; Ord. No. 10-28, § 1, 9-28-10; Ord. No. 2017-16, § 9, 10-10-17)  
Sec. 66-338. - Miscellaneous provisions.

Any modification or amendment of the system may be made retroactively, if necessary or appropriate, to qualify or maintain the system as a plan meeting the requirements of the applicable provisions of the code as now in effect or hereafter amended, or any other applicable provisions of the U.S. Federal Tax Laws, as now in effect or hereafter amended or adopted, and the regulations issued thereunder.

Notwithstanding the previous sentence, reemployment by the city shall be subject to the limitations set forth in this section. 
(b)  After normal retirement. Any retiree who is retired under normal retirement pursuant to this system and who is reemployed as a firefighter and, by virtue of that reemployment, is eligible to participate in this system, shall upon being reemployed, discontinue receipt of benefits. Upon reemployment, the member shall be deemed to be fully vested and the additional credited service accrued during the subsequent employment period shall be used in computing a second benefit amount attributable to the subsequent employment period, which benefit amount shall be added to the benefit determined upon the initial retirement to determine the total benefit payable upon final retirement. Calculations of benefits upon retirement shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation, and credited service as of that date and the retirement benefit amount for any subsequent employment period shall be based upon the benefit accrual rate, average final compensation (based only on the subsequent employment period and not including any period of DROP participation), and credited service as of the date of subsequent retirement. The amount of any death or disability benefit received during a subsequent period of employment shall be reduced by the amount of accrued benefit eligible to be paid for a prior period of employment. The optional form of benefit and any joint pensioner selected upon initial retirement shall not be subject to change upon subsequent retirement except as otherwise provided herein, but the retiree may select a different optional form and joint pensioner applicable only to the subsequent retirement benefit. 
(c)  Any retiree who is retired under normal retirement pursuant to this system who is reemployed by the city in a position other than as a firefighter, shall upon being reemployed, continue receipt of benefits for the period of any subsequent employment period. Former DROP participants shall begin receipt of benefits under these circumstances. 
(d)  After early retirement. Any retiree who is retired under early retirement pursuant to this system and who subsequently becomes an employee of the city in any capacity shall discontinue receipt of benefits from the system. If the reemployed person, by virtue of his reemployment, is eligible to participate in this system, that person shall accrue a second benefit as provided for in subsection (2) above and benefit payments shall remain suspended during any such subsequent employment period. If the reemployed person is not eligible to participate in this system, that person's pension benefit payments shall be suspended until the earlier of termination of employment or such time as the reemployed retiree reaches the date that he would have been eligible for normal retirement under this system had he continued employment and not elected early retirement. "Normal retirement" as used in this subsection shall be the current normal retirement date provided for under this system. 
(e)  After disability retirement. 
(1)  Subject to paragraph (2) below, any retiree who is retired under section 66-328, Disability ("disability retiree"), may, subject to subsection (e), physical examination requirement, of that section, be reemployed by any public or private employer, and may receive compensation from that employment without limiting or restricting in any way, the retirement benefits payable under this system. 
(2)  Any disability retiree who subsequently becomes an employee of the city in any capacity, except as a firefighter, shall discontinue receipt of disability benefits from the system for the period of any such employment. 
(3)  If a disability retiree is reemployed as a firefighter for the city, his disability benefit shall cease and section 66-328, subsection (e) shall apply. 
(f)  Reemployment of terminated vested persons. Reemployed terminated vested persons shall not be subject to the provisions of this section until such time as they begin to actually receive benefits. Upon receipt of benefits, terminated vested persons shall be treated as normal or early retirees for purposes of applying the provisions of this section and their status as an early or normal retiree shall be determined by the date they elect to begin to receive their benefit. 
(g)  DROP Participants. Retirees who were in the deferred retirement option plan shall, following termination of employment after DROP participation, have the options provided for in this section for reemployment.

The order shall be in writing, shall be personally served upon the person or entity named in the order and shall set forth the violation for which the order was issued. Service of the order shall be made at the address set forth on the business tax receipt, and shall be directed to the person named as owner or operator of the business for which the receipt was issued. If the owner of the receipt is a corporation, partnership or other business entity, then service shall be made upon the person holding or owning the tax receipt. If the owner or operator of the business cannot be found on the premises of the business, then service may be made upon any manager or other person in charge of the premises for which the tax receipt was issued. 
(2)  The cease and desist order shall require the owner or holder of the business tax receipt to cease and desist from further violating, or from further violations of, the ordinances of the city, or from any applicable state or county statute or ordinance, applicable to the premises for which such receipt was issued, within 30 days from the date of service of the order.

(3)  The person or business entity to whom the order to cease and desist has been issued pursuant to this section shall be entitled to appeal the issuance of the order in the manner provided in section 78-107.

Upon any revocation or suspension, the owner or holder of the receipt shall immediately cease all business operating under the tax receipt. If the city is required to seek injunctive relief to enforce the provisions of this section, it shall be entitled to recover its reasonable attorneys' fees expended in order to enforce the cease and desist order. Nothing contained in this section shall prevent the city from pursuing any and all legal remedies available to it, including but not limited to criminal prosecution of the receipt owner, or holder or the manager of the premises for which such receipt was issued, and any employees found to be working on the premises at the expiration of the 30 days given for compliance with the order.

Unless waived in writing, within 30 days after the issuance of the summary order, the director or his designated official shall conduct a special hearing for such action in respect to the summary order as may be therein determined. Notice of such hearing shall be given the affected person in the manner prescribed in this section.

(Ord. No. 2004-26, § 1, 11-9-04)  
Sec. 78-117. - Ad valorem tax exemptions for improvements to historic property authorized: limitations. 
The city commission may authorize an exemption from ad valorem taxation equal to 100 percent of the assessed value of all improvements to historic properties which result from the restoration, renovation or rehabilitation of such properties. The exemption applies only to improvements to real property. In order for the property to qualify for the exemption, any such improvements must be made on or after the effective date of this ordinance. 
(Ord. No. 2004-26, § 1, 11-9-04)  
Sec. 78-118. - Ad valorem tax exemptions for historic properties open to the public. 
If a property is used for nonprofit or governmental purposes, and is regularly and frequently open for the public's visitation, use and benefit, as defined in Chapter lA-38, F.A.C., the city commission may exempt 100 percent of the assessed value of the property as improved from ad valorem taxes levied by the city commission provided that the assessed value of the qualifying improvement is equal to at least 50 percent of the total assessed value of the property as improved. This section applies only if the qualifying improvements are made by or for the use of the existing property owner. In order for the property to qualify for the exemption provided in this section, any such improvements must be made on or after the effective date of this ordinance. 
A property is considered used for nonprofit or governmental purposes if the occupant or the user of at least 65 percent of the useable space of the building is an agency of the federal, state, or local government or a nonprofit corporation whose articles of incorporation have been filed by the Department of State in accordance with F.S. § 617.0125. A property is considered regularly and frequently open to the public if public access to the property is provided not less than 52 days a year on an equitably spaced basis, and at other times by appointment. This exemption does not prohibit the owner from charging a reasonable nondiscriminatory admission fee. If a property that qualifies for this exemption is no longer regularly and frequently open to the public, or if ownership is transferred, then this exemption shall be subject to the revocation proceedings of section 78-114 of this article. 
(Ord. No. 2004-26, § 1, 11-9-04)  
Sec. 78-119. - Application. 
(a)  Preconstruction application. Any person, firm, or corporation that desires an ad valorem tax exemption for the improvement of an historic property must submit to the local historic preservation office a preconstruction application on a form prescribed by the Department of State. The preconstruction application must receive approval prior to the start of construction. An improvement or any portion thereof initiated prior to approval of the preconstruction application shall not be eligible for the exemption. The application must include the following information: 
(1)  The name of the property owner and the location of the historic property; and 
(2)  A description of the improvements to real property for which an exemption is requested and the anticipated date of commencement of construction of such improvements. This includes an estimate of the cost of the improvements that will be done to the exterior of the property or documentation that no improvements to the exterior of the property are necessary; and 
(3)  Proof, to the satisfaction of the local historic preservation office, that the property that is to be restored, renovated, or rehabilitated is an historic property under this ordinance; and 
(4)  Proof, to the satisfaction of the local historic preservation office, that the improvements to the property will be consistent with the United States Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and will be made in accordance with guidelines developed by the Department of State, Chapter 1A-38, F.A.C.; and 
(5)  Other information identified in appropriate Department of State regulations; and 
(6)  Other information requested by the local historic preservation office or requested by the city commission; and 
(7)  If necessary, a completed application for a certificate of appropriateness for the qualifying restoration, renovation, or rehabilitation. On completion of the review of a preconstruction application, the local historic preservation office shall notify the applicant in writing of the results of the review and shall make recommendations for correction of any planned work deemed to be inconsistent with section 111-4(b) of this article. Any changes made to the improvement after approval of the preconstruction application must receive prior approval of the local historic preservation office to ensure compliance with the criteria set forth in this ordinance. Failure to obtain prior approval may result in denial of the exemption. 
(b)  Request for review of completed work application. A request for review of completed work application shall be submitted to the local historic preservation office upon completion of the improvements. The form of said application shall be prescribed by the Department of State and shall include all information referenced in subsection (a) of this section. The local historic preservation office shall review the request for review of completed work application and provide to the board of county commissioners a written recommendation of either approval or denial of the application. The review by the local historic preservation office will be conducted in accordance with rules adopted by the Department of State, Chapter 1A-38, F.A.C. The local historic preservation office reserves the right to inspect the completed work to verify that it is in compliance with the work described in the approved preconstruction application. In order for an improvement to an historic property to qualify the property for an exemption, the improvement must meet the requirements of section 111-4(b) of this article. 
(c)  Interior inspection. Upon receipt of a preconstruction application or a request for review of completed work application involving an improvement project in which some of the work is in the interior of the property, the local historic preservation office reserves the right to make arrangements with the applicant for an interior inspection. The purpose of the interior inspection is to ascertain the effect, if any, of the improvement project on significant historical or architectural interior features. In order to determine the assessed value of an improvement project in which some of the work is in the interior of the property, the county property appraiser's office reserves the right to make arrangements with the applicant for an interior inspection after a tax exemption has been granted by the city commission. 
(d)  Reapplication. A property owner previously granted an exemption may undertake additional improvements during the exemption period or apply for additional exemptions for additional improvements following the expiration of the exemption period. A property owner may not reapply for an exemption for an improvement which has been denied by the city commission. 
(Ord. No. 2004-26, § 1, 11-9-04)  
Sec. 78-120. - Required covenant. 
(a)  To qualify for an exemption, the property owner must enter into a covenant with the city commission for the term for which the exemption is granted. The form of the covenant must be approved by the Department of State. The covenant shall provide that the property owner shall maintain and repair the property so as to preserve and maintain the historic architectural qualities or historical or archaeological integrity of the property during the period that the exemption is granted. If the exemption is granted, the property owner shall have the covenant recorded with the deed for the property in the official records of the county prior to the effective date of the exemption and shall provide a certified copy of the recorded covenant to the city manager within 30 days of city commission approval or said approval by the city commission shall be void. The covenant shall be binding on the current property owner, transferees, and their heirs, successors, or assigns. Violation of the covenant results in the property owner being subject to the payment of the differences between the total amount of taxes which would have been due in March in each of the previous years in which the covenant was in effect had the property not received the exemption and the total amount of taxes actually paid in those years, plus interest on the difference calculated as provided in F.S. § 212.12(3). 
(b)  If the property changes ownership during the exemption period, the requirements of the covenant must be transferred to the new owner. The new property owner may sign a waiver which discontinues the exemption on the property with no penalty to the property owner. The exemption may not be reinstated after the waiver has been delivered to the city manager. A copy of the waiver will be delivered to the county property appraiser's office. For waivers received prior to July 1 by the property appraiser's office, the exemption will be discontinued in that tax year. For waivers received after July 1 by the property appraiser's office, the exemption will be discontinued in the following tax year. 
(c)  One historic property tax exemption covenant may be executed by the property owner to include both the City of St. Pete Beach and Pinellas County. The property owner must provide a certified copy of the recorded covenant to both the city manager and to the county administrator, or his or her designee. 
(Ord. No. 2004-26, § 1, 11-9-04)  
Sec. 78-121. - City commission review and action. 
On completion of any municipal action on an application, the local historic preservation office shall deliver a copy of the application, their recommendation to grant or deny the tax exemption and the reasons therefore to the city commission. The city commission may then approve, modify, defer, or deny an application for tax exemption by resolution. If approved by the city commission, such tax exemption shall take effect on the January 1 following the resolution approving the tax exemption. Said approval shall be conditioned upon receipt by the city manager, or his or her designee, of a certified copy of the recorded covenant. The resolution approving the tax exemption shall include but not be limited to the following: 
(1)  The name of the owner and the address of the historic property for which the exemption is granted. 
(2)  The period of time for which the exemption will remain in effect and the expiration date of the exemption. 
(3)  A finding that the historic property meets the requirements of this ordinance. 
(4)  Any conditions of approval. 
(Ord. No. 2004-26, § 1, 11-9-04)  
Sec. 78-122. - Notice to Pinellas County Board of Commissioners. 
The city commission shall deliver to the Pinellas County Board of Commissioners a copy of each approved application for an historic property ad valorem tax exemption within five working days of said approval. 
(Ord. No. 2004-26, § 1, 11-9-04)  
Sec. 78-123. - Notice to property appraiser. 
The city commission shall deliver to the county property appraiser a copy of each application for an historic property ad valorem tax exemption approved in the previous calendar year. 
(Ord. No. 2004-26, § 1, 11-9-04)  
Sec. 78-124. - Revocation proceedings. 
The city commission may revoke an exemption at any time in the event that the property owner, or any subsequent owner or successor in interest to the property, violates the covenant, fails to maintain the qualifying property according to the terms, conditions and standards of the covenant, the historic character of the property and improvements which qualified the property for the exemption are not maintained, or if the property has been damaged by accidental or natural causes to the extent that the historic integrity of the features, materials, appearances, workmanship and environment, or archaeological integrity which made it eligible for listing or designation have been lost or damaged so that restoration is not possible. The city manager shall provide notice of such proceedings to the owner of record of the property. The city commissioner shall determine whether, and under what conditions the exemption shall be revoked, and whether and in what amount the property owner owes back taxes pursuant to section 111-10(a) of this article. The city commission shall provide written notice of the decision to the owner of record and to the county property appraiser. The local historic preservation office of the City of St. Pete Beach shall notify the county administrator's office, or his or her designee, of the proceedings and the reasons therefor.

The officer shall conspicuously affix to such vehicle a traffic citation or notice in writing for the driver to answer the charge within such time specified on the traffic citation or notice and at such place as designated on the traffic citation or notice. 
(b)  Any person issued a parking ticket by an officer shall be deemed to be charged with a noncriminal violation and shall comply with the directions on the ticket.

(b)  The owner of a vehicle is responsible and liable for payment of any parking ticket violation unless the owner can furnish evidence that the vehicle was, at the time of the parking violation, in the care, custody, or control of another person. In such instances, the owner of the vehicle is required, within a reasonable time after notification of the parking violation, to furnish to the city an affidavit setting forth the name, address, and driver's license number of the person who leased, rented or otherwise had the care, custody or control of the vehicle.

Any part of the evidence may be received in written form and all testimony of parties and witnesses shall be made under oath. Hearsay evidence may be used for the purpose of supplementing or explaining other evidence but shall not be sufficient in itself to support a finding, unless it would be admissible over objection in civil actions. Any interested party or person may make application and upon good cause shown may be allowed by the hearing officer, in the reasonable exercise of such officer's discretion, to intervene in a pending proceeding. At the conclusion of the hearing, the hearing officer may dismiss the citation or issue an appropriate fine in accordance with this division. All orders shall be in writing and shall be signed and dated by the hearing officer. Such fine may be collected by the city in any manner allowable by law.

Sec. 82-240. - Eligibility and criteria for establishment of controlled parking residential areas. 
(a)  A residentially zoned area shall be deemed eligible for designation as a controlled parking residential area for residential permit parking if parking therein is impacted by commuter vehicles during any hours of any day. 
(b)  The following objective criteria are established to be used in evaluating the need for restricted parking in a residentially zoned area in accordance with this section. For an area, however big or small, to be eligible for residential permit parking, that area must meet the following criteria: 
(1)  During any period of the day, the number of vehicles legally or illegally parked or standing on the streets in the area is equal to 50 percent or more of the legal on-street parking capacity of the area. For purposes of this criterion, a legal parking space shall be 20 linear feet, measured parallel to the curb or pavement edge. 
(2)  During the same period as in subsection (b)(1) of this section, 25 percent or more of the vehicles parking or standing on the streets in the area are not registered in the name of persons residing in the area. For purposes of this criterion, the latest available information from the state department of highway safety and motor vehicles regarding registration of motor vehicles shall be used. 
(3)  In determining whether an area identified as impacted and eligible for residential permit parking shall be designated as a controlled parking residential area, the following factors shall be considered: 
a.  The local needs with respect to clean air and environment in residential areas. 
b.  The possibility of a reduction in total vehicle miles driven in the city. 
c.  The likelihood of alleviating traffic congestion, illegal parking and related health and safety hazards. 
d.  The proximity of public transportation to the residential area. 
e.  The desire and need of the residents for residential permit parking. 
f.  The need for parking regulation to maintain the residential character of the neighborhoods. 
(Code 1983, § 21-49; Ord. No. 84-44, § 4, 9-5-84; Ord. No. 91-10, § 1, 5-7-91)  
Sec. 82-241. - Procedure for determining controlled parking residential areas. 
(a)  ln order to determine whether a particular area should be designated as a controlled parking residential area, the city commission can request or the city manager may conduct, upon his own initiative or upon a petition of a majority of the households on a proposed residential block addressed to the city manager, a study to determine if the proposed area meets the criteria set forth in section 82-240. Following the study, the city manager shall determine whether to designate the proposed area under consideration as a controlled parking residential area or to remove the designation of a previously established controlled parking residential area. The city commission may also request the city manager to designate an area as a controlled parking residential area based upon a study previously conducted, if the criteria set forth in section 82-240 are met. 
(b)  If the city manager finds the criteria to designate have been met in a controlled parking residential area during the hours between 9:00 a.m. and 5:00 p.m., he shall cause the regulation to be recorded upon an appropriate map of the city and retained permanently in the office of the city clerk. If the city manager finds the criteria to designate have been met in a controlled parking residential area between the hours of 5:00 p.m. and 9:00 a.m., the findings shall be submitted to the city commission for approval by resolution, and the city manager shall then cause the regulation to be recorded upon an appropriate map of the city and retained permanently in the office of the city clerk. In addition, the city manager shall cause parking signs to be erected upon public streets in the area, indicating the times, locations and conditions upon which parking shall be by permit only. When an area has been approved, designated and posted as a controlled parking residential area, it shall be unlawful and a violation of this section to park a vehicle in an area restricted to decal parking only, without having a valid residential parking permit displayed according to the administrative regulations.

(b)  The application for a permit shall contain the name of the owner or operator of the motor vehicle; the residential address; and the motor vehicle's make, model and registration number. The motor vehicle's registration may, at the discretion of the police department, be required at the time of making application in order to verify the contents. If the vehicle is registered at an address other than the local residence, the applicant shall provide other sufficient proof, acceptable to the police department, showing residency within the controlled residential parking area. The permit shall be valid for a calendar year and shall be renewed for each successive calendar year. A fee established by resolution of the city commission and listed in appendix A to this Code, payable at the office designated by the city, shall be charged for the annual permit.

A residential parking permit shall not guarantee or reserve to the holder of the permit a parking space within a designated controlled parking residential area. 
(b)  A residential parking permit shall not authorize the holder to stand or park a motor vehicle in such places or during such times as the stopping, standing or parking of a motor vehicle is prohibited or set aside for specified types of vehicles, nor shall it exempt the holder from the observance of any traffic regulation within the controlled parking residential area. 
(c)  No person, other than the permittee named on the permit, shall use the residential parking permit or display it on a vehicle operated or parked, and any such use or display by a person other than the permittee shall constitute a violation of this division by the permittee and by the person who so used or displayed such parking permit.

Sec. 94-74. - Customary use of beaches-intent. 
The intent of this section and of section 94-75 through 94-79 is to determine and confirm as a legislative fact that since time immemorial, the public has enjoyed access to the beaches of St. Pete Beach fronting the Gulf of Mexico and its related waters, and has made recreational use of the beaches; that such use has been ancient, reasonable, without interruption, and free from dispute; and that because of this customary access and use, the public has the right of access to the beach and a right to use the beach for recreation and other customary related purposes. The intent is to mandate that the city define, protect, and enforce the public's customary rights of beach access and use. It is not the intent of the city to affect the title of the owner of land adjacent to the beach, nor to impair the right of any such owner to contest the existence of the customary right of the public to access and use any particular area of privately-owned beach, nor to reduce or limit any rights of public access or use that may exist or arise other than as customary rights. It is therefore declared and affirmed to be the public policy of the city, that the public, individually and collectively, subject to the provisions of this Code, shall have the right to personal ingress and egress to and from the beach and the right to make recreational and other customary uses of the beach. The office of the city attorney shall be authorized to take all steps legally necessary to protect and defend the public right of access and use declared by this Code. Further, it is the intention that customary use shall be an affirmative defense in any proceeding challenging this division.

Sec. 94-76. - Prohibition of obstructions to personal access to the beaches. 
Except as provided for otherwise in this Code or general law, it shall be prohibited for any person to create, erect, or construct any structure, barrier, or restraint, either vegetative or manmade, that will interfere with or obstruct the right of the public, individually and collectively, to enter or leave the beach by way of any approach or to use lawfully any part of the beach for recreation and other customary purposes. 
(Ord. No. 18-07, § 1, 6-26-18)

(Ord. No. 18-07, § 1, 6-26-18)

(Ord. No. 09-04, § 1, 6-11-09)  
Sec. 98-73. - Unsanitary vacant properties declared nuisances; enclosure required; action by city when owner fails to enclose. 
(a)  The city commission finds and determines that there exist within the city numerous vacant lots and lots containing vacant buildings and structures whereon the excessive growth and accumulation of weeds, other plant life, trash and waste occurs in such manner as to cause infestation by rodents and wild animals, the breeding of mosquitoes and vermin and threatens or endangers the public health, or adversely affect and impair the economic welfare of adjacent property. Such properties constitute a public nuisance to the community. 
(b)  The presence of a fence or wall surrounding vacant lots and lots containing vacant buildings and structures is a deterrent to the unauthorized and illegal use of such lots as dumping sites for trash, debris and waste. 
(c)  The requirements set forth in this article are necessary to protect the public health, safety and welfare of the city. 
(1)  Unsanitary vacant properties declared nuisances. The existence of excessive accumulation or untended growth of weeds or either dead or living plant life or any garbage or rubbish upon any vacant lot, tract or parcel of land or any land containing a vacant building or vacant structure and located within 200 feet of the boundary line of any improved property within the city, to the extent and in the manner that such property is or may become infested or inhabited by rodents, vermin or wild animals or may furnish a breeding place for mosquitoes, or threatens or endangers the public health, safety or welfare, or adversely affects and impairs the economic welfare of adjacent property, is hereby prohibited and declared to be a public nuisance. 
(2)  Enclosure required. 
a.  Any vacant building, structure or lot which is not completely enclosed by a wall or a black or green vinyl-coated fence and which is found in violation of this article by the city's special magistrate or county court judge or any such vacant lot which has been cleared by the city due to the owner's failure to comply with lot maintenance requirements of this article on two separate occasions in any two-year period shall be enclosed by its owner by a wall or a black or green vinyl-coated fence to of at least six feet in height. The code inspector shall notify such owner by certified mail when a wall or a black or green vinyl-coated fence is required pursuant to this section, and the owner shall have 45 days from receipt of such notice to cause the wall or a black or green vinyl-coated fence to be erected. 
b.  If an owner believes that the code inspector has erred in determining that enclosure is required, such determination may be appealed to the special magistrate. If the special magistrate determines that enclosure is required, the owner shall have 30 days from the date of such determination to enclose the property. 
c.  Where City Code permits walls or fences to exceed five feet in height, the owner may choose to erect a wall or a black or green vinyl-coated fence exceeding five feet in height in keeping with that code. Walls or fences erected pursuant to this section shall also conform to all other requirements of the Land Development Code, including those pertaining to the type of fencing materials permitted. 
(3)  Action by city when owner fails to enclose. If within 45 days after mailing of the required notice, or if an appeal is requested, within 30 days of the determination of the special magistrate, the required wall or fence has not been erected, the city may cause the subject property to be enclosed by a black or green vinyl-coated five-foot fence at the property owner's expense. Chainlink fence shall be used for this purpose where permitted. 
(4)  Unpaid costs to be secured by lien. The city shall certify the expense incurred by the city in enclosing the subject property whereupon such expenses, together with the applicable administrative fee, shall be billed to the property owner and shall become due and payable within 30 days of the mailing of such bill. Any such bill which has not been paid within the 30-day period shall become a lien upon the property. 
(Ord. No. 09-04, § 1, 6-11-09)  
Sec. 98-74. - Boarding of vacant buildings or dwellings. 
(a)  Findings and purpose. 
(1)  The city commission finds, determines, and declares that buildings which remain vacant and unoccupied for any unreasonable period of time become an attractive nuisance or dangerous condition to children, a harborage for insects, rodents, vermin, or other pests, an invitation to criminals as a temporary abode and as a place to conduct illegal conduct, frequently including illegal drug-related activity, and an increased fire hazard; that unkept and unsecured grounds surrounding such buildings invite the dumping of garbage and trash thereon and the congregation of unauthorized persons who use the property for illegal activity; that such buildings contribute to the growth of blight within the city, depress market values of surrounding properties, thereby reducing tax revenues, necessitate additional governmental services, significantly interfere with the use and enjoyment of neighboring properties, create an unhealthy and unsafe condition affecting the public, and constitute an unreasonable use of property and a public nuisance. 
(2)  The protection of the health, safety, and welfare of the citizens of the city requires the establishment and enforcement of the means by which such nuisance conditions may be prevented and abated. 
(b)  Application. 
(1)  The provisions of this article shall apply generally to all property throughout the city. 
(2)  Provisions of this article are to be supplementary and complementary to all of the provisions of this Code, state law, and any law cognizable in common law or in equity, and nothing in this article shall be read, interpreted, or construed in any manner so as to limit any existing right or power of the city to abate any and all nuisances. 
(c)  Responsibility for property maintenance. Every owner of real property within the city is required to maintain such property in a manner so as not to violate the provisions of this article, and such owner remains liable for violations thereof regardless of any contract or agreement with any third party regarding such property. 
(d)  Nuisances specified. It is declared unlawful and a public nuisance for any owner of any property in the city to maintain such property or to permit such property to be maintained in such a manner that any one or more of the conditions described in the following subsections are found to exist: 
(1)  Any vacant and unoccupied building of which doors, windows, or other openings are broken or missing, so as to allow access to the interior, or boarded and which is not secured in compliance with this article. 
(2)  Any vacant and unoccupied building of which doors, windows, or other openings are secured by boarding, but for which there is no current and valid boarding certificate as required by this article. 
(e)  Certificate required for boarding building. 
(1)  All buildings which are boarded shall require a certificate of boarding be issued by the city. The fee for boarding certificates shall be set by resolution of the city commission. 
(2)  No person shall erect, install, place, or maintain boards over the doors, windows, or other openings of any building or structure or otherwise secure such openings by a means other than the conventional method used in the original construction and design of the building or structure without first applying for and, within 30 days of application, completing all of the steps necessary for the issuance of a boarding certificate, and thereafter having a valid and current boarding certificate issued by the building official. 
(3)  The building official shall issue a boarding certificate required by subsection (1) of this section upon the submission of a written application by the owner of the property or his authorized representative or contractor; upon the payment of the required fee; and upon the confirmation, through inspection by a city inspector, that the boarding or other method of securing the building or structure has been done in compliance with this article. 
(4)  The boarding certificate issued pursuant to this section shall authorize the boarding or other securing of a building or structure for a period of no greater than six months from the date of the issuance. Renewal of the boarding certificate may be granted by the building official after the initial six-month period for an additional six months. The issuance of a renewal boarding certificate shall be subject to all of the following conditions: 
a.  The boarding or other method of securing the building or structure has been done in compliance with this article, as confirmed by a city inspector after inspection of the building or structure by the inspector. 
b.  The owner or his authorized representative or contractor has submitted to the building official, prior to the hearing, a detailed plan for correction, repair, or rehabilitation of violations of state or local building and housing standards and for the securing of the doors, windows, and other openings by the conventional method used in the original construction and design of the building or structure or, alternatively, a detailed plan for sale of the property to another person or entity with provision in the sale of correction, repair, or rehabilitation. 
c.  The owner or his authorized representative or contractor has submitted to the building official, prior to the hearing, a time line for applying for all appropriate permits for such work and for completing such work prior to the expiration of the renewal certificate or, alternatively, a time line for the sale of the property. 
d.  The renewal certificate may be revoked by the building official if the owner fails to comply with the plan for such work or fails to adhere to the submitted time line. 
(5)  A boarding certificate may not be extended beyond the renewal period except upon demonstration that good cause for the renewal exists. Good cause shall require a showing by the owner that the certificate renewal is made necessary by conditions or events beyond the owner's control, such as inability to obtain financing for repair or rehabilitation, inability to locate a suitable buyer, unanticipated delays in construction or rehabilitation, or unanticipated damage to the property. In addition, where appropriate, good cause shall also require a showing by the owner that the owner has exercised reasonable and due diligence in attempting to complete the needed correction, repair, or rehabilitation, or is attempting to sell the property. If the building official determines that there exists good cause to renew the certificate, the certificate may be renewed by the building official for a period of up to, but not more than, an additional six months, subject to all of the same conditions imposed on the original renewal certificate. 
(e)  Standards for securing building. 
(1)  Compliance with city specifications. The boarding of the doors, windows, or other openings of any building or structure, or any means of securing such openings, other than by the conventional method used in the original construction and design of the building or structure, shall comply with the specifications as required by the city. 
(2)  Additional requirements. In connection with the boarding of the doors, windows, or other openings of any building or structure, or any means of securing such openings, other than by the conventional method used in the original construction and design of the building or structure, the owner shall also comply with all of the following requirements: 
a.  All utility service to the building or structure shall be terminated by removal of the meters and termination of electric power at the pole. Compliance with this subsection a. may be waived in writing by the city as to the electric utility service if electricity is needed to power exterior security lighting, an alarm system, or equipment to be used in connection with the rehabilitation of the building or structure for which there is an active and current building permit. 
b.  The sewer shall be capped in a manner approved by the city so as to prevent the accumulation of methane gas in the building or structure. 
c.

(1)  It shall be the duty and responsibility of the building official to enforce this article and to proceed against each and every person found in violation of the requirements of this article. 
(2)  All inspections, regulations and enforcement of violations of the provisions of this article, unless expressly stated to the contrary, shall be under the direction and supervision of the building official. 
(3)  Whenever necessary to make an inspection to enforce any of the provisions of this article, or whenever the building official has reasonable cause to believe that there exists in any building or upon any premises any condition or code violation which makes such building, structure, premises, electrical, gas, mechanical or plumbing systems unsafe, dangerous or hazardous, the building official may enter such building, structure or premises at all lawful times to inspect the same or to perform any duty imposed upon the building official by this article. If such building or premises are occupied, the building official shall first present proper credentials and request entry. If such building, structure, or premises are unoccupied, the building official shall first make a reasonable effort to locate the owner or other persons having charge or control of such and request entry. If entry is refused, the building official shall have recourse to every remedy provided by law to secure entry. 
(4)  When the building official shall have first obtained a proper inspection warrant or other remedy provided by law to secure entry, no owner or occupant or any other persons having charge, care or control of any building, structure, or premises shall fail or neglect, after proper request is made as herein provided, to promptly permit entry therein by the building official for the purpose of inspection and examination pursuant to this article.

DIVISION 1. - GENERALLY 
 
Sec. 98-120.1. - Title. 
These regulations shall be known as the Floodplain Management Ordinance of the City of St. Pete Beach, Florida, hereinafter referred to as "this section." 
(Ord. No. 15-26, § 1, 9-22-15; Ord. No. 18-08, § 2, 2-26-19)  
Sec. 98-120.2. - Scopes. 
The provisions of this section shall apply to all development that is wholly within or partially within any flood hazard area, including but not limited to the subdivision of land; filling, grading, and other site improvements and utility installations; construction, alteration, remodeling, enlargement, improvement, replacement, repair, relocation or demolition of buildings, structures, and facilities that are exempt from the Florida Building Code; placement, installation, or replacement of manufactured homes and manufactured buildings; installation or replacement of tanks; placement of recreational vehicles; installation of swimming pools; and any other development. 
(Ord. No. 15-26, § 1, 9-22-15; Ord. No. 18-08, § 2, 2-26-19)  
Sec. 98-120.3. - Intent and purpose. 
The purpose of this section and the flood load and flood resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code are to establish minimum requirements to safeguard the public health, safety, and general welfare and to minimize public and private losses due to flooding through regulation of development in flood hazard areas to: 
(1)  Minimize unnecessary or prolonged disruption of commerce, access and public service during times of flooding; 
(2)  Require the use of appropriate practices, at the time of initial construction, in order to prevent or minimize future flood damage; 
(3)  Manage filling, grading, dredging, mining, paving, excavation, drilling operations, storage of equipment or materials, and other development which may increase flood damage or erosion potential; 
(4)  Manage the alteration of flood hazard areas, watercourses, and shorelines to minimize the impact of development on the natural and beneficial functions of the floodplain; 
(5)  Minimize damage to public and private facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains, electric, telephone and sewer lines, streets and bridges located in floodplains; 
(6)  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of flood hazard areas in such a manner as to minimize future flood blight areas; 
(7)  Minimize the need for future expenditure of public funds for flood control projects and response to and recovery from flood events; 
(8)  Meet the requirements of the National Flood Insurance Program for community participation as set forth in the Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Section 59.22; 
(9)  Protect human life and health; 
(10)  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
(11)  Ensure that property owners are notified yearly the property is in a flood prone area; 
(12)  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards or which result in damaging increases in erosion or in flood heights or velocities; and 
(13)  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards to other lands. 
(Ord. No. 15-26, § 1, 9-22-15; Ord. No. 18-08, § 2, 2-26-19)  
Sec. 98-120.4. - Findings of fact. 
(a)  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life; loss of property; health and safety hazards; disruption of commerce and governmental services; extraordinary public expenditure for flood protection and relief; and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
(b)  These flood losses are caused by the cumulative effect of obstructions in floodplains, causing increases in flood heights and velocities, and by the occupancy of flood hazard areas by uses vulnerable to floods or hazardous to other lands, which are inadequately elevated, flood proofed or otherwise protected from flood damage. 
(Ord. No. 15-26, § 1, 9-22-15; Ord. No. 18-08, § 2, 2-26-19)  
Sec. 98-120.5. - Coordination with the Florida Building Code. 
This section is intended to be administered and enforced in conjunction with the Florida Building Code. Where cited, ASCE 24 refers to the edition of the standard that is referenced by the Florida Building Code. 
(Ord. No. 15-26, § 1, 9-22-15; Ord. No. 18-08, § 2, 2-26-19)  
Sec. 98-120.6. - Warning. 
The degree of flood protection required by this section and the Florida Building Code is considered the minimum reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This section does not imply that land outside of mapped special flood hazard areas, or that uses permitted within such flood hazard areas, will be free from flooding or flood damage. The flood hazard areas and base flood elevations contained in the Flood Insurance Study and shown on Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRM) and the requirements of Title 44 Code of Federal Regulations, Sections 59 and 60 may be revised by the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), requiring the city to revise these regulations to remain eligible for participation in the National Flood Insurance Program. No guaranty of vested use, existing use, or future use is implied or expressed by compliance with this section. 
(Ord. No. 15-26, § 1, 9-22-15; Ord. No. 18-08, § 2, 2-26-19)  
Sec. 98-120.7. - Disclaimer of liability. 
This section shall not create liability on the part of the city, its officers, agents, elected or appointed officials or employees thereof for any flood damage that results from reliance on this section or any administrative decision lawfully made thereunder. 
(Ord. No. 15-26, § 1, 9-22-15; Ord. No. 18-08, § 2, 2-26-19)

(2)  Review all applications for modification of any existing development in flood hazard areas for compliance with the requirements of this section; 
(3)  Interpret flood hazard area boundaries where such interpretation is necessary to determine the exact location of boundaries and a person contesting the determination shall have the opportunity to appeal the interpretation; 
(4)  When interpretation is needed as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard (for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions), the floodplain administrator shall make the necessary interpretation; 
(5)  Provide available flood elevation and flood hazard information; 
(6)  Determine whether additional flood hazard data shall be obtained from other sources or shall be developed by an applicant; 
(7)  Review all applications to determine whether proposed development will be reasonably safe from flooding; 
(8)  Issue floodplain development permits or approvals for development other than buildings and structures that are subject to the Florida Building Code, including buildings, structures and facilities exempt from the Florida Building Code, when compliance with this section is demonstrated, or disapprove the same in the event of noncompliance; 
(9)  Coordinate with and provide comments to the Building Department employees to assure that applications, plan reviews, and inspections for buildings and structures in flood hazard areas comply with the applicable provisions of this section; 
(10)  Review all applications for permits to ensure that the permit requirements of this section have been satisfied; 
(11)  Advise applicant that additional federal and state permits may be required and ensure that all required state and federal permits have been received. The floodplain administrator shall require that copies of such permits be provided and maintained on file with the city permit.

Sec. 98-122.4. - Substantial improvement and substantial damage determinations. 
For applications for building permits to improve buildings and structures, including alterations, movement, enlargement, replacement, repair, change of occupancy, additions, rehabilitations, renovations, substantial improvements, repairs of substantial damage, and any other improvement of or work on such buildings and structures, the floodplain administrator shall: 
(1)  Require the applicant to obtain an appraisal of the current market value prepared by a qualified independent appraiser, of the building or structure before the start of construction of the proposed work; in the case of repair, the market value of the building or structure shall be the market value before the damage occurred and before any repairs are made; 
(2)  Compare the cost to perform the improvement, the cost to repair a damaged building to its pre-damaged condition, or the combined costs of improvements and repairs, if applicable, to the market value of the building or structure; 
(3)  Determine and document whether the proposed work constitutes substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage; and 
(4)  Notify the applicant if it is determined that the work constitutes substantial improvement or repair of substantial damage and that compliance with the flood resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code and this section is required. 
For the purpose of making this determination, the cost to perform the improvements and the cost to perform the repairs shall not be cumulative from project to project. Costs of improvements and costs of repairs shall include all costs attributed to a project and shall be determined: 
(1)  By submission of a detailed cost estimate by a licensed contractor, provided such estimate includes all work required to complete the work described in the permit application; 
(2)  By submission of a summation of the prevailing market cost for all materials and labor including all expenses normally charged or incurred if the work were performed by a contractor (e.g., construction supervision and management, insurance, overhead and profit, demolition, etc.); or 
(3)  By the floodplain administrator if the applicant's submission and supporting data do not, in the opinion of the floodplain administrator, reasonably reflect the actual project cost; alternatively, the floodplain administrator may require submission of another estimate. If determined by the floodplain administrator the floodplain administrator may use (a) the most recent (at the start of construction) square foot valuation data for this area published by the International Code Council; (b) an estimated cost using current prices provided by Marshall and Swift; or (c) the replacement cost less the depreciation costs (at the start of construction) identified in a certified appraisal less than 12 months old.

Sec. 98-126.8. - Conditions for issuance of variances. 
After consideration of the factors listed above and the purposes of this section variances shall be granted by the board or city commission only upon: 
(1)  Submission by the applicant, of a showing of good and sufficient cause that the unique characteristics of the size, configuration, or topography of the site limit compliance with any provision of this section or the required elevation standards; 
(2)  Determination by the board or city commission that: 
a.  Failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional hardship, based on the considerations set forth for issuance of a variance, due to the physical characteristics of the land that render the lot undevelopable; increased costs to satisfy the requirements or inconvenience do not constitute hardship; and 
b.  The granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, extraordinary public expense, nor create nuisances, cause fraud on or victimization of the public or conflict with existing laws and ordinances; and 
c.  The variance is the minimum necessary, considering the flood hazard, to afford relief; and 
d.  The variance receives the affirmative vote of at least a majority of the board or city commission; and 
e.  No variance shall be granted for development which was constructed without a permit, or beyond the scope of a permit, unless it meets the considerations set forth for the issuance of a variance and receives the affirmative vote of a super-majority of the board or city commission. 
(3)  No variance, if granted, shall be effective until a copy of the variance with the name of the owner and the legal description of the property is recorded in the office of the clerk of the court so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land; and 
(4)  If the request is for a variance to allow construction of the lowest floor of a new building, or substantial improvement of a building, below the required elevation, a copy in the record of a written notice from the floodplain administrator to the applicant for the variance, specifying the difference between the base flood elevation and the proposed elevation of the lowest floor, stating that the cost of federal flood insurance will be commensurate with the increased risk resulting from the reduced floor elevation and stating that construction below the base flood elevation increases risks to life and property. The application shall provide notice to, and each application shall acknowledge that, the granting of a variance will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance (in some cases amounts as high as $25.00 for $100.00 of insurance coverage or increases of 100 percent or greater) and construction pursuant to the variance increases risks to life and property.

Project means any work done for which a permit is required during the time period from when the work begins until the permit is closed and shall include all work and permits necessary to make a structure safe to be occupied. A permit may be closed by issuance of a certificate of occupancy or an approved final inspection. 
Recreational vehicle means a vehicle, including a park trailer, which is: [See F.S. § 320.01]. 
(1)  Built on a single chassis; 
(2)  Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection;

Standard single exterior door means a movable barrier used to seal or close-off entry to a building which is constructed of wood, metal or glass, not more than 36 inches wide and that swings on hinges. 
Standard double exterior door means a movable barrier used to seal or close-off entry to a building which is constructed of wood, metal or glass, not more than 76 inches wide and that swings on hinges. 
Start of construction means the date the building permit was issued, for either new construction or substantial improvements, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement occurred within 180 days of the date the permit was issued. The actual start of construction means either the first placement of permanent construction of a building on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation (such as clearing, grading, or filling), the installation of streets or walkways, excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations, the erection of temporary forms or the installation of accessory buildings such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main buildings. For a substantial improvement, the actual "start of construction" means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
Substantial damage means damage of any origin sustained by a building or structure whereby the cost of restoring the building or structure to its before-damaged condition would be equal to or exceed 50 percent of the market value of the building or structure before the damage occurred. 
Substantial improvement means any repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other improvement of a building or structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds 50 percent of the market value of the building or structure before the improvement or repair is started. If the structure has incurred "substantial damage," any repairs are considered substantial improvement regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
(1)  Any project for improvement of a building required to correct existing health, sanitary, or safety code violations identified by the building official and that are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions. 
(2)  Any alteration of a historic structure provided the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as a historic structure. 
Variance means a grant of relief from the requirements of this section, or the flood resistant construction requirements of the Florida Building Code, which permits construction in a manner that would not otherwise be permitted by this section or the Florida Building Code. 
Watercourse means a river, creek, stream, channel or other topographic feature in, on, through, or over which water flows at least periodically.

DIVISION 2. - DRAINAGE PLAN 
 
Sec. 106-51. - Violations; maintenance; restoration. 
(a)  Any person who commences or conducts an activity described in sections 106-28 and 106-52 through 106-59 without prior approval of a drainage plan, deviates from an approved drainage plan or fails to maintain drainage facilities under the person's ownership or control shall be guilty of a violation of this article. The city may act to maintain such drainage facilities if the lack of maintenance constitutes a public nuisance. The cost of such maintenance shall then become a lien on the property on which the facilities are located. 
(b)  Any activity undertaken in violation of this article shall be halted immediately after written notice by the city. The violator may be required to restore any altered land to its undisturbed condition or restore it to such condition in which it would not shed stormwater in violation of the control requirements for stormwater runoff contained in this article. If restoration is not undertaken within a reasonable time and the alteration constitutes a public nuisance, the city may act to restore the property. The cost of the restoration shall then become a lien upon the property where such illegal activity occurred. 
(c)  The city shall follow the procedure set forth in chapter 46 in restoring property or maintaining drainage facilities and placing a lien on the property. 
(d)  If a pond or other water body is entirely surrounded by private property so that the general public does not have access to use and enjoy the water body, maintenance of such ponds or other water bodies shall be accomplished by the city only with respect to drainage as part of the overall drainage system of the city. If a public nuisance should be created as the result of a lack of maintenance of such pond or other water body, where it is entirely surrounded by private property owners, the city may carry out necessary maintenance and charge the cost of such maintenance to the abutting property owners. The city shall follow the procedure set forth in chapter 46 in maintaining such pond or water body and placing a lien on the property. 
(e)  For the purposes of this article it shall be conclusively presumed that a nuisance exists when one or more of the following conditions exist: 
(1)  Drainage facilities are not maintained properly so that as a result water has flooded or is reasonably likely to flood land not owned by the owner of the land on which the drainage facilities are located or water has flooded or is reasonably likely to flood a building whether or not located on land owned by the owner of the drainage facilities. 
(2)  Activity has been undertaken in violation of this article and as a result water has flooded or is reasonably likely to flood land not owned by the owner of the land on which the unlawful activity has taken place or a building or part thereof, whether or not located on land owned by the owner of the land on which the unlawful activity has taken place. 
(3)  A pond or other water body entirely surrounded by private property has not been properly maintained and as a result water has flooded or is reasonably likely to flood land other than that owned by the owners of land directly abutting such pond or water body or a building or part thereof, whether or not located on land owned by the owner of land directly abutting such pond or body of water.

Sec. 106-52. - Approval required prior to development; submission of plan. 
(a)  Prior to development or grading and land balancing of any land specified in this division, approval of a drainage plan shall be obtained from the city engineer. The city engineer shall not be required to approve such a plan until site plan approval and, as required, plat approval has been obtained. Issuance of this approval is contingent upon the requirements of this article. 
(b)  The developer shall submit to the department of planning and development two copies of a drainage plan prepared by a professional engineer. At the time of the submission of a drainage plan, the applicant shall pay the city a filing fee as established by resolution of the city commission and listed in the fee schedule in appendix A to this Code. 
(Ord. No. 81-48, § 3; Code 1983, § 7-3(b)(1); Ord. No. 97-14, § 1(7-3(b)(1)), 5-20-97)  
Sec. 106-53. - Information required. 
(a)  The drainage plan shall provide an up-to-date survey of the proposed land to be developed, redeveloped or graded and land balanced showing the number and location of existing trees; adequate elevations or contours to determine the existing and proposed drainage patterns; and all ditches, canals, streams, storm sewers and all other key topographic features located within or directly adjacent to or serving the land to be developed or cleared. The calculations for runoff, detention and pipe sizes shall be submitted. The department may require such additional information as deemed necessary to determine if the plan meets the requirements of this article.

(4)  There shall be no fill used as structural support higher than 16 inches above the crown in the road with the exception that the interior of stemwall construction may be filled. Noncompacted fill may be used around the perimeter of a building for landscaping or aesthetic purposes provided the fill has the ability to wash out during storm surge, thereby rendering the building free of obstruction prior to generating excessive loading forces, ramping effects, or wave deflection. The building official shall approve design plans for landscaping or aesthetic fill only after the applicant has provided an analysis by a certified engineer, architect, or soil scientists, which demonstrates that the following factors have been fully considered: 
a.  Particle composition of fill material does not have a tendency for excessive natural compaction; 
b.  Volume and distribution of fill will not cause wave defection to adjacent properties; and 
c.  Slope of fill will not cause wave run-up or ramping. 
(Ord. No. 81-48, § 3; Code 1983, § 7-3(b)(3); Ord. No. 97-14, § 1(7-3(b)(3)), 5-20-97; Ord. No. 99-53, § 1, 9-21-99; Ord. No. 00-35, § 1, 8-1-00)

Removal and replacement of impervious surface cover with a permeable cover shall be credited towards the minor addition, alteration or improvement thresholds set forth in this section. Such credit shall be subtracted as a square footage or dollar amount, whichever is applicable, prior to calculation of the appropriate threshold percentages. 
(Ord. No. 81-48, § 3; Code 1983, § 7-3(b)(4); Ord. No. 97-14, § 1(7-3(b)(4)), 5-20-97)  
Sec. 106-56. - Fee payment in lieu of drainage improvements. 
Some existing developments undergoing additions, alterations or improvements which exceed the thresholds described in section 106-55 may be permitted to pay a fee in lieu of installing drainage improvements when it is determined by the city that the requirements of this article are impractical or impossible to construct on the site. All such determinations shall be made on a case-by-case basis. The amount of the fee shall be based on an amount per square foot of the entire site, such amount to be established by resolution of the city commission and is listed in appendix A to this Code. Moneys collected under this section shall be used by the city to make upgrades, improvements and extensions of the existing drainage system. In no case shall this provision be permitted where the intent of this article can be met. 
(Ord. No. 97-14, § 1(7-3(b)(5)), 5-20-97)  
Sec. 106-57. - Review. 
The drainage plan will be reviewed by the department within 60 days of receipt unless other reviews required by ordinance require more time, in which case the time shall extend 60 days beyond completion of such review. If the drainage plan is in compliance with the requirements of this Code and this article, approval shall be issued. 
(Ord. No. 81-48, § 3; Code 1983, § 7-3(c); Ord. No. 97-14, § 1(7-3(c)), 5-20-97)  
Sec. 106-58. - Inspection of improvements. 
Upon completion of improvements under this article, the city engineer shall inspect the site for compliance with the approved plan. A certificate of compliance must be issued by the inspection officer before a certificate of occupancy can be issued for any related structure or before any paved access (curb cuts) to public streets from the site may be granted. If the application is for grading and land balancing only and no structure or paving is specified, a certificate of compliance must be issued if a financial guarantee acceptable in form to the city attorney and in the amount approved by the city manager is provided. 
(Ord. No. 81-48, § 3; Code 1983, § 7-3(d); Ord. No. 97-14, § 1(7-3(d)), 5-20-97)  
Sec. 106-59. - Approval criteria and procedures. 
(a)  Drainage plans shall be approved only if they demonstrate that the proposed development or grading and land balancing has been planned and designed and will be constructed and maintained to meet the standards in this section. 
(b)  No development or redevelopment of a site shall cause the rate of stormwater discharge to be released from the post-developed site to exceed the rate of stormwater discharge of the predeveloped site. Additional stormwater discharge created by the development or redevelopment of the site shall be retained on-site and released at a rate no greater than the rate of the predeveloped site. 
(c)  If there is an absence of data to adequately determine the "natural unimproved state," such as a redevelopment project, the existing runoff discharge may be calculated using a runoff coefficient of 0.3. 
(d)  The proposed development or grading and land balancing shall not allow erosion or flooding to effect any significant damage to adjacent areas during or after construction. 
(e)  In determining runoff, pipe sizes, detention requirements, etc., for the site to be developed, the following criteria and methods shall be used: 
(1)  Criteria for calculating stormwater runoff. 
a.  The maximum rate of runoff released from a site and the required retention volume shall be calculated using the rational formula as follows: 
Q = Cia 
Where: 
Q 	is the rate of runoff in cubic feet per second; 
C 	is the coefficient of runoff; 
i 	is the intensity of rainfall in inches per hour, pursuant to the current state department of transportation rainfall intensity curves for zone VI, using a ten-year, one-hour design storm; and 
a 	is the drainage areas in acres. 
 
Other formulas, where appropriate, as described in the Basis for Review for Surface Water Management Applications within the Southwest Florida Water Management District, may be used when such other formulas are acceptable to the city engineer. 
b.  The coefficient of runoff shall be determined by the type of existing and future development, the soil characteristics and the topography of the land. The following table listing the general ranges shall be used, subject to variation in accordance with generally accepted scientific principles: 
Lawns: 	
	Sandy soil, flat (2% slope) 	0.100.15 
	Sandy soil, average (2%7% slope) 	0.150.20 
	Clayey soil, flat (2% slope) 	0.140.20 
	Clayey soil, average (2%7% slope) 	0.200.30 
Commercial: 	
	Downtown areas 	0.700.95 
	Neighborhood areas 	0.500.70

Chapter 131 - WIRELESS COMMUNICATION TOWERS AND ANTENNAS 
 
Sec. 131-1. - Purpose. 
The purpose of this chapter is to establish general guidelines for the siting of wireless communications towers and antennas to accomplish the following objectives: 
 Protection of residential areas and land uses from potential adverse impacts of towers and antennas; 
 To encourage the location of towers in non-residential areas; 
 To minimize the total number of towers throughout the community; 
 To strongly encourage the joint use of new and existing tower sites as a primary option rather than construction of additional single-use towers; 
 To encourage users of towers and antennas to locate them, to the extent possible, in areas where the adverse impact on the community is minimal; 
 To encourage users of towers and antennas to configure them in a way that minimizes the adverse visual impact of the towers and antennas through careful design, siting, landscape screening, and innovative camouflaging techniques; 
 To enhance the ability of the providers of telecommunications services to provide such services to the community quickly, effectively, and efficiently; 
 To consider the public health and safety of communication towers; and 
 To avoid potential damage to adjacent properties from tower failure through engineering and careful siting of tower structures. 
In furtherance of these objectives, City of St. Pete Beach shall give due consideration to the comprehensive plan, zoning map, existing land uses, and environmentally sensitive areas in approving sites for the location of towers and antennas. 
(Ord. No. 97-18, § 1, 7-15-97)

The wireless provider may accept the rates, fees, and terms established under this subsection for small wireless facilities and utility poles that are the subject of an application submitted after the rates, fees, and terms become effective. 
e.  A person owning or controlling an authority utility pole shall offer rates, fees, and other terms that comply with this subsection. By the later of January 1, 2018, or three months after receiving a request to collocate its first small wireless facility on a utility pole owned or controlled by the authority, the person owning or controlling the authority utility pole shall make available the rates, fees, and terms for the collocation of small wireless facilities on the authority utility pole which comply with this subsection. 
1.  The rates, fees, and terms must be nondiscriminatory and competitively neutral and must comply with this subsection. 
2.  For an authority utility pole that supports an aerial facility used to provide communications services or electric service, the parties shall comply with the process for make-ready work under 47 U.S.C. s. 224 and implementing regulations. The good faith estimates of the person owning or controlling the pole for any make-ready work necessary to enable the pole to support the requested collocation must include pole replacement if necessary. 
3.  For an authority utility pole that does not support an aerial facility used to provide communications services or electric service, the authority shall provide a good faith estimate for any make-ready work necessary to enable the pole to support the requested collocation, including necessary pole replacement, within 60 days after written acceptance of the good faith estimate by the applicant. Alternatively, the authority may require the applicant seeking to collocate a small wireless facility to provide a make-ready estimate at the applicant's expense for the work necessary to support the small wireless facility, including pole replacement, and perform the make-ready work. If pole replacement is required, the scope of the make-ready estimate is limited to the design, fabrication, and installation of a utility pole that is substantially similar in color and composition. The authority may not condition or restrict the manner in which the applicant obtains, develops, or provides the estimate or conducts the make ready work subject to usual construction restoration standards for work in the city rights-of-way. The replaced or altered utility pole shall remain the property of the authority. 
4.  An authority may not require more make-ready work than is required to meet applicable code or industry standards. Fees for make-ready work may not include costs related to preexisting damage or prior noncompliance. Fees for make-ready work, including any pole replacement, may not exceed actual costs or the amount charged to communications services providers other than wireless services providers for similar work and may not include any consultant fee or expense.

PREFACE 
    This volume constitutes a publication of the Land Development Regulations of the City of St. Pete Beach, Florida. 
    Source material used in the preparation of this publication of the Land Development Regulations was Ordinance Number 03-7, as amended. The source of each section is included in the history note appearing in parentheses at the end thereof. By use of the comparative tables appearing in the back of this Code, the reader can locate any ordinance included in this volume. 
Page Numbering System 
    The page numbering system used in this Code is a prefix system. The letters to the left of the colon are an abbreviation which represents a certain portion of the volume. The number to the right of the colon represents the number of the page in that portion. In the case of a chapter of the Code, the number to the left of the colon indicates the number of the chapter. 
Index 
    The index has been prepared with the greatest of care. Each particular item has been placed under several headings, some of which are couched in lay phraseology, others in legal terminology, and still others in language generally used by local government officials and employees. There are numerous cross references within the index itself which stand as guideposts to direct the user to the particular item in which the user is interested. 
Looseleaf Supplements 
    A special feature of this publication is the looseleaf system of binding and supplemental servicing of the publication. With this system, the publication will be kept up-to-date. Subsequent amendatory legislation will be properly edited, and the affected page or pages will be reprinted. These new pages will be distributed to holders of copies of the publication, with instructions for the manner of inserting the new pages and deleting the obsolete pages. 
    Keeping this publication up-to-date at all times will depend largely upon the holder of the publication. As revised pages are received, it will then become the responsibility of the holder to have the amendments inserted according to the attached instructions. It is strongly recommended by the publisher that all such amendments be inserted immediately upon receipt to avoid misplacing them and, in addition, that all deleted pages be saved and filed for historical reference purposes.

DIVISION 1 - INTRODUCTION 

Sec. 1.1. - Title and purpose. 
    This ordinance shall be known as the "Land Development Code." The provisions of this Land Development Code shall be held to be the minimum requirements for the promotion of the public safety, health, convenience, comfort, morals, prosperity and general welfare. 
    The purpose of the Land Development Code is to promote the orderly and efficient development of the City of St. Pete Beach, in accordance with the goals, objectives and policies of the Comprehensive Plan; to secure safety from fire, panic and other dangers; to promote health and the general welfare; to provide adequate light and air; promote or enhance aesthetics; to prevent the overcrowding of land; to avoid undue concentration of population; to protect natural and historic resources; and to facilitate adequate and concurrent provision of transportation, water, sewerage, parks and other public improvements, facilities and services. 
    These regulations have been made with reasonable consideration, among many things, as to the character of the districts hereinafter provided for, and their peculiar suitability for particular uses, and with a view to conserving the value of buildings and encouraging the most appropriate use of land, air and water throughout the city, consistent with the goals, objectives and policies of the Comprehensive Plan. 
(Ord. No. 03-7, § 3, 5-1-03) 
Sec. 1.2. - Rules of construction. 
    For the purposes of these regulations, the following rules of construction shall apply: 
(a)  These regulations shall be construed to achieve the purposes and intent for which they are adopted. 
(b)  In case of a conflict between the text of these regulations and any caption, figure, illustration, table, or map, the text of these regulations shall control. In case of a conflict between a chart and an illustration, the chart shall control. All illustrations included in these regulations are for illustrative purposes only. 
(c)  In case of any conflict in limitations, restrictions, or standards applying to an individual use or structure, the more restrictive provisions shall apply. 
(d)  The words "shall," "must," and "will," are mandatory in nature, implying an obligation or duty to comply with the particular provision. 
(e)  The word "may" is permissive in nature. 
(f)  Words used in the present tense include the future tense. 
(g)  Words used in the singular number include the plural number and the plural number includes the singular number, unless the context of the particular usage clearly indicates otherwise. 
(h)  Words used in the masculine gender include the feminine gender. 
(i)  Any act authorized by these regulations to be carried out by a specific official or agency of the city is impliedly authorized to be carried out by a designee of such official or agency. Any transfer of duties to a different official impliedly transfers the authority to carry out acts under these regulations. 
(j)  The time within which an act is to be done shall be computed by excluding the first and including the last day; if the last day is a Saturday, Sunday or a legal holiday, that day shall be excluded. 
(k)  Any words and terms not defined herein shall have the meaning indicated by common dictionary definition. 
(l)  Any reference to Florida Statutes shall be construed to be a reference to the most recent enactment of such statute, and shall include any amendments as may from time to time be adopted. 
(Ord. No. 03-7, § 3, 5-1-03) 
Sec. 1.3. - Purposes and matters regulated; application of regulations; schedule of district regulations. 
(a)  Purposes. The regulations and restrictions herein prescribed are in furtherance of the general purposes set forth in section 1.1 and have the objectives of: 
(1)  Reducing, or eliminating, elements of present and future harmful incompatibility between uses permitted in the same district or neighboring districts; 
(2)  Segregating uses which cannot be made reasonably compatible into separate districts; and 
(3)  Encouraging and promoting proper, orderly and efficient development of land according to the needs of the general public, as set forth in the goals, objectives and policies of the Comprehensive Plan. 
(b)  Matters regulated. Matters regulated include, but are not limited to: 
(1)  Use of land and water for residential, commercial and other uses; 
(2)  Size of lots, yards and other spaces; 
(3)  Maximum coverage of lots by buildings and other structures and uses; 
(4)  Height, size, location, erection and construction, reconstruction, alteration and use of buildings and other structures; 
(5)  Density of population and intensity of uses; 
(6)  Provision of public facilities and services concurrent with the impacts of development; and 
(7)  Protection of natural and historic resources. 
(c)  Application of regulations. Except as hereinafter provided, no structure shall be erected, converted, enlarged, reconstructed or structurally altered, nor shall any structure or land be used or occupied which does not comply with all the regulations established by this ordinance for the district in which the building or land is located. No part of a yard, other open space, parking or loading space required for a building or use for the purpose of complying with the provisions of this ordinance shall be included as part of a yard, open space, parking or loading space similarly required for another building or use. 
    No building or use shall be relocated from one zoning lot to another or relocated to another location on the same zoning lot unless such building, structure or use shall thereafter conform to all of the applicable provisions of this ordinance and the provisions of Chapter 98 - Buildings and Building Regulations, of the St. Pete Beach Code of Ordinances. 
    In no case shall there be more than one main structure and the customary accessory structures on one lot when single-family residential is the principal use of the lot. No yard, or lot, now existing, or hereinafter created, shall be reduced in dimensions or area below the minimum requirements herein for the district in which it is located. No structure shall be erected on a lot heretofore or hereinafter reduced below minimum dimensions or area required by law, nor shall such lot be offered for sale or sold, except to used in such combination with adjacent lots as will produce conformity with the requirements of this ordinance, provided, however, this requirement shall not apply to a lot which was of record, either by plat or by deed describing the lot by metes and bounds or otherwise, in the office of the Clerk of the Circuit Court, Pinellas County, Florida, on August 1, 1972, being the date of final adoption of Ordinance 200 containing similar provisions. 
    Within each district, the regulations set forth herein shall be minimum regulations and shall apply to each class or kind of building or land. The regulations may specify the uses permitted, the uses permissible as conditional uses provided that reasonable requirements of a special nature are met to reduce or eliminate harmful incompatibility, the off-street parking and loading requirements for each use, and identify the uses or characteristics of uses that are prohibited. 
(d)  Calculation of residential and transient accommodation densities. Maximum residential and transient accommodation densities within the applicable zoning district regulations, when calculated by multiplying the lot area by the number of units per acre permitted results in any fractional unit, are always rounded downward to the next whole number. This provision shall not be subject to any variance granting authority provided elsewhere within the St. Pete Beach Code of Ordinances. 
(e)  Schedule of district regulations. Except for regulations applying to more than one zoning district which appear in the supplemental regulations herein and elsewhere, regulations for the individual districts appear in the specific district regulations divisions. 
(Ord. No. 03-7, § 3, 5-1-03) 
Sec. 1.4. - Conflicts with other ordinances, covenants or agreements. 
    Wherever higher or more restrictive standards are established by the provisions of any other applicable statute, ordinance or regulation than are established by the provisions of this ordinance, those regulations shall govern. This ordinance is not intended to interfere with, abrogate or annul any easement, covenant or other agreements between parties, except that if this ordinance imposes greater restriction, this ordinance shall control. 
(Ord. No. 03-7, § 3, 5-1-03) 
Sec. 1.5. - Severability. 
    Should any section or provision of this Land Development Code be declared by a court of competent jurisdiction to be unconstitutional or invalid, such decision shall not affect the validity of these regulations as a whole or any part thereof other than the part so declared to be unconstitutional or invalid. 
(Ord. No. 03-7, § 3, 5-1-03) 
Sec. 1.6. - Effective date. 
    This ordinance shall become effective immediately upon its final adoption. 
(Ord. No. 03-7, § 3, 5-1-03) 
Sec. 1.7. - Official zoning map adopted. 
    The Official Zoning Map of the City of St. Pete Beach, Florida, and incorporated herein by reference, is hereby adopted as part of this ordinance and shall be maintained in the office of the city clerk and not henceforth reproduced as part of this ordinance. A copy of the official zoning map may be purchased. 
(Ord. No. 03-7, § 3, 5-1-03) 
Sec. 1.8. - Transitional rules. 
(a)  Transition period. Where a complete application for development approval is pending on the effective date of these regulations, the provisions of the regulations in effect when the application was filed shall govern the review and approval of the application for development approval. If such application is approved within six months of the date of adoption of these regulations, then the applicant shall be entitled to complete the development, provided that construction begins within six months of the issuance of such approval and is diligently pursued to completion. For the purposes of this section, "diligently pursued" shall mean that following the commencement of construction, there shall be ongoing construction activity to completion with no periods of inactivity exceeding 14 consecutive days. 
(b)  Existing unlawful uses and structures. A nonconforming structure or use lawfully existing, pursuant to the prior ordinance, at the time of the adoption of these regulations is hereby deemed lawful as of that date only if it conforms with all of the requirements of these regulations. However, if such structure or use does not conform with all of the requirements of these regulations, then such structure or use remains nonconforming hereunder. 
(c)  Existing permitted uses.

Sec. 3.8. - Administration and enforcement of performance standards. 
(a)  Intent concerning determinations involved in administration of performance standards. Determinations necessary for administration and enforcement of performance standards range from those which can be made by a reasonable person using normal senses and no equipment to those which require high technical competence and complex equipment. 
(1)  Where determination can reasonably be expected to be made by the city manager, using equipment normally available to the city or obtainable without extraordinary expense, such determinations shall be so made before notice of violation is issued.

(1)  Application requirements. 
a.  Map amendments rezoning individual properties may be initiated by the owner of property involved, a non-owner with the written permission of such property owner, the city commission, the appropriate board of authority, or the city manager. Any such application for a zoning map change shall be accompanied by the information necessary to demonstrate that the proposed rezoning is consistent with the criteria set forth in paragraph (5) below. 
b.  An application may be accompanied by an offer to the city to impose special conditions (proffers) upon the development of the property that is the subject matter of the application. 
c.  At the request of an applicant for a rezoning, a site plan may be processed concurrently with the rezoning application, pursuant to Division 5 of this Code. 
(2)  Staff review and recommendations. The city manager shall review the application for the rezoning, and the comments of all appropriate departments of the city, and shall prepare a written staff analysis of the issues raised by the application. Such analysis shall set forth a recommended zoning district classification, if any, and evaluate the goals, policies and objectives of the comprehensive plan affected by the proposed rezoning. 
(3)  Planning board review. The planning board shall conduct a public hearing to review the proposed rezoning, and shall consider the written staff analysis and the testimony at the public hearing, and make a recommendation upon the proposed rezoning, setting forth its findings in regard to whether the proposed rezoning will satisfy the standards set forth in paragraph (5) below, and its findings in regard to whether the rezoning is consistent with comprehensive plan. The planning board may include in its recommendation any modifications or conditions to the rezoning, and the reasons therefor. 
(4)  City commission review. The city commission shall review the proposed rezoning, the written staff analysis and the recommendation of the appropriate board of authority, and shall approve, approve with conditions or deny the rezoning and site plan, if any, after a public hearing. Action taken by the city commission to approve a rezoning with conditions shall be documented in the form of an ordinance which rezones the subject property and shall state with specificity any conditions imposed by the city commission. 
(5)  Standards for review. In reviewing the application for a rezoning, the staff, the planning board and the city commission shall consider whether the proposed rezoning is consistent with and furthers the goals, policies and action strategies of the comprehensive plan. 
In addition, the planning board and city commission shall consider the following: 
a.  Whether the proposed change would be contrary to the land use plan and would have an adverse effect on the plan. The planning board and city commission shall review the request considering the most intense use permitted in the requested zone district; 
b.  Compatibility with adjacent properties and the existing land use pattern; 
c.  Possible creation of an isolated district unrelated to adjacent and nearby districts; 
d.  The population density pattern and increase in demand for public utilities or services, including potable water supply, sanitary sewer capacity, law enforcement or fire suppression; 
e.  Any increase in use of city infrastructure, including stormwater management facilities, streets and roads, water lines, sewer lines or lift stations; 
f.  Whether existing district boundaries are logically drawn in relation to existing conditions on the property proposed for change; 
g.  Whether changed or changing conditions make the passage of the proposed amendment necessary; 
h.  Whether the proposed change will adversely affect drainage. 
i.  Whether the proposed change will be a deterrent to the improvement or development of adjacent property in accordance with existing regulations; 
j.  Whether the proposed change will constitute a grant of special privileges to an individual owner as contrasted with the public welfare; and 
k.  Whether the change suggested is out of scale with the needs of the neighborhood or the city. 
(6)  Effect of decision. 
a.  The ordinance which rezones the subject property shall state with specificity any conditions imposed by the city commission, and no building permit pertaining to the rezoned property shall be issued for construction which does not conform to any site plan finally approved by the city commission as part of the rezoning. 
b.  In the event that any conditions require the execution of an appropriate legal document by the applicant, the applicant shall be required to execute same prior to issuance of a building permit. When appropriate, fully executed documents may be attached to the ordinance as exhibits. 
(7)  Changes to rezonings. 
a.  A modification to any previously approved rezoning shall be processed in the same manner as the original application. Revisions to site plans proffered as part of a rezoning application, other than revisions determined to be minor pursuant to this Code, shall require the submission of an amended site plan and city commission adoption of an ordinance amending the initial rezoning ordinance to reflect approval of the amended site plan. 
b.  In the event a site plan approved as a condition of a rezoning application expires, any new site plan shall be submitted to the city and adoption of a new ordinance amending the initial rezoning ordinance to reflect approval of a new site plan shall be required. 
(8)  Expiration of approval. An ordinance rezoning property shall have no expiration date, unless otherwise specified in the approval. 
(c)  Amendments to this Code. Amendments to this Code may be initiated by the city commission, any board appointed by the city commission, or the city manager. An application for a text amendment shall be accompanied by justification necessary to support the amendment. 
    In reviewing the application for a text amendment, the appropriate board of authority and the city commission shall consider whether the proposed amendment is consistent with and furthers the goals, policies and objectives of the comprehensive plan and whether the proposed change will further the purposes of this Code and other city ordinances, regulations and actions designed to implement the comprehensive plan. The appropriate board of authority shall act upon all text amendments as properly presented. Failure to act upon the proposed amendment shall not preclude the city commission from adjudicating the proposal. 
(Ord. No. 2005-43, § 1, 12-13-05) 
Sec. 3.10. - Vested rights and nonconformities. 
    The purpose of this section is to regulate the continued existence of certain uses and structures established prior to the effective date of this Code that do not conform to these regulations. It is the intent of this Code to permit legally nonconforming uses and structures to continue in existence until they are removed or abandoned. 
    To avoid undue hardship, nothing in this Code shall be deemed to require a change in the plans, construction or designated use of any structure on which actual construction was lawfully begun prior to the effective date of this Code, or amendment thereto, and upon which actual building construction has continued unabated since inception of such construction, pursuant to valid building permits issued therefor. 
(a)  Nonconforming lots. In any district in which single-family dwellings are permitted, notwithstanding limitations imposed by other provisions of this Code, except as provided below, a single-family dwelling and customary accessory buildings may be erected on any lot of record as of the adoption date of this Code. This provision shall apply even though such lot fails to meet the requirements for lot width or area, or both, that are generally applicable to the district, provided that the building setbacks and other requirements shall conform to the regulations for the district in which the lot is located. 
(b)  Nonconforming structures. Where a lawful structure exists at the time of adoption or amendment of this Code which could no longer be built under the terms of this Code by reason of restrictions on lot area, impervious surface, height, or other such characteristics, such structure may continue to be used so long as it remains otherwise lawful, subject to the following provisions: 
(1)  No such structure may be enlarged, altered or improved in a manner which increases its non-conformity, except for the conditions set forth for elevating an existing structure in Section (3)A. below. 
(2)  Any nonconforming structure which suffers substantial damage, as defined in this Code, shall only be repaired, restored or reconstructed in a manner which brings the entire structure into compliance with all requirements of this Code and other applicable codes of the city. 
(3)  Should such nonconforming structure be moved, either vertically or horizontally, it shall comply with the following: 
A.  The structure shall be moved, vertically only, such that the lowest floor is elevated no higher than six inches above the base flood elevation, as defined and established in the city's flood damage prevention regulations set forth in Chapter 98 of the Code of Ordinances, except that minimum necessary additional height shall be allowed to provide for the construction of a garage underneath any structure which is so moved. The maximum height of the new construction for the garage shall not exceed nine feet from the existing grade of the lot to the bottom of the existing horizontal structural member of the lowest floor. Under no circumstances shall the resulting structure exceed the maximum height allowed by the zoning district. 
B.  The structure shall be moved, horizontally only, such that no additional non-conformities are created, and no existing non-conformities are increased, by such relocation; and 
C.  The structure shall be located on the property so that there is a setback of at least three feet from the nearest property line on all sides of the structure. 
(c)  Nonconforming uses. Nonconforming uses of land, structures and premises which were lawfully established prior to the adoption of this Code, but which are not permitted or are otherwise currently prohibited by this Code, may continue to operate at their present location until such time as such use has been discontinued. If the use is discontinued for more than 90 consecutive days or a total of 180 calendar days within a one-year period, subsequent use of the premises shall conform to the district regulations. Continuance of nonconforming uses are subject to the following provisions: 
(1)  Uses nonconforming by the type of use are regulated as follows: 
a.  There shall be no increase of a nonconforming use by expansion of the use to adjacent properties, to other structures on the property, or to other portions of a multi-tenant structure within which the nonconforming use is located. No multi-tenant structure may be converted into a single-tenant structure for the purpose of expanding a nonconforming use. 
b.  No structure in which a nonconforming use is located shall be enlarged, altered, improved or relocated to occupy other portions of the lot upon which it is located or to increase the size of the structure. 
c.  When a structure which is occupied by a nonconforming use suffers substantial damage, said structure, if repaired, restored or reconstructed, shall only be occupied, upon completion, by uses which are allowed in the zoning district in which the structure is located. 
(2)  Uses that are nonconforming by reason of development density are regulated as follows: 
a.  The recognized number of units on such property shall be determined by the number shown in the property records on file with the city as of the date of adoption of this section. 
b.  There shall be no increase in the number of units by expansion or alteration of the use. 
c.  Except as provided for elsewhere in this Code, any property, upon which there are one or more buildings having such pre-existing nonconforming number of units shall be brought into conformity with the density requirements of this ordinance when any building is proposed to be substantially improved. 
(d)  Grandfathered nonconforming residential uses. Not withstanding the provisions of paragraph (c)(2) above and paragraph (e) following, nonconforming residential properties having a greater number of units than currently allowed under the provisions of the comprehensive plan and this Code that are lost through a catastrophic event may be reconstructed with the same number of units as they had prior to the loss under the following conditions: 
(1)  For the purposes of this subsection only, transient accommodations shall be considered to be residential properties. 
(2)  The applicant can verify to the satisfaction of the city that the property contained the number of units, square footage and height that are proposed for replacement; 
(3)  The replacement structure(s) shall be no larger in square footage, nor taller than the original structure, except that structure height may be increased by the height of the base flood elevation where necessary to comply with flood hazard mitigation requirements; 
(4)  Provided there are no conflicts with other codes and that no adverse impacts on adjacent properties will be created, the replacement structure(s) may be permitted to be constructed with the same footprint as the original structure(s); 
(5)  The replacement structure(s) shall meet all other local, state and federal requirements in place at the time of replacement; and 
(6)  Permits to rebuild under these provisions shall be obtained within one year of the catastrophic loss unless a general extension of time has been granted by the city commission. 
(e)  Nonconforming accessory structures. No nonconforming accessory structure shall continue after the principal use or structure is terminated by abandonment, damage, or destruction. In addition to the other provisions of this section applicable to nonconforming structures, the following additional conditions shall apply to nonconforming accessory structures: 
(1)  Any nonconforming accessory structure shall be brought into conformity with these regulations whenever a substantial improvement to the structure or the principal structure on the property is proposed and approved. Notwithstanding the foregoing, any accessory structure which is designated and constructed as a garage, the principle purpose of which is the storage of motor vehicles for single-family residential purposes, which is substantially damaged as the result of a catastrophic event as defined in the Code of Ordinances, may be reconstructed in accordance with the criteria set forth in subsection (d) hereof. 
(2)  Any nonconforming accessory structure which is destroyed or substantially damaged, shall, upon replacement, conform to all requirements of this Code and other applicable codes of the city. Any part of a nonconforming accessory structure which is destroyed or damaged to less than 50 percent of the value of such accessory structure may be repaired or restored if a permit for the repair or restoration is issued within 12 months of the date of the damage. 
(f)  Repairs and maintenance; maintaining safe condition. Repairs and maintenance of nonconforming structures are permitted.

Sec. 3.11. - Reserved. 
Sec. 3.12. - Variances. 
(a)  Authority and approval criteria. 
(1)  The appropriate board of authority may authorize variances to the land development regulations if the applicant is able to demonstrate the following conditions: 
(a)  The existence of conditions and circumstances that are peculiar to the subject land, structure or building and do not apply generally to neighboring lands, structures or buildings in the same district which have complied with these regulations without hardship; that the strict application of the provisions of the land development regulations would deprive the applicant of reasonable use of such land, structure or building; and the peculiar conditions and circumstances are not the result of the actions of the applicant; and 
(b)  Neither a nonconforming use of neighboring lands, structures or buildings, legal or illegal, in the same district, nor a permitted use in adjacent districts shall be considered as grounds for issuance of a variance; and 
(c)  The proposed variance will not have the effect of changing any district boundary on the zoning map, nor constitute the granting of a nonconforming use. Under no circumstances shall a variance permit an increase in development density or permit a use not specifically permitted in the district; and 
(d)  The granting of a variance will be in harmony with the general purpose and intent of the land development regulations and will not be injurious to the neighborhood or otherwise detrimental to the public welfare. In granting the variance, the appropriate board of authority may prescribe any conditions and safeguards it deems necessary or desirable as a condition of approval of the variance application; and 
[e]  The appropriate board of authority finds as a reasonable conclusion that hardship would unnecessarily result from a literal enforcement of the provisions of the land development regulations as set forth in the application, and the variance proposed is the minimum variance that will make possible the reasonable use of the land, structure and building. 
(2)  When application is made to the city commission for approval of a conditional use permit, any necessary variances shall be considered by the commission at the same time as the conditional use permit request. Such variances may be approved or denied by the city commission without regard to the disposition of the conditional use permit request. 
(3)  Any variance granted hereunder shall expire one (1) year from the date of the development order providing for such variance, unless a building permit for the construction authorized by such variance is obtained within such time and said building permit has not expired prior to the completion of construction in accordance therewith. 
(b)  Limitations on variance authority of appointed boards. Any request for variance to the city's coastal control line shall be made directly to the city commission. No board of authority shall grant a variance from any requirement imposed by the city commission as a condition of rezoning, conditional use approval or any other action of the commission resulting in the granting of specific development rights. 
(c)  Application submission requirements. Each application is due no later than 30 days prior to the public hearing and shall contain the following information, accompanied by the payment of the applicable fee set forth in Appendix A, St. Pete Beach Code of Ordinances: 
(1)  A completed application, signed by the property owner. The format of the application shall be determined by the City Manager. 
(2)  Proof of ownership. 
(3)  When the applicant is a representative of the property owner or purchaser under contract, a notarized statement authorizing the representative to act as an agent of the property owner with regard to the application and associated procedures. 
(4)  A property survey containing the legal description, land area, and existing improvements on the site. The survey shall be signed and sealed by a surveyor licensed in the State, and shall have been performed not more than ten (10) years prior to the date of application. The survey shall accurately depict all improvements on the site. If all improvements are not depicted on the survey, the applicant shall conduct a new survey of the property and submit it with the application materials. 
(5)  A site plan illustrating the request, drawn to scale. The sheet size shall not be less than eleven inches by seventeen inches (11 × 17) and shall not be more than thirty-six inches by forty-eight inches (36 × 48). An electronic version may be required. 
(6)  Any stipulation, condition, or proffer the applicant wishes to offer along with the application. 
(7)  Applicants are encouraged and may be required to submit additional information, such as elevations, photos, and/or product information, when appropriate. 
(d)  Determination of completeness of application. The city shall determine whether the application is complete. If the application is complete, the application shall be forwarded for review. If the application is not complete the city shall take no further action on the application until the required information is submitted by the applicant.

Sec. 3.13. - Reserved. 
Sec. 3.14. - Appeals. 
(a)  An appeal to a hearing officer designated by the city commission may be taken by any person aggrieved by any final decision of an administrative official of the city where it is alleged there is an error in an order, permit, condition, requirement, decision or determination by the administrator in enforcing the Land Development Code. An appeal shall be filed in writing on or before 30 days from the day of the administrative decision. 
(b)  Any person aggrieved by a final order of the city commission or any appointed board may appeal the order to the circuit court. The appeal shall be filed with the circuit court on or before 30 days following the issuance of the final development order. 
(c)  When an appeal is filed, all proceedings in furtherance of the action affected by the decision being appealed from shall be stayed, unless city manager certifies, after the notice of appeal has been filed with the city, that by reason of facts stated in the certificate, a stay would cause imminent peril to life or property. 
(d)  If the hearing officer finds that said conditions exists, the hearing officer may deny the stay and allow the administrative order to be executed. 
(e)  The city commission may appoint one or more hearing officers to hear appeals as provided in this section.

DIVISION 4 - CONDITIONAL USE PERMITS[1] 

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2005-07, § 2, adopted Feb. 22, 2005, amended Div. 4, in its entirety, to read as herein set out. Prior to inclusion of said ordinance, Div. 4 pertained to similar subject matter. Subsequently, Ord. No. 2005-44, § 1, adopted Dec. 13, 2005, amended Div. 4, in its entirety, to read as herein set out. See also the Code Comparative Table. 

Sec. 4.1. - Review of conditional use permit applications. 
(a)  Purpose. Certain uses are conditional rather than uses by right. They are subject to the conditional use regulations because they may, but do not necessarily, have significant adverse effects on the environment, public services, the desired character of an area, or they may create nuisances. A review of these uses is necessary due to the impacts they may have on the surrounding area or neighborhood. The conditional use review provides an opportunity to allow the use when there are minimal impacts, to allow the use but impose mitigation measures to address identified concerns, or to deny the use if the concerns cannot be resolved. 
(b)  Authority. The city commission may approve applications for conditional uses in accordance with the procedures, standards and limitations of this division. 
(c)  Authorized conditional uses. Only those uses which are authorized in each zoning district or those nonconforming uses which are substantially damaged or destroyed, and are permitted to be re-established in accordance with this ordinance may be approved as conditional uses. The designation of a use in a zoning district as a conditional use does not constitute an authorization of such use or an assurance that such use will be approved; rather, each proposed conditional use shall be evaluated by the city commission for compliance with the standards and conditions set forth in this section and for each district. Wherever a conditional use existing on the effective date of these regulations is terminated or destroyed, subsequent conditional use of the property shall be permitted only in conjunction with the approval process specified herein. 
(Ord. No. 2005-44, § 1, 12-13-05) 
Sec. 4.2. - Applications and administrative review procedures. 
(a)  Simultaneous applications. Applications for conditional uses, site plan review, zoning changes, variances and any other similar applications may be filed simultaneously by the applicant; however, all such applications shall be finalized before any permits or licenses are granted. 
(b)  Application submission requirements. Each application is due no later than 30 days prior to the public hearing accompanied by the payment of the applicable fee set forth in Appendix A, St. Pete Beach Code of Ordinances, and shall contain the following information: 
(1)  A completed application, signed by the property owner. The format of the application shall be determined by the City Manager. 
(2)  Proof of ownership. 
(3)  When the applicant is a representative of the property owner or purchaser under contract, a notarized statement authorizing the representative to act as an agent of the property owner with regard to the application and associated procedures. 
(4)  A property survey containing the legal description, land area, and existing improvements on the site. The survey shall be signed and sealed by a surveyor licensed in the State, and shall have been performed not more than ten (10) years prior to the date of application. The survey shall accurately depict all improvements on the site. If all improvements are not depicted on the survey, the applicant shall conduct a new survey of the property and submit it with the application materials. 
(5)  A site plan illustrating the request, drawn to scale. The sheet size shall not be less than eleven inches by seventeen inches (11 × 17) and shall not be more than thirty-six inches by forty-eight inches (36 × 48). An electronic version may be required. 
(6)  Applicants are encouraged and may be required to submit additional information, such as elevations, photos, and/or product information, when appropriate. 
(c)  Determination of completeness of application. The city shall determine whether the application is complete. If the application is complete, the application shall be forwarded for review. If the application is not complete the city shall take no further action on the application until the required information is submitted by the applicant. 
(d)  Determination of sufficient application. After an application is determined complete, each department involved in the review process shall review the application for sufficiency and shall notify the applicant of any additional information that may be required. 
(1)  Remedy of insufficiencies. If the applicant fails to respond to the specified request for information within the time period established by the notification of deficiency, the application for development or conditional use approval shall be voided. 
(e)  Changes of information. If an applicant submits new data or information at any time after a determination of completeness has been made, the revised application will be subject to the same stages of review as the initial application. Any additional costs associated with the required advertisement of modified applications shall be borne by the applicant and must be paid prior to the hearing at which the application is considered. 
(Ord. No. 2005-44, § 1, 12-13-05; Ord. No. 2011-21, § 1(Exh. A), 11-22-11) 
Sec. 4.3. - Compliance requirements. 
(a)  The city, as a further condition to approval of an application for a conditional use permit, may require financial guarantees or other such guarantees as may be reasonably necessary to insure compliance with the terms and conditions of its approval. 
(b)  In instances where no additional construction is necessary to implement the conditional use failure to obtain an occupational license for the approved conditional use within six months from the date of approval of the conditional use permit shall invalidate the approval, unless a shorter compliance period is required by the city. 
(c)  Where construction is necessary prior to the operation of the conditional use, failure to obtain a building permit within 12 months of the date of approval of an application for a conditional use permit, shall invalidate the approval. A shorter compliance period may be required by the city commission. 
(1)  An occupational license shall be obtained within 30 days of the issuance of the certificate of occupancy for the necessary construction. 
(2)  Failure to maintain continual construction, as defined in Division 2 of this ordinance, shall void any building or other development approval granted in connection with the project. If construction activity ceases at any time after the zoning lot has been cleared of vegetation, the owner shall be required to reclaim the site in accordance with section 22.3(g) of this division. 
(Ord. No. 2005-44, § 1, 12-13-05) 
Sec. 4.4. - Standards for review. 
(a)  Standards applicable to all conditional uses. When considering an application for approval of a conditional use, the city commission review shall consider the following standards: 
(1)  Whether the conditional use is consistent with the goals, objectives, and policies of the Comprehensive Plan, any adopted special area plan and these regulations; 
(2)  Whether the proposed use will be compatible with the character of the existing area, including existing structures and structures under construction, existing public facilities and public facilities under construction, and residential, commercial and/or service facilities available within the existing area. More specifically: 
a.  Whether the overall appearance and function of the area will be significantly affected consideration shall be given to the existence of other uses in the area, based on the number, size, and location of the uses and the intensity and scale of the proposed and existing uses in the area; 
b.  Whether the application will preserve any city, state or federally designated historic, scenic, archaeological, or cultural resources; 
c.  Whether the application will be compatible with adjacent development, if any, based on characteristics such as size, building style and scale; or whether such incompatibilities are mitigated through such means as screening, landscaping, setbacks, and other design features; and 
d.  Whether the application will have significant adverse impacts on the livability and usability of nearby land due to noise, dust, fumes, smoke, glare from lights, late-night operations, odors, vehicular traffic, truck and other delivery trips, the amount, location, and nature of any outside activities, potential for increased litter, or privacy and safety issues. 
(3)  Whether the transportation system is capable of adequately supporting the proposed use in addition to the existing uses in the area. Evaluation factors include street capacity and level of service, access to arterials, transit availability, on-street parking impacts, if any, site access requirements, neighborhood impacts, and pedestrian safety; 
(4)  Whether the minimum off-street parking area required and the amount of space needed for the loading and unloading of trucks, if applicable, will be provided and will function properly and safely;

(7)  Whether the proposed use complies with all additional standards imposed on it by the particular provision of these regulations authorizing such use and by all other applicable requirements of the regulations of the City of St. Pete Beach. 
(Ord. No. 2005-44, § 1, 12-13-05) 
Sec. 4.5. - Staff review and report. 
    The staff shall review all applications for conditional use approval and provide a written analysis of the issues raised by the application which shall be forwarded to city. 
(Ord. No. 2005-44, § 1, 12-13-05) 
Sec. 4.6. - Reserved. 
Sec. 4.7. - City commission review. 
    Upon receipt of the written staff analysis, the city commission shall hold a public hearing to consider the application for conditional use and may grant, grant with conditions or deny the application. Final action of the city commission shall be by resolution and documented in the form of a development order containing a legal description of the real property to which the conditional use applies, together with the terms of the conditional use and any additional conditions imposed. For conditional use permits required by section 39.6(p) of this Code, the planning board shall hold a public hearing to consider the application and make a recommendation to the city commission. 
(Ord. No. 2005-44, § 1, 12-13-05; Ord. No. 2015-22, § 2, 12-15-15; Ord. No. 2017-07, § 2, 6-13-17)

(Ord. No. 2005-44, § 1, 12-13-05) 
Sec. 4.11. - Conditional uses in designated community redevelopment districts. 
    It is the intent of the city that the aesthetic and functional characteristics of new development shall be regulated to insure consistency with the stated objectives of city redevelopment policy and that all new development is undertaken in a manner consistent with the best interests of the community. In instances of development projects which are of significant density or intensity, the complexity of the construction and operation of such projects require a higher than usual level of public security and technical review prior to permitting, and necessitate the articulation of specific requirements on the part of both the developer and the city to ensure that such developments are in harmony with community character and consistent with the policies of the community redevelopment plan. The provisions of this section are intended to supplement the stated requirements of this division and other divisions of the Land Development Code and provide for the incorporation of provisions into conditional use approvals which address issues of public concern.

Sec. 6.18. - Reserved. 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 2004-3, § 1, adopted March 9, 2004, repealed § 6.18, which pertained to preservation areas. See also the Code Comparative Table. 
Sec. 6.19. - Public and semi-public uses. 
    Public and semi-public facilities are allowable in all districts as conditional uses; however, such uses shall not exceed the acreage threshold of three acres. Any such use, alone or when added to an existing contiguous like use(s), which exceeds the three acre threshold shall require an amendment to the future land use map and a zoning change. 
(Ord. No. 03-7, § 3, 5-1-03) 
Sec. 6.20. - Utilities. 
    Notwithstanding other provisions of this Code, it is not intended to regulate or restrict the location of utility lines, poles and related facilities, except plants or substations, nor to regulate or restrict the location of necessary drainage facilities which are part of the community drainage system.

(Ord. No. 03-7, § 3, 5-1-03) 
Sec. 6.21. - Visibility at intersections. 
    Except as provided herein, no structure or portion of any structure, including earthen berms, shall be placed or erected, no motor vehicle, trailer or equipment shall be allowed to park, stand, stop or be stored, and no vegetation taller than 24 inches in height shall be permitted to be located within the areas described below: 
(a)  Street intersections. Within 20 feet of the back of curb or pavement edge where no curb exists. (b)  Alleys. Within ten feet of the back of curb or pavement edge where no curb exists on the street with which the alley intersects. (c)  Driveways. Within ten feet of the back of curb or pavement edge where no curb exists on the street with which the driveway intersects.  
    The following illustration depicts how the visibility triangle is determined. Essentially, depending upon which of the above three intersection types is involved, the appropriate measurement is taken as shown in the drawing, and the two points most distant from the theoretical intersection of the two roadway lines are connected by a diagonal line. The shaded area on the drawing represents the determined visibility triangle. 

    Trees may be planted, with a minimum separation of 20 feet, within the above described areas provided that they are maintained as needed to ensure that no branch of the tree is nearer the ground than eight feet. In certain circumstances, the city may require greater separation for reasons of public safety. 
(Ord. No. 03-7, § 3, 5-1-03) 
Sec. 6.22. - Yard and measurement requirements. 
(a)  Required yards. Examples of yards are shown in the illustration on the next page.

Open stairs, without independent roof or overhang systems, may be permitted to encroach into any required yard a distance of three feet provided that no resulting setback shall be less than 2 feet from any property line. 
(c)  Encroachment of ornamental building components. Every part of a required front, rear and side yard shall be open from grade to the sky, unobstructed by any structure except for the ordinary projections of sills, belt courses, cornices, buttresses, ornamental features, and chimneys; provided, however, that none of the projections mentioned in this subsection shall extend into a required yard more than 12 inches. 
(d)  Encroachment of eaves. Roof eave projections with gutters shall extend no more than two feet into any required side yard. 
(e)  Front yard averaging. Prior to the adoption of this Code some existing residential structures were built with lesser front yards than are required by the district regulations herein. When new single-family or two-family residential construction is proposed on a lot fronting on a block where a majority of the existing structures have lesser front yards than are required by the district regulations, the minimum required front yard shall be the average of the yards established by the existing structures. However, no such new structure shall be permitted to have less than a ten-foot front yard under this provision. For the purposes of this section, a block is defined as a group of lots fronting along the same side of the street as the subject lot lying between the two nearest intersecting streets or waterways or combination thereof. If front yard averaging is used, paragraphs (b) and (c) do not apply. 
(f)  Determination of front yard on corner lots. On corner lots, the front yard shall be determined as the yard abutting the street on which each lot of record or lots of record involved have their lesser dimension. The other yard abutting the intersecting street shall be determined to be a secondary front yard.

(2)  Notwithstanding the preceding, a residential dock for the joint use by two or more adjacent waterfront property owners may be permitted where the physical characteristics of the waterfront make it impractical to build individual docks. 
(3)  No residential dock, davits, boatlifts or tie poles shall extend from the mean high water line or seawall of the appurtenant upland property to a length greater than one-half the width of the zoning lot at the waterfront. This requirement may be varied administratively provided that signed statements of "no objection" from both adjacent waterfront property owners have been submitted. 
(4)  Residential dock, davits, boatlifts or tie poles shall be located within the center one-half of the width of the appurtenant upland property at the waterfront. For the purpose of this regulation, side lot lines of a lot shall be deemed to extend into the adjacent water body perpendicular to the shoreline which they intersect. This requirement may be varied administratively provided that a signed statement of "no objection" from the property owner encroached upon has been submitted with the permit application. 
(e)  Additional requirements for commercial docks. A commercial dock shall be permitted only as a conditional use. In addition to the requirements of Division 4, the following standards shall be met prior to the issuance of any development order for any commercial docking facility by the city: 
(1)  The applicant shall demonstrate that the waterfront use is in compliance with this Code or can be brought into compliance to accommodate both the current use and the proposed dock, as it relates to parking, drainage, utilities and other facilities necessitated by the development. This provision shall also apply to a property which is already developed with docking facilities and where the owner wishes to add ancillary facilities; 
(2)  All commercial dock installations must be consistent with the zoning of the adjacent upland property;

(4)  All docking facilities must be so located that no portion of the proposed facility is closer to either adjacent extended property line than ten percent of the property width at the waterfront; 
(5)  Commercial docks abutting adjacent waterfront residential property must be set back a minimum of one-third of the applicant's waterfront property width from the adjacent waterfront residential property. This requirement may be waived administratively provided that signed statements of "no objection" from the affected property owners has been submitted; 
(6)  Would have a detrimental effect on the use of such waters for navigation, transportation, recreational or other public purposes and public conveniences; 
(7)  Would have a material adverse effect upon the natural beauty and recreational advantages of the city; 
(8)  Would have a material adverse effect upon the conservation of wildlife, marine life, and other natural resources, including beaches and shores, so as to be contrary to the public interest; 
(9)  Would have a material adverse effect upon the uplands surrounding or necessarily affected by such plan or development; or 
(10)  Would have a material adverse effect on the safety, health and welfare of the general public.

(b)  Official zoning map. The location and boundaries of the districts established by this Code are described on the official zoning map of the city, which together with all explanatory matter thereon, is hereby adopted by reference and declared to be a part of this Code as if they were fully described herein. 
(c)  Maintenance of map. The official zoning map, as amended from time to time in accordance with the provisions of section 3.9(b) shall be kept on file and made available for public reference in the office of the city clerk.

(1)  Boundaries indicated as approximately following the centerlines of streets or alleys shall be construed to follow such centerlines as they exist on the ground, except where variation of actual location from mapped location would change the zoning status of a zoning lot, in which case the boundary shall be interpreted in such a manner as to avoid changing the zoning status of any zoning lot. Should a street or alley be vacated or closed, the boundary line shall be construed as remaining in its location, except where ownership of the vacated street or alley is divided other than at the center, in which case the boundary line shall be construed as moving with the ownership. 
(2)  Boundaries indicated as approximately following lot lines, public property lines, and the like shall be construed as following such lines; provided that, where such boundaries are adjacent to a street or alley and the zoning status of the street or alley is not indicated, the boundaries shall be construed as running to the middle of the street or alley. Should a street or alley be vacated or closed, interpretation shall be as provided in paragraph (1) of this section. 
(3)  Boundaries indicated as approximately following city limits shall be construed as following such city limits. 
(4)  Boundaries indicated as following shorelines or centerlines of other bodies of water or indicated as following official bulkhead lines shall be construed as following such shorelines, centerlines or official bulkhead lines. In the case of a change in shoreline or of the course or extent of bodies of water, the boundaries shall be construed as moving with the change. 
(5)  Boundaries indicated as following physical features other than those mentioned above shall be construed as following such physical features, except where variation of actual location from mapped location would change the zoning status of a zoning lot. In such case, the boundary shall be interpreted to avoid changing the zoning status of any zoning lot. 
(6)  Boundaries indicated as parallel to or extensions of features indicated in paragraphs (1) through (5) of this section shall be construed as being parallel to or extensions of such features. 
(7)  Where a district boundary divides the area of a zoning lot unequally and the zoning lot is less than one acre in area, the district classification and regulation of the larger portion shall apply to the remaining smaller portion of the lot. 
(8)  If any further uncertainty exists, the appropriate board of authority shall interpret the intent of the map as to location of such boundaries.

(1)  Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this Code shall be deemed exclusive in nature, and only those uses specified shall be permitted in the various zoning districts. If a use is not specified in a zoning district, it shall be prohibited in that district. In the event that a use is not permitted in any zoning district, it may only be permitted after appropriate amendment to the text of this Code. 
(2)  Further, when any defined use, condition or activity is permitted in a district subject to restrictions, such use, condition, or activity is prohibited if it is being conducted in violation of those restrictions. 
(g)  Interpretation when more than one regulation or standard applies. When more than one regulation or standard applies to any use, structure, activity or undertaking subject to any provision of this Code, the most restrictive or stringent regulation or standard shall govern.

(j)  Reduction of lot area. No zoning lot, lot of record, parcel, or yard existing on the effective date of this Code, shall thereafter be reduced in dimension or area below the minimum requirements set forth in this Code, except by reason of a portion being acquired for public use in any manner, including dedication, condemnation, purchase and other similar situations. Zoning lots or yards created after the effective date of this Code shall meet at least the minimum requirements established by this Code.

The height limitations contained in the regulations pertaining to specific districts do not apply to spires, belfries, cupolas, personal television antennae, water tanks, ventilators, chimneys, elevator shaft enclosures, or other appurtenances usually required to be placed above the roof level and not intended for human occupancy.

    Within the city, there are street-ends that terminate at the Gulf of Mexico beach and are used by the public and abutting owners for pedestrian access to the waterfront, motor vehicle access to abutting properties or parking. Within the recreation and open space element of the St. Pete Beach 2010 Comprehensive Plan these street-ends are designated as beach accesses for the public; however, these street-ends were not dedicated as parks in the subdivision plats in which they were set aside for public use. These street-ends or portions thereof currently serve, and will continue to serve the public and abutting owners as pedestrian access to the beach and vehicular access to the abutting properties. The recreational facilities maps within the recreation and open space element of the comprehensive plan is general and does not show the exact areas set aside as beach access, and it is the purpose of this division to set forth the city's policy for the use of the street-ends designated ROS/SE-1.

    Within the city, there are street-ends, as defined in Division 2, that terminate at the Gulf of Mexico beach, Boca Ciega Bay or Blind Pass Channel and where it is desirable that the street-end be used only for recreation open space and not for vehicular access or parking. However, these street-ends were not dedicated as parks in the subdivision plats in which they were set aside for public use. Because these street-ends are not required to serve abutting owners who have adequate vehicular access to their property from other public rights-of-way, the abutting owners may convey their title interest in the underlying street-end to the city and waive any right to vehicular access from the street-end. As consideration for the conveyance of the fee title to the underlying street-end, the city will modify specific land use requirements for the development of the abutting property under the terms of this division. The modified land use requirements specified herein, are intended to motivate property owners who abut such street-ends to convey the fee title interest in the underlying street-end to the city enabling the city to increase the recreation open space available to the public.

    The City recognizes that the Pass-a-Grille Area was developed prior to the development of suburban zoning regulations. The (PAG) Pass-a-Grille Overlay District is intended to allow for structures that are considered contributing to the National Register Historic District to be considered conforming regarding base flood elevations and uses of property within the Pass-a-Grille area situated south of 32nd Avenue, in order to ensure that structures and uses will be compatible with the character of existing development, including the area within the designated Pass-a-Grille Historic District. Also, to recognize that the existing parcel size's, uses and overall character of the PAG shall be permitted to continue as viable uses while allowing for improvements to existing structures, additions and new development that is consistent with the existing mass and scale within the district.

Sec. 20.02. - Definitions. 
(a)  Accessory structure envelope means provisions for the setbacks and maximum building footprints permitted for accessory structures. 
(b)  Balance means the relationship among the elements of a building on either side of an imaginary centerline through the middle of a building. Buildings are either symmetrically or asymmetrically balanced. 
(c)  Balanced, asymmetrically means the shape(s) and design of a building may not match exactly, but instead have equal visual weight they are still visually balanced. 
(d)  Balanced, symmetrically means the shapes on one side of the centerline match the shapes on the other side. The two halves are visually equally. 
(e)  Building height : Provisions for permitted heights in feet (ft). The maximum height for first floor residential development shall be fourteen (14) feet and twenty (20) feet for non-residential. The maximum height for second story and higher shall not exceed fourteen (14) feet. Each building lot typology provides the range of height appropriate for the building type. No new or substantially improved building within the PAG Overlay District and having the underlying zoning designation of THD, RU-2 Residential, RLM-2 Residential, or RM Residential shall be constructed not to exceed twenty-eight (28) feet in height to the midpoint of a sloped roof or top of the parapet of a flat or low sloped roof, and measured from the base flood elevation determined under the most restrictive applicable standard for the building site, further provided that the overall roof height shall not exceed thirty-two (32) feet. Base flood elevation requirements are outlined in section 98-33 of the City's Code of Ordinances. 
(f)  Building envelope : Provisions for the minimum and maximum setbacks permitted by front, side, and rear yards. There is a minimum and maximum setback for each lot type. The maximum and minimum frontage refers to the proportion of the lot width along which the primary building façade must be within the minimum and maximum front setback. 
(g)  Compatible design means architectural design and construction that will fit harmoniously into the district based on scale, materials, and quality of construction with adjacent buildings and structures.

The parking zone refers to any uncovered parking area located on the parcel. Driveways are permitted in any zone provided the frontage requirements have been met as required by building type. The diagram illustrates a primary and secondary street. Primary streets are streets that are addressed to the parcel of land. Secondary streets may or may not have access to the parcel. Zones are defined and illustrated by the lot area between the principal building frontage and: 
(1) ;hg;Zone 1: the right-of-way of any primary street. (2) ;hg;Zone 2: any common interior lot line. (3) ;hg;Zone 3: any rear lot line. (4) ;hg;Zone 4: the right-of-way of any secondary street.  
(l)  Private frontages , refers to the area that is attached or integrated into the primary building. 
(m)  Proportion means the relationships of one part of a façade to the whole. A house that is correctly proportionate establishes a visual relationship between all parts of its exterior. The voids, primary, and secondary masses should all be proportional to one another in order maintain architectural harmony. 
(n)  Proximity means that objects that are close together should complement each other. 
(o)  Rhythm means the use of repetitive elements in order to establish architectural harmony. It is based off of three main principles: the principle of Proximity, the principle of Similarity, and the principle of Continuation. These principles are part of a larger set known as Gestalt Principles. 
(p)  Similarity means how our eyes are easily able to group objects together that share common textures, colors, or features 
(q)  Voids means windows, doors, or other openings that create negative space allowing for breaks within a primary or secondary mass.

    Design review shall be based on the requirements set forth in the underlying zoning district and the PAG Overlay District herein and for consistency with the Secretary of Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation. If the Historic Preservation Board finds that an addition is consistent with the Secretary of the Interior's Standards and that the addition would not preclude the structure's continued designation as a contributing structure, and approves a certificate of appropriateness for the plans, then the applicant can request a reduction to any and all of the setbacks, provided the setbacks are consistent within the same block of the proposed addition by providing the historical setback data for the street block (both faces) the parcel is on and the historical setbacks along that particular street that will be evaluated by the Historic Board. The following setbacks shall be considered: 
Setback Front yard 10 feet Secondary front yard 5 feet Side yard 10 percent of the lot width (each) Rear yard 10 feet

Sec. 22.1. - Purpose and intent. 
    It is the intent and purpose of these regulations to provide standards for landscaping and tree protection to improve the appearance of the city, as well as assist in the natural control of air and water pollution and soil conservation. Emphasis shall be placed upon landscaping as a means of achieving beauty in the community. It will be required on all projects, and in some projects and areas it will be the primary tool available. Landscaping is considered extremely important to the aesthetic and environmental goals of the city. 
(Ord. No. 2005-38, § 2, 11-8-05) 
Sec. 22.2. - Applicability. 
    The minimum requirements set out in this section are applicable to each zoning district relative to tree protection, the landscaping of certain setback areas and additional required on-site landscaping, including vehicular use areas. Landscape design and planning shall be integrated into the overall design concept and not be considered merely as an afterthought. Towards this end, proposed landscaping schemes will be evaluated as to their relationship to the existing natural landscape, developed and other proposed landscape, including those on adjacent properties and street rights-of-way and the building or buildings proposed. The city may require additional landscaping if it deemed important for buffering or screening. 
(Ord. No. 2005-38, § 2, 11-8-05) 
Sec. 22.3. - General requirements. 
(a)  Plan approval. All new construction, except single-family and two-family dwellings as regulated under section 22.5, must have a site plan and landscape plan approved by the city prior to the issuance of a building permit. 
(b)  Screening of certain areas. Screening shall be employed for parking lots as required, and to mask from the public view such service areas as trash and garbage areas, outside equipment of unaesthetic character, and accessory buildings or areas not enhancing or in keeping with the aesthetics of the project or the neighborhood. 
(c)  Installation. All landscaping shall be installed in accordance with the approved landscape plan prior to issuance of a certificate of occupancy and shall be installed in accordance with accepted landscape practices within the area. All plant material listed as Category I by the Florida Exotic Pest Plants Council (FEPPC) shall be removed prior to issuance of certificate of occupancy. 
(d)  Maintenance. The owner and tenant, or their agent, if any, shall be jointly and severally responsible for the maintenance of all landscaping in accordance with section 22.10, and landscaped areas shall be so maintained as to present a healthy, neat and orderly appearance and shall be kept free from refuse and debris. If trees, shrubs or other landscape material should die, such materials must be replaced within 30 days. 
(e)  Protection of landscaped areas. All landscaped areas shall be protected from vehicular encroachment by curbs, wheel stops or other similar device. 
(f)  Preservation of existing plant material. In instances where healthy plant material exists on a site prior to its development, in part or in whole, for purposes of off-street parking or other vehicular use areas, or in conjunction with other landscaping requirements, an applicant will be encouraged to retain such landscaping. The city manager may adjust the application of the standards set out in this section to allow credit for such plant material if, in his opinion, such an adjustment is in keeping with and will preserve the intent of this section. 
(g)  Reclamation. In the event construction activity ceases on a zoning lot that has been cleared of vegetation, the owner shall be required to restore sufficient vegetation and/or provide such other means, as determined by the city, to ensure the stability of the soil on the lot.

Sec. 22.8. - Buffer requirements and installation standards. 
(a)  Generally. A buffer shall be defined as specified land area together with its planting and landscaping requirements. Buffers may also contain a barrier, such as a fence, wall, hedge, or berm, where such additional screening is necessary to achieve the desired degree of buffering between adjacent uses. 
    Landscaped buffers shall be required to separate transient accommodation and nonresidential uses from residential or institutional uses, where such area abuts property zoned or in fact used primarily for residential or institutional purposes, to eliminate or minimize potential negative effects such as dirt, noise, litter, glare of lights, signs, parking areas, or to provide spacing to reduce the adverse impacts of noise, odor, or danger from fires or explosions. The size and nature of the buffer shall be determined by the site plan process. Buffers shall be subject to the following provisions: 
(1)  A buffer may be used for passive recreation, when appropriate upon approval of the approving authority. 
(2)  A buffer may be used for utility or drainage easements, provided that the requirements of such use and the buffer requirements are compatible. 
(3)  A buffer may be used for satisfaction of minimum setback requirements. 
(4)  A buffer may be used for satisfaction of minimum open space requirements. 
(5)  A buffer may be used for storm water retention or detention areas so long as the required buffer plantings are provided and the design and landscaping of the buffer does not interfere with proper functioning of the drainage system and the design water depth does not harm the viability of the plantings. 
(6)  A buffer may be used for passive recreation such as pedestrian or bicycle trails subject to the following limitations: 
a.  No plant material is eliminated. 
b.  The total width of the buffer is maintained. 
c.  All other requirements of these regulations are met.

(9)  Buffers shall remain part of the zoning lot for which they are required. 
(10)  The required buffer shall not contain any development, impervious surfaces, or site features that do not function to meet the standards of this section. No grading, development, or land-disturbing activities shall occur within the buffer unless approved as part of a development permit. Storm water detention, retention or treatment areas and easements shall be shown on the approved landscape plan and such areas shall not occupy more than 50 percent, horizontally, of the width of the buffer. 
(11)  The arrangement of required plants and trees shall be distributed in a relatively uniform manner and as depicted on the approved landscape plan. 
(12)  Existing trees and vegetation within a required buffer, which meet these requirements may be counted toward the total buffer plant material requirements. If existing trees and plants do not fully meet the standards for the type of buffer required, additional vegetation shall be planted. 
(b)  Location of buffers. The buffers required by these regulations shall be located along the perimeter of a zoning lot where required, extending the entire length of the zoning lot, except at approved entrances or exits to the property or in required sight triangles. Buffers shall extend to the zoning lot line or right-of-way line, except where easements, covenants, or natural features may require the buffer to be set back from the property line. 
(1)  Buffers shall not be located on any portion of an existing, dedicated, or proposed right-of-way, road easement, or private street. 
(2)  Where an existing utility easement is partially or wholly within a required buffer, the developer shall design the buffer to eliminate or minimize plantings within the easement. Such design may necessitate choosing a buffer with more land area or fewer required plantings. 
(3)  All general landscape requirements of these regulations shall be met. 
(c)  Landscape buffer along public streets. Landscape buffers along "A" and "B" streets shall meet the following guidelines: 
(1)  A five- to 15-foot landscape buffer shall be required along public streets and shall include shade trees and groundcover.

Developments proposing a privacy fence five feet or more in height within a required buffer may be allowed a 50 percent reduction in the density of plantings. Such request shall be submitted in writing by the applicant and shall include provisions by the owner for maintenance of the buffer and the fencing. 



(f)  Plant sizes and design requirements. 
(1)  Trees in buffers of ten feet or less should be small or medium. Trees in buffers of more than ten feet may be small, medium, or large provided, however, at least one-half of the required trees shall be large. Trees used in required buffers may be used to meet the required plantings for the property, provided the trees meet or exceed all size, type, and location requirements for replacement trees as specified in these regulations. 
(2)  Alternative designs for required buffers may be approved by the city manager upon a finding that such alternative design meets the intent of these regulations and sound landscaping practices. In no case is the city manager authorized to reduce the width of a buffer or the total number of plants required on the site.

(q)  Protect property values by precluding to the maximum extent possible sign-types that create a nuisance to the occupancy or use of other properties as a result of their size, height, illumination, brightness, or movement; 
(r)  Protect property values by ensuring that sign-types, as well as the number of signs, are in harmony with buildings, neighborhoods, and conforming signs in the area; 
(s)  Regulate the appearance and design of signs in a manner that promotes and enhances the beautification of the city and that complements the natural surroundings in recognition of this city's reliance on its natural surroundings and beautification efforts in retaining economic advantage for its resort community, as well as for its commercial properties; and

    Traffic restriction area means an area in which the level of service for a given road facility has been determined by data from the concurrency management monitoring system to be below the acceptable level of service adopted in this article. 
    Transportation concurrency means transportation facilities needed to serve new development shall be in place, or under actual construction, within three years after the city approves a building permit or its functional equivalent that results in traffic generation. 
    Volume-to-capacity (v/c) ratio means the rate of traffic flow of an intersection approach or group of lanes during a specific time interval divided by the capacity of the approach or group of lanes. Volume-to-capacity ratios provide a measure of traffic congestion and are utilized in the concurrency management system to identify congested road segments and to minimize the transportation impacts of development projects that affect them. 
(Ord. No. 2017-01, § 2(Exh. A), 2-28-2017) 
Sec. 29.3. - Levels of service adopted by reference. 
    The adopted levels of service standards, as stated in the City Comprehensive Plan, for public facilities and services are hereby adopted by reference. 
(Ord. No. 2017-01, § 2(Exh. A), 2-28-2017) 
Sec. 29.4. - General requirements. 
(a)  A certificate of concurrency shall be required prior to the issuance of any development permit for a non-exempt development project. The City of St. Pete Beach shall not issue any development order (excluding future land use or zoning map amendments) or building permit for any project that results in a reduction of the level of service requirements established and adopted in the City of St. Pete Beach Comprehensive Plan. An applicant must prepare and complete an application for a certificate of concurrency including an infrastructure study as determined to be necessary by the Technical Review Committee. If a development will require more than one development permit, the issuance of a certificate of concurrency shall occur prior to the issuance of the initial permit. Upon request by applicants, a preliminary concurrency review shall be performed and a conditional certificate of concurrency may be issued. This conditional certificate shall not be binding upon the city and shall only be effective for the year in which the annual concurrency monitoring report was issued. Only those certificates of concurrency issued for development permits shall be binding. Applicants may be charged a fee established by the city commission for certificates of concurrency. 
(1)  Application for development . The property owner, or authorized representative, must provide a complete application for development containing the required documentation for the specific development order or permit. The Technical Review Committee shall then review the application for completeness in a timely manner to ensure that the required information is sufficient to accept the application and continue its review. 
(2)  Development review . When the application for development has been accepted, it shall be processed and reviewed for impacts of the development on the public facilities and services identified in this division. 
(3)  Concurrency review . The concurrency review shall compare the available and reserved capacity of the facility or service to the demand projected for the proposed development. The available capacity shall be determined by adding the total of the existing excess capacity and the total future capacity of any proposed construction or expansion that meets the requirements of section 29.6. The levels of service (LOS) of all facilities and services must be sufficient before a development permit can be issued. 
a.  Traffic restriction and traffic concern areas . Traffic restriction and concern areas shall be designated on an annual basis at the time the annual concurrency monitoring report is issued. These areas will be designated based on the criteria defined in section 29.2. Applications for development permits within these areas may require detailed traffic studies. 
1.  If the development is found to be in a traffic restriction area, a traffic study shall be required. If the traffic study indicates that the affected roadway is not significantly degraded, the project will be found concurrent for traffic. 
2.  If the development is found to be in a traffic concern area, a traffic study may be required. If the traffic study indicates that the affected roadway LOS may be lowered below the adopted LOS, the project will be found concurrent for traffic only if provisions and measures are attached as conditions to prevent the reduction of the LOS. 
3.  If the development is found to be in a traffic restriction or traffic concern area and the traffic study indicates that the affected roadway is significantly degraded, the project will be found concurrent for traffic only if provisions and measures are attached as conditions to prevent the significant degradation of the affected roadway. 
4.  If the development is not found to be in a traffic restriction or traffic concern area but the estimated traffic volumes resulting from the development degrade the peak hour LOS below the adopted LOS standard, the project will be found concurrent for traffic only if mitigation provisions are attached as conditions to prevent the degradation of the affected roadway below the adopted LOS standard. 
(4)  Certificate of concurrency . 
a.  The certificate of concurrency shall indicate the date of issuance and shall automatically expire simultaneously with the expiration of the development permit to which it applies. In the event that a time extension is requested prior to the expiration of the development permit, then the accompanying certificate of concurrency may be renewed upon determination by the Technical Review Committee that the conditions of concurrency will still be met. 
b.  Any development order or permit that is issued within the effective period of a validly issued certificate of concurrency shall be vested for the purposes of concurrency until the expiration of that development order or permit, provided that development commences within the validity period of the development order or permit and continues in good faith. 
(5)  Development order or development permit compliance . 
a.  Any development orders and development permits approved and issued after the effective date of this division shall be based upon and in compliance with the certificate of concurrency issued for that application. 
(b)  The burden of showing compliance with the adopted levels of service and meeting the concurrency evaluation shall be upon the applicant. For non-exempt development orders or projects, the applicant shall prepare and submit an infrastructure study that determines the extent of any degradation of the infrastructure below the adopted levels of service unless determined unnecessary by the City's Technical Review Committee based on an evaluation of potential impact relative to the nature, size, type, and location of the proposed development project or land use amendment application. Mitigation fees and/or physical or operational improvements determined to be reasonably required in proportion to the impacts caused by the increased density and/or intensity of new development in consideration of the long-term concurrency management plan of the local government who owns and operates the facility or system, shall be stipulated as conditions of approval as part of the development order. The Technical Review Committee shall document its findings pertaining to its review.

Sec. 29.12. - Proportionate fair share program. 
(a)  General requirements . 
(1)  An applicant may choose to satisfy the transportation concurrency requirements of the city by making a proportionate fair-share contribution, pursuant to the following requirements: 
a.  The proposed development is consistent with the comprehensive plan and applicable land development regulations; and 
b.  The five-year schedule of capital improvements for St. Pete Beach includes a transportation improvement(s) that, upon completion, will mitigate the transportation impacts of the proposed development in accordance with the requirements of this subsection. 
(2)  The applicant may also choose to satisfy transportation concurrency by contributing to an improvement that, upon completion, will satisfy the requirements of this subsection, but that is not contained in the Schedule where the following apply: 
a.  St. Pete Beach adopts, by resolution or ordinance, a commitment to add the improvement to the schedule no later than the next regularly scheduled update. To qualify for consideration under this subsection, the proposed improvement must be determined to be consistent with the comprehensive plan, and in compliance with the provisions of this subsection. 
b.  If the funds allocated for the schedule are insufficient to fully fund construction of a transportation improvement required for the applicant to comply with the terms of this subsection, the city may enter into a binding proportionate fair-share agreement with the applicant authorizing construction of that amount of development on which the proportionate fair-share is calculated if the proportionate fair-share amount in such agreement is sufficient to pay for one or more improvements which will significantly benefit the impacted transportation system. 
c.  The improvement or improvements funded by the proportionate fair-share component must be adopted into the schedule. 
d.  Any improvement project proposed to meet the applicant's fair-share obligation must meet design standards of the city, county and FDOT as applicable. 
(b)  Proportionate fair share mitigation agreement . 
(1)  Upon notification that a proposed development project is subject to transportation concurrency regulations and is eligible to participate in the proportionate fair share program, the applicant shall be notified in writing of such during the site plan review process pursuant to section 5.1 of Division 5 herein.. 
(2)  If the applicant chooses to exercise this concurrency option, a meeting shall be held to discuss eligibility, application submittal requirements, potential mitigation options, and related issues. If the impacted facility is on the SIS, then the FDOT will be notified and invited to participate in the meeting. 
(3)  Pursuant to F.S. § 163.3180(16)(e), proposed proportionate fair-share mitigation for development impacts to facilities on the SIS requires the concurrence of the FDOT. Therefore, agreements involving improvements to SIS facilities will require approval by FDOT. 
(4)  After a mitigation project is identified and agreed upon by the city, the applicant and FDOT (if the project affects an SIS facility), a proposed proportionate fair-share obligation and binding agreement will be prepared by the city or the applicant with direction from the city. The final agreement will become a part of the site plan submittal which will be delivered to the appropriate parties for review. Final approval of the site plan and agreement rests with the city manager. 
(c)  Determining proportionate fair-share obligation . 
(1)  The proportionate fair-share obligation shall be based on the impact a development has on a transportation facility as determined by a traffic impact analysis that assesses the volume of traffic generated by the proposed development. 
(2)  A facility shall be considered impacted when the net trips generated by the proposed development meets or exceeds five percent of the facility's peak hour capacity. 
(3)  Should the impacted facility be operating at an LOS that meets the locally adopted LOS standard, it would not be eligible for the application of proportionate fair share provisions. 
(4)  Should the impacted facility be operating at a substandard LOS based on existing conditions or as a result of the impacts of a proposed development, the facility would be identified as eligible for proportionate fair share provisions and the applicant would be notified as such. 
(5)  Proportionate fair-share mitigation for concurrency impacts may include, without limitation, separately or collectively, private funds, contributions of land, and construction and contribution of facilities. 
(6)  A development shall not be required to pay more than its proportionate fair-share. The fair market value of the proportionate fair-share mitigation for the impacted facilities shall not differ regardless of the method of mitigation. 
(7)  The methodology used to calculate an applicant's proportionate fair-share obligation shall be as provided for in F.S. § 163.3180(12), as follows: 
The cumulative number of trips from the proposed development expected to reach roadways during peak hours from the complete build out of a stage or phase being approved, divided by the change in the peak hour maximum service volume (MSV) of roadways resulting from construction of an improvement necessary to maintain the adopted LOS, multiplied by the construction cost, at the time of developer payment, of the improvement necessary to maintain the adopted LOS. 
OR 
Proportionate Fair-Share = S[[(Development Trips;sub \sub;) / (SV Increase;sub \sub;)] x Cost;sub \sub;] 
Where: 
Development Trips;sub \sub; = Those trips from the stage or phase of development under review that are assigned to roadway segment "i" and have triggered a deficiency per the CMS; 
SV Increase;sub \sub; = Service volume increase provided by the eligible improvement to roadway segment "i"; 
Cost;sub \sub; = Adjusted cost of the improvement to segment "i". Cost shall include all improvements and associated costs, such as design, right-of-way acquisition, planning, engineering, inspection, and physical development costs directly associated with construction at the anticipated cost in the year it will be incurred. 
(8)  For the purposes of determining proportionate fair-share obligations, the city shall determine improvement costs based upon the actual cost of the improvement as obtained from the MPO transportation improvement program. Where such information is not available, improvement cost shall be determined using one of the methods described below. 
a.  An analysis by the city of construction costs that incorporates data from recent projects and is updated annually; or 
b.  The most recent issue of FDOT transportation costs, as adjusted based upon the type of cross-section (urban or rural); locally available data from recent projects on acquisition, drainage and utility costs; and significant changes in the cost of materials due to unforeseeable events. Cost estimates for state road improvements not included in the adopted FDOT work program shall be determined using this method in coordination with the FDOT district. 
(9)  The value of a proportionate fair share mitigation project proposed by the applicant and accepted by the city shall be determined using one of the methods provided in this subsection. 
(10)  The city may also accept right-of-way dedication for the proportionate fair-share payment credit for the dedication shall be based on fair market value established by an independent appraisal approved by the city and at no expense to the city. The applicant shall supply a drawing and legal description of the land and a certificate of title or title search of the land to the city at no expense to the city. If the estimated value of the right-of-way dedication proposed by the applicant is less than the estimated total proportionate fair-share obligation for that development, then the applicant must also pay the difference. 
(d)  Impact fee credit for proportionate fair-share mitigation . 
(1)  Proportionate fair-share contributions shall be applied as a credit against impact fees consistent with the terms of the impact fee section of section 41.6 of the Land Development Code. 
(2)  Impact fee credits for the proportionate fair-share contribution will be determined when the transportation impact fee obligation is calculated for the proposed development. Impact fees owed by the applicant will be reduced per the proportionate fair-share agreement as they become due per the impact fee section of section 41.6 of the Land Development Code. If the applicant's proportionate fair-share obligation is less than the development's anticipated road impact fee for the specific stage or phase of development under review, then the applicant or its successor must pay the remaining impact fee amount to the city. 
(e)  Proportionate fair-share agreements . 
(1)  Upon execution of a proportionate fair-share agreement, the applicant shall receive transportation concurrency approval or functional equivalent. Should the applicant fail to apply for a development permit in accordance with section 29.4(1), then the agreement shall be considered null and void, and the applicant shall be required to reapply. 
(2)  Payment of the proportionate fair-share contribution is due in full prior to issuance of the final development order or recording of the final plat and shall be non-refundable. If the payment is submitted more than 12 months from the date of execution of the agreement, then the proportionate fair-share cost shall be recalculated at the time of payment based on the best estimate of the construction cost of the required improvement at the time of payment, pursuant to section 29.11(c) and adjusted accordingly. 
(3)  All proportionate fair share mitigation improvements authorized under this subsection must be completed prior to issuance of a development permit, or as otherwise established in a binding agreement that is accompanied by a security instrument that is sufficient to ensure the completion of all required improvements. It is the intent of this subsection that any required improvements be completed before issuance of building permits or certificates of occupancy. 
(4)  Dedication of necessary right-of-way for facility improvements pursuant to a proportionate fair-share agreement must be completed prior to issuance of the final development order or recording of the final plat. 
(5)  Any requested change to a development project subsequent to a development order may be subject to additional proportionate fair-share contributions to the extent the change would generate additional traffic that would require mitigation. 
(6)  Applicants may submit a letter to withdraw from the proportionate fair-share agreement at any time prior to the execution of the agreement. 
(7)  The city may enter into proportionate fair-share agreements for selected corridor improvements to facilitate collaboration among multiple applicants on improvements to a shared transportation facility. 
(f)  Appropriation of fair-share revenues . 
(1)  Proportionate fair-share revenues shall be placed in the appropriate project account for funding of scheduled improvements in the CIE, or as otherwise established in the terms of the proportionate fair-share agreement. Proportionate fair-share revenues may be used for operational improvements prior to construction of the capacity project from which the proportionate fair-share revenues were derived. Proportionate fair-share revenues may also be used as the 50 percent local match for funding under the FDOT Transportation Regional Incentive Program (TRIP). 
(2)  In the event a scheduled proportionate fair share improvement is removed from the CIE, then the revenues collected for its construction may be applied toward the construction of another improvement within the same corridor or planning sector that would mitigate the impacts of development pursuant to the requirements of section 29.11(a)(2)b. 
(3)  Where an impacted facility has been designated as a regionally significant transportation facility in an adopted regional transportation plan, the city may coordinate with other impacted jurisdictions and agencies to apply proportionate fair-share contributions and public contributions to seek funding for improving the impacted regional facility under the FDOT TRIP. Such coordination shall be ratified by the city through an interlocal agreement that establishes a procedure for earmarking the developer contributions for this purpose. 
(4)  Where an applicant constructs a transportation facility that exceeds their proportionate fair-share obligation calculated under section 29.11(c)(7), the city shall reimburse them for the excess contribution using one or more of the following methods: 
a.  An impact fee credit account may be established for the applicant in the amount of the excess contribution, a portion or all of which may be assigned and reassigned under the terms and conditions acceptable to the city. 
b.  An account may be established for the applicant for the purpose of reimbursing the applicant for the excess contribution with proportionate fair-share payments from future applicants on the facility. 
c.  The city may compensate the applicant for the excess contribution through payment or some combination of means acceptable to the city and the applicant. 
(g)  Cross jurisdictional impacts . 
(1)  In the interest of intergovernmental coordination and to reflect the shared responsibilities for managing development and concurrency, the city may enter into an agreement with one or more adjacent local governments to address cross jurisdictional impacts of development on multi-jurisdictional transportation facilities. The agreement shall provide for application of the methodology in this subsection to address the cross jurisdictional transportation impacts of development. 
(2)  A development application submitted subject to transportation concurrency requirements and meeting all of the criteria listed below shall be subject to this subsection. 
a.  All or part of the proposed development is located within an area or corridor designated by an adjacent local government where development projects are subject to transportation concurrency requirements in accordance with their respective land development codes. 
b.  If the additional traffic from the proposed development would use five percent or more of the adopted peak hour LOS maximum service volume of a multi-jurisdictional transportation facility within the concurrency jurisdiction of the adjacent local government ("impacted multi-jurisdictional facility"). 
c.  The impacted multi-jurisdictional facility is projected to be operating below the level of service standard, adopted by the adjacent local government, when the traffic from the proposed development is included. 
(3)  Upon identification of an impacted multi-jurisdictional facility, the city shall notify the applicant and the affected adjacent local government in writing of the opportunity to derive an additional proportionate fair-share contribution, based on the projected impacts of the proposed development on the impacted adjacent facility. 
(4)  The adjacent local government shall have up to 90 days in which to notify the city of a proposed specific proportionate fair-share obligation, and the intended use of the funds when received. The adjacent local government must provide reasonable justification that both the amount of the payment and its intended use comply with the requirements of F.S. § 163.3180. Should the adjacent local government decline proportionate fair-share mitigation under this subsection, then the provisions of this subsection would not apply and the applicant would be subject only to the proportionate fair share requirements of the city. 
(5)  If the subject application is subsequently approved by the city, the approval shall include a condition that the applicant provides, prior to the issuance of any building permit covered by that application, evidence that the proportionate fair-share obligation to the adjacent local government has been satisfied.

Sec. 39.4. - Use of prototypes. 
    Development prototypes are intended to provide general guidance for the physical design of new projects within the Community Redevelopment District. These prototypes indicate general patterns for building placement, landscape configuration and the location of parking facilities and access points. The prototypes provide for consistency of site layout within a flexible framework which addresses the individual features of specific sites. 
    Permitted block types are described within a single-use prototype for illustrative purposes. Development applications for specific sites are required to assemble structures into blocks when the development is over two acres. Each site plan shall be required to identify how the proposed development including buildings and structures are assembled within a context that conforms to the design standards for the block or partial block within which the building occurs. 
(a)  Development prototype structure. The development prototype structures are a series of figures that highlight some of the regulations. The prototypes are shown in a block format and individual parcel development may not be able to build to the form of a block. However, all development, at a minimum, will be expected to build to the building design, site design and lot layout. If development of an entire block occurs, the prototype shall be used as a development tool. 
The mixed-use development prototypes are designed to accommodate a range of retail, office and mixed-use building types including "anchor" retail, "liner" retail, and "main street" retail buildings. The Multi-Family Development Block is designed to accommodate a range of multi-family building types including apartment buildings, condominiums and town homes. 
(b)  Specific development prototype standards. 
"Main Street" Retail. The Main Street Retail building type permits multi-story, mixed-use buildings with retail and office uses on the ground floor. 
"Liner" Retail. The Liner Retail building type permits single-story retail uses along "A" Street frontages. 
"Anchor" Retail. The Anchor Retail building type permits grocery stores and larger format retail within the retail development block. The maximum size of an "anchor" retail use is 30,000 square feet. At least one building entrance shall face a public street and shall be articulated with additional height and massing. 
Shelter. Buildings shall incorporate arcades, roofs, alcoves, porticos or awnings that protect pedestrians from the rain and sun. 
Setback encroachment. Special architectural features, such as balconies, bay windows, arcades, awnings, etc. may project into front setbacks and public right-of-ways on streets provided they are eight feet above the sidewalk and leave a minimum five-foot wide unobstructed sidewalk. Support structures for these features shall be located such that they do not affect the clear sight triangle for travel lanes or the on-street parking. Prior to new encroachment into the public right-of-way, a permit shall be obtained from the city manager or designee. 
Garages. Street-facing ground floor parking, including garages, is not permitted on the first floor of a multifamily structure on an "A" street. Parking shall occur underneath the multifamily structure, within parking garages, or within surface lots that do not front on a "Main street" Street.

DIVISION 43 - PLANNED DEVELOPMENT DISTRICTS 

Sec. 43.1. - Purpose and intent. 
    It is the intent of the planned development district to provide for developments that incorporate complimentary uses and innovative design features that promote aesthetic quality and superior functionality of optimal density development. It is not the intent of the district to simply avoid the requirements and criteria which are found in the standard districts of the Land Development Code. Planned development districts shall be districts specifically approved by the city commission for the establishment of integrated groupings of residential, commercial or office uses developed under a single, unified plan. It is the intent of these regulations to provide for development of such districts at appropriate locations, in accordance with the goals, objectives, policies, and other criteria of the Comprehensive Plan, and in accord with the requirements of this division 
    Planned development districts are intended to be established for specialized projects where the proposed project warrants greater flexibility than a standard zoning district provides. Planned developments may be established to permit developments where the innovative use of buffering and design techniques mitigate the external impacts of development and create a unique physical environment. The utilization of a planned development district allows for a compatible mixture of uses with appropriate relationships of exterior and interior space and the preservation of desirable natural features. 
    Planned development district regulations are intended to accomplish the purposes of zoning and other applicable regulations to an equivalent or higher degree than the use of standard zoning districts, and are intended to promote economical and efficient land use, improved amenities, and harmonious and creative design.

When located in an area where land uses and/or intensities or densities vary, planned development districts shall be designed in such a manner as to provide for the most gradual change in intensity and/or density feasible. 
(4)  Access. Principal vehicular access points shall be designed to encourage smooth traffic flow with controlled turning movements and minimum hazards to vehicular or pedestrian traffic. Plans shall provide for functional and logical transportation linkages to adjacent commercial properties. Vehicular access to streets from off-street parking areas shall be so designed and located as to provide for convenient and safe movement of vehicles. Pedestrian access shall, to the extent possible, be separated from vehicular access points in order to reduce congestion and safety hazards. All private streets in planned developments shall be designed and constructed in accordance with city standards for public road construction. 
(5)  Service areas. Facilities and access routes for deliveries, servicing and maintenance shall be located and arranged to prevent interference with pedestrian and vehicular traffic. Loading zones shall be located to minimize conflict with through traffic. 
(6)  Pedestrian systems. All planned development districts shall provide internal and/or external sidewalks where reasonably required for adequate pedestrian circulation. The site plan shall provide for the efficient grouping of structures, uses, and open spaces in a manner which facilitates pedestrian movement between origins and destinations within, and adjacent to, the district. 
(7)  Natural and historic features, and conservation and preservation areas. Planned development districts shall be designed to preserve natural and historic features, such as existing trees, natural topography, and archaeological and historic sites, to the extent reasonably possible.
