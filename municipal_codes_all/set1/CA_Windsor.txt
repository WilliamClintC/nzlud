A Codification of the General Ordinances of 
Windsor, California

PREFACE 
    The Windsor, California Municipal Code, originally published by Coded Systems, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 20, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this Code current by regular supplementation. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company. 
    The Code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 20, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific Code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance 2019-332 , passed April 3, 2019.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 20, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    As of Supplement No. 20, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 20, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No.20, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, the pages of this code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. 20, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM. Electronic files enable us not only to get you your code more quickly but also ensure that it is error-free.

c.  The alteration or modification of any existing structure which is connected to an on-site disposal system or water system requiring a permit from the health officer where the alteration or modification may impose additional burdens upon the existing system, such as, but not limited to, the addition of rooms or the modification of floor plans for potential additional occupancy.

A copy of the notice shall be delivered to the Department of Building Safety concurrently with service upon the permittee. Should such action be initiated by the Public Health Officer, no final disposition shall be made in the matter by the Department of Building Safety or the Board of Building Appeals unless such disposition is approved in writing by the Public Health Officer. The Public Health Officer or his/her duly appointed representative may enter, during reasonable times, and in accordance with law, upon buildings, structures or premises in the Town to perform any duty imposed upon him/her by this chapter. 
    Whenever a property owner requests a certificate from the Health Officer, certifying that the premises comply with all existing laws and regulations enforced by the Health Officer in respect to sewage disposal systems and water supply, a fee shall be charged as set by resolution of the Council. No charge shall be made for a check of premises at the request of the owner thereof where no certificate is required.

    Any condition imposed on an application shall be designed to mitigate the specific, adverse impact upon health and safety at the lowest possible cost. 
    The Department shall use its best efforts to ensure that the selected method, condition, or mitigation meets the conditions of subparagraphs (A) and (B) of paragraph (1) of subdivision (d) of Section 714 of the Civil Code defining restrictions that do not significantly increase the cost of the system or significantly decrease its efficiency or specified performance. 
    The Department shall not condition approval of an application on the approval of an association, as defined in Section 4080 of the Civil Code. 
    If an application is deemed incomplete, a written correction notice detailing all deficiencies in the application and any additional information or documentation required to be eligible for expedited permit issuance shall be sent to the applicant for resubmission. 
    Only one inspection shall be required and performed by the Department for small residential rooftop solar energy systems eligible for expedited review. If the Department and the Windsor Fire Protection District (Fire District) have entered into an agreement allowing the Department to perform fire safety inspections of eligible rooftop solar energy systems on behalf of the Fire District, a separate fire inspection of the system is not required. 
    The inspection shall be done in a timely manner and should include consolidated inspections. An inspection will be scheduled within two (2) business days of a request and provide a two-hour inspection window. 
    If a small residential rooftop solar energy system fails inspection, a subsequent inspection is authorized but need not conform to the requirements of this article.

TITLE VIII - MOBILE HOME REGULATIONS 
CHAPTER 1. - RENT STABILIZATION 
Article 1. - Findings and Purpose; Definitions 

8-1-100 - Findings and Purpose. 
a.  In 1985 the Sonoma County Town Council recognized that a serious problem of rapidly increasing mobile home park space rents existed in the unincorporated areas of Sonoma County. In 1986 the Board retained an experienced consultant, Connerly & Associates, Inc., to conduct a market survey of mobile home parks and mobile home park residents in the County. 
b.  In January, 1987, Connerly and Associates, Inc., submitted to the Board a written report detailing their findings, which were as follows: 
1.  The majority of mobile homes in the County are located in rented spaces in mobile home parks. 
2.  In the unincorporated area of the County, there are seventy-five (75) mobile home parks containing three thousand six hundred fifty-nine (3,659) spaces (in 1986). 
3.  Mobile homes in mobile home parks provide an important alternative form of housing for a substantial number of County residents. 
4.  The majority of mobile home park residents are age sixty-five (65) or older. 
5.  The median income of mobile home park residents in unincorporated County areas is fourteen thousand ($14,000.00) dollars per year, which is defined by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development as "lower" income (in 1986). 
6.  In the unincorporated County areas, about forty-three (43%) percent of mobile home park residents are defined as "very low" income recipients according to the HUD definition of that term (in 1986). 
7.  Seventy (70%) percent of mobile home park resident households have at least one (1) retired member whose primary source of income is Social Security payments. 
8.  During the past three (3) years, median mobile home park space rents have increased by eighteen point one (18.1%) percent. 
9.  A majority of mobile home park residents in the County pay more than twenty-five (25%) percent of their income for housing. 
10.  A large majority of mobile home park residents own the mobile homes which they occupy and many of these residents have substantial loan payments to meet in addition to rent payments. 
11.  The median estimates sales value of a mobile home in a mobile home park exceeds thirty thousand ($30,000.00) dollars. 
12.  Many mobile home park residents were born in Sonoma County or have lived in the County for ten (10) years or more. 
13.  The vacancy rate among mobile home park spaces is zero point three (0.3%) percent (in 1986). 
14.  The cost of moving a mobile home is in the range of two thousand nine hundred ($2,900.00) dollars to four thousand ($4,000.00) dollars or more (in 1986). 
c.  The Town Council reviewed the above conclusions on March 16, 1987, and found them to be true and correct. In reviewing a new rent control survey prepared by Connerly and Associates in early 1992, the Town Council found a profound need for continued mobile home space, and, in special circumstances, recreational vehicle space rent control. The Town Council found the 1992 survey, its data and its conclusions to be true and correct, and took particular note of the following: 
1.  Mobile homes and manufactured housing have represented an affordable form of shelter to millions of Californians with modest incomes. This has been especially true for elderly persons living on fixed Social Security or retirement incomes. 
2.  A vacancy rate of one point two (1.2%) percent in 1991 and vacancy rates of typically one (1%) percent or less over the past five (5) years have given mobile home park owners a virtual oligopoly where market forces do not influence space rental pricing. 
3.  Typical moving costs for mobile homes from one mobile home park to another (if vacant spaces could be located) range from approximately five thousand ($5,000.00) dollars to nine thousand four hundred ($9,400.00) dollars depending upon the size of the mobile home. 
4.  The average annual rent increase proposed by park owners between 1987 and 1991 was thirteen point two (13.2%) percent annum. Pursuant to the rent stabilization ordinance, an average less than half (1/2) the proposed percentage rent increase was authorized during those years. 
5.  Persons over sixty-five (65) comprised over half (1/2) of the mobile home park population. 
6.  Of those survey respondents reporting their level of income, forty-three (43%) percent were very low-income (fifty (50%) percent or less of the median county income), and twenty-seven (27%) percent were lower-income (fifty (50%) percent - eighty (80%) percent of the median County income). 
7.  Few residents reported substantial assets which they could draw upon to meet future housing expenses. Fewer than half (1/2) of the respondents had thirty thousand ($30,000.00) dollars or more in assets (excluding the value of their mobile homes). 
8.  Under the County's voluntary mediation program between 1985 and 1987, park owners proposed annual rent increases averaging nine point six (9.6%) percent, nearly four (4) times the rate of general price increases according to the CPI for Sonoma County. After mandatory arbitration was established, and the current rent control ordinance adopted, requested rent increases were generally twice or more of the approved rent increases. Approved rent increases, on the average, began to mirror the CPI. 
9.  The mobile home space rent stabilization program has succeeded in its broad objectives and should be expanded to address additional problem areas. 
10.  The Town Council found that it would be desirable to include long-term recreational vehicle space tenants in mobile home parks under the rent stabilization program. Such tenants in mobile home parks appear to be similarly situated to mobile home tenants except for the vehicular character of their dwellings. Although mobile, recreational vehicles in mobile home parks are "trapped" by the low vacancy rate within mobile home parks. Transient recreational vehicle parks are not amenable to the type of permanent residency needs of permanent recreational vehicle space tenants. 
11.  The Town Council found that it would be desirable to provide prospective mobile home park tenants with an option to choose between a long-term lease and a periodic tenancy of less than one (1) year in duration. The terms offered under typical long-term leases by some park owners are excessively long, oppressive, one-sided adhesion agreements. Such an option furthers a legitimate governmental objective and is not in conflict with or preempted by State law. 
12.  The Town Council found that, on average, several dozen mobile homes are sold or offered for sale each year in Sonoma County. The sale of these mobile homes on-site subjects mobile home coach owners to unreasonably suppressed resale rates due to oppressively high rental adjustments upon rent decontrol. The Town Council found that it would be desirable to provide vacancy control in its rent stabilization program as hereunder provided. 
13.  The need for effective and fair mobile home park space rent stabilization continues to exist in Sonoma County in 1992 as it did in 1986. 
(Ord. No. 92-25 § 1) 
8-1-105 - Additional Findings and Purpose. 
a.  Based on the aforementioned findings, the County of Sonoma enacted County Ordinance 4667. As County Ordinance 4667 forms the basis of this section, to the extent necessary and appropriate the Town Council hereby incorporates the consultant's study and the County's findings. In addition, the Town Council finds the following. 
Statistically, the mobile home park vacancy rate averages under one (1%) percent with a shortage of parks, and no new ones being built. The cost of moving a mobile home today is exorbitant and averages over six thousand ($6,000.00) dollars. Over fifty (50%) percent of the residents are over sixty-five (65); Social Security is the primary source of income for over seventy (70%) percent and many residents are either single or widowed. 
This is true affordable housing and needs to be preserved. There is a great need to prevent excessive space rent increases which could result in threats to health and safety and possible economic eviction. 
b.  The purpose of this section is to stabilize the rate of mobile home park space rental in order to: 
1.  Prevent exploitation of the shortage of vacant mobile home park spaces; 
2.  Prevent excessive and unreasonable mobile home park space rent increases; 
3.  Rectify the disparity of bargaining power which exists between mobile home park residents and mobile home park owners; 
4.  Provide mobile home park owners with a guaranteed rate of annual space rent increase which accurately reflects the rate of inflation and increases in their expenses; 
5.  Provide a process for ensuring mobile home park owners a fair, just and reasonable rate of return on their parks in cases where the guaranteed annual space rent increase provided by this section proves insufficient. 
(Ord. No. 92-25 § 2) 
8-1-110 - Definitions. 
    As used in this section: 
    Affected tenants shall mean those tenants whose space is not covered by a valid lease meeting the requirements as outlined in Section 798.17(b) of the California Civil Code. Such tenants are to be notified that a space rent increase is to become effective. 
Arbitrator shall mean a person (1) who is neither a tenant as that term is defined in this section nor who has an interest in a mobile home park of a nature that would require disqualification under the provisions of the Political Reform Act if the person were an elected state official; and (2) a person whom the Clerk of the Windsor Mobile Home Space Rent Stabilization Program (see definition of "Clerk" below) determines meets one of the following criteria: 
1.  Completion of a Juris Doctor or equivalent degree from a school of law and completion of a formal course of training in arbitration which, in the sole judgement of the Clerk of the Windsor Mobile Home Space Rent Stabilization Program, provides that person with the knowledge and skills to conduct a space rent dispute arbitration in a professional and successful manner; or 
2.  Completion of at least three (3) arbitration proceedings for a Superior Court or other public entity that involved issues the Clerk of the Windsor Mobile Home Space Rent Stabilization Program finds similar to those raised in space rent dispute; or 
3.  Served as a California Superior or Municipal Court pro tempore judge. 
Base rent shall mean the authorized rent, calculated pursuant to the provisions of Section 8-1-200, plus any rent increase allowed under this section or any rent adjustment attributable to vacancy decontrol as provided in Section 8-1-340. 
Clerk shall mean the Clerk of the Windsor Mobile Home Space Rent Stabilization Program, who shall be the Town Manager or his or her designee. 
Capital improvements means those improvements that materially add to the value of the property and appreciably prolong its useful life or adapt it to new uses, and which may be amortized over the useful remaining life of the improvements to the property. The term "capital improvements" does not include those costs associated with the normal maintenance and upkeep of facilities and premises which were reasonable intended to be part of consideration provided by the mobile home park as rent. Substantial rehabilitation of the park that is necessitated as a result of the park owner's neglect, permissive waste, deferred maintenance or acts of God shall not be regarded to be capital improvements to the extent that they restore facilities and premises to the conditions reasonably bargained for by the mobile home park tenants. Proposed capital improvements claims must set forth an amortization table spreading the cost of the improvement over its proven useful life. Such costs must be separately itemized, if approved, on the monthly rent invoice. Monthly rent shall be decreased for such amortized capital improvement expenses at the end of the amortization period. Failure to do so shall be regarded to be an unauthorized increase in rent. Capital improvements must be for the primary benefit, use and enjoyment of the tenants of the entire park, and costs must be allocated over all beneficiaries of the improvement. 
Consumer price index shall mean the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers, San Francisco-Oakland Area, published by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Labor Statistics. 
Housing services shall mean a service provided by the owner related to the use of occupancy of a mobile home space, which is neither a capital improvement nor substantial rehabilitation as those terms are defined herein, including but not limited to, repairs. replacement, maintenance, painting, lighting, heat, water, laundry facilities, refuse removal, recreational facilities, parking, security service and employee services. 
Mobile home shall mean a structure designed for human habitation and for being moved on a street or highway under permit pursuant to Section 35790 of the California Vehicle Code. "Mobile Home" includes a manufactured home, as defined in Section 18007 of the California Health and Safety Code, and a mobile home, as defined in Section 18008 of the California Health and Safety Code, but does not include a recreational vehicle, as defined in Section 799.24 of the California Civil Code and Section 18010 of the California Health and Safety Code, or a commercial coach, as defined in Section 18001.8 of the California Health and Safety Code except when such a vehicle has continuously remained within a mobile home park for a period in excess of nine (9) months. 
Mobile home park shall mean any area of land within the Town of Windsor where two (2) or more mobile home spaces are rented, or held out for rent, to accommodate mobile homes used for human habitation. 
Mobile home park owner shall mean any owner, lessor, or sublessor of a mobile home park in the incorporated areas of the Town who receives or is entitled to receive rent for the use or occupancy of any mobile home space thereof, and the representative, agent, or successor of such owner, lessor, or sublessor, and who reports to the Internal Revenue Service any income received or loss of income resulting from such ownership or claims any expenses, credits or deductions because of such ownership. 
Mobile home space shall mean any site within a mobile home park located in the Town intended, designed or used for the location or accommodation of a mobile home and any accessory structures or appurtenances attached thereto or used in conjunction therewith except: (1) sites rented together and concurrently with a mobile home provided by the mobile home park owner, and (2) "new construction" as defined by Civil Code Section 798.45. The term "mobile home space" shall also include, for purposes of the rent stabilization ordinance codified in this chapter and accompanying fee ordinance, rentable spaces within mobile home parks which have been occupied by a "recreational vehicle" as defined by Civil Code Section 799.24 for a period of nine (9) months or more. 
Mobile home space tenant means a tenant, subtenant, lessee, or sublessee or any other person entitled to the use or occupancy of any mobile home space not otherwise a party to a rental agreement exempt from regulation under this section pursuant to Civil Code Section 798.17. 
Net operating income shall mean net operating income as defined in Section 8-1-240a. 
Owner shall mean a mobile home park owner. 
Party shall mean and refers to any affected mobile home tenant and/or owner involved in proceedings under this chapter. 
Percent change in consumer price index shall mean the annual percent change in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), calculated to the nearest tenth, published for the month of July, issued in the month of August. In the event that an index is not published for the month of July, the closest preceding month for which an index is published shall be used. It is the intent of this section to fix the CPI in the beginning of the fiscal year (for the rest of that fiscal year) barring an unforeseen failure to publish a CPI for the month of July. 
Rent shall mean mobile home space rent. 
Rent increase means any additional space rent demanded of or paid by a tenant for a mobile home space including any reduction in housing services without a corresponding reduction in the amount demanded or paid for rent. Said increase shall be (i) uniform in percentage rate relative to current base rent for all spaces subject to the increase; or (ii) uniform in dollar amount relative to base rent for all spaces subject to the increase. Failure to reduce rent at the end of an amortization period for a capital improvement or for separately billed utilities will also be regarded to constitute an authorized rent increase for the purpose of this chapter. 
Rent stabilization administration fee shall mean the fee established by resolution of the Town Council in accordance with the provisions of Section 8-1-300 herein. 
Space rent shall mean the total consideration, including any bonus, benefit, or gratuity, demanded or received by a mobile home park owner for or in connection with the use or occupancy of a mobile home space or any housing services provided with the mobile home space. Space rent shall not include any amount paid for the use or occupancy or a mobile home dwelling unit, unless the amount paid for the use or occupancy of a mobile home is or includes consideration paid to a mobile home park owner under a rental agreement or other document evidencing tenancy of the mobile home. Space rent shall also not include the proportional amount of the Fire Protection Special Tax (originally imposed via Ordinance No. 3540 R of the County of Sonoma) attributable to a particular mobile home space. 
Substantial rehabilitation shall mean that work done by an owner to a mobile home space or to the common areas of the mobile home park, exclusive of a capital improvement as that term is defined herein, the value of which exceeds two hundred ($200.00) dollars and which is performed whether to secure compliance with any State or local law or to repair damage resulting from fire, earthquake, or other casualty or natural disaster, to the extent such work is not reimbursed by insurance. 
Tenant shall mean mobile home space tenant. 
Tenant-to-be shall mean a person who is not currently a tenant in a mobile home park but is a prospective mobile home space tenant who desires the use of a mobile home space as defined in this chapter and has presented himself/herself to the park owner as such.

*  Editor's Note: This chapter was adopted by Ordinance No. 92-25 on October 28, 1992. 
b.  If a park owner wishes to apportion to each space on a pro rata basis the allowable percentage of any current rent stabilization administration fee, in addition to any increase of space rent in accordance with subsection a. of this section, the following provisions shall apply: 
1.  The owner shall provide to all affected tenants documentation supporting the allowable amount to be collected in order to recover a portion of rent stabilization administration fees. At a minimum such documentation shall include: billing notices or other equivalent documents from the Town imposing the rent stabilization administration fee; a copy of Section 8-1-300 which authorizes the apportionment of rent stabilization administration fees; the calculations used by the owner to apportion the cost of the allowable percentage among the affected tenants. In addition, the owner shall provide all affected tenants with the address and telephone number of the Clerk and the fact that the affected tenant is encouraged to contact the Clerk for an explanation of the provisions of this chapter. 
2.  A rent increase approved pursuant to the provisions of this section and in accordance with the procedure set forth in Section 8-1-215 of this chapter shall not be considered part of the rent base upon which future rent increases can be made. 
c.  In the event an owner wishes to increase the rent payable for any mobile home space within a twelve (12) month period more than the amount permitted in subsection a. of this section for any reason other than that stated in subsection b. of this section, the procedures set forth in Sections 8-1-210 and 8-1-215 shall be followed. In the event an owner wishes to increase the rent payable for any mobile home space within a twelve (12) month period more than three hundred (300%) percent of the percentage change in the CPI, a mandatory meet-and-confer and arbitration shall automatically be required to show good cause why such an increase is necessary. The arbitrator may reduce this proposed increase to a figure determined upon by the evidence submitted by the park owner or his or her representative to be a fair return on investment. 
d.  A notice of rent increase given by an owner pursuant to subsection a., b. or c. of this section shall be given in writing at least ninety (90) days before any rent increase is to take effect. 
e.  A notice of rent increase incorporating within it a proposed capital improvement which is not otherwise authorized as a pass-through pursuant to Civil Code Section 798.49 must be claimed within twelve (12) months of completion of the project, construction or final billing.

Erroneous use of this notice shall be regarded as an irrevocable stipulation to the jurisdiction of the arbitrator. 
c.  The park owner shall also serve any tenant-to-be as defined in Section 8-1-110 with a separate "RENTAL OPTION" notice which sets forth the recitation in capital letters set forth in Section 8-1-220, Rights of a "Tenant-To-Be." 
d.  An owner failing to provide an affected tenant or tenant-to-be with the information, documents and notices required by this section shall not be entitled to collect any rent increase otherwise authorized by this section from that tenant nor to any rent increase that might otherwise be awarded by an arbitrator. Such failure by the owner shall be a defense in any action brought by the owner to recover possession of a mobile home space or to collect any rent increase from the tenant. An owner may cure the failure to serve any notice or meet the obligation to provide information to a tenant or tenant-to-be which is required under this section by giving such notice or information before initiating an action for possession of the space or collecting any rent increase or binding a tenant-to-be to a month-to-month rental/long term lease election otherwise authorized hereunder. 
e.  An affected tenant who is given notice of a rent increase is entitled to file a Petition for Space Rent Review as provided in Section 8-1-215 in spite of the fact that the owner has failed to provide the affected tenant(s) with all the information, documents and notices required by this section. 
(Ord. No. 92-25 § 6; Ord. No. 95-70 § 3; Ord. No. 2001-147 § 3) 
8-1-215 - The Rent Dispute Resolution Process. 
a.  Mandatory Meet-and-Confer Meeting. Except when a parkowner elects rent increases permitted under Section 8-1-205(a), the tenants and parkowners must, within seven (7) working days of the notice of rent increase, meet and confer with each other's representatives at the Office of the Sonoma County Community Development Commission. Written notice of the time, place and date of the meeting should be arranged within forty-eight (48) working hours of the notice of the rent increase. If the parkowners or tenants fail to agree on the time, place and date of the hearing within that forty-eight (48) hour span and provide due notice to the Clerk, the meeting shall be set at the convenience of the Clerk. At the meeting, representatives of the parties should exchange documentary evidence that the parties in good faith then know will be used to support their respective positions in an arbitration and discuss the issues in dispute. In the case of a parkowner, all financial data upon which any proposed increase is claimed shall be supplied to tenant representatives at the time of the meet-and-confer meeting. 
1.  Sanctions. A parkowner's failure to provide the minimum information required by this section set forth under subsection a.2. below or attend the hearing shall require the Clerk to suspend further proceedings under this section. The park owner's application for a rent increase under such circumstances shall be deemed defective, without force or effect, and deemed withdrawn. Renoticing of the increase shall be required to reinitiate an application for rent increase. 
2.  Minimum Meet-and-Confer Information. The park owner has a duty to provide adequate information to the tenants regarding the park's net operating income sufficient for a reasonably sophisticated inquiry into the financial status of the park owner's business. This will consist of true and accurate book entries or other competent evidence of gross income including, but not limited to, gross rents, interest upon security and cleaning deposits, income from ancillary services (submetering of utilities, laundry facilities, etc.) and true and accurate book entries or other competent evidence of operating expenses including, but not limited to, license fees, property taxes, utilities, insurance, management expenses, landlord performed labor, building and grounds maintenance, legal fees, auto and truck expenses, employee benefits, permits, refuse removal, ground lease payments, and similar expense. 
b.  Petition. If discussions between owner and tenants do not resolve the dispute between them, the tenants or their representative shall file with the Clerk, a Petition for Space Rent Review and a copy of the notice of rent increase, if available, within twenty-one (21) days after the date upon which the rent increase notice was received. The Clerk shall not accept a petition for filing unless it has been signed by at least fifty-one (51%) percent of all affected tenants. Upon the filing of a petition, the rent increase is not effective and may not be collected until and to the extent it is awarded by an arbitrator or until the petition is abandoned. As used herein, the term "abandoned" refers to the lack of prosecution of the arbitration by the mobile home tenants' representative(s). An automatic arbitration based upon a three hundred (300%) percent CPI increase will not require active tenant prosecution, although such prosecution will not be prohibited. The term "prosecution" refers to actively pursuing necessary steps towards preparing the tenants' case for the arbitration hearing. 
c.  Contents of Petition. 
1.  The Petition for Space Rent Review shall set forth the total number of affected rented spaces in the mobile home park, shall identify the space occupied by each tenant and shall state the date upon which the notice of the rent increase was received by the tenant(s). 
2.  After obtaining the required signatures, the tenant(s) shall deliver the petition or mail it by registered or certified mail to the Clerk at the following address: P.O. Box 100, Windsor, California, 95492 (or successor address). No petition shall be accepted unless it is accompanied by the requisite number of signatures and is received in the office of the Clerk within the twenty-one (21) day period set forth in subsection b. of this section. The Clerk shall provide a copy of the completed petition form to both parties and the arbitrator forthwith or within five (5) working days. 
d.  Information Questionnaire. After the Clerk has accepted a Petition for Space Rent Review, the Clerk shall remit to the owner and tenants an information questionnaire in such form as the Clerk may prescribe. The completed information questionnaire shall be returned to the Clerk at least five (5) working days prior to the date scheduled for hearing of the petition by the arbitrator. Copies of the completed information questionnaire shall be provided to the arbitrator and the opposing party. 
e.  Assignment of Arbitrator and Hearing Date. Upon receipt of the petition, or in the event of an automatic arbitration, or upon an affected tenant's claim of a vacancy control violation where an authorized rent increase has been sought, the Clerk shall, within five (5) working days, assign an arbitrator. The Clerk shall set a date for the arbitration hearing no sooner than five (5) nor later than ten (10) working days after the arbitrator is assigned. The owner and affected tenant(s) shall be notified immediately in writing by the Clerk of the date, time and place of the hearing and this notice shall be served either in person or by ordinary mail. 
f.  Arbitration Hearing. 
1.  The owner and tenant(s) may appear at the hearing and offer oral and documentary evidence. Both the owner and tenant(s) may designate a representative or representatives to appear for them at the hearing. The arbitrator may grant or order one (1) continuance for not more than five (5) days from the date of the initial hearing. The burden of proving that the amount of rent increase is reasonable shall be on the owner by a preponderance of the evidence. The hearing need not be conducted according to technical rules relating to evidence and witnesses. The rules of evidence and manner of producing evidence shall be those rules set forth in Section 11513 of the California Government Code for the conduct of hearings under the Administrative Procedure Act. These rules may be relaxed at the discretion of the arbitrator in the interests of justice. 
2.  The arbitrator shall, within fourteen (14) days of the hearing, submit by mail a written statement of decision and the reasons for the decision to the Clerk who shall forthwith distribute by mail copies of the decision to the owner and tenant(s). The arbitrator shall determine the amount of rent increase, if any, which is reasonable based upon all the provisions of this chapter. 
3.  The arbitrator shall not allow more than one (1) rent increase per park per twelve (12) month rent period. 
4.  The decision of the arbitrator, rendered in accordance with this section, shall be final and binding upon the owner and all affected tenants. The decision of the arbitrator will be subject to the provision of CCP Section 1094.5. 
5.  Any party may have electronic recording equipment or a court reporter present to record and prepare a transcript of the hearing before the arbitrator, however, such equipment or reporter shall be provided at that party's own expense. 
6.  The arbitrator is authorized to modify the basic time periods set forth herein at his or her discretion to promote the purposes of this program provided a final decision is rendered within ninety (90) days of the notice of rent increase. 
7.  Any procedural or jurisdictional dispute regarding the processes set forth herein may be decided by the arbitrator. 
g.  Tenant's Right to Contact Clerk. The tenant may contact the Clerk of the Windsor Mobile Home Space Rent Stabilization Program for an explanation of the provisions of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 92-25 § 7; Ord. No. 95-70 § 4; Ord. No. 2001-147 § 4) 
8-1-220 - Rights of a Tenant-To-Be. 
    Any person who is a "tenant-to-be" as defined in Section 8-1-110 shall be offered the option of renting a mobile home space in a manner which will permit the "tenant-to-be" to receive the benefits of the Mobile Home Space Rent Stabilization Program, which includes, but is not limited to, rental of a mobile home space on a month-to-month basis. Such a person cannot be denied the option of a tenancy twelve (12) months or less in duration. The park owner shall provide each "tenant-to-be" with a written notification of the option which shall make the following recitation: "UNDER WINDSOR ORDINANCE NO. 92-25, SECTION VIII, YOU ARE LEGALLY ENTITLED TO ELECT A MONTH-TO-MONTH TENANCY OVER ANY OTHER LONGER PERIODIC TENANCY. YOU ARE ADVISED THAT YOU MAY NOT BE ENTITLED TO RENT STABILIZATION (RENT CONTROL) PROGRAM BENEFITS IF YOU ELECT A LEASE OF MORE THAN TWELVE (12) MONTHS IN DURATION IF THAT LEASE MEETS THE REQUIREMENTS OF CIVIL CODE SECTION 798.17, WHICH HAS BEEN ATTACHED HERETO." Any effort to circumvent the requirements of this section shall be unlawful, as well as an unfair business practice subject to enforcement under Business and Professions Code Section 17200 et seq. The rights set forth above have no application to mobile home spaces subject to a more-than-twelve (12)-month lease. By definition, tenants-to-be are prospective "mobile home space tenants," and such tenants are defined by Section 8-1-110 as excluding a "party to a rental agreement exempt from regulation under this article pursuant to Civil Code Section 798.17. 
(Ord. No. 92-25 § 8; Ord. No. 2001-147 § 5) 
8-1-225 - Subpoena Power. 
    Subpoenas, including subpoenas duces tecum, requiring a person to attend a particular time and place to testify as a witness, may be issued in connection with any dispute pending before an arbitrator, and shall be issued at the request of the Clerk, an arbitrator, the tenant(s) or the owner. Subpoenas shall be issued and attested by the Clerk of the Town Council. A subpoena duces tecum shall be issued only upon the filing with the Clerk of the Town Council of an affidavit showing good cause for the production of the matters of things desired to be produced, setting forth in full detail the materiality thereof to the issues involved in the proceedings, and stating that the witness has the desired matters or things in his or her possession or under his or her control, and a copy of such affidavit shall be served with the subpoena. Any subpoena or subpoena duces tecum issued pursuant to the provisions of this chapter may be served in person or by certified mail, return receipt requested, and must be served at least five (5) days before the hearing for which the attendance is sought. Service by certified mail shall be complete on the date of receipt. Any subpoena or subpoena duces tecum issued pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed issued by and in the name of the Windsor Town Council. 
(Ord. No. 92-25 § 9) 
8-1-230 - Consolidations of Petitions. 
    As soon as possible after a petition has been filed with respect to mobile home spaces which are within a single park, the Clerk shall, to the extent possible, consistent with the time limitations provided herein, consolidate petitions involving ten (10) or fewer affected tenants. 
(Ord. No. 92-25 § 10) 
8-1-235 - Standards of Review. 
    In evaluating the space increase proposed or imposed by the owner, the following factors may be considered: 
a.  Unavoidable increases in maintenance and operating expenses, including but not limited to the reasonable value of the owner's labor and any increased costs for services provided by a public agency, public utility, or quasi-public agency or utility; provided, however, that any increased costs in rent stabilization administration fees shall be subject to the provisions of Sections 8-1-205b. and 8-1-210; 
b.  The substantial rehabilitation or the addition of capital improvements, including the reasonable value of the owner's labor, as long as such rehabilitation or improvement has been completed and is: 
1.  Distinguished from ordinary repair or maintenance, 
2.  For the primary benefit, use and enjoyment of the tenants, 
3.  Permanently fixed in place or relatively immobile and dedicated to the use of the property, 
4.  Not coin-operated nor one for which a "use fee" or other charge is imposed on tenants for its use, 
5.  Cost-factored and amortized over the good faith estimate of the remaining useful life of the rehabilitation or improvement, and 
6.  Does not constitute maintenance of the infrastructure of gas or electrical lines within the mobile home park for which the public utility has permitted the park owner a special premium with the intent that it be used to replace or otherwise maintain the system within the mobile home park; 
c.  Increased costs of debt service due to a sale or involuntary refinancing of the park within twelve (12) months of the increase provided that: 
1.  The sale or refinancing is found to have been an arm's length transaction, 
2.  The proceeds of such refinancing are found to have been used for park improvements or similar park-related uses, 
3.  The aggregate amount from which total debt service costs arise constitutes no more than seventy (70%) percent of the value of the property as established by a lender's appraisal; 
d.  The rental history of the space or the park of which it is a part, including: 
1.  The presence or absence of past increases, 
2.  The frequency of past rent increases, 
3.  The occupancy rate of the park in comparison to comparable parks in the same general area; 
e.  The physical condition of the mobile home space or park of which it is a part, including the quantity and quality of maintenance and repairs performed during the preceding twelve (12) months; 
f.  Any increase or reduction of housing services since the last rent increase; 
g.  Existing space rents for comparable spaces in comparable parks; 
h.  A decrease in "net operating income" as defined in Section 8-1-240a; 
i.  A fair return on the property prorated among the spaces of the park; 
j.  Other financial information which the owner is willing to provide; 
k.  Any costs incurred as a result of a natural disaster and only to the extent such costs have not been reimbursed to the owner by insurance or other sources. 
(Ord. No. 92-25 § 11) 
8-1-240 - Net Operating Income. 
    In evaluating a space rent increase imposed by an owner to maintain the owner's net operating income from the park, the following definitions and provisions shall apply: 
a.  Net operating income of the mobile home park shall mean the gross income of the park less the operating expenses of the park. 
b.  Gross income shall mean the sum of the following: 
1.  Gross space rents, computed as gross space rental income at one hundred (100%) percent occupancy; plus 
2.  Other income generated as a result of the operation of the park, including, but not limited to, fees for services actually rendered; plus 
3.  Revenue received by the park owner from the sale of gas and electricity to park residents where such utilities are billed individually to the park residents by the park owner. This revenue shall equal the total cost of the utilities to the residents minus the amount paid by the park owner for such utilities to the utility provider; minus 
4.  Uncollected space rents due to vacancy and bad debts to the extent that the same are beyond the park owner's control. Uncollected space rents in excess of three (3%) percent of gross space rent shall be presumed to be unreasonable unless established otherwise and shall not be included in computing gross income. Where uncollected space rents must be estimated, the average of the preceding three (3) years' experience shall be used. 
c.  Operating Expenses means: 
1.  Real property taxes and assessments; 
2.  Utility costs to the extent that they are included in space rent; 
3.  Management expenses including the compensation of administrative personnel, including the value of any mobile home space offered as part of compensation for such services, reasonable and necessary advertising to ensure occupancy only, legal and accounting services as permitted herein, and other managerial expenses. Management expenses are presumed to be not more than five (5%) percent of gross income, unless established otherwise; 
4.  Normal repair and maintenance expenses for the grounds and common facilities including but not limited to landscaping, cleaning, and repair of equipment and facilities; 
5.  Owner-performed labor in operating or maintaining the park. In addition to the management expenses listed above, where the owner performs managerial or maintenance services which are uncompensated, the owner may include the reasonable value of such services. Owner-performed labor shall be limited to five (5%) percent of gross income unless the arbitrator finds that such a limitation would be substantially unfair in a given case. A park owner must devote substantially all of his or her time, that is, at least forty (40) hours per week, to performing such managerial or maintenance services in order to warrant the full five (5%) percent credit for his or her labor as an operating expense. No credit for such services shall be authorized unless a park owner documents the hours utilized in performing such services and the nature of the services provided; 
6.  Operating supplies such as janitorial supplies, gardening supplies, stationery, and so forth; 
7.  Insurance premiums prorated over the life of the policy; 
8.  Other taxes, fees, and permits, except as provided in Section 8-1-300 herein; 
9.  Expenditures for capital improvements to upgrade existing facilities or increase amenities or services shall be an allowable operating expense only if the park owner has: 
(a)  Established upon written verification, or by other competent evidence to the satisfaction of the arbitrator, that the cost of the capital improvements provided to the park residents, for their general use, is factually correct as claimed; 
(b)  Said capital improvements are wholly compensable to the park owner upon appropriate amortization or their cost, together with a reasonable return upon the capital improvement investment made by the park owner; 
(c)  Any capital improvement expenses shall be amortized over the reasonable life of the improvement of such other period as may be deemed reasonable by the arbitrator under the circumstances. In the event that the capital improvement expenditure is necessitated as a result of an accident, disaster, or other event for which the park owner received insurance benefits, only those capital improvement costs otherwise allowable exceeding the insurance benefits may be calculated as operating expenses. 
10.  Involuntary refinancing of mortgage or debt principal. A park owner may, under the provisions of this subsection, be able to include certain debt service costs as an operating expense. Such costs are limited to increases in interest payments from those interest payments made during 1986 of the first year such payments were made if the owner acquired the park after 1986 which result from one of the following situations or the equivalent thereof: 
(a)  Refinancing of the outstanding principal owed for the acquisition of a park where such refinancing is mandated by the terms of a financing transaction entered into prior to January 1, 1987, for instance, termination of a loan with a balloon payment, or 
(b)  Increased interest costs incurred as a result of a variable interest rate loan used to finance the acquisition of the park and entered into prior to January 1, 1987; 
In refinancing, increased interest shall be permitted to be considered as an operating expense only where the park owner can show that the terms of the refinancing were reasonable and consistent with prudent business practices under the circumstances. 
d.  Operating expenses shall not include the following: 
1.  Debt service expenses, except as provided in subsection c.11. of this section; 
2.  Depreciation; 
3.  Any expense for which the park owner is reimbursed; 
4.  Attorneys' fees and costs, except printing costs and documentation as required by Section 8-1-300, incurred in proceedings before an arbitrator or in connection with legal proceedings challenging the decision of an arbitrator or the validity or applicability of this chapter. 
e.  All operating expenses must be reasonable. Whenever a particular expense exceeds the normal industry or other comparable standard, the park owner shall bear the burden of providing the reasonableness of the expense. To the extent that an arbitrator finds any such expense to be unreasonable, the arbitrator shall adjust the expense to reflect the normal industry or other comparable standard 
(Ord. No. 92-25 § 12; Ord. No. 95-70 § 5; Ord. No. 2001-147 § 6) 
8-1-245 - Obligations of the Parties. 
a.  If a final decision by an arbitrator finds that a proposed increase or any portion thereof that was previously inoperative is justified, the tenant shall pay the amount found justified to the owner within thirty (30) days after the decision is made. 
b.  If a final decision by an arbitrator finds that an increase or any portion thereof is not justified, the owner shall refund any amount found to be unjustified, but that had been paid, to the tenant within thirty (30) days after the decision is made. If such refund is not made within the said thirty (30) days, the tenant may withhold the amount from the next space rent(s) due until the full amount of the refund has been made. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the event that the tenancy of tenant is terminated for any reason prior to full credit against rent, the balance of the credit due the tenant shall be paid by the owner within thirty (30) days from the date of the termination of the tenancy. 
c.  Any sum of money that under the provisions of this section is the obligation of the owner or tenant, as the case may be, shall constitute a debt and, subject to the foregoing provisions of this section, may be collected in any manner provided by law for the collection of debts. 
(Ord. No. 92-25 § 13) 
8-1-250 - Tenant's Rights of Refusal. 
    A tenant may refuse to pay any increase in rent which is in violation of this chapter, provided a petition has been filed and either no final decision has been reached by an arbitrator or the increase has been determined to violate the provisions of this chapter. Such refusal to pay shall be a defense in any action brought to recover possession of a mobile home space or to collect the rent increase. 
(Ord. No. 92-25 § 14) 
8-1-255 - Retaliatory Acts; Tenants' Right to Organize; Petitions to Waive Rights are Without Effect. 
a.  No owner may retaliate against a tenant or tenant-to-be for the tenant's or tenant-to-be's assertion or exercise of rights under this chapter in any manner, including but not limited to, threatening to bring or bringing an action to recover possession of a mobile home space; engaging in any form of harassment that causes a tenant to quit the premises; dissuades a tenant-to-be from freely exercising his or her legal options to choose a month-to-month rental; decreasing housing services; increasing the space rent; or imposing or increasing a security deposit or any other charge payable by a tenant. The tenants have a right to organize a tenants' association without hindrance from the park owner and to exercise these rights as provided under the provisions of this Code. This association may be referred to as "Park Tenants Association at <park name>." 
b.  The distribution of a petition or other documents seeking to have mobile home tenants waive rights, abandon a filed petition or in any way affect the entitlement of the tenants to participate in the rent stabilization process authorized under the this Code shall be without force or legal effect within the Town's rent stabilization program. Such documents shall not affect the right of any tenant to participate in the rights, remedies, procedures, and processes set forth in this chapter. Efforts to utilize such documents to discourage participation in the Town's rent stabilization program may be deemed retaliatory. 
(Ord. No. 92-25 § 15; Ord. No. 95-70 § 6) 
Article 3. - Administration 

8-1-300 - Fees. 
    The costs of administration of this chapter shall be borne by the Town of Windsor, subject to reimbursement of the Town General Fund by imposition of a rent stabilization administration fee chargeable against each mobile home space in the Town. The park owner who pays these fees may pass through fifty (50%) percent of the fees assessed against a mobile home space to the tenant pursuant to the provisions of Section 8-1-205b. herein. This fee pass-through must take place no later than twelve (12) months after the park owner is billed for the program administration fees. Failure to timely pass-through fifty (50%) percent of the fees assessed against a mobile home space will result in the loss of the park owner's right to do so. The remaining fifty (50%) percent of the fees assessed against a mobile home space shall not be passed on in any way to tenants. Fees passed through to tenants as herein authorized shall not be considered a part of the rent base upon which future rent increases can be made. 
The fees imposed by this section shall be paid annually. The time and manner of payment, delinquency status, and assessment and collection of penalties for delinquent payment of the fees imposed by this section shall be as provided by separate resolution of the Town Council. The Clerk shall recommend to the Town from time to time the amount of such fee and the Town Council shall adopt such fee by ordinance or resolution. 
(Ord. No. 92-25 § 16; Ord. No. 95-70 § 7) 
8-1-305 - Exemption from Fees. 
    Any park owner who believes that he/she may be entitled to a space fee exemption pursuant to Civil Code Section 798.17(b), having provided the park tenant with a legally recognized long-term lease which is not subject to rent stabilization administration fees, shall provide the Clerk with the following documentation: 
a.  The executed lease for each exempt space claimed; 
b.  Amendments to the exempt lease, if any; 
c.  For a newly constructed space, proof that the space was constructed after January 1, 1990 (building permits, etc.) 
(Ord. No. 92-25 § 17) 
8-1-310 - Nonwaiverability. 
    Any provision, whether oral or written, in or pertaining to a rental agreement whereby any provision of this chapter is waived or modified, is against public policy and void except with respect to any rental agreement complying with all of the terms and conditions set forth in Section 798.17 of the California Civil Code (as amended 1986). 
(Ord. No. 92-25 § 18) 
8-1-315 - Penalties and Remedies. 
    In addition to those penalties and remedies set forth elsewhere in this chapter, the following remedies shall apply: 
Any owner who demands, accepts, receives or retains any money as rent from a tenant to which the owner is not entitled under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to the tenant for any actual damages, attorney's fees and costs incurred by the tenant as a consequence thereof plus a penalty in the sum of three (3) times the amount of money the owner accepted, received or retained in violation of the provisions of this chapter or five hundred ($500.00) dollars, whichever is greater. 
(Ord. No. 92-25 § 19) 
8-1-320 - Rights of Affected Tenants Reserved. 
    This chapter shall not be construed to limit or curtail any other action or proceeding which may be pursued by an affected tenant against an owner before any Court or other body having jurisdiction thereof. 
(Ord. No. 92-25 § 20) 
8-1-330 - Review by the Town Council. 
    The Town Council shall review the effectiveness of this chapter in addressing the problems giving rise to its enactment at least one (1) year from its enactment. Notice of the time and place of the Town Council's review shall be published at least ten (10) days prior to the date in a newspaper of general circulation in the Town. 
(Ord. No. 92-25 § 22) 
8-1-335 - Severability. 
    This chapter shall be liberally construed to achieve its purposes and preserve its validity. If any provision or clause of this chapter or application thereof to any person or circumstances is held invalid, such invalidity shall not affect other provisions or applications of this chapter which can be given effect without the invalid provision or application, and to this end the provisions of this chapter are declared to be severable and are intended to have independent validity. 
(Ord. No. 92-25 § 23) 
8-1-340 - Vacancy Control-Establishment of New Base Rent. 
a.  A mobile home park owner shall be permitted to charge a new base rent for a mobile home space whenever a lawful space vacancy occurs. For purposes of this chapter, a lawful space vacancy is defined as follows: 
1.  A vacancy occurring because of the termination of the tenancy of the affected mobile home tenant in accordance with the Mobile Home Residency Law, California Civil Code Sections 798.55 through 798.60, as amended; or 
2.  A vacancy of the mobile home space arising from the voluntary removal of a mobile home from the mobile home space by the affected mobile home tenant. A removal of the mobile home from the space for the purpose of performing rehabilitation or capital improvements to the space or for the purpose of upgrading the mobile home shall not constitute a voluntary removal of the mobile home. 
b.  When a new base rent is established following the vacancy of a mobile home space pursuant to this section, the park owner shall give written notice to the new affected tenant of the twelve (12) month anniversary date for rent increases allowed under Section 8-1-205 and shall give written notice to such affected tenant that the space rent may be subject to stabilized rent increases pursuant to the provisions of this chapter. 
c.  In the absence of a lawful vacancy, a park owner is prohibited from raising rent upon a sale of a mobile home on-site to a tenant-to-be or current tenant. 
(Ord. No. 92-25 § 24; Ord. No. 96-74 § 2) 
8-1-345 - When Recreational Vehicle Space Tenants are to Be Treated as "Affected Tenants." 
    Any recreational vehicle space that is occupied by a recreational vehicle as defined in Civil Code Section 799.24 for a period in excess of nine (9) months on or after October 1, 1991, shall be regarded to be a "mobile home space" for purposes of this chapter, and a tenant upon such a space shall be entitled to all the rights, protections and obligations of this chapter. Such a space tenant shall be counted as an "affected tenant" upon the effective date of this chapter, and the space shall be subject to the fees authorized by the Town Council for mobile home spaces. The space tenant and the recreational vehicle park owner shall apportion the fee in the manner authorized for mobile home spaces subject to this chapter generally. 
(Ord. No. 92-25 § 25) 
8-1-350 - Suspension; Invalidity. 
    Should any provision of this section be suspended or otherwise held invalid in any judicial, or other, proceeding, then, in such event, the provisions of this section shall not be operative and the Council hereby ordains that the provision of mobile home rent stabilization, as it existed prior to the enactment of this chapter shall remain in full force and effect. 
(Ord. No. 92-25 § 26) 
CHAPTER 2. - CONVERSION OF MOBILE HOME PARKS TO OTHER USES 

8-2-100 - Findings. 
    The Town Council hereby does find and determine that the following local conditions and circumstances exist within the Town of Windsor and that they make necessary and appropriate the regulations contained within this ordinance: 
a.  Statistically, the mobile home park vacancy rate averages under one (1%) percent, with a shortage of parks, and no new ones being built. The cost of moving a mobile home today is exorbitant and averages over six thousand ($6,000.00) dollars. Over fifty (50%) percent of the residents are over sixty-five (65)-social security is the primary source of income for over seventy (70%) percent and many residents are either single or widowed. This is affordable housing and needs to be preserved. There is a great need to prevent excessive space rent increases which could result in threats to health and safety and possible economic eviction. 
b.  Closure of such a park would have a substantial adverse economic effect on these residents. When a mobile home in an existing park is sold it is generally sold in place; a mobile home in an existing park is not often moved from its location once it has been placed in a park. There are a few vacant spaces in the mobile home parks within the immediate vicinity of the Town, and the number of vacant spaces in Sonoma County is small. Relocating homeowners in an area in excess of thirty (30) miles from their existing home creates a special hardship, particularly for elderly residents, who need to be in social service support networks. A move in excess of thirty (30) miles would seriously disrupt these support resources, would jeopardize the jobs of those residents currently employed, and would not constitute adequate replacement housing for such residents. 
c.  Due to the above circumstances, spaces in the existing mobile home park in the Town represent an important component of the housing stock of the Town especially for senior citizens and persons of low/moderate incomes. 
d.  Unless mitigation measures are undertaken, the conversion of mobile home parks to other uses would have a substantial adverse economic effect upon the homeowners and residents in terms of cost of relocation, including the significantly higher cost of other types of housing in the immediate area if such homeowners cannot relocate to other mobile home parks. Mobile home owners often have invested substantial sums in the acquisition, installation and maintenance of their mobile homes. For most residents, these units represent their sole or principal financial asset. One result of conversion, unless mitigated, can be the destruction of the value of the mobile home. This destruction of value would be a direct cost of relocation and would adversely affect the homeowners' ability to find adequate replacement housing, so that it is important to provide reasonable relocation assistance to avoid such an adverse effect. 
e.  It is the policy of State law, as enunciated in Government Code Sections 65863.7 and 66427.4, that prior to the conversion of a mobile home park to other uses, or prior to the closure of a park or the cessation of use of the land as a mobile home park, or at the time of filing of a subdivision map for a subdivision resulting from any such conversion, the proponent of the proposed change of use must file a report on the impact of such change with the public agency having jurisdiction over the mobile home park, and the agency shall have the power to require measures to be undertaken to mitigate the adverse impacts of such conversion upon the ability of displaced residents to find adequate replacement housing. 
(Ord. No. 95-58 § 1) 
8-2-105 - Purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to provide for procedures and standards for the conversion, closure, or cessation of use of a mobile home park so as to implement State law, to mitigate the adverse impacts of park closure on the displaced residents' ability to find adequate replacement housing, taking into account the particular local conditions existing within the Town of Windsor, while providing economically viable and reasonable use of the mobile home park land to park owners. This chapter will serve to inform park owners and homeowners of their respective rights and obligations, including specific identification of the reasonable costs of relocation so as to promote certainty between the parties and to achieve the purposes of this chapter. It is important to adopt these standards both for existing and future parks, so that both existing and future park owners and homeowners are apprised of their obligations and rights.

a.  Whenever twenty (20%) percent or more of the total number of mobile home sites of a mobile home park are uninhabited and such situation was not caused by physical disaster, including but not limited to, fire, flood, storm, earthquake, landslide, or by another condition beyond the control of the owner of the mobile home park, the owner of such park shall file with the Town Manager a written notice to such effect. For purposes of this chapter, a mobile home site is "uninhabited" when it is either (1) unoccupied by a mobile home, or (2) occupied by a mobile home in which no persons reside. The existence of the condition described in this section, when determined by the procedures of this section, shall be deemed a "change of use" for purposes of this chapter. 
b.  Whenever a resident of a mobile home park or other interested person has reason to believe that such park is uninhabited and that such situation was not caused by physical disaster, including but not limited to fire, flood, storm, earthquake, landslide, or by another condition beyond the control of the owner of the mobile home park, such resident may file a written statement to that effect with the Town Manager. Such statement shall indicate the particular sites which the resident or other interested person believes to be uninhabited.

c.  Upon the filing of a notice pursuant to paragraph a. or the making of the determinations pursuant to paragraph b., the Town Manager shall transmit to the owner of the mobile home park a written notice by certified mail, return receipt requested, or by personal service, which notice shall state, if a notice was filed pursuant to paragraph a., that the mobile home park is determined to be undergoing a change of use, or, if the determination was made pursuant to paragraph b., or, if the determination was made pursuant to paragraph b., that such park is determined to be undergoing or not to be undergoing a change of use, as the case may be. If the determination was made pursuant to paragraph b., written notice thereof shall be given to the owner or the mobile home park, the person who filed the statement and the mobile home park residents. A notice of determination of change of use shall also direct the owner to prepare a report pursuant to Section 8-2-120 and the Town Manager shall establish a reasonable period of time for the preparation of such report. Upon the filing of a completed report, a hearing date before the Planning Commission will be set by the Council.

The provisions of this section shall not be applicable if an application for conversion of a mobile home park has been filed pursuant to this chapter prior to the filing of a notice pursuant to paragraph a., or of a written statement pursuant to paragraph b., where such application is pending. 
f.  For purposes of the ensuing sections of this chapter, the owner of a mobile home park whose mobile home park shall have been determined by the Town Manager to be undergoing a change of use shall be deemed to be an "applicant".

8-2-135 - Mitigation of Adverse Impacts and Reasonable Costs of Relocation. 
a.  The applicant shall include within the report the steps the owner proposes to mitigate any adverse impact on the ability of displaced park residents to find adequate housing in a mobile home park, including the reasonable costs of relocation. The Town Council, upon reviewing the report and recommendation of the Planning Commission, shall require the applicant to take steps to mitigate such adverse impact which shall not exceed the reasonable costs of relocation, except where and to the extent that any such applicant shall have been exempted from any such requirement pursuant to Section 8-2-140. 
1.  As used in this section, the reasonable costs of relocation shall include: the cost of relocating a displaced homeowners' mobile home, accessories and possessions to a comparable mobile home park within thirty (30) miles of its existing location, including costs of disassembly, removal, transportation, and reinstallation of the mobile home and accessories at the new site, and replacement or reconstruction of blocks, skirting, siding, porches, decks, awnings or earthquake bracing if necessitated by the relocation; indemnification for any damage to personal property of the resident caused by the relocation; reasonable living expenses of displaced park residents from the date of actual displacement until the date of occupancy at the new site; payment of any security deposit required at the new site; and the difference between the rent paid in the existing park and any higher rent at the new site for the first twelve (12) months of the relocated tenancy. 
2.  If the Town Council determines that a particular mobile home cannot be relocated to a comparable mobile home park within thirty (30) miles of its existing location, and the homeowner has elected to sell his or her mobile home, the reasonable costs of relocation shall include the cost of purchasing the mobile home of a displaced home owner at its in-place market value. Such value shall be determined after consideration of relevant factors, including the value of the mobile home in its current location, assuming the continuation of the mobile home park in a safe, sanitary and well-maintained condition, and not considering the effect of the change of use on the value of the mobile home. Any interested person may present evidence on any relevant factors in determining in-place value. The appraisal is to be made no more than sixty (60) days prior to its submittal. 
3.  All eligible homeowners and all mobile home tenants of eligible homeowners shall be provided with the services of one (1) or more housing experts to assist them in relocating to available and adequate housing upon their request. Any such experts shall be those approved pursuant to Section 8-2-120b., 12. herein. 
4.  For those who move to a multiple or two (2)-family dwelling, provision of a rent subsidy for up to twenty-four (24) months. Rent shall not exceed the fair market rent for new construction and substantial rehabilitation for the Sonoma County area as established by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development. "Rent subsidy" is the difference between the rent of the multiple or two (2)-family dwelling and the rent of the mobile home space or mobile home on the date of the notice of intention to convert. 
b.  No benefits shall be provided to any person who is renting a mobile home from the owner of the mobile home park where such person shall have executed a written agreement with such mobile home park owner waiving his or her rights to any such benefits. No such waiver shall be valid unless it contains the text of this section, and unless such person shall have executed a written acknowledgment that he or she has read and understands his or her rights pursuant to this chapter and knowingly agrees to waive them. 
c.  In order to facilitate the intentions of the homeowners or tenants and an applicant for a change of use with regard to a change of use, the parties may agree to other mutually satisfactory relocation assistance. To be valid such an agreement shall be in writing, shall include a provision stating that the homeowner or tenant is aware of the provisions of this ordinance, shall include a copy of this ordinance as an attachment, shall include a provision in at least ten (10) point type which clearly states the right to seek and the importance of obtaining an attorney's advice prior to signing the agreement, and shall be drafted in form and content otherwise required by applicable State law. No person signing a relocation assistance agreement provided for in this section may contest the adequacy of the report at the hearing on such report. 
d.  No waiver by an eligible mobile home owner or mobile home tenant of any of his or her rights pursuant to this section shall be valid or effective for any purpose except with regard to a relocation assistance agreement as provided in paragraph c. herein. 
(Ord. No. 95-58 § 8) 
8-2-140 - Application for Exemption from Relocation Obligations. 
a.  Any person who files an application for change of use of a mobile home park may, simultaneously with such application, file an application for total or partial exemption from the obligation to provide relocation costs and assistance pursuant to Section 8-2-135. The owner of a mobile home park as to whom the Town Manager has made a determination of change of use pursuant to Section 8-2-125 may also file such an application for exemption not later than thirty (30) days from the transmittal of the notice of determination by the Town Manager pursuant to Section 8-2-125. 
b.  If such application is filed, notice of such application, with the information contained therein, distribution thereof to the residents of the mobile home park, and discussion of the application at the informational meeting shall be accomplished pursuant to Section 8-2-130. 
c.  Any such application shall state that it is made on either or both of the following bases: 
1.  That imposition of the full relocation obligations would eliminate substantially all reasonable use or economic value of the current use or of alternative use of the property. 
2.  That a court of competent jurisdiction has determined in connection with a proceeding in bankruptcy that the closure or cessation of use of the property as a mobile home park is necessary, and that such court has taken further action which would prohibit or preclude payment of relocation assistance benefits, in whole or in part. 
d.  Any such application made pursuant to paragraph c., 1. shall contain adequate documentation that the conditions set forth in paragraph c. exist. The Town Manager may request such additional documentation, reports and information as he or she deems necessary to evaluate the application. Such information may include: 
1.  Statements of profit and loss from the operations of the mobile home park for the most recent five (5) year period of the date of the application or request, certified by a certified public accountant. 
2.  The estimated total of relocation costs which would otherwise be required to be provided pursuant to this chapter, which shall be based upon documented surveys of available mobile home sites within Sonoma County, residents of the park who would elect to relocate and those who would elect to sell their mobile homes, and the value of the mobile homes in the park based upon recent sales of representative mobile homes in the park. 
3.  An estimate of the value of the mobile home park by a qualified real estate appraiser if the park were permitted to be developed for the use proposed in the application for change of use of the park, and an estimate of the value of such park by such appraiser if use of the property as a mobile home park is continued. 
4.  Such other information which the applicant believes to be pertinent or which may be required by the Town Manager. 
e.  Any such application filed pursuant to paragraph c., 2. shall be accompanied by adequate documentation as to the title, case number, and court in which the bankruptcy proceeding was held, and copies of all pertinent judgments, orders, and decrees of such court. 
(Ord. No. 95-58 § 9) 
8-2-145 - Application for Conversion; Public Hearings; Findings. 
a.  When a request or application has been made or filed under a General Plan amendment, rezoning, tentative map, use permit, site development permit or other discretionary development permit for the proposed change of use of a mobile home park, a public hearing shall be held on the report and on any application for exemption from relocation assistance obligations either in conjunction with or prior to the public hearings held by the Planning Commission and Town Council on the amendment, rezoning, map, or permits sought. 
b.  The Planning Commission shall make a recommendation to the Town Council on the adequacy of the report, or on any application for exemption from relocation obligations. 
c.  Upon receipt of the Planning Commission' s recommendations, the Town Council shall hold a public hearing and shall make one (1) of the following determinations: 
1.  That the report does or does not comply with the requirements of the Town Code. If the Town Council determines that the conversion impact report does not comply with one (1) or more requirements of the Town Code, the Town Council shall indicate in which respects the report does not comply with any such requirement. If land use permits for the change of use are approved, the Town Council may condition such approvals upon specified amendments to the report. 
2.  That specified conditions shall be imposed upon the change of use to mitigate adverse impacts upon the ability of displaced homeowners and tenants to find adequate replacement housing in a mobile home park and to require that reasonable costs of relocation be paid as set forth in the Town Code. 
3.  Where an application for an exemption from relocation assistance has been made the Town Council shall make one (1) of the following findings: 
(a)  That the applicant shall not be exempt from relocation assistance obligations because sufficient evidence has not been shown that the cost of relocation which would otherwise be required by this chapter would eliminate substantially all reasonable use or economic value of the property for alternative uses. 
(b)  That the applicant or owner shall be exempt from relocation assistance obligations, in whole or in part, because he or she has shown sufficient evidence that imposition of such obligations, in whole or in part, would eliminate substantially all reasonable alternate use or economic value of the property. In making such determination, the Town Council may take into account the financial history of the mobile home park, its condition and the condition of amenities and improvements thereon, the cost of any necessary repairs, improvements or rehabilitation of such park, the estimated costs of relocation, the fair market value of the property for the proposed alternative use, the fair market value of the property for continued use as a mobile home park, and any other pertinent evidence requested or presented. In rendering its decision, the Town Council shall have the power to eliminate or waive all or portions of any type of benefit which would otherwise be applicable and shall expressly indicate in its decision any such waiver or elimination and the extent thereof. 
d.  Where an application for exemption from relocation assistance has been made based upon bankruptcy proceedings pursuant to Section 8-2-140c., 2. the Town Council may make the following findings: "That the application or project shall be exempt from relocation assistance obligations, in whole or in part, because a court of competent jurisdiction has determined in connection with a proceeding in bankruptcy that the closure or cessation of use of the property as a mobile home park is necessary, and because such court has taken further action which would prohibit or preclude payment of such benefits, whether in whole or in part." 
e.  No request or application for an amendment to the General Plan or zoning ordinance, approval of a tentative map, use permit, site development permit or other discretionary development permit for change of use of a mobile home park shall be approved unless and until the Town Council shall have first determined that the report complies with the requirements of this chapter. The approval of a total exemption from relocation assistance obligations shall have the effect of elimination of the requirement of such portion of the report. If such report is determined not to comply with the requirements of this chapter, the aforementioned requests or amendments shall not be considered further unless and until the report is revised, a public hearing upon appropriate notice is conducted thereon, and the report is determined to be in compliance with the requirements of the Town Code.

If the applicant purchases the mobile home pursuant to Section 8-2-135, the owner of the mobile home shall be required to promptly submit to the applicant all documents necessary to transfer complete title and ownership of such mobile home to the applicant, free and clear of all security interests, liens, or other encumbrances. 
c.

d.  If the owner of the mobile home park, the applicant, homeowner or tenant specifically requests that any of the time limitations required by this section be modified, the Town Council shall consider any such modification and evidence relating to the need therefore at the public hearing on the report. The Town Council shall have the power to make modifications in such time limits, both in response to a request and on its own motion in conjunction with any approval of the report, as the Town Council may deem just and reasonable. 
e.  All mitigation measures imposed in the approval of the report shall be fully performed as to each resident prior to or concurrently with that resident's required vacation of the mobile home park, unless otherwise provided in the mitigation measure.

    No building permit shall be issued for the development of any real property which has been or is being converted from a mobile home park to another use pursuant to the Town Code unless and until the applicant or the owner of the property, as the case may be, who is responsible for payment of any required monetary relocation assistance, shall have filed with the Town Manager a verified statement made under penalty of perjury that relocation assistance payments required pursuant to this chapter have been paid. Such statement shall specify in itemized form each payee, the amount paid, the date of payment, and the type of relocation or other assistance for which each such payment was made.

CHAPTER 2. - FRONTAGE IMPROVEMENTS 

16-2-100 - Town Council Findings as to Need and Purpose. 
    The Town Council finds that development creates traffic which, in turn, creates the need for improved streets and highways, and since a given development directly benefits from improved streets and highways by being more accessible. The Town Council finds it is appropriate to require a contribution toward street improvement when a parcel of land develops, to help offset the burden the development creates and to compensate the community at large for the benefit the development receives. 
    The Town Council further finds that unless measures are taken to provide for the orderly and systematic increase in width, capacity and improvement of streets and highways when and as the development of land takes place, the economic welfare, public convenience and general prosperity of the community and its citizens will suffer. These provisions are, therefore, intended to define the requirements, policies and procedures for the acquisition of public right-of-way easements and for the construction of public improvements in connection with the development of land. It is intended to extend the basic requirements under the Subdivision Map Act and Titles of this code to apply to land development in which no subdivision is involved. It is intended to fairly spread the cost of required public improvements upon abutting properties. It is intended to prevent the dissipation of the Town's funds by preventing faulty or substandard installations. It is intended to help the Town meet the important and competing demands for public service without unduly increasing the cost of government or the tax burden upon the taxpayer of the community. It is intended to protect the public safety, living standards and common welfare of the Town and the citizens of Town of Windsor. 
    This chapter is enacted to require any person who proposes to erect, construct, alter, enlarge, repair, move or maintain any building or structure for which any Town permit is required on or upon any land adjacent to an unimproved street or who seeks to change the use of or subdivide any land which includes or is adjacent to an unimproved street to improve or agree to improve that street as required by this chapter through the dedication of lands for street and public utility use and the installation of such of the following improvements including but not limited to, as may be necessary: curbs, gutters, driveways, sidewalks, storm drains, street paving, street lighting, medians, traffic signals, signing and striping, bus stops, street trees, walkways, landscaping, sewer lines, water lines, undergrounding existing overhead and new utilities services. This chapter applies to any required improvements whether or not the improvement is included in the street improvement fund. In enacting this chapter, the Town Council intends that said improvement or agreement for improvement shall be a condition precedent to the subdivision of lane or issuance of any permit required by the Town. Permits for accessory structures such as gazebos, pools, decks, awnings, patio covers and similar accessory non-inhabitable structures are exempt from the requirements of this chapter. In addition, second units, guesthouses, and similar habitable structures including, but not limited to, room additions and conversions where a primary structure exists are exempt from these requirements. 
(Ord. No. 2003-171 § 2 (part))

16-2-140 - Application of Chapter-Chapter Not Limiting Power of Town Council. 
    Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed to limit the power or authority of the Town Council of the Town of Windsor to impose requirements and conditions upon the issuance of a development permit, in addition to those authorized by this chapter. The Town Council of the Town of Windsor declares that in enacting this chapter, it expressly reserves the right to impose reasonable requirements and conditions upon subdivisions of land and the issuance of a development permit (regardless of whether the same are described herein).

(Ord. No. 2003-171 § 2 (part))

    As a condition precedent to obtaining a subdivision approval or development permit from the Town, any permittee shall dedicate land and make the improvements required by this chapter, or at the election of the Town and pursuant to the provisions of Section 16-2-110 of this chapter, shall dedicate land and pay a sum in lieu of improvements. 
(Ord. No. 2003-171 § 2 (part)) 
16-2-170 - Rezoning and Prezoning. 
    The mere rezoning or prezoning of a parcel of land initiated by Town without application by the owner of said land will not require the dedication or improvement of land pursuant to this chapter but said dedication or improvement shall be postponed until subdivision or development permit is subsequently sought for said land. 
(Ord. No. 2003-171 § 2 (part)) 
16-2-180 - Requirements for Dedication of Land. 
    Any permittee required to dedicate land shall make such dedications as are necessary to conform to and comply with the provisions of this section. 
a.  Procedure. Any street or highway contiguous to or passing through any portion of land for which a subdivision of land or development permit is sought, shall conform in width to the requirements of this chapter. Rights-of-way for any such street or highway shall be dedicated as required by the Town Manager or his/her designee and to accommodate the necessary improvements. 
b.  Width of Streets and Highways. 
1.  For the purposes of this chapter, the streets and highways within the Town shall be deemed to have the planned width set forth for the classification of streets as shown in the Town of Windsor General Plan Design Standards provided that widths may differ from said standards under special circumstances and conditions as determined by the Town. 
2.  The dedication of any land for street right-of-way purposes shall not be required to exceed a strip of land of the following dimensions: 
(a)  Length shall be the length of the property line abutting the street for which dedication is required. 
(b)  Width shall not exceed one-half the street width ten (10) feet throughout the entire length of the strip dedication provided that widths may differ from said standards under special circumstances and conditions as determined by the Town, but in no event shall result in a paved width less than that required for safe travel as determined by the Town Engineer. 
c.  Rear or Side Lines. When the rear or side lines of any lots border any major or secondary streets, highway or parkway, the permittee may be required to execute and deliver to the Town an instrument deemed sufficient by the Town Attorney prohibiting the right of ingress and egress to such lots across the sidelines of such streets or highways. 
d.  Granting of Public Utility and Drainage Easements. The permittee shall grant easements for public utility and drainage purposes along the rear lot lines, along side lot lines and adjacent to street frontages wherever necessary. The Town Manager or his/her designee shall prescribe the width of such easement. Dedication of easements shall be for the purposes of installing utilities and for other public purposes as may be ordered or directed by the Town Manager or his/her designee. 
e.  Dedication of Right-of-Way for Storm Drainage. The permittee shall, subject to existing water rights, dedicate a right-of-way for storm drainage purposes which conform substantially with the lines of any watercourse or channel, stream or creek that traverses the development; or provide by dedication further and sufficient easements or construction, or both, to dispose of such surface and storm water. 
(Ord. No. 2003-171 § 2 (part)) 
16-2-190 - Improvements Required. 
    When improvements are required hereunder, said improvements shall be made in accordance with the provisions of this section. 
a.  Specifications. Improvements required shall be made in accordance with the specifications and standards of the Town, current at the time said improvements are made. When a required improvement is not provided for by standard specifications of the Town, the nature and type of improvement shall be approved by the Town Engineer. 
b.  Improvements on Streets. Said permittee shall provide for the improvement of said unimproved street by the installation, at the permittee's sole cost, including but not limited to all of the following improvements as required in the Town standards which said unimproved street shall lack: curbs, gutters, driveways, sidewalks, storm drains, complete paving to curb, street lighting, medians, traffic signals, signing and striping, bus stops, street trees, walkways, landscaping, sewer lines, water lines undergrounding existing overhead and new utilities services. 
c.  Improvements on One-Half of Right-of-Way Plus Ten (10) Feet: permittee shall be required to provide improvements in that one-half width of right-of-way adjacent to said land and between the property line and the street center line; but, in no event shall this result in a paved width less than that required for safe travel as determined by the Town Engineer and the corresponding right-of-way street width to accomplish the aforementioned paved width approved by the Town Engineer. 
d.  Service Road and Access Improvements. The improvement of service roads and walkways and access (referred to in Section 16-2-120) shall be improved in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2003-171 § 2 (part)) 
16-2-200 - Dedication and Improvements When More Than One Unimproved Street is Involved. 
    Without limitation to any other provision of this chapter, the regulations herein contained are expressly declared to be applicable to any parcel of land, which is abutted on more than one side by a street, one or more of which is unimproved. Permittee shall have a separate obligation for the dedication and improvement of each of said streets in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2003-171 § 2 (part)) 
16-2-210 - Payment in Lieu of Dedication or Improvement or Both. 
a.  Requirement. Where a permittee seeks a development permit, and the Town Manager or designee determines that improvements should be deferred, the Town Manager or designee in its sole discretion may, as a condition precedent to the issuance of said development permit: 
1.  Require dedication of land from the permittee in accordance with the provisions of this chapter; and 
2.  Require payment from the permittee in accordance with the provisions of this chapter in lieu of improvements. 
b.  Town Manager or his/her designee may, but is not required, to consider: 
1.  That the present installation of said improvements would impose a health or safety hazard; 
2.  That the present installation of said improvements is uneconomical and that said improvement can hereafter be installed more efficiently and economically as a portion of a larger installation of improvements; 
3.  The risk of deterioration of said improvement if presently installed and the need for maintenance and upkeep is such that either the permittee or Town would benefit by deferring installation of said improvements; or 
4.  For other good cause as set forth in said findings. 
c.  Amount of Payment in Lieu of Improvement. The amount of payment required in lieu of improvement shall be equivalent to the cost of said improvements in accordance with a resolution of costs of improvements adopted by the Town Council or the most recent update of costs of improvements as approved by the Director of Public Works. It shall be the duty of the Director of Public Works at least once a year to prepare and approve an update of the calculation of the reasonable cost of improvements at that time in Sonoma County as the basis for the review of said costs. Nothing herein contained, however, shall invalidate any action of the Town Council or invalidate the imposition of any charge upon a permittee under the provisions of this chapter for payment in lieu of improvements as a result of any failure on the part of the Director of Public Works to prepare an update of the calculation of reasonable costs of improvements at that time in Sonoma County. 
(Ord. No. 2003-171 § 2 (part);Ord. No. 2010-267, § 1, 9-15-2010) 
16-2-220 - Improvement Preceding Permits. 
a.  Intent. The Town Council finds and declares that in some instances the public welfare and convenience and the greatest economy and safety can be accomplished by the installation of improvements on unimproved streets prior to the time that an abutting property owner or owners shall seek a subdivision of land or development permit. Such owners or their successors in title should be required to contribute their fair share to the street improvements in such areas (just as permittee who seek a permit prior to the installation of improvements are required to do) when their property develops or when they seek a development permit. 
b.  Payment to the Town for Improvements. In instances when improvements have been installed in the Town, it is the intent of the Town Council that as a condition precedent anyone requesting a subdivision of land or development permit shall pay to the Town such sum as the Town, other property owner or other public entity on behalf of the Town has paid to acquire the land and shall make payments to the Town for the improvements which the Town or other property owner or public entity has installed on the streets abutting or included in the property of the permittee. In the event that the Windsor Redevelopment Agency has paid for improvements, infrastructure or rights-of-way, the reimbursement is not required. Improvements shall include but are not limited to all of the following improvements as required in the Town standards which said unimproved street shall lack: curbs, gutter, driveways, sidewalks, storm drains, completed paving to curb, street lighting, medians, traffic signals, signing and striping, bus stops, street trees, walkways, landscaping, sewer lines, water lines, undergrounding existing overhead or new utilities services. Said payments shall be made at or before the time the permit is issued and shall be in addition to any other requirements of this chapter. 
c.  Procedure Where Partial Improvements Made. If the improvements installed by the Town or others prior to the issuance of the permit shall be less than the improvements required by or authorized to be required by this chapter, permittee shall make or agree to make such other improvements, all as required by this chapter. It is the intent of this chapter that a permittee who obtains his/her permit after improvements have been made by Town or others in whole or in part shall be required to provide (in money or improvements or both) the equivalent of what he would have been required to provide had his permit predated the improvements. The provisions of this section are, therefore, not in derogation of any other provision of this chapter. 
Payments in lieu of improvements under this section shall be an amount equal to what the improvements cost at the time they were made. Said cost shall be computed under the resolution of cost of improvements adopted under Section 16-2-210(c) in force at the time the improvements were made; if there was no resolution of cost of improvements in force at the time improvements were made, costs will be computed in accordance with the resolution of cost improvements first adopted following the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter. 
d.  Acquisition of Land by Town Before its Dedication is Required. In the event the Town required land for right-of-way before said land shall be subject to dedication under this chapter, Town may at its sole discretion, purchase said land or any interest in exchange for an agreement that the owner (and his successors in interest) shall not be required to make repayment for said land under this section and/or one (1) or more of the improvements (or payment in lieu of said improvement or improvements) required by this chapter. This section is intended to authorize a landowner to transfer land to the Town in advance of the date the dedication thereof would be required under this chapter. In consideration of early transfer, the Town is empowered to waive the repayment for land and/or one (1) or more of the improvements otherwise required by this chapter for the land or interest so transferred as may constitute equitable and just consideration for advance transfer. 
e.  The provisions of this section are intended to apply to development permit applications received within twenty (20) years of acceptance by the Town of the Town installed improvements. Beginning with the eleventh (11th) year following installation, however, the value of improvements will be depreciated at a rate of ten (10%) percent per year resulting in a zero value in year twenty (20). 
(Ord. No. 2003-171 § 2 (part)) 
16-2-240 - Timing of Requirements/Legal Description. 
a.  Timing for Dedication and Improvement or Payment or Agreement in Lieu Thereof. Prior to the issuance of any development permit or approval of any final subdivision map the permittee shall make such dedications and install such improvements as are required under this chapter or, in lieu of improvements, shall make such cash payments as are required or shall execute such agreements and securities as are required. 
b.  Legal Description. A true and accurate legal description of the property to be developed along with appropriate plans required for an accurate description of land to be dedicated shall accompany the request for development permit. 
(Ord. No. 2003-171 § 2 (part)) 
16-2-250 - Agreements. 
    Prior to the issuance of a development permit or final subdivision map approval, if the permittee is not proceeding pursuant to subsection (b) of Section 16-2-140, the permittee shall execute an agreement with the Town to install the improvements required by Town pursuant to this chapter at the permittee's sole cost within such time as said agreement shall require. Said agreement shall contain such covenants and conditions as are required by the Town, including, but not limited to, the following: 
a.  No work shall be undertaken by the permittee until all plans and specifications have been submitted to the Director of Public Works and approved in writing; 
b.  All improvements shall be constructed under and subject to inspection by the Director of Public Works; 
c.  The permittee shall pay the Town's costs and expenses in connection therewith; 
d.  Completion of the improvements shall be prior to the issuance of a certificate of occupancy or the expiration of the agreement term, whichever occurs first. 
(Ord. No. 2003-171 § 2 (part)) 
16-2-260 - Security for Agreement. 
    To assure the permittee's full and faithful performance of the agreement, the permittee shall concurrently file security for such sum as is sufficient to cover one hundred (100%) percent of the cost of said improvements and other costs and, in addition, such security as is sufficient to cover one hundred (100%) percent of all labor and materials costs required to construct the improvements. The amount of such security shall be determined by the Director of Public Works and the form of such security shall be approved by the Town Attorney. Such security shall be one or more of the following: 
a.  A bond issued by a surety company authorized to transact a surety business in the state; 
b.  A letter of credit issued by a savings and loan institution or by a bank authorized to transact business in the state; 
c.  The deposit of cash funds in a savings account in any savings and loan or bank maintaining an office in Sonoma County, with an assignment of said account to the Town for payment upon said account; provided, further, that the permittee and the bank or savings and loan shall execute such written documents as shall be required by the Town Attorney and as shall be approved by him as to form to insure the availability of said sums upon demand to the Town and provided further, that there shall be delivered to the Town a certificate or passbook representing said account, together with said assignment, in a form satisfactory to the Town Attorney; 
d.  Cash or cashiers check drawn upon a bank or savings and loan institution maintaining an office in Sonoma County. 
(Ord. No. 2003-171 § 2 (part)) 
16-2-270 - Release of Security. 
    No release of any security required under this chapter shall be made except upon the certification by the Director of Public Works that work covered thereunder has been satisfactorily completed and upon approval of the Town Council, provided, however, that progress payments may be made to the permittee upon approval of the Town Council in accordance with the provisions of his agreement with the Town. Said security or any portion thereof, may be retained by the Town until the end of any express warranty or guarantee period provided for in the agreement secured or until any claim period established by law or agreement has expired. No interest shall be paid by the Town upon any security deposited by the permittee with the Town, any interest earned by the permittee from any bank or savings and loan institution upon an account assigned to the Town (if not called upon to satisfy the permittee's obligations pursuant to his written agreement) shall be released to the permittee when the principal sum on deposit is released to the permittee. 
(Ord. No. 2003-171 § 2 (part)) 
16-2-280 - Indemnification and Reimbursement. 
    In the event that the permittee shall fail to complete all improvement work in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, or shall fail to pay for all labor and materials, all as required by this chapter, agreement or law, the Town shall be entitled to resort to the security furnished by the permittee to complete said improvement work, pay for said labor and materials and pay for such other costs as shall have been incurred by the Town. Resort to said security shall not preclude the Town from proceeding against a permittee for breach of contract and damages for failure to provide improvement work, labor or materials or to pay other costs in excess of the amount of said security.

16-2-290 - Exceptions. 
a.  The Town Manager or his/her designee may recommend that the Town Council authorize conditional exceptions to any of the requirements and regulations set forth in this chapter provided that the following facts are found: 
1.  That there are special circumstances and conditions affecting the subject property; 
2.  That the exception is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right of the developer; 
3.  That the granting of the exception will not be detrimental to the public welfare or injurious to other property in the territory in which said property is situated. 
b.  Report to Town Council. 
1.  In recommending such exceptions, the Town Manager or his/her designee shall act to secure the objectives of the regulations, which exceptions are requested and shall act to protect the public health, safety, convenience and general welfare; 
2.  In recommending the authorization of any exception under the provisions of this section, the Town Manager or his/her designee shall report to the Town Council his/her findings with respect thereto and all facts in connection therewith and shall specifically and fully set forth the exceptions recommended and the conditions designated. 
c.  Upon receipt of such report, the Town Council may approve the subdivision of land or development permit with conditions recommended by the Town Manager or his/her designee and with such other conditions, if any, as the Town Council deems necessary to substantially secure the objectives of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 2003-171 § 2 (part)) 
16-2-295 - Exemptions. 
a.  Development of one "Second Dwelling Unit" (as described by Zoning Ordinance § 27.34.180), where a primary structure exists, is exempt from the provisions of this chapter. 
b.  Permits for accessory structures such as gazebos, pools, decks, awnings, patio covers and similar accessory non-inhabitable structures are exempt from the requirements of this chapter. In addition, guesthouses, room additions, conversions and similar habitable structures, where a primary structure exists, are exempt from this chapter. 
c.  Expansions to the floor area of existing non-residential structures of twenty-five (25%) percent or less. Expansions shall be considered cumulatively from the effective date of this ordinance. Once expansions exceed twenty-five (25%) percent of the floor area in existence at the time of adoption of this ordinance, the requirements of this section shall apply. Said limitations on increases to floor area described herein are also intended to apply cumulatively to those circumstances of common ownership described in subsection (d) of this section. 
d.  It is the intent of the Town Council that the provisions of this chapter shall apply to the extension of an existing building or structure on the same or adjoining parcels as that on which an existing building or structure is located and to the installation of a new or additional building or structure on the same or on an adjoining parcel of land under the same ownership and to the extension of an existing use to an adjoining parcel of land under the same ownership. It is the intent of the Town Council that the provisions of this chapter shall apply to any land abutting on a street held in the same ownership as other land abutting on that street for which a development permit has been previously granted. 
(Ord. No. 2003-171 § 2 (part)) 
16-2-300 - Relinquishment of Dedication and Improvement or Payment in Lieu Thereof. 
a.  If the Town Council shall determine that land dedicated, improvements made or money contributed in lieu of improvements under and pursuant to the provisions of this chapter shall, in any given case, no longer be necessary because of a change in street plan lines, street plans or improvement requirements, and if the Town Council further determines that it is equitable and reasonable to do so, the Town Council shall be empowered to direct the conveyance by quit claim deed of said dedicated land and improvements and the refund without interest of any money paid in lieu of improvements to the present owner (at the time of said conveyance or refund) of the land adjoining the dedicated land. 
b.  The Town Council finds and determines that said conveyance and refund should be made to the present owner for the following reasons: to quit claim to one other than the present owner could leave the present owner's adjoining land without access and landlocked; subsequent owners receive the benefit of a prior owner's compliance with the provisions of this chapter; and therefore, subsequent owners should receive the benefit of any relinquishment by the Town; presumably the cost of dedication and improvement is included in the price which the present owner paid to the prior owner; the tracing of title from present owner to prior owner or owners is costly, burdensome and time consuming and would often outweigh the value of property conveyed or the refund made. The intent of this chapter is that improvements, once made, run with the land and requirements under this chapter once met, need not be repeated on each change of ownership. 
c.  The Town Council finds and determines that no interest should be paid on refunds for the following reasons: as the Town derives no benefit from improvements until they are made, the Town should be entitled to retain any interest on payments in lieu of improvements to compensate the Town for the inability to use the improvements. The Town has not had the unlimited use of funds paid in lieu of improvements under the provisions of this chapter and therefore should not be required to make payment therefore in the form of interest. 
d.  As used in this section, the phrase "land adjoining the dedicated land" refers to the land out of which the dedication is made and which adjoins the dedicated land.

Any fees collected under this article shall be committed within five (5) years after the payment of the fees or the issuance of building permits on one-half (1/2) of the lots created by the subdivision, whichever occurs later. If the fees are not committed, they, without any deductions, shall be distributed and paid to the then record owners of the subdivision in the same proportion that the size of their lot bears to the total area of all lots within the subdivision. 
e.  In accordance with Government Code Section 66477(a)(4), park and recreational facilities shall be in accord with principles and standards of the park and recreation element of the Town General Plan and the Town Parks and Recreation Master Plan.

(Ord. No. 2000-128 § 2 (part)) 
16-3-130 - Amount of Land to be Dedicated. 
    It is found and determined in accordance with Government Code Section 66477(a)(2), that the amount of existing neighborhood and community park area within the Town, as calculated pursuant to Government Code Section 66477(a)(2), equals or exceeds five (5) acres of park area for each one thousand (1,000) persons residing within the Town. It is also found and determined that the public interest, convenience, health, safety and welfare require that five (5) acres of land for each one thousand (1,000) persons residing in a subdivision within the Town subject to this article be devoted to local park and recreational purposes. In accordance with Government Code Section 66477(a)(5), the amount of land to be dedicated, or fees to be paid shall bear a reasonable relationship to the use of the park and recreation facilities by the future inhabitants of the subdivision. In accordance with Government Code Section 66477(a)(2), the amount of land to be dedicated shall be calculated according to the following formula: 
LAND = A × B 
a.  "A" means the park and recreation area required per dwelling unit, based on the type of dwelling units of the proposed subdivision and the park area per one thousand (1,000) Town residents. 
1.  The park area of the Town is determined to be five point zero (5.0) acres per one thousand (1,000) people, or point zero, zero five (.005) acres per person, which is further broken down to three (3) acres per one thousand (1,000) people for community parks and two (2) acres per one thousand (1,000) people for neighborhood parks in accordance with the Windsor General Plan as amended. 
2.  The park and recreation area required per dwelling unit, A, is established as follows: 
(a)  For dwelling units to be constructed on property designated in the Town General Plan for fewer than eight (8) units per acre, each unit is assigned two point nine (2.9) people. 
    Therefore: 
A = 2.9 × .003 = 0.0087 acres per unit 
(for community parks) 
A = 2.9 × .002 = 0.0058 acres per unit 
(for neighborhood parks) 
A (Total) = 0.0145 acres per unit 
(b)  For dwelling units to be constructed on property designated in the Town General Plan for eight (8) or more units per acre, each unit is assigned two point zero (2.0) people. 
    Therefore: 
A = 2.0 × .003 = 0.006 acres per unit 
(for community parks) 
A = 2.0 × .002 = 0.004 acres per unit 
(for neighborhood parks) 
A (Total) = 0.01 acres per unit 
(c)  "B" means the number of dwelling units in the proposed subdivision. For the purpose of this section, the number of dwelling units in the proposed subdivision shall be determined as follows: In areas zoned for one (1) dwelling unit per lot or parcel, the number of dwelling units shall equal the number of parcels indicated on the final map. When the subdivision is located in an area zoned for multiple dwelling units per parcel, the number of dwelling units shall equal the maximum number of dwelling units allowed under that zone. For residential condominium projects, the number of dwelling units shall equal the number of condominium units indicated on the final map. For planned development projects, the number of dwelling units shall equal the number of dwelling units indicated on the approved planned development plan. 
(Ord. No. 2000-128 § 2 (part)) 
16-3-140 - Calculation of In-Lieu Fees. 
    Where fees are required by the Town to be paid in lieu of land dedication, such fees shall be equal to the applicable Park Land Acquisition Fee element of the Park Impact Fee established in Article 4, Chapter 6, Title 16 of the Town of Windsor Code. 
(Ord. No. 2000-128 § 2 (part)) 
16-3-150 - Credits. 
a.  In accordance with Government Code Section 66477(a)(9), if a subdivider provides park and recreational improvements to the dedicated land, as authorized by the Town, the value of the park and recreational improvements, together with any equipment located thereon, as approved by the Town, shall be a credit against the payment of fees or dedication of land otherwise required by this article. To be authorized and approved by the Town, park and recreational improvements and equipment provided by subdividers pursuant to this Section 16-3-150 shall be generally consistent as determined by the Town with applicable principles and standards for local and neighborhood parks contained in the park and open space element of the Town General Plan, the Town of Windsor Design Standards, and the Town Parks and Recreation Master Plan. Such applicable principles and standards shall include, but not be limited to, relevant portions of Sections 4.1.2 and 4.1.3 of the Town of Windsor Design Standards. 
b.  In accordance with Government Code Section 66477(e), common interest developments such as community apartments, condominiums and stock cooperatives, as defined in Section 1351 of the Civil Code, shall be eligible to receive a credit not to exceed twenty-five (25%) percent as determined by the Town, against the land required to be dedicated, or the amount of the fee imposed pursuant to this article, for the value of private open space within the development which is usable for active recreational uses. For the purposes of this Section 16-3-150, private open space usable for active recreational uses means private open space that is: 
1.  At least three-quarters (3/4) of an acre in area with the smallest dimension being at least one hundred (100) feet clear excluding yards and setbacks normally required by zoning provisions; 
2.  Owned and maintained by a homeowner's association, available to all residents of the subdivision without restriction, and designated for park and recreational purposes by recorded covenants which run with the land and cannot be defeated or eliminated without consent of the Town Council; 
3.  Suitable for active park and recreation purposes taking into consideration such factors as shape, topography, access, and improvements proposed; and 
4.  Generally consistent as determined by the Town with applicable principles and standards for local and neighborhood parks contained in the park and open space element of the Town General Plan, the Town of Windsor Design Standards, and the Town Parks and Recreation Master Plan. Such principles and standards that apply to private open space within common interest developments subject to this Section 16-3-150 include, but are not limited to, those contained in Section E.3.5(a), (b), (d), (e) and (f) of the General Plan, and relevant portions of Sections 4.1, 4.1.2 and 4.1.3 of the Town of Windsor Design Standards. 
(Ord. No. 2000-128 § 2 (part)) 
16-3-160 - Procedures. 
a.  Prior to approval of a subdivision subject to this article, the Planning Commission shall consider the report and recommendation from Town staff regarding the following: 
1.  The amount of land required; or

CHAPTER 4. - GROWTH CONTROL* 
* Prior ordinance history: Ords. 97-102, 99-121, 2000-136, 2002-154, 2003-175, 2005-201 and 2006-211. 

16-4-100 - Authority. 
    This chapter is adopted pursuant to the general police powers of the Town of Windsor to protect the public health, safety and welfare of its residents and pursuant to the adopted goals, objectives and policies pertaining to growth control in the Town of Windsor General Plan. 
(Ord. No. 2007-226 § 1 (part); Ord. No. 2017-313 , § 3, 9-6-2017) 
16-4-105 - Title. 
    This chapter shall be known as the "Growth Control Ordinance" of the Town of Windsor. 
(Ord. No. 2007-226 § 1 (part)) 
16-4-110 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of the Growth Control Ordinance is to accommodate growth anticipated under the General Plan, and to manage new development so that it occurs concurrently with necessary public services, facilities and infrastructure as follows: 
a.  By monitoring and regulating the Town's residential development, this chapter furthers the General Plan's Vision Statement to accomplish the following: retain the Town's small town character and rural atmosphere; respect natural resources; encourage compact urban-level development within the Town limits; support rural and agricultural land uses beyond the Urban Growth Boundary; maintain flexibility to accommodate change; and plan the location and timing of growth, taking into consideration infrastructure capacity, public service availability, and fiscal impacts. 
b.  This chapter supports the following General Plan objectives: 
1.  The Urban Growth Boundary provides the Town with sufficient land to accommodate the Town's growth control strategy through the horizon year of the General Plan by annually monitoring the Town's residential development. 
2.  Prioritize development of areas within the Urban Growth Boundary, considering proximity to existing urban development, availability of public services and utilities, fiscal effects for the Town, and protection of Williamson Act land contracts by annually stating community development objectives, and targeting housing types or development areas as needed. 
3.  Ensure that adequate services and infrastructure are in place prior to approving new development. 
4.  Balance residential and economic development in a manner compatible with the planning area's environmental resources and available infrastructure. 
5.  Reserve adequate land to accommodate commercial and future light industrial development to meet the needs for goods and services for the Town and to create jobs. 
6.  Require new development to provide its fair share of required service and infrastructure in a timely manner by not releasing reserved allocations until related development applications have been reviewed through the Town's discretionary land use process, and approved. This timing for the allocations assures that applicants are substantially committed to projects, thereby assuring a more predictable, consistent flow of development impact fees to fund infrastructure projects. 
7.  Ensure the provision of community services, utilities, and facilities; provide adequate space to accommodate these services as development occurs; and deliver these services in a cost-effective manner to reduce the costs of service. 
8.  Strive to meet the Town's fair share of the regional housing need by exempting very-low, low, and moderate-income units for which Windsor has not met its regional share. 
9.  Preserve open space land for the continuation of commercial agricultural and productive uses, the protection and use of natural resources, the enjoyment of scenic beauty and recreation, and protection from natural hazards by monitoring the Town's residential development through an Annual Growth Control Report. 
(Ord. No. 2007-226 § 1 (part); Ord. No. 2017-313 , § 4, 9-6-2017) 
16-4-115 - Findings. 
    The Town Council has considered the effect of this Growth Control Ordinance and finds that the provisions of this chapter are necessary to promote the public health, safety and welfare. This chapter is based on accommodating general plan buildout to assure that housing opportunities in the region are not reduced. However, to the extent that such opportunities may be reduced, those reductions are justified to protect the character and quality of life for existing and future residents by managing and balancing new residential units so as not to exceed available resources including the developable land supply, public infrastructure capacity, public services, and fiscal resources. Pursuant to Government Code Section 65863.6, the Town makes the following specific findings: 
a.  Land Supply Constraints. The Town of Windsor General Plan and its related Environmental Impact Report identify environmental constraints in the planning area of the Town of Windsor. An Urban Growth Boundary has been established within the planning area to provide an adequate land supply for potential development through its horizon year. The location of the Town's Urban Growth Boundary recognizes that certain lands to its west, north, and east are unsuitable for urbanization due to federal, state, county and local policies established for the protection of agricultural lands, oak woodlands, hillsides, vernal pool/wetland habitat, flood zones, steep slopes, seismic hazards, and scenic views. Development to the south of the Sphere-of-Influence and Urban Growth Boundary is also constrained by proximity to the Charles M. Schulz-Sonoma County Airport and the Sonoma County General Plan Community Separator policies. The Windsor General Plan provides land within the Urban Growth Boundary to accommodate urbanization through the life of the General Plan, and relies on a compact land use pattern to make efficient use of lands available for urbanization. 
b.  Public Services and Infrastructure Capacity/Concurrency. The Town of Windsor General Plan and its related Environmental Impact Report recognize that existing infrastructure facilities will need to be expanded to serve ultimate buildout of the Urban Growth Boundary. The General Plan requires planning for and implementation of improvements to the Town's water and wastewater systems to ensure that adequate capacity will be available. 
c.  Public Services. The Windsor Unified School District, Windsor Fire Protection District, and Windsor Police Department provide essential public services for the promotion and protection of the general welfare and safety of Windsor residents. The Town finds that in order to ensure that the provision of these services keeps pace with new development, it is necessary to manage increments of growth in accordance with the service provision of the above districts. 
d.  Fiscal Resources. Balance the mix of residential and nonresidential land uses to emphasize economic growth and to ensure that public infrastructure and service costs associated with unmanaged residential growth do not exceed available fiscal resources resulting in decreased public service or maintenance activities or adverse fiscal consequences to the Town, to the detriment of the public safety and welfare. 
e.  Circulation. The Town of Windsor General Plan and its related Environmental Impact Report identify intersections which would be degraded to less than acceptable Levels of Service with unmitigated buildout of the Urban Growth Boundary. In order to ensure adequate capacity of the Town's circulation system concurrent with new growth and in conformance with the Town's Level of Service (LOS) standard, the Town finds it necessary to monitor and manage growth with appropriate mitigation to ensure meeting the Town's LOS standard. 
f.  Jobs/Housing Balance. The Town of Windsor General Plan and its related Environmental Impact Report document out-commuting trends in Windsor and traffic congestion on Highway 101. In order to reduce out-commuting and congestion on Highway 101 and promote an economically sustainable fiscal mix of residential/nonresidential land uses, the Town finds it necessary to manage the mix of residential to nonresidential growth to both accommodate residential growth and to emphasize economic growth. 
g.  Low, Very-Low and Moderate-Income Housing Needs. The Growth Control Ordinance will not constrain the production of housing for households with very-low, low and moderate-income units as they are exempted from obtaining growth control allocations per the provisions of this chapter.

(Ord. No. 2007-226 § 1 (part)) 
16-4-122 - Agreements. 
    Reserved growth control allocations or growth control allocations committed to a project through a development agreement, allocation agreement, reserve allocation agreement, or other agreement approved by the Town Council, shall be considered when establishing the number of growth control allocations for current and future years' growth control allocations, as specified in the terms of the agreement. 
(Ord. No. 2007-226 § 1 (part); Ord. No. 2017-313 , § 7, 9-6-2017)

16-5-197 - Fees or Dedication Established by Specific Plan. 
    Notwithstanding anything contained in this chapter to the contrary, a developer shall not be required to dedicate land or to pay school impact fees for residential development otherwise required by this chapter, if (1) The proposed residential development is located within an area covered by a duly adopted specific plan and if (2) The developer has been required to dedicate land or pay fees for school facilities pursuant to an ordinance adopted for the purpose of implementing any such specific plan and if (c) Such ordinance or specific plan provides that the dedication of land or payment of fees is for the purpose of fully mitigating the conditions of overcrowding created by the proposed residential development. 
Article 2. - Alternative School Facilities Fees/Dedication 

16-5-200 - Title. 
    This article shall be known and may be cited as the "Alternative School Facilities Fees/Dedication Ordinance." 
16-5-205 - Definitions. 
    Unless specified herein to the contrary, the definitions set forth in Section 16-5-125 shall apply to this article. 
16-5-210 - Purpose. 
    In considering proposals for new residential development, the Town Council has evaluated reports from school districts and other agencies regarding the adequacy of public school services and facilities required to serve new development. In many cases, however, the required public services have not in fact been installed by the time the development causes a need. The result has been that residents in newly developed areas have been inadequately serviced with schools. State legislation and Section 16-5-100 provide for the dedication of land and/or the payment of fees by residential developers to overcrowded school districts for interim classroom and related facilities. The legislation and ordinance have alleviated some of the problems, but they make no provision for long-term permanent solutions to the overcrowding of school districts and provide no flexibility to the developer and district to agree upon alternative, and perhaps more efficacious, mitigation measures. The purpose of this article is to provide an alternative method of mitigating conditions of overcrowding created by new development by providing an alternative procedure through which the districts may secure fees for the purpose of constructing new permanent facilities, rehabilitating old facilities or acquiring land upon which such facilities may be constructed. 
16-5-215 - Authority. 
    The Town Council hereby finds that the provisions of this article are necessary to preserve the public health, safety and general welfare of the residents of the Town of Windsor by providing a mechanism whereby permanent educational facilities may be rehabilitated and constructed to meet the needs of new residential development. 
16-5-220 - General Plan. 
    The Town's General Plan provides for the location of public schools. Where facilities are to be constructed from fees or land required to be dedicated hereunder, or both, such construction or acquisition shall be consistent with the General Plan. 
16-5-225 - Applications for Residential Development. 
a.  Where the findings required by Sections 16-5-150 and 16-5-160 have been made, each application for a proposed residential development involving property located within the jurisdiction of an impacted school district shall include a written statement from the district stating whether the district will be able to provide adequate school services and facilities for the proposed residential development. 
b.  If the district states that it will not be able to provide adequate school services and facilities, it shall include an explanation of its reasons for that statement, and a description of measures concurrently undertaken or planned or any other measures deemed necessary to provide adequate school services and facilities to meet the needs of the proposed residential development. Such measures may include private contribution, school impact fees, or dedications pursuant to Section 16-5-100. 
c.  If the district determines that school impact fees or dedications of land for interim facilities pursuant to Section 16-5-100 will not be sufficient to provide adequate school services and facilities concurrently with need, the district shall determine what reasonable mitigation is necessary to provide adequate school services and facilities concurrently with need and shall certify whether the developer has agreed to modify his or her project to incorporate the mitigation determined to be necessary by the district. 
d.  Unless otherwise required by law, no application for residential development shall be accepted as complete or approved until the impacted district states in accordance with this section, Section 16-1-100, or a school facilities ordinance adopted in connection with a specific plan as set forth in Section 16-5-245, that adequate school facilities will be provided by the developer concurrently with the need generated by the proposed residential development. 
e.  Contribution, fees, or dedications authorized by this article may be used for the purpose of purchasing future sites for educational facilities, constructing new facilities or for repairing or rehabilitating existing facilities. 
16-5-230 - Special Application and Approval-Required Findings. 
    Notwithstanding the provisions of Section 16-5-225, the decision-making body may accept and approve an application for a residential development which is not accompanied by a statement by the school district that adequate public school facilities will be provided concurrently with need where are of the following findings is made: 
a.  That pursuant to this article, provision has been made for payment of fees, dedication of land, or both, or pursuant to an ordinance adopted in connection with a specific plan as set forth in Section 16-5-245, some other provision has been agreed upon by the applicant for a residential development and the school district to mitigate the conditions of overcrowding within the attendance area; or 
b.  That there are specific, overriding, fiscal, economic, social, or environmental factors, which, in the judgement of the decision-making body, would benefit the Town, thereby justifying the approval of a residential development otherwise subject to the provisions of this article without requiring the payment of fees or the dedication of land or other alternate provision required by this chapter. 
c.  The application for residential development is for replacement housing as a result of fire or some other disaster where no new dwelling units are created; or 
d.  The application for residential development is for the conversion of existing apartments, condominiums or vice versa, and no new dwelling units are created. 
16-5-235 - Fee Required. 
    If the payment of a fee is agreed upon by the district and the developer pursuant to this chapter, such payment shall be made at the time that the building permit for the residential development is approved and issued. A building permit for the residential development shall be approved and issued only upon certification from the district that the developer has made the appropriate payments agreed upon. 
16-5-240 - Standards for Fees or Land. 
    Any contribution, fee, or dedication imposed pursuant to this chapter shall bear a reasonable relationship and will be limited to the needs of the community for permanent elementary, junior high, or high school facilities, and shall be reasonably related and limited to the need for the schools caused by the residential development. Nothing contained in this chapter shall authorize an impacted school district to demand, in connection with an application for a residential subdivision not accompanied by an application for some other discretionary approval, a land dedication for educational facilities where such land dedication would exceed the limitations of Section 66478 of the State Subdivision Map Act. 
16-5-245 - Fees or Dedication Established by Specific Plan. 
    Notwithstanding anything contained in this chapter to the contrary, a developer shall not be required to dedicate land or to pay school impact fees for residential development otherwise required by this section or Section 16-5-100, if (1) The proposed residential development is located within an area covered by a duly adopted specific plan and if (2) The developer has been required to dedicate land or pay fees for school facilities pursuant to an ordinance adopted for the purpose of implementing any such specific plan and if (3) Such ordinance or specific plan provides that the dedication of land or payment of fees is for the purpose of fully mitigating the conditions of overcrowding created by the proposed residential development.

CHAPTER 8. - SUBDIVISION ORDINANCE 
Article 1. - General Provisions 

16-8-100 - Citation and Authority. 
    This Chapter is adopted to supplement and implement the Subdivision Map Act, §§ 66410 et seq. of the Government Code and may be cited as the Subdivision Ordinance of the Town of Windsor. 
(Ord. No. 2009-253, § 2, 7-15-2009) 
16-8-110 - Purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this Chapter to regulate and control the division of land within the Town of Windsor and to supplement the provisions of the Subdivision Map Act concerning the design, improvement and survey data of subdivisions, the form and content of all maps provided for by the Subdivision Map Act and the procedure to be followed in securing the official approval of the Town Engineer, the Planning Director, the Planning Commission, and Town Council regarding the maps. To accomplish this purpose, the regulations outlined in this Chapter are determined to be necessary for the preservation of the public health, safety, and general welfare; to promote orderly growth and development; to promote open space, conservation, protection, and proper use of land; and to ensure provision for adequate traffic circulation, utilities, and services. 
(Ord. No. 2009-253, § 2, 7-15-2009) 
16-8-120 - Conformity to General Plan, Specific Plans, Area Plans, and Zoning Ordinance. 
    No land shall be subdivided and developed for any purpose that is not in conformity with the General Plan and any specific plan or local area plan of the Town of Windsor (including but not limited to the Shiloh Road Vision Plan and the Downtown Plan), or the Town's Design Standards, or that is not permitted by or in conformity with the Zoning Ordinance or other applicable provisions of the Windsor Municipal Code. 
    The type and intensity of land use as shown on the General Plan, as supplemented by the Town's specific plans and area plans, shall determine the type and capacity of streets, roads, highways, utilities, and public services and improvements that shall be provided by the subdivider. 
(Ord. No. 2009-253, § 2, 7-15-2009) 
16-8-130 - Application. 
a.  Applications generally. The regulations set forth in this Chapter shall apply to all parts of subdivisions within the Town of Windsor and to the preparation of subdivision maps and to other maps provided for by the Subdivision Map Act. Each subdivision and each part thereof lying within the Town shall be made and each map shall be prepared and presented for approval as provided for and required by this Chapter. 
b.  Application fees. All applications required by and submitted pursuant to this Chapter shall be accompanied by the required fee, as set forth in a resolution adopted by the Town Council. 
(Ord. No. 2009-253, § 2, 7-15-2009) 
16-8-140 - General Design Standards. 
a.  Lot depth and building envelope. In no case shall the depth of a lot created by a new subdivision be less than eighty-five (85) feet, exclusive of rights of way or easements necessary for road purposes. Lot depth shall not be greater than three(3) times the average lot width. Usable building envelopes for residential parcels shall not be less than forty-five (45) feet in depth unless approved otherwise by the Planning Director. 
b.  Lot width. In no case shall the width of a lot created by a new subdivision be less than prescribed by the Town of Windsor Zoning Ordinance's General Development Standards. 
c.  Lot area. In no case shall the area of a lot created by a new subdivision be less than prescribed by the Town of Windsor Zoning Ordinance's General Development Standards. 
d.  Corridor (flag pole) lots. Corridor lots shall not be allowed in new subdivisions, unless the appropriate decisionmaker finds that such lots further in-fill development objectives in a previously developed area, no other reasonable design alternatives are available that will further those objectives, and the resulting lot sizes will be compatible with those in surrounding areas. When a corridor lot is permitted, the minimum width of the "flag" corridor shall be twenty (20) feet, and the "flag" corridor shall not be included in the minimum lot depth and area calculations. 
e.  Energy Conservation. 
1.  The design of a subdivision for which a tentative map is required shall provide, to the extent feasible, for future passive or natural heating or cooling opportunities in the subdivision. 
2.  Examples of passive or natural heating opportunities in subdivision design include design of lot size and configuration to permit orientation of a structure in an east-west alignment for southern exposure. 
3.  Examples of passive or natural cooling opportunities in subdivision design include design of lot size and configuration to permit orientation of a structure to take advantage of shade or prevailing breezes. 
4.  In providing for future passive or natural heating or cooling opportunities in the design of a subdivision, consideration shall be given to local climate, to contour, to configuration of the parcel to be divided, and to other design and improvement requirements, and such provision shall not result in reducing allowable densities or the percentage of a lot that may be occupied by a building or structure under applicable planning and zoning in force at the time the tentative map is filed. 
5.  The requirements of this Section do not apply to condominium projects that consist of the subdivision of airspace in an existing building and that add no new structures. 
6.  For the purposes of this Section, "feasible" means capable of being accomplished in a successful manner within a reasonable period of time, taking into account economic, environmental, social, and technological factors. 
f.  Cable Television Service. 
1.  The design of a subdivision for which a tentative map or tentative parcel map is required shall provide appropriate cable television systems an opportunity to construct, install, and maintain, on land identified on the map as dedicated or to be dedicated to public utility use, any equipment necessary to extend cable television services to each residential parcel in the subdivision. For the purposes of this Section, "appropriate cable television systems" means those systems franchised or licensed to serve the geographical area in which the subdivision is located. 
2.  This Section shall not apply to the conversion of existing dwelling units to condominiums, community apartments, or stock cooperatives. 
g.  Access. 
1.  The subdivision shall abut upon or have an approved access to a public street. Each unit or lot within the subdivision shall have an approved access to a public or private street. 
2.  Street layout shall be designed to provide for future access to, and not impose undue hardship upon, property adjoining the subdivision. Reserve strips, or non-access at the end of streets or at the boundaries of subdivisions, shall be dedicated unconditionally to the Town when required. 
h.  Planned developments. Lots included in subdivisions proposed as part of a planned development, as provided for in the Zoning Ordinance, may deviate from the standards required by this section. In that case, lot design shall be provided for in a development plan authorized by conditional use permit. Criteria for evaluating planned developments shall include, without limitation, elements of design or community benefit that, in the determination of the decisionmaker, are superior to those achieved through standard subdivision design. These elements include unique design features, creation of common open space, provision of amenities, and other features identified in the zoning ordinance. Provisions for long-term maintenance and management of common areas shall be in the form of an owners association or equivalent. Planned developments shall generally consist of five (5) or more lots. 
i.  Water availability - Subdivisions of five hundred (500) or more units. Proposed residential subdivisions of five hundred (500) or more dwelling units shall demonstrate sufficient availability of public water per Section 66473.7 of the Subdivision Map Act. 
(Ord. No. 2009-253, § 2, 7-15-2009) 
16-8-150 - Remainders. 
a.  Policy on the use of remainders. 
1.  Because they can result in "leap-frog" development, delays in the construction of public improvements necessary to maintain existing service levels, and other detriments to the public welfare, use of remainders as part of tentative map submittals will be closely scrutinized for consistency with General Plan policies encouraging efficient and orderly development. Subdividers who include remainders in tentative maps must be able to show that development of the proposed subdivision will not interfere with the realization of those policies in the General Plan. 
2.  Remainders may be used in conjunction with parcel and final maps when phasing of the final or parcel map is authorized by the approved tentative map and use of a remainder does not otherwise conflict with required conditions of approval for the tentative map. 
b.  Depiction on tentative maps. Tentative maps for major and minor subdivisions shall depict remainders and clearly identify them as such. 
c.  Depiction on final maps. Final maps for major and minor subdivisions shall depict remainders of less than five (5) acres. If a remainder is five (5) acres or larger, then the subdivider shall submit with the final map a separate map exhibit showing the location and boundaries of the remainder in relation to the subdivided property. The additional map exhibit shall show the remainder, list any conditions required for the remainder, and be recorded with the final map. The additional map showing the remainder shall not itself be a final map, and recordation thereof shall not extend any development rights conferred by Government Code sections 66498.1 or 66498.5 or by Sections 16-8-410 and 16-8-1235. 
d.  Review for creation. All subdivision applications shall be subject to review to determine whether a remainder is created thereby and whether any such remainder is intended to be used for the purposes of finance, lease, or sale. If the Director determines that a tentative parcel map would create a remainder for any of those purposes, and the total number of lots created by the subdivision, including the proposed remainder, is more than four (4), the Director shall return the application and require the subdivider to submit a tentative or vesting tentative map for a major subdivision. 
e.  Review for further subdivision. The Planning Director shall review all subdivision applications to determine whether all or a part of the parcel subdivided is a remainder from a previous subdivision and whether the first subdivider intended to create the remainder for the purpose of finance, lease, or sale. Indicia of such intent include, but are not limited to, sale to the second subdivider for inadequate consideration; transfer of the remainder to close relatives or business associates; retention of control of or a financial interest in the remainder, and if the remainder was not capable of development under the Municipal Code, combination of the remainder or a part thereof with another parcel in the property proposed to be subdivided. 
f.  Conditions of approval. To the extent allowed by law, particularly section 66424.6 of the Government Code, the Town may impose conditions on a remainder created as part of a proposed subdivision. 
1.  The Town Council hereby finds that the construction of improvements associated with remainders prior to the approval of development therefor is necessary to protect the public health and safety and as a prerequisite to the orderly development of the Town. 
2.  Based on the foregoing finding, the Town Council, Planning Commission, and Planning Director and Town Engineer may require, as a condition of approving any tentative or final map, that improvements required for the subject subdivision also be constructed at the same time for any remainder. Any such condition may be appealed by the subdivider as set forth below. 
3.  To assist Town decisionmakers regarding the need for and details of conditions of approval for remainders, as part of a tentative map application, the Director or Town Engineer may require the subdivider to provide a site plan, consistent with Section 27.42.030 of the Municipal Code, for a remainder parcel. 
4.  In the event that the Town Council, Planning Commission, or Planning Director or Town Engineer allows a subdivider to defer improvement construction for a remainder, the subdivider shall record an agreement approved by the Town Attorney with the county recorder, stating: 
A.  What the required improvements are; and 
B.  That the subdivider or a successor owner is required to complete all required improvements before the Town will grant a permit or other approval for development. 
g.  Certificate of compliance required prior to sale or transfer. Prior to the sale or transfer of any remainder, the subdivider shall be required to obtain from the Town Engineer a certificate of compliance or conditional certificate of compliance, as provided for in the Subdivision Map Act and section 16-8-1320. The Town Engineer's review of such an application shall include a determination that the creation of a remainder and its subsequent sale or transfer do not constitute an attempt to avoid the requirements of this Chapter. 
h.  Reporting of assessor parcel number. For the purpose of tracking remainders, upon recordation of a final or parcel map and assignment of an assessor parcel number (APN) for a remainder, the subdivider shall deliver to the Planning Director a copy of the final or parcel map and report the APN for the remainder created by the subdivision. No building permit or certificate of occupancy for the lots created by a subdivision shall be issued until the subdivider has complied with the reporting requirements of this subsection. No certificate of compliance for the transfer of a remainder shall be issued until the subdivider has complied with the requirements of this subsection. 
i.  Appeals. A decision of the Planning Director or Town Engineer pursuant to this section may be appealed in accordance with the provisions of section 16-8-500(g). 
(Ord. No. 2009-253, § 2, 7-15-2009) 
16-8-160 - Modification of Requirements. 
    Whenever in the opinion of the relevant decisionmaker the land involved in any subdivision is of a size or shape, is subject to title limitations of record, is affected by topographical location or conditions, or is to be devoted to a use that it is impossible or impracticable in the particular case for the subdivider to conform fully to the regulations contained in this Chapter, the decisionmaker may make modifications as, in its opinion, are reasonably necessary or expedient and in conformity with the Subdivision Map Act. 
(Ord. No. 2009-253, § 2, 7-15-2009) 
16-8-170 - Approval Over an Existing Tentative Map. 
    Any approval or conditional approval of a tentative map or tentative parcel map over an existing approved tentative map or tentative parcel map (on the same piece or pieces of land) shall be conditioned upon the subdivider, prior to filing any subsequent drawings for plan check, submitting to the Planning Department a letter withdrawing one of the two (2) approved tentative maps or tentative parcel maps. Any denial of a tentative map or tentative parcel map shall not affect the prior approved or conditionally approved tentative map over the same piece or pieces of land. 
(Ord. No. 2009-253, § 2, 7-15-2009) 
16-8-180 - Administration of Restrictions Imposed Upon Recorded Maps. 
    Notations on previously recorded subdivision maps shall be reviewed by the Planning Director. If the Planning Director determines that notations on a previously recorded subdivision map are informational only, he or she shall use them to evaluate any proposed deviation from the existing approvals for subdivision and development of the property. If the Planning Director determines that notations constitute restrictions imposed upon the subdivision and development of the property, the subdivider shall be required to file a corrected or amended final map.

b.  Consistent with Government Code Section 66412, the Town may impose conditions, including but not limited to construction and dedication of improvements and exactions, upon a lot line adjustment. 
1.  The Town may impose conditions on a lot line adjustment as necessary to achieve conformity with the General Plan, applicable specific plans and area plans, the Zoning Ordinance, the Growth Control Ordinance, and building ordinances. 
(A)  The General Plan contains policies requiring new development to pay its fair share of required services and infrastructure in a timely manner (e.g. Community Services and Facilities Policy E.2 in the Town of Windsor General Plan-2015). The Town's specific plans and area plans contain similar policies related to the specific needs of the portions of the Town regulated by those plans. 
(B)  The frontage improvement and dedication requirements for new development contained in Chapter 2 of Title 16 of the Windsor Municipal Code are an implementation of the policies in the General Plan and therefore applicable to lot line adjustments. 
(C)  Because lot line adjustments further the development potential of the affected properties, the Town may impose conditions of approval as necessary to ensure that lot line adjustments as necessary to comply with applicable provisions of the General Plan, specific plans, area plans, the Zoning Ordinance, the Growth Control Ordinance, and building ordinances. The nature and extent of such conditions may be appealed as provided for in this Chapter. 
(D)  Existing restrictions imposed upon the parcels as a result of a recorded subdivision map (including notes, setbacks, and easements) shall be carried forward and recorded as part of the lot line adjustment in a form approved by the Town Engineer. This may include preparation of exhibits as determined necessary. 
2.  The Town may require prepayment of real property taxes prior to the approval of a lot line adjustment. 
3.  The Town may require the applicant to take any action that the approving body considers necessary to facilitate relocation of existing utilities, infrastructure, or easements. 
4.  Lot line adjustments shall be conditioned to require the subdivider to provide the following to the Town prior to final approval of the grant deeds creating the new property descriptions: 
(A)  Submittal of a Combining Agreement, approved by the Sonoma County Assessor's Office showing the combination of lots as per the approved map. 
(B)  Verification that all taxes that are a lien on the affected parcel and then payable have been paid to the Sonoma County Treasurer/Tax Collector's Office. 
(C)  Legal descriptions of the new parcel configurations. 
(D)  Title company verification that documents have been prepared to establish conformance of any deed of trust agreements to the adjusted lot boundaries and will be recorded under supervision of the title company concurrently with the lot line adjustment deeds. 
c.  An application for a lot line adjustment may be denied if it is determined that the adjustment would create the potential for an increase in density beyond the limit established for the area or would in any way detrimentally conflict with the Town's growth control regulations. 
d.  If the Planning Director believes the circumstances warrant such action, he/she may request that the Planning Commission decide whether to approve, conditionally approve, or deny an application for a lot line adjustment. 
e.  If the Planning Director, Town Engineer, or Planning Commission denies an application for a lot line adjustment, the applicant may appeal the decision as provided for in section 16-8-500(g) or 16-8-400(g), respectively. 
f.  All lot line adjustment approvals shall expire two years from their approval date. The owner of the affected property may apply for a single one-year extension. Any lot line adjustment not effectuated within two (2) years of approval, or after any extension, shall expire automatically, and a new application shall be required.

16-8-340 - Modification to Approved Condominium Subdivision. 
a.  Resubdivision of Condominium Airspace or Other Elements of a Condominium Plan. Resubdivision of airspace or other ownership or exclusive use areas created as part of a condominium plan shall be processed and reviewed in the same manner as major or minor subdivisions. An approved resubdivision shall be recorded as an amendment to the condominium plan if the resubdivision affects unit descriptions and either individual property owner or property owners association responsibilities, an amendment to the CC&Rs for the subdivision is also required. Approval by the owners association shall be provided upon application and for any documents revisions prior to authorization to record the amendment to the condominium plan. 
b.  Adjustments of Condominium Airspace or Other Elements of a Condominium Plan. Adjustments to airspace exclusive use areas or other ownership areas created as part of a condominium plan shall be processed and reviewed in the same manner as lot line adjustments. An approved adjustment shall be recorded as an amendment to the condominium plan if the resubdivision affects unit descriptions and either individual property owner or property owners association responsibilities, an amendment to the CC&Rs for the subdivision is also required. Approval by the owners association shall be provided upon application and for any documents revisions prior to authorization to record the amendment to the condominium plan. 
(Ord. No. 2009-253, § 2, 7-15-2009) 
16-8-350 - Plat Exhibits. 
    A plat exhibit may be required to accompany lot line adjustments, mergers, certificates of compliance, amendments to condominium plans and parcel map waivers. The plat exhibit shall be drawn to scale, shall be fully annotated and shall include and clearly define all streets, improvements, lot lines, lot boundaries, easements and any encroachments within the subject property(s). Deviations from this requirement shall require approval from the Town Engineer

1.  Soils Report. A preliminary soils report prepared in accordance with the Town's Grading Ordinance shall be submitted. If the preliminary soils report indicates the presence of critically expansive soils or other soil problems that, if not corrected, could lead to structural defects, the soils report accompanying the final map shall contain an investigation of each lot within the subdivision. The Town Engineer may require additional information or reject the report if it is found to be incomplete, inaccurate, or unsatisfactory. The preliminary soils report may be waived if the Town Engineer determines that, due to knowledge of the soil qualities in the subdivision, no preliminary analysis is necessary.

7.  Other Reports. Any other data or reports deemed necessary by the Planning Department. 
d.  Submittal to Planning Department. The tentative map application shall be considered complete for filing only when the map conforms to Section 16-8-400(b) and when all accompanying data or reports, as required by Section 16-8-400(c), have been submitted and accepted by the Planning Department (unless specifically waived by the Planning Director in consultation with the Town Engineer). The subdivider shall file with the Planning Department the number of tentative maps the director may deem necessary. The requirements of this section may be reduced by the Planning Department, upon consultation with other agencies and departments, if the Planning Director and Town Engineer agree that the specific requirements are not warranted or necessary based upon the scope, size, and attributes of the proposed subdivision. 
1.  Determination of Complete Application. The Planning Department shall determine whether the application is complete within thirty (30) days after receipt of the application and shall notify the applicant of its determination in writing. The application shall be determined as complete on the date a written "Determination of Application Status," showing a complete application, is prepared by the Planning Department and mailed to the developer. 
2.  Preliminary Review by Other Departments. The Planning Department may refer a subdivision application to interested departments and agencies when the Planning Department determines that the level of application information and data submitted are sufficient for meaningful preliminary evaluation, even if the application is not yet formally determined to be complete. The purpose of such initial review is to assist in early identification of issues and clarification of items needed to determine the completeness of the application. 
3.  Determination of Parcel Validity. As part of the Department's determination of application completeness, it may review the title report and other relevant information to determine, in addition, whether the property proposed to be subdivided constitutes a legally valid parcel. The Department may require the subdivider to submit additional information to prove that the property proposed to be subdivided is a legally valid parcel. If the Department questions the validity of a parcel, the burden shall be on the subdivider to demonstrate its legal validity. 
e.  Application Review. 
1.  The Planning Department shall forward copies of the tentative map to the affected public agencies, which may, in turn, forward to the Planning Department their findings and recommendations. Public agencies and utilities shall state that the subdivision can be adequately served. 
2.  The Planning Department shall also send a notice of the filing of the tentative map to the governing board of any elementary, high school, or unified school district within the boundaries of which the subdivision is proposed to be located. The notice shall also contain information about the location of the proposed subdivision, the number of units, density, and any other information that would be relevant to the affected school district. The governing board may review the notice and may send a written report to the Planning Commission. The report shall indicate the impact of the proposed subdivision on the affected school district and shall make recommendations as the governing board of the district deems appropriate. In the event the school district fails to respond within a twenty (20) day period from receipt of notice of the tentative map, the failure shall be deemed approval of the proposed subdivision by the school district. The Planning Commission shall consider the report from the school district in approving, conditionally approving, or denying the tentative map. 
3.  The Town's Staff Review Committee (SRC), a committee appointed by the Town Manager and comprised of representatives of development related Town departments as well as the local fire districts, may review and offer comments regarding the subdivision application. Review by the SRC typically includes application completeness, identification of issues to be resolved prior to approval, and forwarding of recommended conditions to the decisionmaking bodies. 
f.  Action by Town Council, Planning Commission, or Planning Director. The decisionmaker with primary responsibility to decide whether to approve a tentative map shall be as set forth in Section 16-8-210. Any decisionmaker may, however, opt to transfer the matter to the decisionmaker that would review its decision on appeal. Regardless of the decisionmaker, the following provisions shall apply to Town action on a tentative map. 
1.  Notice of Public Hearings. Upon the determination of a complete application, receipt of any recommendations from the Staff Review Committee, and satisfaction of the requirements of Section 21080.1 of the Public Resources Code, the application shall be set for public hearing. At least ten (10) calendar days before the public hearing, a notice shall be given of the time, date, and place of the hearing, including a general explanation of the matter to be considered, a general description of the area affected, and the street address, if any, of the property involved. 
(A)  Notice shall be given in the manner required by Government Code Sections 65090 and 65091, as follows: 
(1)  Publication once in a newspaper of general circulation; 
(2)  Mailing or delivery to the property owner and project applicant; 
(3)  Mailing or delivery to each local agency expected to provide water, sewage, streets, roads, schools or other essential facilities or services to the project; and 
(4)  Mailing or delivery to all owners of real property within three hundred (300) feet of the property. If the number of owners exceeds one thousand (1,000), the Town may instead publish notice of at least one-eighth ( 1/8 ) page in a newspaper of general circulation. 
(B)  In addition, the Town may give notice in any other manner it deems necessary or desirable. 
(C)  If the proposed project is a conversion of residential real property to a condominium, community apartment, or stock cooperative, notice shall be given to each tenant of the property consistent with this section and Government Code Sections 66451.3 and 66452.5(e). 
2.  Timing of Decision on Tentative Map. The decisionmaker shall approve, conditionally approve, or deny the tentative map and shall report its decision to (A) the Town Council, if the decisionmaker is the Planning Commission, or (B) the Planning Commission, if the decisionmaker is the Planning Director, and (C) the subdivider within fifty (50) days after certification of an environmental impact report, adoption of a negative declaration, or a determination by the Town that the project is exempt from the requirements of the California Environmental Quality Act. Timelines may be extended if the subdivision application also includes an application for rezoning or an amendment to the General Plan, or if it requires discretionary legislative action under the Growth Control Ordinance. 
3.  Approval of Tentative Map 
(A)  The decisionmaker may approve or conditionally approve the tentative map, if it finds that the proposed subdivision, together with the provisions for its design and improvement, is consistent with the General Plan and any applicable specific plans and area plans, the Town's Design Standards, the zoning ordinance, and all applicable provisions of this Code, including but not limited to the Growth Control Ordinance. 
(B)  The decisionmaker may modify or delete any of the conditions of approval recommended in the Planning Department's report, except conditions required by Town ordinance or by the Town Engineer, related to public health and safety or to standards approved by the Town Engineer. The decisionmaker may add additional requirements as a condition of its approval. 
(C)  Whether or not such a condition is explicitly listed as a condition of approval, every approved tentative map shall be deemed to include a condition requiring the subdivider to defend, indemnify, and hold harmless the Town and its agents, officers, and employees from any claim, action, or proceeding against the Town or its agents, officers, or employees to attach, set aside, void, or annul an approval of the Town Council, Planning Commission, Staff Review Committee, or Town Staff concerning a subdivision. The Town shall promptly notify the subdivider of any claim, action, or proceeding and shall cooperate fully in the defense. 
4.  Denial. The tentative map may be denied by the decisionmaker on any of the grounds provided by this Ordinance or the Subdivision Map Act. The decisionmaker shall deny approval of the tentative map if it makes any of the following findings: 
(A)  That the proposed map is not consistent with the General Plan, any applicable specific or area plans, the Town's Design Standards, the zoning ordinance, or any applicable provision of this Code. Additionally, the tentative map shall be denied if there are insufficient growth control allocations available under the Growth Control Ordinance; 
(B)  That the design or improvement of the proposed subdivision is not consistent with the General Plan or any applicable specific or area plans, the zoning ordinance, or any applicable provision of this Code; 
(C)  That the site is not physically suitable for the type of development; 
(D)  That the site is not physically suitable for the proposed density of development; 
(E)  That the design of the subdivision or the proposed improvements are likely to cause substantial environmental damage or substantially and avoidably injure fish or wildlife or their habitat. Notwithstanding the foregoing, the decisionmaker may approve such a tentative map if an environmental impact report was prepared with respect to the project and a finding is made pursuant to Section 21081(c) of the Public Resources Code that specific economic, social, or other considerations make infeasible the mitigation measures and project alternatives identified in the environmental impact report. 
(F)  That the design of the subdivision or the type of improvements are likely to cause serious public health problems; 
(G)  That the design of the subdivision or the type of improvements will conflict with easements, acquired by the public at large, for access through or use of property within the proposed subdivision. In this connection, the decisionmaker may approve a map if it finds that alternate easements for access or for use will be provided, and that they will be substantially equivalent to ones previously acquired by the public. This subsection shall apply only to easements of record or to easements established by judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction, and no authority is hereby granted to the decisionmaker to determine that the public at large has acquired easements for access through or use of property within the proposed subdivision. 
(H)  That the land is subject to a contract under the Williamson Act, and that the resulting parcels following the subdivision would be too small to sustain their agricultural use, subject to the exceptions listed in Section 66474(b) of the Subdivision Map Act. 
5.  Town Council Review 
(A)  Any member of the Town Council may request that the Town Council review the decision of the Planning Commission or Planning Director concerning the tentative map application. If a regular meeting of the Council occurs during the period in which an appeal of the Planning Commission or Planning Director decision may be filed, then a member of the Council may make a request for review orally during that meeting. Otherwise, a member of the Council may request review of the Planning Commission or Planning Director decision by filing a written request with the Town Clerk prior to the expiration of the time during which an appeal can be made. When such review is requested by any member of the Town Council, the request shall be deemed an appeal subject to the provisions of Section 16-8-400(g)(7). However, the member of the Council shall not be required to state a ground of the appeal, and there shall be a presumption applied that the appealed action has significant and material effects on the quality of life in the Town of Windsor. Additionally, no inference of bias shall be made because of such an appeal. 
(B)  If the Council does not act within the time limits set forth in this Article, the tentative map shall be deemed to have been approved or conditionally approved as set forth in the Planning Commission's report, if it complies with all other applicable provisions of the Subdivision Map Act, this Code, and the General Plan. 
6.  Extension of Time for Planning Director, Planning Commission or Town Council Action. The time limits set forth above for acting on the tentative map may be extended by mutual consent of the subdivider and the Planning Director, the Planning Commission, or the Town Council. 
7.  Appeals of Tentative Map Decisions 
(A)  Tentative map decisions of the Planning Director may be appealed to the Planning Commission, and decisions of the Planning Commission may be appealed to the Town Council, by the subdivider, any tenant of the subject property, or any other interested person adversely affected by the action, including a member of the Town Council, as provided for in subsection (5). 
(B)  Any appeal must be filed in writing and accompanied by the required fee. Appeals of a decision of the Planning Commission shall be filed with the Town Clerk; appeals of a decision of the Planning Director shall be filed with the Planning Department. All appeals must be filed within ten (10) days after the action being appealed. The appellant shall state the basis for the appeal. The Council or Commission shall consider the appeal within thirty (30) days, unless the subdivider consents to a continuance. The appeal shall be a public hearing after notice has been given pursuant to Section 16-8-400(g)(1). In addition, notice shall be given to the subdivider and the appellant. 
(C)  Upon conclusion of the public hearing, the Council or Commission shall, within seven (7) days, render its decision. The review on appeal shall not be limited to the issues stated in the appeal. The reviewing authority may sustain, modify, reject, or overrule any recommendations or rulings in the decision being appealed and may make such findings as are consistent with the provisions of this Chapter or the Subdivision Map Act. 
(D)  At the hearing, the appellate body may consider any issue involving the matter that is the subject of the appeal, in addition to the specific grounds of the appeal. The reviewing authority may: 
(i)  Affirm, affirm in part, or reverse the action, the determination, or the decision that is the subject of the appeal; 
(ii)  Adopt additional conditions of approval that may address issues or concerns other than the subject of the appeal. New conditions of approval shall be based upon substantial evidence in the record of the appeal, which may include information not presented during the hearing on the decision that is the subject of the appeal; or 
(iii)  Disapprove the tentative map, even though the appellant only requested a modification or elimination of one or more conditions of approval. 
(E)  If new or different evidence is presented on appeal, the Commission or Council may refer the matter to the prior decisionmaker for further consideration. 
g.  Expirations and Extensions. 
1.  Expiration.

(v)  If no improvement agreement is required for the project, timely filing of all other materials described above before the expiration of the tentative map shall constitute a "timely filing" within the meaning of Government Code section 66452.6(d). 
(F)  If the Town Engineer determines that the aforementioned materials delivered to the Town Engineer do not comply with the requirements of this subsection, and the Town Engineer returns them to the subdivider, the previously established expiration date of the tentative or vesting tentative map shall remain in effect. If the subdivider subsequently fails to deliver a version of the materials required herein that complies with the requirements of this subsection before the expiration of the tentative or vesting tentative map, pursuant to subsection (D), all proceedings related to the map shall cease, and a new tentative or vesting tentative map shall be required. 
2.  Extensions. 
(A)  Request by Subdivider. The subdivider or the engineer may request an extension of the expiration date of the approved or conditionally approved tentative map by written application to the Planning Department and payment of required fees prior to expiration of the map. The map shall automatically be extended for sixty (60) days or until the application for the extension is approved, conditionally approved, or denied, whichever occurs first. 
(B)  Planning Director Action. The Planning Department shall review the extension request and submit the application for the extension, together with a report, to the Planning Director at a noticed public hearing. A copy of the Department's report shall be forwarded to the subdivider prior to the hearing on the extension application. The Director may approve or deny an application. The record of the Planning Director's approval of an extension shall specify the new expiration date of the tentative map. The Planning Director may refer the decision on an extension application to the Planning Commission. The Planning Director shall refer the decision on an extension application to the Planning Commission if conditions of approval are recommended for the extension, as provided for in Section 16-8-400(g)(2)(E). 
(C)  Planning Commission Action. If the Planning Director refers a tentative map extension application to the Planning Commission, he or she shall submit the application and a report to the Commission at a noticed public hearing. A copy of the Planning Director's report shall be forwarded to the subdivider prior to the hearing on the extension. The Commission may approve, conditionally approve, or deny an application. The resolution adopted by the Commission approving or conditionally approving an extension shall specify the new expiration date of the tentative map. 
(D)  Denial of Extension. An application for an extension of a tentative map may be denied for the following reasons: 
(i)  Based on evidence in the record for the hearing on the extension application, circumstances surrounding the original approval have changed substantially so that the subdivision would result in one or more potentially significant and adverse environmental impacts that either 
(a)  were not previously identified and reduced to a less than significant level, or 
(b)  were previously identified but for which the adopted mitigation measures are no longer adequate to reduce an adverse environmental impact to a less than significant level. 
(ii)  The Town's infrastructure capacity, including any contributions from the subdivider in the form of fees or improvements, is no longer adequate to accommodate the subdivision. 
(iii)  Growth control allocations under the Town's Growth Control Ordinance are not available for the subdivision. 
(iv)  The subdivision conflicts with new policies approved by the Town Council by a resolution or ordinance adopted subsequent to the original approval or a previous extension of the tentative map. 
(E)  Conditions of Approval. As a condition of the extension of a tentative map, the Planning Commission, or the Town Council on appeal, may impose new conditions or revise existing conditions on the approved tentative map as recommended by the Planning Department in its report or as it may find necessary. Absent an agreement with the subdivider regarding new conditions, if at the time of an application for an extension of an expiration date, circumstances exist that would justify the denial of a map, as provided for in the Map Act and section 16-8-400(f)(4), the Council or Commission may impose additional conditions on the approval of an extension. In addition, the Council or Commission may impose new conditions on a map extension to the extent allowed by law. Tentative map extension applications that result in new or modified conditions of approval shall be approved by the Town Council or Planning Commission, and not by the Town staff. 
(F)  Time Limit of Extension. The expiration date may be extended pursuant to this Section for a period or periods totaling no more than five (5) years. If it chooses, the may require annual renewal for a total of five (5) years. 
(G)  Appeal. The subdivider or any interested person adversely affected by a decision on a tentative map extension application may appeal the decision within ten (10) days of it becoming final, in conformance with Section 16-8-400(f)(7) of this Chapter. The Town Council may seek review of a tentative map extension decision, in conformance with Section 16-8-400(f)(5). 
h.  Amendments to Approved Tentative Map. 
1.  Minor changes in the tentative map may be approved by the Planning Department upon application by the subdivider or on its own initiative, provided: 
(A)  No lots, units, or building sites are added; 
(B)  Such changes are consistent with the intent and spirit of the original tentative map approval; and 
(C)  There are no resulting violations of the Windsor Municipal Code. 
2.  Any such minor amendment shall be approved by the Planning Director and the Town Engineer and appropriately documented to their satisfaction. 
3.  Amendments of the tentative map that the Planning Department determines are not minor, including but not limited to amendment of conditions of approval, shall be properly noticed for public hearing and presented to the decisionmaking body for approval. In the event that (a) Town Council approval is required as part of the acceptance of a final map or related agreements, and (b) the Planning Director and Town Engineer both support the requested amendment, the hearing on the amendment may be conducted by the Town Council concurrently as part of the final map acceptance. 
4.  Processing of tentative map amendment applications shall be the same as for new tentative map applications, as set forth in this chapter. 
5.  Any approved amendment to a tentative map, including but not limited to a condition of approval, shall not alter the expiration date of the tentative map, unless the amendment application includes a request for an extension. 
6.  If an application to amend a tentative map includes a request to amend a condition of approval that was also a mitigation measure identified during the CEQA review process for the subdivision, then additional CEQA review may be required as part of the application.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, if an improvement agreement is not made a condition of tentative parcel map approval, construction of onsite and offsite improvements within a reasonable time following approval of the parcel map and prior to the issuance of a permit or other grant of approval for the development of a parcel may be made a condition of approval of the tentative parcel map, upon a finding that fulfillment of the construction requirements is necessary for either of the following reasons: 
1.  The public health and safety. 
2.  The required construction is a necessary prerequisite to the orderly development of the surrounding area. 
d.  Extensions. The approved life of a tentative parcel map may be extended by the filing of multiple parcel maps for the subdivision, under the same conditions and subject to the same terms as for tentative maps, as provided for in Section 16-8-400(g)(1) and 16-8-410(b) of this Chapter, if and only if all offsite improvements for the subdivision have been secured as part of the approval of the first parcel map.

In the event that an improvement agreement was not required or that, pursuant to Section 16-8-500(c), the timing of construction of offsite improvements was not otherwise established as a condition of approving a tentative parcel map, the Town Engineer may, in approving a parcel map, require fulfillment of the construction requirements within a reasonable time following approval of the parcel map and prior to the issuance of a permit or other grant of approval for the development of a parcel upon a finding that fulfillment of the construction requirements is necessary for either of the following reasons: 
1.  The public health and safety. 
2.  The required construction is a necessary prerequisite to the orderly development of the surrounding area. 
h.  Filing with the County Recorder. The Town Engineer or authorized agent shall file the approved parcel map directly with the County Recorder. 
(Ord. No. 2009-253, § 2, 7-15-2009) 
16-8-520 - Waiver of Parcel Map Requirements. 
a.  A subdivider may file an application for a waiver of the requirements for a parcel map in a form acceptable to the Planning Director. 
1.  A parcel map shall not be required for the following: 
(A)  Subdivisions of a portion of the operating right-of-way of a railroad corporation, as defined by Section 230 of the Public Utilities Code, that are created by short-term leases (terminable by either party on not more than thirty (30) days' notice in writing). 
(B)  Land conveyed to or from a governmental agency, public entity, public utility, or for land conveyed to a subsidiary of a public utility for conveyance to that public utility for rights-of-way, unless a showing is made in individual cases, upon substantial evidence, that public policy necessitates a parcel map. For purposes of this subsection, land conveyed to or from a governmental agency shall include a fee interest, a leasehold interest, an easement, or a license. 
2.  The Planning Director may waive the parcel map for any other division of real property that would otherwise require a parcel map, if the division of real property otherwise satisfies the requirements of this section. 
b.  A complete application for a parcel map waiver shall include a complete tentative parcel map application, providing the Town with the information necessary to determine whether it can make the findings required by subsection (c) below while also providing an opportunity for continued processing of the tentative parcel map in the event that the waiver is denied. The Planning Director may, however, waive the requirement of a tentative parcel map application, if unnecessary to make the findings in subsection (c) below. Upon receipt of a complete application for a parcel map waiver, the application shall be processed in the same manner as a tentative parcel map application. The Planning Director or other decisionmaker shall make a decision within sixty (60) days of receiving the complete application. In the event that the Planning Director denies a request for parcel map waiver, the request may be reconsidered by the appropriate decisionmaker as part of a concurrently processed tentative map or tentative parcel map application. 
c.  A parcel map may be waived, as provided in this Section, only upon the following findings by the decisionmaker: 
1.  The proposed division of land complies with requirements as to area, improvement and design, floodwater drainage control, appropriate improved public roads, sanitary disposal facilities, water supply availability, environmental protection, and other requirements of this Chapter, local ordinance, the Subdivision Map Act, and the General Plan; and 
2.  The public purposes served by recordation of a parcel map (e.g. providing an instrument for disclosure of title restrictions, easements, agreements, and other limitations of use which are either pre-existing or are resulting from the creation of the new parcel) do not apply. 
d.  Upon waiving the parcel map requirement, the Town Engineer shall cause to be filed with the County Recorder a "Certificate of Compliance" for the land to be divided and a plat map showing the division. The certificate shall include a statement regarding payment of taxes for signature by the County Clerk according to Section 16-8-410(e)(4)(G). 
e.  A tentative map may be required for all divisions of land for which a parcel map waiver is approved. 
f.  Parcel map waivers shall be subject to the same conditions as those for a tentative parcel map, as set forth in Section 16-8-500(b). 
g.  If the Planning Director, Planning Commission, or on appeal, Town Council denies an application to waive a parcel map, the subdivider may apply for a tentative and parcel map in accordance with this Article.

b.  Procedure. The requirement of dedication shall be imposed at the time of approval of the tentative map. If within thirty (30) days after the requirement of dedication is imposed by the Town, the school district does not offer to enter into a binding commitment with the subdivider to accept the dedication, the requirement shall be automatically terminated. The required dedication may be made any time before, concurrently with, or up to sixty (60) days after the filing of the final map on any portion of the subdivision. 
c.  Payments to Subdivider for School Site Dedication. The school district shall, if it accepts the dedication, repay to the subdivider or his or her successors the original cost to the subdivider of the dedicated land, plus a sum equal to the total of the following amounts: 
1.  The cost of any improvements to the dedicated land since acquisition by the subdivider; 
2.  The taxes assessed against the dedicated land from the date of the school district's offer to enter into the binding commitment to accept the dedication; 
3.  Any other costs incurred by the subdivider in maintenance of such dedicated land, including interest costs incurred on any loan covering such land.

The reserved area must be of such size and shape as to permit the balance of the property within which the reservation is located to develop in an orderly and efficient manner. The amount of land to be reserved shall not make development of the remaining land held by the subdivider economically unfeasible. The reserved area shall be consistent with the adopted specific plan or the General Plan and shall be in such multiples of streets and parcels as to permit an efficient division of the reserved area in the event that it is not acquired within the prescribed period. 
c.  Procedure. The public agency for benefit of which an area has been reserved shall, at the time of approval of the final map or parcel map, enter into a binding agreement to acquire such reserved area within two (2) years after the completion and acceptance of all improvements, unless the period of time is extended by mutual agreement. 
d.  Payment to Subdivider. The purchase price shall be the fair market value thereof at the time of the filing of the tentative map plus the taxes against such reserved area from the date of the reservation and any other costs incurred by the subdivider in the maintenance of the reserved area, including interest costs incurred on any loan covering the reserved area. 
e.  Termination. If the public agency for the benefit of which an area has been reserved does not enter into a binding agreement, the reservation of such area shall automatically terminate.

For the purposes of this subsection, "utilities" shall include wires, cables and related facilities, equipment, and structures used in the distribution of electricity or in the transmission of telephone, telecommunications, telegraph, data, radio, or television signals. All existing electrical distribution lines of 21kV (21,000 volts) or less shall be placed underground. The requirement to underground existing and proposed utilities within subdivisions shall otherwise apply unless exempted by an ordinance or resolution adopted by the Town Council. The Town Council may also grant an exception to the undergrounding requirements if topographical soil or other conditions make underground installation of the facilities not feasible or desirable. 
h.  Streets. 
1.  All streets (public and private) shall be constructed to widths and grades approved by the Town Engineer, and consistent with the Town's street design standards. The subdivider shall improve the extension of all subdivision streets, highways, or public ways to the intercepting centerline of any County road or Town street.

1.  At the time of making the survey for the final or parcel map, the engineer or surveyor shall set sufficient durable monuments to conform to (a) the standards described in Business and Professions Code Section 8771 and (b) the Town standards, so that another engineer or surveyor may easily retrace the survey. 
2.  Interior monuments need not be set at the time the map is recorded if the engineer or surveyor certifies on the map that the monuments will be set by a specified date and if the subdivider provides security to guarantee the cost. 
3.  Within five (5) days after the final setting of all monuments, the engineer or surveyor shall give written notice of the setting of the monument to the subdivider and to the Town Engineer. 
j.  Other Improvements. Other improvements such as street lights, fire hydrants, signs, street trees and landscaping, or fees in lieu of any of the foregoing, are required as determined by the Town Engineer in accordance with this title and Town standards and specifications. 
k.  Off-Site Improvements. 
1.  If the subdivider is required to construct off-site improvements on land in which neither the Town nor the subdivider has sufficient title or interest to allow construction, the construction of improvements and dedication of land shall be secured by a subdivision improvement agreement and the forms of security required by this Article. The Town shall, before approving the final or parcel map, require the subdivider to enter into the subdivision improvement agreement. 
2.  If the off-site improvements are identified as necessary for the development as part of the CEQA review process, and the subdivider has not already acquired sufficient title or legal interest in the property to be used for the improvements prior to submitting a complete subdivision application, then the Town shall defer considering approving the CEQA document and tentative map until the subdivider has attempted to acquire the necessary real property interests to construct the off-site improvements. If, after making a good-faith attempt, the subdivider is unable to acquire sufficient title or legal interest in the property necessary to construct the off-site improvements identified as part of the CEQA review process, the subdivider shall either revise the proposed project to eliminate the need for the off-site improvements or identify alternate and equivalent improvements. The Town may require additional CEQA review of the revised project or alternate and equivalent improvements. 
(Ord. No. 2009-253, § 2, 7-15-2009) 
16-8-820 - Design of Subdivision Improvements.

The Town Engineer shall act on the improvement plans within sixty (60) working days of its submittal, plus extensions agreed to or necessitated by corrections. 
d.  Approval by the Town Engineer. 
1.  After the subdivider has completed all required revisions, the subdivider shall transmit the corrected originals of the improvement plans to the Town Engineer for signature. 
2.  Upon finding that the required revisions have been made and that the plans conform to all applicable Town ordinances and plans, design requirements and conditions of approval of the tentative map, the Town Engineer shall sign and date the plans. The originals will be returned to the subdivider. Approval of the improvement plans shall not be construed as approval of the gas, electric, telephone, and cable television service construction plans. 
3.  Approval by the Town Engineer in no way relieves the subdivider or the subdivider's responsibility for the design of the improvements or for any deficiencies resulting from the design thereof or from any required conditions of approval for the tentative map. The approval of the improvement plans by the Town Engineer, or the Town Engineer's certification that no improvements are required, is a condition precedent to the approval of the final or parcel map of the subdivision. 
e.  Revisions to Approved Plans. 
1.  By Subdivider. A request by the subdivider for a revision to the approved plans, appearing necessary or desirable during construction, shall be submitted in writing to the Town Engineer and shall be accompanied by revised drawings showing the proposed revision.

1.  Performance security. In the case of public improvements to be dedicated to and accepted by the Town, the Town shall release performance security only upon acceptance of all improvements by the Town. In the case of improvements that will not be dedicated to and accepted by the Town, the Town shall release performance security only upon (a) the subdivider submitting certification by a registered civil engineer that the improvements have been constructed in accordance with the approved plans and specifications and (b) the improvements have passed any final inspections required by the responsible department. In either case, released of performance security shall also be predicated upon receipt of any required maintenance or warranty agreements and security therefor. Release and reduction of performance security shall be consistent with Government Code section 66499.7. 
2.  Material and labor security. Release and reduction of material and labor security shall be consistent with Government Code section 66499.7. 
3.  Warranty security. The Town shall release the warranty security upon satisfactory completion of the warranty period; provided:

The Town engineer and the flood control district shall have access to the work at all times during its construction and shall be furnished with every reasonable facility for ascertaining that the materials used and the workmanship are in accordance with the requirements of this title. If any of the work on improvements is done by the subdivider before the inspection of the improvements as required by the Town engineer, the Town engineer may reject that work, and it is deemed to have been done at the risk of the subdivider. 
e.  The subdivider shall prosecute the work to completion without undue delay except for inclement weather or other reasonable cause. If there is a delay in completion of the work beyond the period stated in the subdivision improvement agreement, unless an extension is approved by the Town council and the surety company, the Town council may take appropriate steps to use the security to complete the work. 
f.  The Town Engineer shall also inspect private streets, onsite grading, and utility systems improvements for conformance with this code and the zoning ordinance, and the Town design standards, detail drawings and construction specifications. 
(Ord. No. 2009-253, § 2, 7-15-2009) 
16-8-860 - Time of Completion. 
a.  Major subdivisions. 
1.  The subdivider shall complete the improvements for a subdivision of five (5) or more lots within two (2) years from the effective date of a subdivision improvement agreement between the Town and subdivider, unless an extension is granted by the Town council. 
2.  If the subdivider fails to complete the improvements within the specified time, the Town may, by resolution of the Town council, cause the uncompleted improvements to be completed, and the parties executing the performance security shall be firmly bound for the payment of all costs. 
b.  Minor subdivisions. The completion of improvements for subdivisions of four (4) or fewer parcels is not required until a permit or other grant of approval for the development of a lot within the subdivision is applied for.

b.  When dedications of rights-of-way, dedications of easements or improvements are accepted for public purposes, the Town Clerk shall file a notice with the county recorder. 
(Ord. No. 2009-253, § 2, 7-15-2009) 
16-8-870 - Supplemental Improvement Capacity. 
a.  As a condition of approval of a tentative map, there may be imposed a requirement that improvements installed by the subdivider for the benefit of the subdivision contain supplemental size, capacity, number, or length for the benefit of property not within the subdivision, and that those improvements be dedicated to the public. However, when such supplemental size, capacity, number, or length is solely for the benefit of property not within the subdivision, the Town shall, subject to the provisions of Sections 66486 and 66487 of the Government Code, enter into an agreement with the subdivider to reimburse the subdivider for that portion of the cost of such improvements equal to the difference between the amount it would have cost the subdivider to install such improvements to serve the subdivision only and the actual cost of such improvements. 
b.  The Town Council shall determine the method for payment of the costs required by a reimbursement agreement, which method may include, but shall not be limited to, the following: 
1.  The collection from other persons, including public agencies, using such improvements for the benefit of real property not within the subdivision, of a reasonable charge for such use. 
2.  The contribution to the subdivider of that part of the cost of the improvements that is attributable to the benefit to real property outside the subdivision and the levy of a charge upon the real property benefited to reimburse the Town for such costs, together with interest thereon, if any, paid to the subdivider. 
3.  The establishment and maintenance of local benefit districts for the levy and collection of such charge or costs from the property benefited. 
c.  If the Town Council determines to reimburse the subdivider through the creation of a benefit district, the following procedure shall be followed: 
1.  The Town Engineer shall prepare a report calculating the amount of the fee to be imposed on each benefited property. The report shall show that there is a reasonable relationship between the amount of the fee to be imposed on each benefited property and cost of the improvements constructed by the subdivider attributable to each benefited property. 
2.  Prior to approving the formation of the district and the fee, the Town Council shall hold a public hearing. 
3.  At least fourteen (14) days before the public hearing, the Town shall mail written notice of the hearing to the owners of benefited properties. The notice shall identify the improvements to be funded by the fee and the amount of the fee to be imposed on the benefited property. The notice shall additionally inform the owners of benefited properties that the report will be made available to them for review. 
4.  At the conclusion of the public hearing, the Town Council may approve by resolution the formation of the benefit district and the imposition of the fee to reimburse the subdivider for the costs of the improvements. 
5.  The public hearing may, but is not required to, be held at the same time as Town Council consideration of a subdivision improvement agreement and acceptance of a final map. In that event, the proposed fee shall be based upon the estimated cost to construct the improvements and shall be revised to reflect the actual cost of construction subsequent to acceptance by the Town Council.

16-8-880 - Deferred Improvement Agreements. 
    Although a subdivision improvement agreement is required for all subdivisions to ensure the construction of all improvements necessary to be completed as part of the development, the Town may permit some improvements to deferred until a later date. When the Town allows improvements to be deferred, the owner shall enter into an agreement with the Town in a form acceptable to the Town Engineer and Town Attorney for the installation of all deferred improvements at a time in the future as specified by the Town. 
    The agreement shall provide all of the following: 
a.  The owner shall begin construction of improvements within ninety (90) days of the receipt of the notice to proceed from the Town, or as mutually agreed upon in writing. The agreement may require the owner to deposit one hundred (100%) percent of the estimated cost of the improvements with the Town or to provide other security for their construction, consistent with the requirements of this Article. 
b.  In the event of default by the owner, the Town is authorized to cause construction of the improvements to be done and charge the entire cost and expense to the owner, including interest from the date of notice of said cost and expense until paid. The interest rate shall be consistent with the requirements of Article 15, Section 1 of the California State Constitution. 
c.  The agreement shall be recorded with the County Recorder at the expense of the owner, and shall constitute notice to all successors and assigns of the title to the real property of the obligations set forth therein, and shall also constitute a lien in such amount necessary to fully reimburse the Town, including interest as provided above, subject to foreclosure in the event of a default in payment. The obligations under the agreement shall run with the property and constitute a lien against it. 
d.  In the event of litigation occasioned by any default of owner, the owner agrees to pay all costs involved, including reasonable attorney's fees. Those costs shall become a part of the lien against the real property. The construction of deferred improvements shall conform to this tile and all applicable provisions of this code in effect at the time of construction.

The nature of a subdivider's vested rights shall depend on the content of the applicable ordinances, policies, and standards themselves. 
    However, if Section 66474.2 of the Government Code is repealed, the approval or conditional approval of a Vesting Tentative Map shall confer a vested right to proceed with development in substantial compliance with the ordinances, policies, and standards in effect at the time the vesting tentative map is approved or conditionally approved. 
b.  Notwithstanding subdivision (a), a permit, approval, extension, or entitlement may be made conditional or denied if any of the following are determined: 
1.  A failure to do so would place the residents of the subdivision or the immediate community, or both, in a condition dangerous to their health or safety, or both. 
2.  The condition or denial is required to comply with state or federal law. 
c.  The rights referred to herein shall expire, if a final map is not approved prior to the expiration of the vesting tentative map as provided in Section 16-8-1230. If the final map is approved, the rights shall last for the following periods of time: 
1.  An initial time period of one (1) year after recording. If several final maps are recorded on various phases of a project covered by a single vesting tentative map, the initial period shall begin for each phase when the final map for that phase is recorded. All of said final maps must be recorded within the time period set forth in Section 16-8-1230, or the vesting tentative map approval shall expire for those parcels for which final maps are not timely recorded. 
2.  The initial time period set forth above in subsection (c)(1) shall be automatically extended by any time used for processing a complete application for a grading permit, if such processing exceeds thirty (30) days from the date a complete application is filed. 
3.  A subdivider may apply for a one-year extension of the rights described herein at any time before the initial time period set forth in subsection (c)(1) expires. The request for extension shall be submitted, in writing, to the Secretary of the Planning Commission. The Planning Commission shall review any request for extension, and an extension may be granted for a maximum period of one (1) year. A Planning Commission denial of an extension request may be appealed to the Town Council within fifteen (15) days. The Planning Commission shall deny a request for extension, unless it finds that changes to any Town Ordinances, policies, or standards that were adopted subsequent to the time of filing the vesting tentative map are not necessary to protect the public health, safety, or welfare, or if it finds that the extension is not beneficial to the public health, safety, or welfare. 
4.  If the subdivider submits a complete application for a building permit during the periods of time specified in subsections (a) and (c), and the building permit is approved, the rights referred to herein shall continue until the expiration of that permit or any extension of that permit. 
5.  A failure to comply with the time limits or periods as specified in subsections (c)(1) through (c)(4) above shall result in a loss of rights conferred by final map approval. 
d.  In addition to conditions otherwise allowed by statute, ordinance, plan or the Town' police power, vesting tentative maps may also be subject to a condition which identifies the nature, type, and extent of public infrastructure or services which will be needed to serve the proposed subdivision and surrounding area during the projected life of the vesting tentative and final maps and which requires that the precise amount of the subdivider's contribution toward those types of infrastructure and services shall be calculated by the applicable Town department and paid at the time that building permits are issued.

16-8-1240 - Proposed Development Inconsistent with Zoning. 
    Should a subdivider file a vesting tentative map for a subdivision the intended development of which is inconsistent with the then-existing zoning on the property, that inconsistency shall be noted on the tentative map. The decisionmaker shall deny approval of the proposed vesting tentative map, if at the time the decisionmaker considers the proposed map, the zoning on the property is still inconsistent with the intended development. If, however, a rezoning is requested concurrently with consideration of a vested tentative map, the vesting tentative map approval shall be conditional upon successful rezoning of the property. Any concurrent rezoning decision to accommodate the vesting tentative map is subject to referendum, in which case the approval or denial of the vesting tentative map is subject to the outcome of the referendum.

The application for modification shall be processed and reviewed in the same manner as a tentative map. The decisionmaker may impose additional conditions on such maps. An such modifications shall not extend the life of the vesting tentative map or any rights created thereby.

Article 13. - Enforcement of Article Provisions 

16-8-1300 - Prohibition. 
a.  No person shall sell, lease, or finance any parcel or parcels of real property; commence construction of any building for sale, lease, or financing, except for model homes; or allow occupancy, for which a final map is required by this Chapter or the Subdivision Map Act, until a map, in full compliance with the provisions of this Chapter and the Subdivision Map Act, has been filed with the County Recorder for record. 
b.  No person shall sell, lease, or finance any parcel or parcels of real property; commence construction of any building for sale, lease, or financing, except for model homes; or allow occupancy, for which a parcel map is required by this Chapter or the Subdivision Map Act, until a map, in full compliance with the provisions of this Chapter and the Subdivision Map Act, has been filed for record by the Recorder. 
c.  Conveyances of any part of a division of real property for which a final or parcel map is required shall not be made by parcel number, letter, or other designation, unless and until the final or parcel map has been filed for record with the County Recorder. 
d.  This Section does not apply to any parcel or parcels of a subdivision offered for sale or lease, contracted for sale or lease, or sold or leased in compliance with or exempt from any law regulating the design and improvement of subdivisions in effect at the time the subdivision was established. 
e.  Nothing contained in subdivisions (a) through (d), inclusive, shall prohibit an offer or contract to sell, lease, or finance real property or to construct improvements, the sale, lease, financing, or commencement of construction of which is expressly conditioned upon the approval and filing of a final or parcel map. 
(Ord. No. 2009-253, § 2, 7-15-2009) 
16-8-1310 - Remedies. 
a.  Within one (1) year after the date of discovery of the violation, any deed of conveyance, sale, or contract to sell real property, divided or resulting from a division in violation of the provisions of this Chapter or the Subdivision Map Act, is voidable at the sole option of the grantee, buyer, person contracting to purchase, heir, personal representative, or trustee in insolvency or bankruptcy. The deed of conveyance, sale, or contract to sell is binding upon any successor in interest of the grantee, buyer, or person contracting to purchase, other than those above enumerated, and upon the grantor, vendor or person contracting to sell, or his assignee, heir, or devisee. 
b.  Any grantee or successor in interest of real property, divided or resulting from a division in violation of the provisions of this Chapter or the Subdivision Map Act, may, within one (1) year of the date of discovery of such violation, bring an action in the superior court to recover any damages suffered by reason of the division of property. The action may be brought against the person who divided the property in violation and against any successors in interest who have actual or constructive knowledge of such division of property. 
c.  The provisions of this Section shall not apply to the conveyance of any parcel of real property identified in a certificate of compliance filed pursuant to Section 16-8-1320 (10-1.1303) or identified in a recorded final or parcel map, from and after the date of recording. 
    The provisions of this Section shall not limit or affect in any way the rights of a grantee or successor in interest under any other provision of law. 
d.  This Section does not bar any legal, equitable, or summary remedy to which the Town, other public agency, person, firm, or corporation may otherwise be entitled. The Town and such other entities and persons may file a suit in the superior court of Sonoma County to restrain or enjoin any attempted or proposed subdivision for sale, lease, or financing in violation of this Chapter. 
e.  The Town shall not issue a permit or grant any approval necessary to develop any real property that has been divided or that has resulted from a division in violation of the provisions of this Chapter or the Subdivision Map Act, if it finds that development of the real property is contrary to the public health or the public safety. The authority to deny a permit or approval shall apply whether the applicant was the owner of the real property at the time of the violation, or whether the applicant is the current owner of the real property, with or without actual or constructive knowledge of the violation at the time of the acquisition of interest in the real property. 
    The Town, in issuing a permit or granting approval for the development of any real property illegally subdivided, may impose those additional conditions that would have been applicable to the division of the property at the time the current owner of record acquired the property. If the property has the same owner of record as at the time of the initial violation, the Town may impose conditions applicable to a current division of the property. If a conditional certificate of compliance has been filed for record, only those conditions stipulated therein shall be applicable. 
(Ord. No. 2009-253, § 2, 7-15-2009) 
16-8-1320 - Certificate of Compliance. 
a.  Any person owning real property may request the Town Engineer to determine whether the real property complies with the provisions of this Chapter and the Subdivision Map Act. 
b.  Upon making a determination that the real property complies with this Chapter and the Subdivision Map Act, the Town Engineer shall cause a certificate of compliance to be filed for record with the County Recorder. The certificate of compliance shall identify the real property and shall state that the division of land complies with the Subdivision Map Act and this Chapter. 
c.  If the Town Engineer determines that the real property does not comply with the provisions of the Municipal Code or Subdivision Map Act, the Town Engineer may, as a condition to granting a certificate of compliance, impose conditions according to Section 16-8-1310(e). Upon making a determination and establishing conditions, the Town Engineer or authorized representative shall file a conditional certificate of compliance for record with the County Recorder. The certificate shall serve as notice to the property owner who has applied for the certificate, a grantee of the property owner, or any subsequent transferee or assignee of the property that the fulfillment and implementation of the conditions shall be required prior to subsequent issuance of a permit or other grant of approval for development of the property. 
    Compliance with the conditions shall not be required until a permit or other grant of approval for development of the property is issued. 
d.  A recorded final or parcel map shall constitute a certificate of compliance with respect to the parcels of real property described therein. 
e.  A fee to be charged at actual cost shall be charged to the applicant for making the determination and processing the certificate of compliance. A deposit may be required to be applied toward the fee. 
f.  Each certificate of compliance or conditional certificate of compliance shall include information the Town Engineer deems necessary, including, but not limited to, all of the following: 
1.  Name or names of owners of the parcel. 
2.  Assessor parcel number or numbers of the parcel. 
3.  The number of parcels for which the certificate of compliance or conditional certificate of compliance is being issued and recorded. 
4.  Legal description of the parcel or parcels for which the certificate of compliance or conditional certificate of compliance is being issued and recorded. 
5.  A notice stating as follows: "This certificate relates only to issues of compliance or noncompliance with the Subdivision Map Act and local ordinances enacted pursuant thereto. The parcel described herein may be sold, leased, or financed without further compliance with the Subdivision Map Act or any local ordinance enacted pursuant thereto. Development of the parcel may require issuance of a permit or permits, or other grant or grants of approval." 
6.  (A)  Any conditions to be fulfilled and implemented prior to subsequent issuance of a permit or other grant of approval for development of the property, as specified in the conditional certificate of parcel compliance. 
(B)  The Town Engineer may process applications for certificates of compliance or conditional certificate of compliance concurrently and may record a single certificate of compliance or a single conditional certificate of compliance for multiple parcels. Where a single certificate of compliance or conditional certificate of compliance is certifying multiple parcels, the single certificate of compliance or conditional certificate of compliance shall clearly identify, and distinguish between, the descriptions of each such parcel. 
(Ord. No. 2009-253, § 2, 7-15-2009) 
16-8-1330 - Notice of Violation. 
a.  If the Town Engineer or authorized representative has knowledge that real property has been divided in violation of the provisions of this Chapter or the Subdivision Map Act, a notice of intention to record a notice of violation shall be mailed by certified mail to the current owner of record. The notice shall describe the property in detail, name the owner, describe the violation, and state that the owner will be given opportunity to present evidence. The notice shall specify the date, time, and place for a meeting at which the owner may present evidence to the Town Engineer why a notice of violation should not be recorded. 
b.  The meeting shall be held no sooner than thirty (30) days and no later than sixty (60) days from the date of mailing. If, within fifteen (15) days of receipt of the notice, the owner fails to notify the Town Engineer of his/her objection to the recording of the notice of violation, the Town Engineer shall record it. If, after the owner presents evidence, the Town Engineer determines that the property has in fact been illegally divided, the Town Engineer shall record the notice of violation. If, after the owner presents evidence, the Town Engineer determines that there has been no violation, the Town Engineer shall mail a clearance letter to the owner. 
c.  The notice of violation, when recorded, shall be constructive notice of the violation to all successors in interest in the property. 
(Ord. No. 2009-253, § 2, 7-15-2009) 
16-8-1340 - Penalties. 
a.  Each violation of this Chapter by a person who is the subdivider or an owner of record, at the time of the violation, of property involved in the violation shall be punishable by imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding one year or in the state prison, by a fine not exceeding ten thousand dollars ($10,000), or by both fine and imprisonment. The Town may alternatively, in its discretion, charge such a violation as a misdemeanor. Every other violation of this Chapter is a misdemeanor. 
b.  Any person convicted of a misdemeanor under the provisions of this Chapter shall be punishable by imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding six (6) months, by fine not exceeding one thousand dollars ($1,000), or by both. 
c.  Except as otherwise provided in this Chapter, each person shall be guilty of a separate offense for each and every day during any portion of which any violation of any provision of this Chapter is committed, continued, or permitted by such person and shall be punishable accordingly. 
(Ord. No. 2009-253, § 2, 7-15-2009) 
16-8-1350 - Judicial Action. 
    Any action or proceeding to attack, review, set aside, void, or annul the decision of the Town Engineer, Planning Director, Planning Commission, or Town Council concerning a subdivision or any of the proceedings, acts, or determinations taken, done, or made prior to such decision, and any action or proceeding to determine the reasonableness, legality, or validity of any condition attached thereto shall not be maintained by any person, unless the action or proceeding is commenced and service of summons effected within ninety (90) days after the date of the decision. Thereafter, all persons are barred from any such action or proceeding or any defense of invalidity or unreasonableness of the decision or of the proceedings, acts, or determinations. Any such proceeding shall take precedence over all matters of the calendar of the court, except criminal, probate, eminent domain, forcible entry, and unlawful detainer proceedings.

CHAPTER 27.01 - PURPOSE AND APPLICABILITY OF ZONING
ORDINANCE
27.01.010 - Purpose of Zoning Ordinance
The Town of Windsor Zoning Ordinance carries out the policies of the Windsor General Plan by classifying and regulating the uses of land and structures within the Town, consistent with the General Plan. This Zoning Ordinance is adopted to protect and to promote the public health, safety, comfort, convenience, prosperity, and general welfare of residents, and businesses in the Town. More specifically, the purposes of this Zoning Ordinance are to:
A. Provide standards and guidelines for the orderly growth and development of the Town that will assist in protecting the rural characteristics and community identity of Windsor;
B. Conserve and protect the Towns natural beauty and setting, including the rolling hills and oak trees, scenic vistas, and historic and environmental resources;
C. Create a comprehensive and stable pattern of land uses upon which to plan transportation, water supply, sewerage and other public facilities and utilities;
D. Minimize automobile congestion by promoting pedestrian oriented development, safe and effective traffic circulation, and adequate off-street parking facilities; and
E. Ensure compatibility between residential and commercial development and land uses.
27.01.020 - Authority
This Zoning Ordinance is enacted based on the authority vested in the Town of Windsor by the State of California, including but not limited to: the State Constitution; the Planning and Zoning Law (Government Code Sections 65000 et seq.); and the California Environmental Quality Act (Public Resources Code Sections 21000 et seq.).
27.01.030 - Responsibility for Administration
This Zoning Ordinance shall be administered by: the Windsor Town Council, hereafter referred to as the Council; the Planning Commission, referred to as the Commission; the Town Planning Director, referred to as the Director; and the Town Planning Department, hereafter referred to as the Department.
1-3
27.01.040 - Applicability of the Zoning Ordinance
This Zoning Ordinance applies to all land uses, subdivisions, and development within the Town of Windsor, as provided by this Section.
A. New land uses or structures, changes to land uses or structures. It shall be unlawful, and a violation of this Zoning Ordinance for any person to establish, construct, reconstruct, alter, or replace any use of land or structure, except in compliance with the requirements of Section 27.06.020 (General Requirements for Development and New Land Uses), and Chapter 27.50 (Nonconforming Uses, Structures, and Parcels).
B. Subdivisions. Any subdivision of land proposed within the Town after the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance shall be consistent with the minimum lot size requirements of Article 2 (Zoning Districts and Allowable Land Uses), the subdivision requirements of the Town of Windsor Subdivision Ordinance, and all other applicable requirements of this Zoning Ordinance.
C. Continuation of an existing land use. An existing land use is lawful and not in violation of the this Zoning Ordinance only when operated and maintained in compliance with all applicable provisions of this Zoning Ordinance, including Chapter 27.50 (Nonconforming Uses, Structures, and Parcels). However, the requirements of this Zoning Ordinance are not retroactive in their effect on a land use that was lawfully established before the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance or any applicable amendment.
D. Effect of Zoning Ordinance changes on projects in progress.
1. A land use permit application that has been accepted by the Department as complete prior to the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance or any amendment shall be processed in compliance with the requirements in effect when the application was accepted as complete.
2. A project that is under construction on the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance or any amendment, need not be changed to satisfy any new or different requirements of this Zoning Ordinance, provided that the approved use of the site shall be established, including the completion of all structures and other features of the project as shown on the approved permit, before the expiration of the permit, or applicable time extension.
E. Minimum requirements. The provisions of this Zoning Ordinance shall be minimum requirements for the promotion of the public health, safety, and general welfare. When this Zoning Ordinance provides for discretion on the part of a Town official or body, that discretion may be exercised to impose more stringent requirements than set forth in this Zoning Ordinance, as may be necessary to promote orderly land use and development, environmental resource protection, and the other purposes of this Zoning Ordinance.
1-4
F. Conflicting requirements:
1. Zoning Ordinance and Town Code provisions. If conflicts occur between requirements of this Zoning Ordinance, or between this Zoning Ordinance, the Town of Windsor Code, or other regulations of the Town, the most restrictive shall apply.
2. Development Agreements or Specific Plans. If conflicts occur between the requirements of this Zoning Ordinance and standards adopted as part of any Development Agreement or applicable Specific Plan, the requirements of the Development Agreement or Specific Plan shall apply.
3. Private agreements. This Zoning Ordinance applies to all land uses and development regardless of whether it imposes a greater or lesser restriction on the development or use of structures or land than a private agreement or restriction, without affecting the applicability of any agreement or restriction. The Town shall not enforce any private covenant or agreement unless it is a party to the covenant or agreement.
G. Other requirements may apply. Nothing in this Zoning Ordinance eliminates the need for obtaining any other permits required by the Town, or any permit, approval, or entitlement required by the regulations of any regional, State, or Federal agency.
27.01.050 - Interpretations
A. Authority. The Director has the authority to interpret any provision of this Zoning Ordinance.

B. Language. When used in this Zoning Ordinance, the words "shall," "must," "will," "is to," and "are to" are always mandatory. "Should" is not mandatory but is strongly recommended; and "may" is permissive. The present tense includes the past and future tenses; and the future tense includes the present. The singular number includes the plural number, and the plural the singular, unless the natural construction of the word indicates otherwise.

CHAPTER 27.08 - RESIDENTIAL ZONING DISTRICTS
27.08.010 - Purpose of Chapter
This Chapter lists the land uses that may be allowed within the residential zoning districts established by Section 27.04.020 (Zoning Map and Zoning Districts), determines the type of land use permit/approval required for each use, and provides basic standards for site layout and building size.
27.08.020 - Purposes of Residential Zoning Districts
(Revised 4/18/18, Ord. 2018-325)
The residential zoning districts are provided to preserve, enhance, and expand the existing housing stock to provide a range of safe housing opportunities for all members of the Windsor community, and to blend in with the natural setting of the community. The purposes of the individual residential zoning districts and the manner in which they are applied are as follows.
A. ER (Estate Residential) District. The ER zoning district is intended for areas suitable for single-family residential development on larger parcels. The allowable density ranges from zero to three dwelling units per acre. The ER zoning district is consistent with the Estate Residential and Rural Residential land use classifications of the General Plan.
B. SR (Surrounding Residential) District. The SR zoning district is intended for areas appropriate for a mixture of housing types. The primary housing type is single-family homes; however, duplexes and triplexes are encouraged within the allowable density range. The allowable density ranges from three to six dwelling units per acre. The SR zoning district is consistent with the Very Low Density land use classification of the General Plan.
C. VR (Village Residential) District. The VR zoning district is intended for areas appropriate for a mixture of housing types on smaller lots. The allowable density ranges from five to eight dwelling units per acre. The lower end of the density range may be appropriate adjacent to the SR or ER zoning districts, with the higher end of the range being appropriate near neighborhood centers, parks, and transit stops. The VR zoning district is consistent with the Low Density Residential land use classification of the General Plan.
D. MDR (Medium Density Residential) District. The MDR zoning district is intended for areas appropriate for multi-family housing, and is suitable near activity centers and along major thoroughfares. This zoning district allows for a variety of residential opportunities including small single-family units, row houses, townhomes, and small apartment complexes. The allowable density ranges from eight to sixteen dwelling units per acre. The MDR zoning district is consistent with the Medium Density Residential and Mobile Home Park land use classifications of the General Plan.
E. HDR (High Density Residential) District. The HDR zoning district is intended for areas appropriate for high-density, multi-family housing. Typical dwelling units include
2-9
townhouses and apartments. The allowable density ranges from sixteen to thirty-two dwelling units per acre. The HDR zoning district is consistent with the High Density Residential land use classification of the General Plan.
F. CR (Compact Residential) District. The CR zoning district is intended for areas of compact high density housing, especially in association with nearby mixed use development and near transit corridors or stops. Typical dwelling units include apartments, condominiums and town homes. In limited circumstances, schools, parks and other public facilities may be provided to serve the residential community. The allowable density ranges from twelve to twenty-four units per acre for CR-24 zoned sites to twelve to thirty-two units per acre for CR-32 zoned sites. The CR zoning district is consistent with the High Density Residential land use classification of the General Plan.

Notes:
(1) Lot widths, lot sizes, and setbacks below the minimum may be authorized by Use Permit approval or through rezoning to apply the -PD overlay district where the review authority finds that a lesser lot width, lot size, or setback will be adequate after first reviewing the design and layout of the proposed housing units.
(2) Allowable density will be determined for each specific site by the review authority through the Minor Use Permit, Use Permit, Tentative Map, or -PD rezoning process, as applicable.
(3) A porch with a minimum depth of six feet may encroach into a required front setback.
(4) But not less than 10 feet further from the street than the front facade of the residence.

(11) For single-family houses, duplexes and townhouses, garages should not make up more than 50% of the street-facing width of the house. However, where lot widths are less than 45 feet, wider garage doors may be allowed with a Conditional Use Permit if garage door dominance is minimized through innovative lot patterns, deeper garage setbacks or architectural excellence.
(Revised 08/1/01, ORD. 2001-148)
(12) New homes should provide a minimum of 48 square feet of covered porch (with a minimum depth of 6 feet clear of railings and supports).

For up to 50% of all units within a project, arbors, trellises, courtyards and similar landscape architectural features may substitute for porches at the front door if they are accompanied by fast-growing vines, and if the front door is protected from rain. (Revised 08/1/01, ORD. 2001-148)
(13) Corner lots shall have enhanced architecture  such as windows, bay windows, doors, wraparound porches (strongly recommended), room projections, changes in roofline features, etc.  on both street frontages. These enhanced architectural features shall be provided for a minimum of 50% of the side street frontage elevation. (Revised 08/1/01, ORD. 2001-148 and Revised 03/15/05 ORD. 2005-189)

Proposed residential projects of two or more dwelling units shall be designed to provide on the site a minimum of 400 square feet of usable open space per dwelling unit, in compliance with the following standards.
A. Composition of open space. The open space may be a combination of common open space accessible to all project residents, or private open space for the exclusive use of a single dwelling; however, no unit shall have less than 50 square feet of private open space when it is provided by a deck or balcony, or 100 square feet when provided by a yard at ground level. Porch areas can apply toward these requirements, but driveways and service areas shall not be counted as applying.

CHAPTER 27.10 - COMMERCIAL ZONING DISTRICTS
27.10.010 - Purpose of Chapter
This Chapter lists the land uses that may be allowed within the commercial zoning districts established by Section 27.04.020 (Zoning Map and Zoning Districts), determines the type of land use permit/approval required for each use, and provides basic standards for site layout and building size.
27.10.020 - Purposes of Commercial Zoning Districts
(Revised 4/18/18, Ord. 2018-325)
The commercial zoning districts are intended to provide an open and inviting business climate for new and existing businesses, a balanced economic environment, and diverse tax base. The purposes of the individual commercial zoning districts and the manner in which they are applied are as follows.
A. NC (Neighborhood Center Commercial) District. The NC zoning district is applied to areas where residents can shop, socialize, or recreate. This zoning district includes a mix of land uses that would be appropriate along major thoroughfares and adjacent to the MDR zoning district. Different NC land uses can be located in the same building or on the same site, and include retail, child care, and public uses. The NC zoning district is consistent with the Neighborhood Commercial Mixed Use land use classification of the General Plan.
B. CC (Community Commercial) District. The CC zoning district is applied to areas appropriate for a range of local- and community-serving retail and service land uses, including restaurants, shops, personal and business services. The CC zoning district is consistent with the Retail Commercial and General Business land use classifications of the General Plan.
C. TC (Town Center Commercial) District. The TC zoning district is intended to provide attractive areas within the Old Town where the community can gather to socialize, shop, recreate, or live. This zoning district includes diverse, compatible land uses that can be developed on the same site, and where desirable, in the same building. Appropriate land uses include retail, high density residential, public uses, hotels and motels, and offices. The TC zoning district is consistent with the Town Center Mixed Use land use classification of the General Plan.
D. TC (Town Center Commercial) Active Use Frontage Overlay District. The TC Active Use Frontage Overlay District is intended to provide attractive areas within the downtown where the community can gather to socialize, shop, recreate, or live. This zoning district includes diverse, compatible land uses that can be developed on the same site, and where desirable, in the same building. Appropriate land uses include retail, high density residential, public uses, hotels and motels. However, this District requires that the ground level have uses that are accessible to the general public, generate walk-in pedestrian clientele and thus contribute to a high level of pedestrian activity, and are engaging to pedestrians walking by. The TC zoning district is consistent with the Town Center Mixed Use land use classification of the General Plan and the
2-18
Station Area/Downtown Specific Plan. The TC Active Use Frontage Overlay zoning district is consistent with the Town Center land use classification of the Station Area/Downtown Plan.
E. TC (Town Center Commercial) Entertainment Overlay District. The TC Entertainment Overlay District is intended to promote entertainment uses and limit potential incompatibility with residential uses. The Entertainment Overlay restricts residential uses and serves community and regional retail needs with a focus on entertainment and recreation uses. This includes nightlife venues, various types of theaters, music venues, arcades/game rooms, and restaurants. While these uses are encouraged in this area by restricting housing, it is noted that entertainment uses are allowed throughout the Town Center designation. The TC zoning district is consistent with the Town Center Mixed Use land use classification of the General Plan. The TC Entertainment Overlay zoning district is consistent with the Town Center land use classification of the Station Area/Downtown Plan.
F. SC (Service Commercial). The SC zoning district is applied to areas suitable for land intensive personal and business service uses, including automobile repair shops, construction equipment sales and rental yards, service stations, and outdoor recreation uses. The SC zoning district is consistent with the Service Commercial land use classification of the General Plan.
G. GC (Gateway Commercial). The GC zoning district is applied to areas along highways that are visually prominent entryways into the town. Land uses in the GC zoning district are intended to serve the region, and include retail and tourist-related uses. Given the prominent locations of this zoning district, development will need to be of particularly high quality in design. The GC zoning district is consistent with the Gateway Commercial land use classification of the General Plan.
H. BC (Boulevard Commercial). The BC zoning district is applied to areas of intensive mixed use development with extensive pedestrian-oriented frontage on a boulevard street, near transit service and stops, and is intended primarily to serve local residents and businesses. A mix of compatible land uses is encouraged within the same building or on the same site, and could include public facilities or plazas, residential, retail, office and childcare uses. The BC zoning district is consistent with the Boulevard Mixed Use land use classification of the General Plan. (Revised 08/3/05, ORD. 2005-192)
I. RC (Regional Commercial). The RC zoning district is applied in locations where more intensive employment opportunities, residential, shopping, visitor-serving, and institutional uses are mixed to serve Windsor and the surrounding community. This zoning district provides for a mix of diverse and compatible land uses in the same building or on the same site, and could include public facilities or plazas, retail, higher density residential, hotel/motel accommodations, conference facilities, health services and office uses. The RC zoning district is consistent with the Gateway Commercial land use classification of the General Plan.

27.10.030 - Commercial District Land Uses and Permit Requirements
Table 2-4 identifies the uses of land allowed by this Zoning Ordinance in the commercial zoning districts, and the land use permit required to establish each use, in compliance with Section 27.06.030 (Allowable Land Uses and Permit Requirements).
Note: the far right column in the tables ("Specific Use Regulations") will show a section number for regulations that apply to the particular use listed, in addition to the other general standards of this Zoning Ordinance.
A. Windsor Station Area/Downtown Specific Plan: Properties within the adopted Windsor Station Area/Downtown Specific Plan are subject to additional design and development standards. Where conflicts arise between the Zoning Ordinance and the Windsor Station Area/Downtown Specific Plan, the Windsor Station Area/Downtown Specific Plan criteria and standards shall apply. (Revised 02/06/13, ORD 2013-277)

CHAPTER 27.12 - INDUSTRIAL ZONING DISTRICTS
27.12.010 - Purpose of Chapter
This Chapter lists the land uses that may be allowed within the industrial zoning districts established by Section 27.04.020 (Zoning Map and Zoning Districts), determines the type of land use permit/approval required for each use, and provides basic standards for site layout and building size.
27.12.020 - Purposes of Industrial Zoning Districts
The purposes of the individual industrial zoning districts and the manner in which they are applied are as follows.
A. BPI (Industrial/Business Park) District. The BPI zoning district is applied to areas appropriate for light industrial and business park land uses, including low-intensity manufacturing and assembly processes, research and development, and corporate headquarters offices. The land uses allowed and development standards required within the BPI district are intended to protect adjacent areas from impacts while allowing indoor, clean, and quiet industry. Land uses in the BPI zoning district are often organized as a business park, with tenants that may include some commercial activities. The BPI zoning district is consistent with the Light Industrial land use designation of the General Plan.
B. LI (Light Industrial) District. The LI zoning district is applied to areas appropriate for light industrial and manufacturing, warehousing, offices and assembly uses. Land uses allowed in the LI zoning district will not create objectionable noise, smoke, odor, dust, noxious gases, glare, heat, vibration, or industrial wastes. The LI zoning district is consistent with the Light Industrial land use designation of the General Plan.
C. HI (Heavy Industrial) District. The HI zoning district is applied to areas appropriate for a wider variety of land uses that are more land-intensive manufacturing uses than allowed in the LI district. These include industrial manufacturing, warehousing, offices, and assembly that may generate objectionable noise, smoke, odor, dust, noxious gases, glare, heat, vibration, and industrial wastes. The HI zoning district is consistent with the Heavy Industrial land use designation of the General Plan.
2-26
27.12.030 - Industrial District Land Uses and Permit Requirements
A. General requirements. Table 2-6 identifies the uses of land allowed by this Zoning Ordinance in each industrial and special purpose zoning district, and the land use permit required to establish each use, in compliance with Section 27.06.030 (Allowable Land Uses and Permit Requirements).
Note: the far right column in the tables ("Specific Use Regulations") will show a section number for regulations that apply to the particular use listed, in addition to the other general standards of this Zoning Ordinance.
B. Permit requirement for expansion. Any expansion of an existing use within an industrial zoning district shall require Minor Use Permit approval (Section 27.42.050).

CHAPTER 27.16 - OVERLAY ZONING DISTRICTS
27.16.010 - Purpose of Chapter
This Chapter regulates new and existing structures and land uses in the overlay zoning districts established by Section 27.04.020 (Zoning Map and Zoning Districts), being appended as a suffix to the symbol for the primary zoning district on the Zoning Map (e.g. RM-H). The provisions of this Chapter provide guidance for development in addition to the standards and regulations of the primary zoning districts, where important site, environmental, safety, compatibility, or design issues require particular attention in project planning.
27.16.020 - Applicability of Overlay Zoning Districts
A. Mapping of overlay districts. The applicability of any overlay zoning district to a specific site is shown by the overlay Zoning Map symbol established by Section 27.04.020 (Zoning Map and Zoning Districts), being appended as a suffix to the symbol for the primary zoning district on the Zoning Map (for example, CT-F).
B. Conflicting provisions. The provisions of this Chapter apply to proposed land uses and development in addition to all other applicable requirements of this Zoning Code. In the event of any perceived conflict between the provisions of this Chapter and any other provision of this Zoning Code, the most restrictive shall control.
27.16.030 - Airport Safety (-AS) Overlay District
A. Purpose. The intent of the -AS overlay zone is to protect people and property both in the air and on the ground by regulating structures that may affect navigable airspace, consistent with Federal regulations, and to minimize noise, safety, and other conflicts between airport operations and surrounding land uses. Land uses within this overlay zone are regulated in recognition that certain development and land use characteristics may conflict with the safe and efficient operation of the airport and aircraft.
It is further the intent of this district to establish consistency between the Town of Windsors zoning regulations and the adopted policies of the Sonoma County Airport Land Use Commission as they exist at the time of ordinance adoption. (Revised 03/5/03, ORD. 2003-164)
B. Applicability. The -AS overlay zoning district is applied to lands within the Sonoma County Airport referral area that are subject to:
1. Sonoma County Airport Land Use Plan: adopted January 8, 2001, Resolution No. and Amended on October 9, 2001 Resolution No. by the Sonoma County Airport Land Use Commission. (Revised 03/5/03, ORD. 2003-164)
2. For purposes of this section, Airport Land Use Plan shall mean the Comprehensive Airport Land Use Plan for Sonoma County. (Revised 03/5/03, ORD. 2003-164)
2-38
C. Allowed land uses. Any land use normally allowed in the primary zoning district by this Chapter may be allowed within the -AS overlay zone, provided that the land use is also in compliance with any applicable Airport Land Use Plan standards.
D. Permit requirements. A proposed development and/or new land use within the -AS overlay district shall obtain the land use permit required by this Chapter for the primary zoning district.
E. Development standards. Development and new land uses within the -AS overlay zone shall comply with the Airport Land Use Plan, all applicable permit and development requirements of the primary zoning district, and the following requirements.
1. Height limits. The height limits of the Airport Land Use Plan apply if they are more restrictive than otherwise required by this Chapter for the primary zoning district, or by Article 3 (Site Planning and General Development Standards).
2. Lot Coverage. The lot coverage defined by the Airport Land Use Plan applies if after reviewing the Airport Land Use Plan as applied to the entire affected zone and not just those parcels within the Town of Windsor, it is more restrictive than otherwise required by this Chapter for the primary zoning district or by Article 3 (Site Planning and General Plan Development Standards). (Revised 03/5/03, ORD. 2003-164)
3. Intensity of Use. Intensity of proposed uses within the _ AS overlay shall be defined by the Airport Land Use Plan. Prior to issuance of any Building Permit on commercial properties in the AS overlay, the Town may require the property owner to execute and record an agreement or similar legal instrument limiting the number of employees and type of business to those allowed by the Airport Land Use Plan. (Revised 03/5/03, ORD. 2003-164)
4. Noise mitigation. Proposed structures shall be designed and constructed to provide noise insulation to reduce interior noise levels to the community noise equivalent level (CNEL) recommended by the Noise Element of the General Plan.
5. Aviation easements, noise agreements. Prior to the Towns issuance of any Building Permit, the approval of a Tentative Map, or the approval of a land use permit in compliance with this Zoning Ordinance, the property owner shall enter into an agreement with the County of Sonoma granting any necessary aviation easements for aircraft over flight, and acknowledging and permitting the ongoing exposure of the site to aircraft noise. The property owner shall record the agreement/easements with the Sonoma County Recorder.
2-39
27.16.040 - Flood Hazard (-F) Overlay District
A. Purpose. The -F overlay zoning district is applied to areas within the Town prone to flooding, to protect people and property by requiring that proposed development and new land uses be designed and constructed so as to minimize the risk of flood damage, and to not increase the flood hazard on other properties.
B. Applicability. The -F overlay zoning district is applied to areas determined to be at risk for flood hazards identified on the maps prepared by the Federal Emergency Management Act (FEMA), and to other areas that may be identified by the Town Engineer as being subject to flooding.
C. Allowed land uses. Any land use normally allowed in the primary zoning district by this Article may be allowed within the -F overlay district, provided that the land use is also in compliance with development standards identified below and other applicable development standards required by this ordinance, Article 3, (Site Planning and General Development Standards).
D. Development standards. Development and new land uses shall comply with the following requirements, to prevent encroachment of flood waters on adjacent properties, and prevent undue increases in flood heights and danger to life and property within this and adjoining districts.
1. New residential, commercial, and industrial structures will be permitted, if designed, constructed and utilized so that appreciable flood damage will not occur. No basements in buildings will be allowed to be constructed below ground level and the lower floor of structures will be elevated a minimum of one foot above the flood profile level. All foundations shall be constructed to withstand or resist water or water pressure, and the top of foundations shall be six inches above the flood profile level. On parcels not being subdivided nor involving more than a one acre development site, the Town Engineer will assist applicants for building permits in locating the flood profile levels. Subdivisions will be allowed provided that all of the area to be subdivided is filled to the elevation of the selected flood profile level prior to platting, and all development conforms to Federal flood insurance regulations and programs.
2. Any structure permitted shall be flood-proofed to the satisfaction of the Town Engineer and consistent with Federal requirements, and located so that it will minimize obstruction to water flow.
3. Where the Town determines that topographic data, engineering studies, or other professional studies are needed to determine the effects of flooding on a proposed structure, or the effect of the structure on the floodway, the Town may require the applicant to submit requested studies prepared by qualified professionals.

Notes:
(1) Each of the noise limits specified in Table 3-1, above shall be reduced by 5 dB(A) for impulse or simple tone noises, or for noise consisting of speech or music. If the ambient noise level exceeds the resulting standard, the ambient noise level shall be the standard.
(2) It shall be unlawful for any person within a residentially zoned area of the Town to operate any noise amplified device (e.g., bull horns, microphones, musical instruments, speakers, etc.), that exceeds a noise level of 45 dB(A) measured at the property line or cause loud excessive noise which disturbs the peace of the neighborhood.
2. Exterior noise standards. Exterior noise levels, when measured at any receiving property, shall conform to the noise level standards identified in Table 3-1, above.
a. If the measured ambient noise level exceeds the applicable noise level standard in any category above, the applicable standards shall be adjusted to equal the ambient noise level.
b. If the intruding noise source is continuous and cannot reasonably be discontinued or stopped to allow measurement of the ambient noise level, the noise level measured while the source is in operation shall be compared directly to the applicable noise level standards identified in Table 3-1, above.
3. Conflicts with late night, early morning, or 24-hour operations. Nonresidential activities shall not impact surrounding residential land uses (e.g., single-, multi-family, and mobile home parks).
4. Construction hours allowed. In order to allow construction schedules to take advantage of the weather, normal day light hours, to allow construction to proceed in an efficient manner, and to ensure that nearby residents as well as nonresidential activities are not disturbed by the early morning or late night activities, the Town has adopted, in the Municipal Code of the Town of Windsor, Title VII Building and
3-6
Housing Section 7-1-190 which establishes construction working hours related to the days and hours in which construction activity can occur. In addition, the Municipal Code has established procedures for seeking relief from the restrictions.

H. Radioactivity, electrical disturbance or electromagnetic interference. None of the following shall be emitted:
1. Radioactivity, in a manner that does not comply with all applicable State and Federal regulations; or
2. Electrical disturbance or electromagnetic interference that interferes with normal radio or television reception or with the function of other electronic equipment beyond the property line of the site; or that does not comply with all applicable Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and other applicable State and Federal regulations.
27.20.040 - Creekside Development
A. Purpose. This Section provides for adequate buffer areas between creek corridors and adjacent development, to protect the creek corridors as valuable natural, scenic, and recreational amenities.
B. Applicability. The provisions of this Section apply to proposed development, other than public works or infrastructure, on any site adjacent to or crossed by a creek or stream.
C. Streambed analysis required. The project permit application shall include a site-specific streambed analysis prepared by a hydrologist, civil engineer, or other qualified professional to determine the precise boundary/top of bank of the waterway. The Director may waive this requirement if it is determined that the project, because of its size, location, or design will not have a significant impact on the waterway, or that sufficient information already exists and further analysis is not necessary. A required streambed analysis shall include all information and materials required by the Department.
D. Development standards.
1. A building setback line along the waterway shall be measured from the toe of the stream bank outward a distance of 2.5 times the height of the stream bank plus 30 feet, or 30 feet outward from the stream bank, whichever distance is greater. Additional setbacks may be required for "Riparian Woodlands" as designated in the General Plan, or to preserve existing vegetation or other environmental resources along any waterway. Setbacks adjacent to creekside paths or open spaces shall be measured from the outside boundary of the path or open space.
3-8
2. Paths or trails may be located within a creekside setback; however, no structure, road, parking access, parking spaces, paved areas, or swimming pool shall be constructed within a creek or creekside setback area.
3. No grading or filling, planting of exotic/non-native or non-riparian plant species, or removal of native vegetation shall occur within a creek or creekside setback area.
4. Where drainage improvements are required, they shall be placed in the least visible locations and naturalized through the use of river rock, earthtone concrete, and landscaping with native plant materials.
5. The proposed development should incorporate permeable surfaces (for example, wood decks, sand-joined bricks, and stone walkways) where feasible, to minimize off-site flows and facilitate the absorption of water into the ground.
6. Development or land use changes that increase impervious surfaces or sedimentation may result in channel erosion. This may require measures to stabilize creek banks.
a. Creek rehabilitation is the preferred method of stabilization, with the objective is to maintain the natural character of the creek and riparian area. Rehabilitation may include enlarging the channel at points of obstruction, clearing obstructions at points of constriction, limiting uses in areas of excessive erosion, and restoring riparian vegetation.
b. Concrete channels and other mechanical stabilization measures shall not be allowed unless no other alternative exists.
c. If bank stabilization requires other than rehabilitation or vegetative methods, hand-placed stone or rock riprap are the preferred methods.
7. Public access and visibility to creeks should be provided through the use of single-loaded frontage roads adjacent to creeks, but outside of the creek setback. Structures or lots that back-on to creeks or creek frontage roads are discouraged.
8. The provision of multipurpose creekside trails and public open space is strongly encouraged. Open space areas should include planting for riparian enhancement with native shrubs and trees, paths and trails, lighting, benches, play and exercise equipment, and trash receptacles outside of the riparian habitat area, where appropriate.
9. Where streets are not used, frequent access to creekside trails and public open space should be provided at least every 300 feet, and may occur at the end of cul-de-sacs.

B. Maximum height of structures. The height of structures shall not exceed the standard for the applicable zoning district established by this Chapter, except as otherwise provided by this Chapter.
C. Height measurement. The maximum allowable height shall be measured as the vertical distance from the existing grade of the site to an imaginary plane located the allowed number of feet above and parallel to the grade. See Figure 3-1.
FIGURE 3-1
HEIGHT MEASUREMENT
D. Exceptions to height limits. The review authority may approve exceptions to the height limits of this Zoning Ordinance as follows.
1. Non-residential districts. Minor projections, including elevator and mechanical equipment enclosures may exceed the height limit by 15 feet, provided they are screened by a parapet or pitched roof. Architectural features including clock towers, cupolas, and similar structures may exceed the height limit by:
a. Up to 20 feet, if located at a street intersection; and
b. Up to 12 feet, if located midblock.
These features shall not exceed a width of 25 feet or one-third of the length of the building facade, whichever is less. Signs shall not be included within the additional height allowed.
3-10
2. Residential districts. Chimneys, television antennas, and solar collectors not exceeding a dimension of six feet at their base may exceed the height limits of the applicable zoning district by a maximum of five feet.
E. Height limit at street corners. Development proposed adjacent to any public or private street or alley intersection in other than the CT zoning district shall be designed to provide a traffic safety visibility area for pedestrian and traffic safety. See Figure 3-2.
1. Measurement of visibility area. A traffic safety visibility area is a triangle measured as follows, and may include private property and/or public right-of-way.

27.20.060 - Historic Conservation and Preservation
A. Purpose. These standards are intended to protect sites and structures identified by the community as historically significant, that contribute to Windsor's character and identity, and that should be preserved and/or restored. For additional information refer to Section 27.16.050  Historical (HO) Overlay. (Revised 03/5/03, ORD. 2003-163)
B. Applicability. No person shall alter the exterior of, construct improvements to, or demolish any historic structure until the analysis required by the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA) is completed to determine the historic significance and the effects of the proposed alterations.
C. Historic landmark designation. The Council may designate an improvement, natural feature, or site as an historic landmark and any area within the Town as an historic district in compliance with this Section, based on the Council's evaluation of the age of the structure, distinguishing characteristics, geographically definable area, familiar visual feature, significant achievement, significant geographical patterns, and/or similar to other distinctive areas.
1. Procedure. The designation of an historic landmark or district, or the removal of an historic landmark or district from the Historic Register, shall comply with the procedure established by this Zoning Ordinance for amendments (Chapter 27.54), including public notice and a hearing in compliance with State law, a recommendation by the Commission, and a final decision by the Council.
2. Permit issuance during nomination process. No permit for any improvement or structure within a proposed historic district or relative to a nominated historic landmark shall be issued while the nomination process is pending.
3. Placement on the Historic Register. The nominated district, site, or structure shall be placed on the Historic Register after being officially accepted by the Council.
4. Removal from the Historic Register. The Commission shall not recommend removal from the Historic Register unless it discovers that the information relied that supported the original designation was erroneous, or that circumstances beyond the owner's control have rendered the resource ineligible for designation and it would be infeasible to restore the resource.
D. Criteria for approval. In considering an application for exterior alterations or new construction, the Director shall be guided by the Secretary of the Interior's Standards for Rehabilitation and the compatibility of the proposed architectural features, materials, and style with those of existing structures.
3-13
E. Findings for alteration or demolition. The Director may approve alterations or demolition only after first making all the following findings, unless economic hardship is determined in compliance with Subsection F.
1. The proposed change would not adversely affect any significant aesthetic, architectural, cultural, or historical features of the subject parcel or the historic district;
2. The proposed change is compatible in architectural style with the structure and with existing adjacent structures in an historic district;
3. The proposed decorative features, details, fenestration, massing, materials, proportions, scale, and textures are consistent with the period and/or compatible with adjacent structures; and
4. In the case of a demolition, the applicant has submitted satisfactory evidence that a financial commitment has been obtained by the applicant to ensure replacement of the existing feature, landmark, or structure and that a Building Permit has been issued for the replacement structure.
F. Economic hardship. Alterations or demolition not in compliance with the findings required by Subsection E. may be approved only in cases of economic hardship. Economic hardship is defined as a substantial cost to the owner of the property that is patently unreasonable in comparison to the benefit conferred to the community should the owner be limited to following the guidelines for preserving or protecting the property.
1. Supporting evidence. Material evidence supporting the request for a finding of economic hardship shall consist of any information required by the Director.
2. Findings. In order to approve the alteration or demolition on the basis of economic hardship, the Director shall first find all of the following:
a. Disapproval would substantially diminish the value of the property;
b. The sale or rental of the property is impractical when compared to the cost of holding the property for uses allowed in the subject zoning district;
c. An adaptive reuse study has been conducted and found that utilization of the property for lawful purposes is prohibited or impractical;
d. Disapproval would unreasonably damage the owner of the property in comparison to the benefit conferred on the community;
e. All means involving Town sponsored incentives (e.g., amendments to this Zoning Ordinance, Building Code modifications, financial assistance, and grants) have been explored to relieve possible economic hardship;
3-14
f. Without approval of the proposed construction, demolition, exterior alteration, remodeling, or removal, the reasonable use of or return from a designated landmark or property within an historic district will be denied a property owner; and
g. In the case of a proposed demolition, the Director shall make an additional finding that the designated landmark cannot be remodeled or rehabilitated in a manner that would allow a reasonable use of or return from the property to the owners.
3. Demolition of a nominated or designated historic landmark.
a. If approval with a finding of economic hardship would result in the demolition of a nominated or designated historic landmark, the applicant shall be required to provide documentation of the resource proposed for demolition to the standards of the Historic American Buildings Survey.
b. Documentation may include an archaeological survey, floor plans, measured drawings, photographs, or other documentation required by the Director and shall be submitted before issuance of a Demolition Permit.

27.20.070 - Setback Measurement and Exceptions
A. Purpose. This Section provides standards for the use and minimum size of setbacks. These standards provide open areas around structures for: visibility and traffic safety; access to and around structures; access to natural light, ventilation and direct sunlight; separation of incompatible land uses; and space for privacy, landscaping and recreation.
B. Setback requirements.
1. General requirement. All structures shall comply with the setback requirements of each zoning district and with any setbacks established for specific uses by this Article, except as otherwise provided by this Section. No portion of any structure, including eaves or roof overhangs, shall extend beyond a property line; or into an access easement or street right-of-way, without first securing an Encroachment Permit.
2. Infill development within previously approved projects. Where setbacks have been established for individual vacant parcels by a Specific Plan, a PC zoning district applied prior to the adoption of this Zoning Ordinance, a PD zoning district, an approved subdivision map, or other entitlement, those setbacks shall apply to continuing development within the approved project instead of the setbacks required by this Zoning Ordinance.
C. Measurement of setbacks. Setbacks shall be measured as follows, except that the Director may require different setback measurement methods where he or she determines that unusual parcel configuration makes the following infeasible or ineffective. See Figure 3-3. For streets with detached parkways, the property line is assumed to be the back of the sidewalk for the purposes of setback measurement.
1. Front yard setbacks. The front yard setback shall be measured at right angles from the nearest point on the front property line of the parcel (or edge of access easement on a private street) to the nearest point of the wall of the structure, except as provided in following Subsections C.1.a and C.1.b. The front property line is the narrowest dimension of a lot adjacent to a street.
a. Flag lots. For a parcel with a fee ownership strip extending from a street or right-of-way to the building area of the parcel, area of the required front setback shall be determined by the Director.
b. Corner lots. The measurement shall be taken from the nearest point of the structure to the nearest point of the most narrow street frontage property line. If the property lines on both street frontages are of the same length, the property line to be used for setback measurement shall be determined by the Director.
2. Side yard setbacks. The side yard setback shall be measured at right angles from the nearest point on the side property line of the parcel to the nearest line of the structure;
3-16
establishing a setback line parallel to the side property line, which extends between the front and rear yards.
3. Street side yard setbacks. The side yard on the street side of a corner parcel shall be measured from the nearest point of the side property line bounding the street, or the easement for a private road.
4. Rear yard setbacks. The rear yard shall be measured at right angles from the nearest point on the rear property line to the nearest line of the structure, establishing a setback line parallel to the rear property line. The Director shall determine the location of the required rear yard setback on a double-frontage parcel.
FIGURE 3-3
LOCATION AND MEASUREMENT OF SETBACKS
D. Exemptions from setback requirements. The minimum setback requirements of this Zoning Ordinance apply to all development and new land uses, except the following:
1. Fences or walls six feet or less in height above the grade of the site, when located outside of the front setback;
2. Decks, earthworks, free-standing solar devices, steps, terraces, and other site design elements that are placed directly upon grade and do not exceed a height of 18 inches above the surrounding grade at any point; and
3. Retaining walls less than 30 inches in height above finish grade. Embankments to be retained that are over 48 inches in height shall be benched so that no individual retaining wall exceeds a height of 36 inches.
3-17
E. Limitations on uses of setbacks.
1. Structures. Required setback areas shall not be occupied by structures other than:
a. The fences, walls, and hedges permitted by Chapter 27.26 (Fences, Walls, and Hedges); and
b. The projections into setbacks allowed by Subsection F.
2. Storage. No front or street side setback shall be used for the storage of scrap or junk.
3. Parking. Required residential parking spaces shall not be located within required setback areas. Temporary (overnight) parking is allowable within required setback areas only on paved driveways, in compliance with Section 27.30.080 (Parking Design and Development Standards).
F. Allowed projections into setbacks. Attached architectural features and certain detached structures may project beyond the wall of the structure and into the front, side and rear yard setbacks, in compliance with the following requirements.
1. Architectural features. Architectural features attached to the primary structure may extend beyond the wall of the structure and into the front, side and rear yard setbacks, in compliance with Table 3-3. See also Figure 3-4.
2. Equipment. Air conditioning, heating, and similar equipment may extend up to 30 inches into side and rear yards, but to no closer than 36 inches to any property line. Swimming pool, hot tub, and spa equipment are instead subject to Subsection G., below.

27.22.090 - In-Lieu Participation Fees
The Towns intent is to provide a mix of housing units and types. The Towns General Plan Housing Element addresses a diverse housing stock and the Inclusionary Housing Ordinance further supports this intent. When circumstances in development support findings that the inclusion of affordable units is not suitable, but that greater density would better serve the project, the Town may consider payment of an in-lieu fee in place of actual construction of the units.
3-36
A. In-lieu fees may be appropriate for particular developments not suitable for affordable units due to factors including location, development density, accessibility to public transportation, environmental conditions, or in cases where the affordable requirement includes a decimal fraction of a unit and a combination of both affordable units and in-lieu fees is required to fulfill the affordable requirement. These in-lieu fees shall be used by the Town or its designee for the purpose of developing affordable housing for low and very low income households elsewhere in the Town.
B. The in-lieu participation fees for all residential development must be paid prior to the issuance of the first Building Permit for the project. The amount of in-lieu fees shall be established by resolution of the Council. The in-lieu fee shall be adjusted periodically to reflect changes in the Consumer Price Index (CPI), and may also be adjusted as necessary for changing conditions in the Town.
27.22.100 - Land Dedication
An Applicant may dedicate land to the Town or a non-profit entity or agency approved by the Town in place of actual construction of affordable units upon the approval of the Council. The intent of allowing a land dedication option is to provide the land needed to make affordable housing development feasible, thus furthering the intent of this Chapter. Reference Section 27.22.030 B for additional density bonus information in relation to donation of land.

CHAPTER 27.23- INCLUSIONARY HOUSING REQUIREMENTS
27.23.010- Purpose and Intent
The Town of Windsor recognizes the importance of achieving a diverse and balanced community with housing available for households of all income levels. Economic and social diversity cultivates a healthy social fabric that is beneficial to all residents of Windsor. The Town is experiencing an increasing shortage of housing affordable to very low, low and moderate- income households. New residential development does not provide housing opportunities for this segment of society. As a result, very low, low and moderate -income households are excluded from new housing, creating economic stratification in the Town that is detrimental to the public health, safety, and welfare.
The purpose of this chapter is to establish an inclusionary requirement on residential development projects. This Chapter will mitigate the impacts caused by these development projects for the additional demand for more affordable housing and rising land prices for limited supply of available residential land. The inclusionary requirements required by this chapter do not replace other regulatory requirements and processing fees or exactions, funding required pursuant to a development agreement or reimbursement agreement; assessment charged pursuant to special assessments or benefit assessments districts proceedings, etc., unless so specified.
27.23.020- Applicability
A. Threshold. The provisions of this Chapter shall apply to all new Residential Developments of ten (10) or more parcels or dwelling units intended and designed for permanent occupancy, including but not limited to single-family dwellings, multi-family residential projects which receive subdivision, Use Permit, or Design Review approval after the effective date of this Chapter.
B. Exemptions. The following shall not be subject to the provisions of this Chapter:
1. Residential dwelling for which a building permit has been issued by the Town prior to the effective date of this Chapter.
2. Residential and mixed-use development projects that the Town Council has determined have a vested right to proceed without complying with the provisions herein.
3. Existing residences, which are altered, improved, restored, expanded, or extended, provided that the number of units is not increased to five or more.
4. Accessory dwelling units constructed pursuant to Section 27.34.180 of the Zoning Ordinance. (Rev. 04/09/18, ORD. 2017-319)
5. Junior accessory dwelling units established pursuant to Section 27.34.185. (Rev. 04/09/18, ORD. 2017-319)
3-38
5. Dwelling units, which are offered and restricted for sale, lease or rent solely to individuals or households of very-low, low, or moderate-incomes as defined by this Chapter, and for the minimum terms set forth by this Chapter.
6. Replacement of any dwelling unit or residential development which is damaged or destroyed by fire or other catastrophe provided the number of units and the use of the building remain the same.
27.23.030- Inclusionary Requirements
A. Percentage requirement. In projects of ten (10)or more dwelling units, a ten (10%) inclusionary requirement applies if the inclusionary units are constructed for moderate-income households, seven and half (7.5%) requirement if the inclusionary units are constructed for low-income households, and a five percent (5%) requirement if the inclusionary units are constructed for very low income households. If, in the application of the requirements of this Chapter, a decimal fraction unit requirement is obtained, an in-lieu fee shall be provided equal to the applicable decimal fraction cost of a full housing unit. Council Resolution shall establish said fee.
B. Payment of an in-lieu fee for all units. The Town shall establish an in-lieu fee schedule, as defined in Section 27.23.130. Any fee required by this chapter shall be paid in full prior to the issuance of a Building Permit for the project. In multi-phase projects, the entire in-lieu fees required for the project, inclusive of all phases, shall be paid prior to issuance of any building permits for the first phase.
C. Land Donation. Dedicate with cost to the Town, a lot or lots within, contiguous to or elsewhere in Town sufficient to accommodate at least the required number of affordable units for the residential project. An election to dedicate land in lieu of compliance with other provisions of this chapter shall be allowed only if:
1. The appraised value, of the lot or lots to be dedicated, net of demolition and environmental remediation costs, is equal to at least 150 percent of the projects in lieu fee obligation and financing or a viable financing plan is in place for at least the required number of affordable units and;
2. The lot or lots are suitable for the construction of affordable housing at a feasible cost, defined by the Town Manager, are zoned appropriately for affordable housing development, served by utilities, streets and other infrastructure and there are no hazardous materials or other material constraints on the development of affordable housing.
D. Off site construction. Construct, or make possible construction by another developer, of units not physically contiguous to the market-rate units or units that are physically contiguous to the market-rate units if the Town determines that this will provide greater public benefit and if the inclusionary housing regulatory agreement is acceptable to the Town Manager or the Managers designee.
3-39
E. Construction of Inclusionary units. The inclusionary units shall be provided at the same time as the other units. Both the inclusionary and market rate housing units shall be completed at the same time.
F. Distribution of Inclusionary units. Inclusionary units are encouraged to be distributed throughout the development. Distribution of units may take into account the number of required inclusionary units in the project, as well as consideration of environmental and aesthetic factors.
G. Appearance of Inclusionary units. The inclusionary units are encouraged to be substantially the same as the market rate units or buildings in exterior materials and finish. The developer may provide less expensive interior amenities for the inclusionary unit as long as there are not significant differences visible from the exterior. All units must conform to the requirements of the Building and Housing Codes, and subject to the approval of the Town Manager, or his/her designee.
H. Bedroom Count of Inclusionary Units. Inclusionary units shall be comparable in bedroom count distribution to the market rate units.
27.23.040- Pricing Requirements for Inclusionary Units.

Very low income:
30% of 50% AMI, adjusted for household size
Low income:
30% of 60% of AMI, adjusted for household size
Moderate Income:
30% of 110% of AMI, adjusted for household size
For owners, affordable housing expense shall include principal, interest, PMI, property taxes, insurance, homeowners association dues, property maintenance, repair and a Utility Allowance and shall not exceed:

1. Amount of fee. For purposes of this section, the fractional remainder and in-lieu inclusionary fee shall be as defined in Section 27.23.130 of this Chapter.
2. Payment of fee. Any fee required by this chapter shall be paid in full prior to the issuance of a Building Permit for the project. In multi-phase projects, the entire in-lieu fees required for the project shall be paid prior to issuance of any building permits.
3. Use of funds. Any funds received from in-lieu fee payments shall be placed in a reserve account used for the exclusive purpose of providing housing affordable to very-low, low and moderate-income households in the Town of Windsor.
27.23.070 - Deed Restrictions
When inclusionary units are required, a deed restriction shall be recorded setting forth the applicable restrictions in this Chapter. The minimum period of affordability for inclusionary units shall be set forth below:
A. Affordability Period. Except as may be otherwise provided in Section 27.22.040, inclusionary units which are built without a public subsidy, or density bonus or other concession granted pursuant to Government Code Section 65915, shall be required to maintain affordability in perpetuity for rental units and for the longest feasible time, but not less than forty-five (45) years, for owner units, or for a different period when required
3-41
by the Town of Windsor or State law. At the resale of an affordable owner unit, the affordability period of not less than forty-five (45) years shall be renewed. A program to assure affordability for these units for this period of time shall be administered by the Town or by a non-profit housing agency approved by the Town. The developer shall enter into an agreement with the Town or its designee to provide monitoring and to assure affordability of the inclusionary units in perpetuity for rental units and for the longest feasible time, but not less than forty-five (45) years, for owner units from the effective date of first occupancy or resale of an affordable owner unit. The Town Manager shall be authorized to enter into such agreement on behalf of the Town. The approved agreement shall be recorded with the Sonoma County Recorder prior to issuance of a building permit for the project.
1. All buyers of for sale inclusionary units shall enter into a Resale Agreement with the Town or its designee prior to the close of escrow for such inclusionary unit. The Resale Agreement shall specify the required affordability term, shall provide for an option for the Town or its designee to designate an eligible purchaser and shall provide the Town or its designee with first right of refusal to purchase the unit, and shall provide for a calculation of future equity assignment upon sale of the unit. Such agreement shall be recorded against each lot or unit.
2. Conversion of an inclusionary rental unit to a for sale unit, if otherwise permitted, shall not void any provisions of applicable inclusionary housing agreements or requirements.
27.23.080 - Monitoring of Inclusionary Units
Each owner of any rental inclusionary units shall submit an annual report to the Planning Department, no later than March 1, for the previous calendar year, identifying monthly rental rates, vacancy status of each inclusionary unit, income status for resident and any other related data deemed necessary by the Town while ensuring privacy for all occupants. The deed restriction for ownership units shall require a comparable conformance report to the Town upon sale of ownership of inclusionary units.
27.23.090- Developer Incentives
When a developer proposes a housing project that is subject to the inclusionary requirements of this Chapter, the Town shall provide the developer a density bonus compliant with State density bonus law, as defined in California Government Code section 65915 et seq, as revised periodically. Subject to the approval of the Town Manager or the Town Managers designee, the Town may also provide other incentives, including, but not limited to: reduction in site development standards, modification of architectural design requirements, or other similar incentives that assist in making the project economically feasible. Subject to the approval of the Town Manager or the Town Managers designee, other incentives may be offered for the production of very low, or low income housing units, include fee deferrals, fast track permitting, shared equity programs and exceptions from zoning ordinance requirements i.e. parking, setbacks and others.
3-42

It shall be the responsibility of the developer to negotiate any needed agreement with the monitoring agency to comply with Section 27.40.070 Deed Restrictions.
27.23.110- Modification of Requirements, Hardship, Exception.
Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, the requirements of this chapter shall be waived, adjusted or reduced if the applicant shows, by the presentation of substantial evidence, that there is no reasonable relationship between the impact of a proposed residential project and the requirements of this chapter, or that applying the requirements of this chapter would take property in violation of the U.S. or California Constitution. To receive a waiver, adjustment or reduction under this subsection (c), the applicant must make a showing under this subsection when applying for a first approval for the residential project, and/or as part of any appeal which the City provides as part of the process for the first approval.
27.23.120- Appeals and Enforcement
A. Application of requirements. The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all agents, successors and assignees of the developer. No planning permit shall be issued after the effective date of this Chapter for any project which does not meet the requirements of this Chapter.
B. Violations. Any person, firm or corporation, whether as principal, agent, employee or otherwise, violating or causing the violation of any provision of this chapter, shall be guilty of a separate offense during each and every day during any portion of which any violation of this chapter is commenced, continued, or permitted by such person, firm or cooperation.
C. Appeal to Planning Commission.

3-43
Commission may appeal to the Town Council upon payment of the applicable fee. The appeal shall set forth specifically wherein in action of the Town or its designee fails to conform to the provisions of this chapter thereby adversely affecting the developers or other persons interests. The Town Council may reverse or modify any determination or requirement of the Town or its designee if it finds that the action under appeal does not conform to the provisions of this Chapter.
27.23.130  In Lieu Fee Schedule
A. Per square foot in lieu fee amount. The in lieu fee shall be calculated on a per square foot basis, based on the square footage of the market rate units, as follows:
1. A minimum per unit in lieu fee of $2,000 shall apply for units up to 1,000 square feet;
2. For units of 1,000 square feet, the fee shall be $2.00 per square foot;
3. For larger units, the per square foot fee shall increase by $0.015 per 50 square feet, or fraction thereof.
B. Adjustments to the in lieu fee. The in lieu fee shall be adjusted annually by an inflation factor equal to the percent increase in the median home sales price in the Town over the previous three (3) years.

CHAPTER 27.24 - AGRICULTURAL PRESERVATION
27.24.010 - Purpose of Chapter
It is in the public interest to preserve and protect agricultural lands and operations within the vicinity of the Town exclusively for agricultural and appurtenant uses. Non-agricultural land uses adjacent to agricultural lands and operations often lead to restrictions on the agricultural operations to the detriment of the economic viability of agriculture.
The purposes of this Chapter are to preserve and protect agricultural uses, support continued agricultural operations, alert prospective residents to the importance of agricultural land preservation, and provide suitable methods of land use separation and buffering provisions, in compliance with Section 27.24.020 (Buffering), below.
27.24.020 - Buffering
A. Buffering required. At the time of the subdivision or development of any parcel that adjoins lands zoned for and/or currently in agricultural use, an appropriate buffer shall be established on the parcel where the subdivision or development is proposed, between the urban development and existing agricultural operations.
B. Width of buffer. The minimum width of a buffer shall be 100 feet from the property line for row and field crops and 200 feet from the property line for vineyards and orchards. The Council may adjust the width of the buffer where deemed appropriate because of any of the following factors, provided that the buffer shall not be reduced to less than 100 feet:
1. Type of agricultural activity (e.g., animal husbandry, field crops, orchards, vineyards, etc.);
2. Agricultural practices;
3. Existing physical features (e.g., stand of trees, topography, water courses, etc.);
4. Man-made features (e.g., fences/walls, parking lots, streets, trails, etc.); and
5. Configuration, location, and size of the properties involved.
C. Setback from habitable structures. For development on individual parcels where a planning-related entitlement (e.g., Design Review, Tentative Map, Use Permit, etc.) is not required, a minimum buffer setback to all habitable structures of 100 feet shall be maintained.
3-46
27.24.030 - Disclosure
A. Disclosure by subdivider. The subdivider of any property located within 1,000 feet of land zoned and/or currently used for agricultural use shall disclose, through a notation on the final map of the subdivision, within Conditions, Covenants and Restrictions (CC&Rs), if prepared, and through the recordation of a separate acknowledgment statement, the presence of agricultural and appurtenant uses in the proximity of the subdivision through the following statement:
"The property(ies) within this subdivision is(are) located within 1,000 feet of land utilized or zoned for agricultural operations and residents/occupants of the property may be subject to inconvenience or discomfort arising from use of agricultural chemicals, including acaricides, fertilizers, fungicides, herbicides, insecticides, predacides, and rodenticides; and from the pursuit of agricultural operations, including crop protection, cultivation, harvesting, plowing, processing, pruning, shipping, and spraying, which may generate dust, light, noise, odor, smoke, and traffic. The Town has adopted policies to encourage and preserve agricultural lands and operations in the vicinity of the Town. Residents/occupants of property(ies) within this subdivision should be prepared to accept inconveniences or discomfort as normal and necessary to on-going agricultural operations."
B. Disclosure before issuance of Building Permits. Where a new structure intended for human occupancy is to be located on property which is located within 1,000 feet of land zoned and/or currently used for agricultural use, the owner(s) of the property shall, before issuance of a Building Permit, be required to sign and record a statement in a form complying with Subsection A. (Disclosure by subdivider), above. In lieu of signing the statement required above, the owner(s) may submit evidence that the statement in Subsection A., above, has been made a part of subdivision documents creating the parcel on which the structure is to be located.
3-47
CHAPTER 27.25  REASONABLE ACCOMMODATION
27.25.010  Purpose of Chapter
The purpose of this chapter is to provide a procedure for individuals with disabilities to request reasonable accommodation in seeking equal access to housing under the federal Fair Housing Act and the California Fair Employment and Housing Act (Acts) in the application of zoning laws and land use regulations, policies, and procedures.
27.25.020 - Applicability
A. A request for reasonable accommodation may be made by any person with a disability or their representative, when the application of a requirement of the Zoning Ordinance or Town requirement, policy, or practice acts as a barrier to fair housing opportunities. For the purpose of this chapter a person with disability is any person who has a physical or mental impairment that limits or substantially limits one or more major life activity, anyone who is regarded as having such impairment or anyone who has a record of such impairment. This chapter is intended to apply to those persons who are defined as disabled under the Acts.
B. A request for reasonable accommodation may include a modification or exception to the rules, regulations, and/or practices for the siting, development, use of housing or housing-related facilities that would eliminate regulatory barriers and provide a person with a disability equal opportunity to housing of their choice.
C. A reasonable accommodation is granted only to the household that needs the accommodation and does not apply to successors in interest to the site.
D. A reasonable accommodation may be granted in compliance with this chapter without the need for approval of a variance.
27.25.030  Procedure
A. A request for reasonable accommodation shall be submitted in writing to the Community Development Director and shall contain the following information:
1. The applicants name, address, and telephone number.
2. Address of the property for which the request is being made.
3. The current use of the property.
4. The basis for the claim that the individual is considered disabled under the Acts, including verification of such claim.
3-48
5. The zoning code provision, regulations, or policy from which reasonable accommodation is being requested.
6. The reason why the reasonable accommodation is necessary to make the specific property accessible to the individual.
B. If the project for which the request for reasonable accommodation is being made requires some other discretionary approval (i.e. Use Permit, Design Review, etc.), the applicant shall file the information required by A. of this section for concurrent review with the application for discretionary approval.
C. A request for reasonable accommodation shall be reviewed by the Community Development Director or his/her designee. If no approval is sought other than the request for reasonable accommodation, the Director or his/her designee, shall make a written determination within 45 days of the application/written request being deemed complete and either grant, grant with modifications, or deny a request for reasonable accommodation.
D. A request for reasonable accommodation submitted for concurrent review with another discretionary land use application shall be reviewed by the Planning Commission or designated hearing body. The written determination on whether to grant or deny the request for reasonable accommodation shall be made by the Planning Commission/designated hearing body, in compliance with the applicable review procedure for the discretionary review.
27.25.040 Approval Findings
The written decision to grant or deny a request for reasonable accommodation will be consistent with the Acts and shall be based on consideration of the following:
A. Will the housing in the request be used by a person with a disability under the Acts?
B. Is the request for reasonable accommodation necessary to make specific housing available to a person with a disability under the Acts?
C. Will the request for reasonable accommodation impose undue financial, administrative, or enforcement burdens on the Town?
D. Will the request for reasonable accommodation require a fundamental alteration in the nature of a Town program or law, including but not limited to land use and zoning?
E. What, if any, are the potential impacts on surrounding uses?
F. What are the physical attributes of the property and structures?

27.30.050 - Reduction of Parking Requirements
A. Reduction of parking through Minor Use Permit. The number of parking spaces required by this Chapter may be reduced with Minor Use Permit approval.
B. Reduction for shared use. Where two or more nonresidential uses are developed as a shopping or professional center and two or more uses have distinct and differing peak parking usage periods, (e.g. a theater and a bank), a reduction in the required number of parking spaces may be approved by the Director, provided that the most remote space is located within 300 feet of the use it is intended to serve (as measured along the most direct pedestrian path). The amount of reduction may be up to the amount of spaces required for the least intensive of the two or more uses sharing the parking. A shared parking analysis may be required by the Director to support a request for a parking reduction.
C. Alternative shared-use parking reduction in TC, BC and RC zoning districts. The following shared-use parking standards are based on the assumption that patrons will use a single parking space for more than one destination and that a single parking space will be available for short-term parking to serve a variety of different uses that may have different peak hours.
3-67
1. Eligible projects. The following categories of development shall be eligible to use the alternative shared-use parking standards within the TC, BC and RC zoning districts:
a. Nonresidential new construction on sites of less than 20,000 square feet in size.
b. New construction on sites greater than 20,000 square feet in size for retail commercial, restaurants (excluding fast food and drive-throughs), and theaters.

2. Ineligible projects. The following types of uses are not eligible to use alternative shared-use parking standards:
a. Residential uses that are not part of a mixed use project.
b. New construction of hotel or office uses on sites greater than 20,000 square feet in size.
3. Shared-use parking standards. Once it has been established that parking is required, eligible projects within the TC, BC and RC zoning districts may choose to provide shared parking by using the Alternative Shared-Use Parking Standards in Table 3-8 below. Projects developed under the shared-use parking standards shall enter into an agreement with the Town and recorded with the Office of the County Recorder. The agreement shall require that the parking be operated on a nonexclusive basis, open and available to the general public for shared use at all times.

27.32.070 - Comprehensive Sign Program
A. Purpose. The purpose of a Comprehensive Sign Program is to integrate a project's signs with the design of the structures to achieve a unified architectural statement. A Comprehensive Sign Program provides a means for the flexible application of sign regulations for multi-tenant projects and other users of multiple signs in order to encourage creativity and provide incentive and latitude in the provision of multiple signs and to achieve, not circumvent, the intent of this Chapter.
B. Comprehensive Sign Program required. The Commission may approve a Comprehensive Sign Program which may modify the development standards for signs for an eligible project. Standards for signs provided in this Chapter shall serve as a reference for evaluating Comprehensive Sign Program applications.
A Comprehensive Sign Program shall be required whenever any of the following circumstances exist.
1. New multi-tenant developments of three or more separate tenants that share either the same parcel or structure and use common access and parking facilities.
2. Whenever five or more signs are proposed for a new or existing development.
3. Whenever three or more signs are requested by a single tenant in an existing multi-tenant project that currently is not covered by a Comprehensive Sign Program.
3-87
4. Whenever signs are proposed on parcels adjoining U.S. Highway 101 and the signs will be located on elevations of structures facing the highway so that the signs will be visible from the highway. Signs shall comply with the standards for highway-oriented signs located in Subsection 27.32.100.D (Highway oriented signs) unless modifications to the standards are approved by the Commission through a Comprehensive Sign Program.
5. Whenever the Director determines that a Comprehensive Sign Program should be developed for a project due to special circumstances (e.g., the number or size of signs proposed, constrained visibility of the site, location of site relative to major transportation routes, etc.).
C. Contents of Comprehensive Sign Program request. A request for approval of a Comprehensive Sign Program shall clearly detail the type, number, size, and location of each proposed sign. Elevations of each sign shall be provided indicating the proposed text, letter size, colors, materials, use of logos, method of illumination, and method of attachment to the structure.
D. Lessees to be informed of Comprehensive Sign Program. Lessees within developments subject to the requirements of an approved Comprehensive Sign Program shall be made aware of the program in their lease and their responsibility to follow the approved Comprehensive Sign Program.
E. Revisions to Comprehensive Sign Programs. Revisions to a Comprehensive Sign Program may be approved by the Director if the Director determines that the revision is minor and that the intent of the original approval and any conditions are not affected. Revisions that would substantially deviate from the original approval shall require Commission approval.
27.32.080 - Temporary Off-Site Signs (Revised 09/02/2009, ORD. 2009-256)

The permittee may, upon request, be required to provide the Town with a copy of written permission from the owner. In the event a permittee is unable to provide written permission to post signs, the signs shall be immediately removed or the Town may impose a penalty on the permittee sufficient to cover the costs of removal.
6. The maintenance and removal of the signs are the responsibility of the permittee. All signs shall be removed entirely within the allotted time on the permit. In the event that all signs are not properly removed within the allotted time, the Town may impose a penalty on the permittee sufficient to cover the costs of removal.
7. No portion of a sign shall be located within five feet of road, street, or common driveway and no sign may obstruct vision on the public rights-of-way or at any other location where, by reason of the signs position, shape or color it interferes or may be confused with any authorized traffic sign, signal or device. Signs erected on public property and/or in the public right-of-way, may be abated by the Town without notice.
8. Signs shall not be erected above the height limitations of Section 9, on/or attached to a pole, or suspended without support from the ground (i.e. from a crane, or similar device). With the exception of magnetic signs attached to the doors, no signs shall be mounted on a vehicle or similar object.
9. The height of a sign shall be measured from the existing grade to the top of the sign and shall not exceed 4 in height in a residential zone nor 6 in height in a non-residential zone.
10. If the Town Manager determines that any sign has been posted in violation of these conditions, but not in such a manner that poses an immediate safety hazard, the Town Manager will notify the permittee by phone and in writing of the violation. The permittee will then have two working days to correct the violation. Any major violation, as determined by the Town Manager, to the provisions herein shall result in the immediate and summary abatement by the Town. The permittee shall be liable to the Town for any and all removal and abatement costs.
11. The permit shall be subject to revocation upon failure to comply with the above conditions.
B. Community event signs. Community event signs shall be allowed on public and/or private property as approved by the Town Manager, and may be subject to administrative design review. Signs may be posted two weeks prior to the activity and shall be removed within two days after the event.

CHAPTER 27.34 - STANDARDS FOR SPECIFIC LAND USES
27.34.010 - Purpose of Chapter
This Chapter provides site planning and development standards for land uses that are allowed by Article 2 (Zoning Districts and Allowable Land Uses) in individual or multiple zoning districts, and for activities that require special standards to ensure their compatibility with adjacent land uses and avoid problems for the community.
27.34.020 - Applicability
The provisions of each of the following Sections apply to the use identified in the Section title, as allowed in the applicable zoning district by Article 2 (Zoning Districts and Allowable Land Uses).
27.34.030 - Adult Business Establishments
A. Purpose. The intent of this Section is to prevent community-wide economic impacts, increased crime, decreased property values, and the deterioration of neighborhoods, which can be brought about by the concentration of adult business establishments in close proximity to incompatible uses such as schools for minors, churches, and residentially zoned districts or uses. The Council finds that it has been demonstrated in various communities that adult business establishments can cause an increase in the number of transients in the area, and an increase in crime and in addition to the effects described above can cause other businesses and residents to move elsewhere. It is, therefore, the purpose of this Section to establish reasonable and uniform regulations to prevent the close proximity of adult business establishments to incompatible uses, while permitting the location of adult business establishments in certain areas.
B. Applicability. Adult business establishments are allowed in compliance with Article 2 (Zoning Districts, Allowable Land Uses, and Zone-Specific Standards) and the following Standards.
C. Separation requirements. An adult business establishment shall not be established within 300 feet of another similar establishment or within 500 feet of any of the following:
1. Property classified in any residential zoning district;
2. Residential use;
3. Church, chapel, or similar place of worship;
4. Retirement or convalescent home or hospital;
5. School or day care establishment, or public or private park or playground;
3-100
6. Recreational facility, (e.g., game arcade, bowling alley, skateboard rink, skating rink), or similar area where minors regularly congregate; Town Hall, Town offices, libraries or other governmental facilities.
D. Measurement of distances. Distances shall be measured in a straight line, without regard for intervening structures, from the nearest property line for which the adult business is proposed to be located to the nearest property line of a use or district listed above.
E. Development standards.
1. Screening. New or existing structures intended to accommodate adult business establishments shall be designed so that windows and entries are oriented to prevent the interior of the premises from being visible to the public; however, screening or barriers to windows and entries are not allowed, so as to facilitate crime prevention by law enforcement agencies.
2. Signs, advertisements, and displays. Signs, advertisements, displays or other promotional materials depicting or describing "specified anatomical areas" or "specified sexual activities" or displaying instruments, devices, or paraphernalia that are designed for use in connection with "specified sexual activities" shall not be shown or exhibited so as to be visible from areas open to the general public.
3. Facilities for live entertainment. The following standards shall apply to adult business establishments that provide live entertainment depicting "specified anatomical areas" or involving "specified sexual activities":
a. There shall be no live entertainment performances, for patrons of an adult business establishment, except upon a stage at least 18 inches above the level of the floor which is separated by a distance of at least six feet from the nearest area occupied by patrons. Patrons shall not be allowed within six feet of the stage while the stage is occupied by an entertainer/performer;
b. The adult business establishment shall provide separate dressing room facilities and entrances/exits to the premises which are exclusively dedicated to the entertainers' use; and
c. The adult business establishment shall provide permanent access for entertainers between the stage and the dressing room facilities which is completely separated from the patrons and prevents any physical contact between the entertainers and patrons.
3-101
4. Arcade viewing area.
a. It is unlawful to maintain, operate, or manage or permit to be maintained, operated, or managed any adult arcade in which the viewing areas are not visible from a continuous main aisle or are obscured by a curtain, door, wall, or other enclosure. For purposes of this Subsection, "viewing area" means the area where a patron or customer would ordinarily be positioned while viewing a film, performance, picture, or show.
b. It is unlawful for more than one person at a time to occupy any individually partitioned viewing area or booth.
c. It is unlawful to create, maintain, or permit to be maintained any holes or other openings between any two booths or individual viewing areas for the purpose of providing viewing or physical access between the booth or individual viewing area.
F. Operational requirements.
1. Employees required. It shall be the duty of the owners to ensure that at least one employee in addition to any performers is on duty at all times when any patron is present inside the premises.
2. Hours of operation. The adult business establishment shall not operate or be open between the hours of 2:00 a.m. and 7:00 a.m.
3. Security program. A security program shall be prepared and submitted for the approval of the Chief of Police. The security program shall be subject to change based on problem activity as identified by the Police Chief.
G. Judicial review. The judicial review of any permit issued or denied in compliance with this Section shall be subject to expedited judicial review in accordance with the time limits set forth in Code of Civil Procedure Sections 1094.8 et seq.
3-102

CHAPTER 27.36 - TREE PRESERVATION AND PROTECTION
27.36.010 - Purpose of Chapter
The Town of Windsor is endowed with a wide variety of both native and non-native trees, giving the Town a unique visual character. Trees are a source of great beauty, provide shade and other environmental benefits, enhance property values, create community identity, and generally enhance the quality of urban life. The Town is committed to planting new trees, as well as protecting all existing trees to the greatest extent practicable.
This Chapter provides regulations for the protection, preservation, and maintenance of native Oak trees and trees of significance, groves and stands of mature trees, and mature trees in general. It is also the intent of this Chapter to perpetuate these trees through the replacement of trees removed as a result of a new development.
27.36.020 - Applicability
The provisions of this Chapter shall apply in all zoning districts to the removal or relocation of protected trees as identified in Section 27.36.040 (Protected Trees). Exceptions to the provisions of this Chapter are outlined in 27.36.030 (Exceptions). Town sponsored/funded projects are subject to tree protection and preservation requirements but are exempt from security deposit requirements.
27.36.030 - Exceptions
The removal or relocation of protected trees is exempt from the provisions of this Chapter under the following circumstances.
A. Existing trees on residential property. Existing trees on single-family residential property less than one acre in size but not including protected trees, or trees that were required to be preserved, relocated, or planted as a condition of approval of a Tree Removal Permit or other discretionary permit.
B. Emergency situation. Cases of emergency where the Director, a member of a law enforcement agency, or the Windsor Fire Department, determines that a protected tree poses an imminent threat to the public safety, or general welfare. In the case of an emergency situation on private property where persons or property are threatened the tree may be removed under the following conditions:
EMERGENCY REMOVAL CONDITIONS
1. Abatement
When a tree has partially failed and persons or property are threatened the tree may be removed without Town review or approval. The Town does not require an arborist report before the removal in this instance.
3-132
2. Authorization
Such cases must be substantiated after the fact by the property owner and tree professional with photographs, abatement information, insurance claim or other relevant information as well as completion of a Protected Tree Removal Application. The information is to be submitted to the Town Planning Department within five days of emergency removal. All other authorizations are subject to the standard procedure for tree removal.
C. Traffic visibility obstructions. Removal or relocation of trees necessary to maintain adequate line-of-sight distances as required by the Town's Traffic Engineer or Director of Public Works.
D. Public utility damage. Removal of trees for the protection of existing electrical power or communication lines.
E. Nursery. Removal of trees planted, grown, or held for sale by a nursery.
F. Orchards. Removal of orchards or fruit trees grown, planted, or held for sale for cash crop or commercial purposes.
27.36.031 - Hazardous Trees
Property owners are responsible for the trees on their own property. The Town does not require advance permission for removal of Protected or Designated Trees in emergencies. However, it does require documentation of the problem after the fact. This is to avoid the unlawful removal of sound trees on the grounds that they are hazardous. If there is no immediate danger, and the structural deficiency can be corrected, it should be. If the Town determines that there was no reasonable basis for believing there was an emergency, the property owner may face penalties for violating this Ordinance.
The health and safety of a tree are two distinct and separate functional characteristics. A vigorous and healthy tree may not necessarily be of sound wood or structure. To remove a dangerous protected or designated tree, it must first be evaluated and the tree determined to be hazardous as defined in this section. This must be verified in writing by the Town Arborist before the tree can be removed.
A. Tree Hazard Responsibility. On private property, it is the responsibility of the property owner to mitigate or abate a known hazardous condition of a protected or designated tree that may be of questionable structure or deemed as hazardous. Most tree hazards can be prevented with regular checkups by a tree care professional and timely maintenance action by the property owner.
3-133
B. Recognizing Tree Hazards - Criteria and Evaluation of Hazards. Determining whether or not a trees defects constitute a condition that presents an imminent hazard to an area requires a high degree of knowledge and experience. Hazard tree assessment of a protected or designated tree should only be evaluated by an arborist. Refer to the Town of Windsor TREE TECHNICAL MANUAL for specific criteria in evaluating tree hazards. The manual includes a checklist for evaluation as well as reduction and prevention methods.
C. Town Liability for Public Right-of-Way, Publicly Owned Property. In the event that a tree on private property is evaluated by an arborist and a report is submitted that indicates that a tree may be a hazard to the public (overhang sidewalk, buildings, pedestrian use area, etc.) but recommends for reasons of health, maturity, etc. that the tree be retained, the Town may require that Risk Management review and make a determination on the issue of liability. If the tree is determined by the Towns Risk Manager to be a liability, maintenance and/or removal may be required. Payment of costs shall be determined by the Town Manager or his/her designee.
27.36.032  Tree Technical Manual
Regulations to implement this Ordinance are entitled Tree Technical Manual. The manual will be made available to the public and shall include but not be limited to standards and specifications regarding: (1) protection of trees during construction; (2) replacement of trees; (3) maintenance of protected trees; (4) format and content of tree plans/reports.
27.36.040 - Protected Trees
A protected tree is any of the following:
A. The following native oak trees six inch or greater:
Black Oak (Quercus kelloggii) Valley Oak (Quercus lobata)
Blue Oak (Quercus douglasii) Interior Live Oak (Quercus wislizenii)
Coast Live Oak (Quercus agrifolia) Oracle Oak (Quercus x morehus)
Oregon Oak (Quercus garryana) Chase Oak (Quercus x chaseii)
The following trees:

On projects where Planning Commission/Town Council approval is not required, determination will be made at the direction of the Planning Director.)
B. Heritage trees as identified by Council resolution
3-134
C. Significant groves or stands of trees. On projects where Planning Commission/Town Council approval is not required, determination will be at the direction of the Planning Director.
D. Mature trees located on a parcel of one acre or more. Smaller trees may also be protected under special circumstances. On projects where Planning Commission/Town Council approval is not required, determination will be at the direction of the Planning Director.
E. Any tree required, to be planted or preserved, as environmental mitigation for a discretionary permit.
F. Landmark trees are trees identified during the development process and for which preservation is encouraged during the design phase of the project by keeping development and construction activity outside the designated Tree Protection Zone (TPZ). An arborist report prepared by a Town approved arborist shall be prepared assessing the structural integrity and health of the tree(s). Project developers should be aware of their significance and understand that special measures, unusual protection techniques, and more rigid preservation standards will apply. Development density and project layout may be affected where landmark trees are located in order to protect them. Over-mature, senescent, or ancient trees may not qualify for preservation if they are unstable, hazardous, in poor health, or otherwise unsuited for preservation in an urban setting. However, if older larger trees are not in optimum condition that in itself would not be a reason for removal. (Revised 04/18/07, ORD. 2007-214)
Landmark trees shall be designated on the development plan for preservation and protection. When a tentative map is part of the development entitlement the conditions shall include the following notes to be recorded on the map:
1. The location of the tree shall be identified by lot/parcel number.
2. The Tree is subject to all regulations of the Tree Protection Ordinance.
3. Maintenance shall be completed in accordance with the Tree Technical Manual.
4. Tree Removal is subject to Planning Commission review and action.
5. Standard Tree Protection Notes including references to the arborist report and supplemental reports shall be included.
27.36.050 - Preservation of Existing Trees
A. The design of each project shall recognize the desirability of preserving protected trees to the greatest extent feasible. The design of the grading and site improvements shall reflect consideration of the following safeguards:
1. Provision of sufficient growing areas as required by individual species;
2. No disruption or removal of structural roots;
3-135
3. Fencing of trees at or beyond their drip lines during grading and construction activities;
4. No ornamental landscape, filling, cutting, development, or compaction of soils within the drip line;
5. Preservation of oak leaf litter below the drip line; and
6. Other measures required by the particular species of tree(s) to be preserved as recommended by the consulting arborist, horticulturist, or landscape architect.
B. It is recognized that the preservation of all existing trees on a development site may sometimes conflict with reasonable land developmental considerations (e.g., adequate drainage, grading, circulation, safety, and provision of utilities.) However, the design of the proposed development shall address preservation of the most desirable and significant of the healthy trees and the developer is encouraged to utilize creative land planning techniques to achieve this goal.
C. Grading and landscaping plans shall implement the approved tree preservation plan. The locations of all protected trees shall be indicated on the plans by the number of the tree as described in the tree study. Notes shall identify which trees are to be preserved and which may be removed. Plans shall be consistent with the required tree protection mitigation measures included in the project application, initial study, mitigated negative declaration, or environmental impact report and monitoring plan, and the conditions of the development approval.
D. Prior to use inauguration, the preserved trees shall be trimmed for healthy balance, structural integrity and ornamental appearance.
E. The precise vertical and horizontal locations (plus or minus one foot) of all protected trees to be preserved or removed shall be shown on the site plan as part of the initial application unless the project does not involve exterior alterations or construction activities.
27.36.051 - Project Arborist Requirements
The Town strongly recommends the use of a Town arborist in the preparation of any required arborist report or Tree Preservation and Protection Plan. Arborist reports must be prepared by an arborist, pre-approved by the Town of Windsor. All approved arborists must possess a current Certified Arborist Certificate from the International Society of Arboriculture and be a current member of the American Society of Consulting Arborists. An applicant may submit an arborist report prepared by his/her own arborist who is certified, however, the report will require a peer review pre-approved Town arborist at the applicants expense. A deposit fee will be collected when an application is submitted for review. The fee will be used to cover the cost of report preparation and recommendations. Additional fees will be collected if the actual costs exceed the initial deposit fees. The applicant will be provided with a written request for the fees. If the initial deposit fee exceeds the final report costs the applicant will be refunded the difference.
3-136
In the event that an applicants arborist is used and the recommendations conflict with the Town arborist recommendation, the Planning Director will make a decision on the recommendations.
27.36.060 - Tree Removal
A. Permit required. No protected tree shall be removed, cut down, or otherwise destroyed, unless a written permit is issued by the Planning Department. For individual sites including single-residential lots a Tree Removal Permit must be completed and submitted to the Planning Department for review and action. For site development that allows for tree removal as part of a projects conditions of approval, the written permit may be in the form of signed authorization by the Planning Department, a tree preservation plan signed by the Planning Department, written approval for a grading permit, encroachment permit, or other similar permit. In all cases, removal of a protected or designated tree requires written authorization from the Planning Department.
B. Tree replacement requirement. The following conditions determine whether a protected or designated tree must be replaced.
1. Protected Trees  If the Town authorizes the removal of a protected tree(s) because it is dead, dangerous, or a nuisance, no tree replacement is required. In all other cases, the tree(s) must be replaced, with the exception of protected trees approved for removal by the approving body in relation to a development application.
2. Designated Trees  The Planning Director or the Directors designee shall require tree replacement if it is necessary or desirable to implement the intent of the original site design. The number and nature of the replacement trees shall be determined by the Director or designee, taking into consideration the value of the tree removed and the site design.
3. Street Trees  If the Town authorizes removal of a street tree in connection with a development project, it shall specify the replacement requirements in the permit authorizing removal.
4. Development Projects - If a project applicant chooses to remove trees only from development areas (building envelopes, access roads, etc.), the project applicant may be required to replace the tree/trees. Refer to the Town of Windsor Tree Technical Manual Sections 6.20, 6.30, 6.40 and 6.50 for approved forms of tree replacement. On projects where Planning Commission/Town Council approval is not required, replacement will be at the direction of the Planning Director. If the protected tree is dead, dying, or diseased replacement/in-lieu fee will not be required. For development projects that require Planning Commission/Town Council approval, protected trees authorized for removal will be addressed as part of the development conditions of approval. The approving body shall be the deciding factor on appropriate replacement/in-lieu fee and the project will be conditioned accordingly.
3-137
5. Development and General Plan Density Issues  The Town Council and/or Planning Commission may direct removal of protected and designated trees for development purposes. Certain levels of removal at the direction of the Council and/or Commission may be allowed to meet density and housing goals and policies of the General Plan. These levels are solely at the discretion of the Council and/or Commission and certain criteria and review is required, prior to a final determination. See the Tree Technical Manual for additional criteria.
C. Appraisal valuations. All trees to be replaced shall be the same native species as those removed, unless specific approval has been granted, by the Director. Appraisal value shall be determined by using the most recent edition of the Guide for Plant Appraisal, published by the Council of Tree and Landscape Appraisers. The appraisals shall be completed on the most recent Form for Northern California published by the International Society of Arboriculture.
D. Location of replacement trees. Replacement trees may be located on residentially zoned parcels of at least 1.5 acres and on any commercial or industrial zoned parcel, regardless of size, where feasible. Where infeasible, replacement trees may be located on public land or maintained private open space. In-lieu fees may be used to acquire and protect stands of native trees in preserves or place trees on public lands.
E. Diseased or hazardous trees. In no case shall an applicant for a Tree Removal Permit be required to replace or otherwise pay for the value of a tree that is diseased or in danger of collapse, or that the Town has requested to be removed.
F. Posting of notification of pending permit. The applicant shall be issued a summary notice to be posted on a pole, tree, or fence nearest to the front of the subject parcel. Copies shall be posted on each corner of the parcel visible to the public. The notice shall state, "Application has been made to the Department to cut and/or damage certain trees on this site, previously described in a Council resolution as a protected tree. A copy of the tree removal plan is on file with the Department."
G. Considerations for denial of Tree Removal Permit. A finding of any one of the following situations shall be grounds for denial of the permit.
1. Removal or damage of a healthy tree could be avoided by:
a. Reasonable redesign of the site plan prior to construction;
b. Trimming, thinning, tree surgery, or other reasonable treatment, as determined by the Director.
2. Adequate provisions for drainage, erosion control, land stability, windscreen buffers along the road and between neighbors have not been made where these problems are anticipated as a result of the removal.
3. The tree to be removed contains an active bird nest of a rare and endangered species and relocation of the nest is not possible.
3-138
H. Security Deposits. A security deposit shall be posted to cover the value of protected trees for preservation. The security deposit will be collected with and subject to the same requirements as site improvements. Typical methods may be improvement agreements, encroachment permit, building permit, or other similar methods used by the Town to secure improvement requirements. Release of security for tree preservation shall be the same as the time frames defined within the agreement/permit method used to secure improvements.
Security deposits for tree preservation shall be subject to a tiered system as defined below.
1. Up to the first $100,000 of tree value the deposit is 20%, thereafter tree valuations in excess of $100,000 shall be 10% of the valuation in excess of $100,000. Total security deposit amounts for any project shall not exceed $50,000.
Creeks, riparian corridors and significant groves or stands of trees are considered a biological resource and construction activity is restricted from these areas. Creeks, riparian corridors and significant groves or stands of trees are exempted from security deposit requirements.
Town of Windsor sponsored/funded projects are exempt from security deposit requirements.
If any tree fails to survive, or declines to a point where it is deemed to not be expected to survive, the Town may use the security value of the dead or declining tree(s) to purchase new trees for on or off-site use. In the event that replacement cannot be accomplished on-site, the security will be placed in a fund with the Town of Windsor for use in planting trees within public right-of-way, parks, public landscape areas, or other areas as deemed appropriate by the Town of Windsor.
If a tree or trees, that have been designated to be protected, are determined to have failed or died on their own and not through impacts from development, the security deposit shall not be used for replacement. This determination shall be made at the discretion of the Planning Director and may include an evaluation by the Town arborist, the cost to be borne by the developer.
NOTE: Single developed lot property owners that are proposing remodels, additions, pools, etc. are exempt from security deposits.
27.36.061 Tree Mitigation (Revision 02/21/07, ORD. 2007-212)
An arborist report is required for all development project sites that contain protected trees. The Town maintains a list of arborists approved to work on Town projects. An initial deposit amount to prepare the report shall be paid by the owner/developer of the project. The deposit amount will be used to cover the cost of the report preparation. Additional fees will be collected if the actual costs exceed the initial deposit amount. If an arborist is utilized who is not on the list that arborists report is subject to a peer review by an approved Town arborist with the cost to be borne by the developer/owner of the project. Tree mitigation may be in the form of in-kind replacement, in-lieu replacement, and/or a combination of both.
3-139
A. New Commercial and/or Residential (2 or more units) Development Projects. In the event that there are no viable and/or practical alternatives except to remove a protected tree, the Town will require mitigation. All removed protected trees shall be replaced at the following ratios:
 All protected trees, determined by the project arborist to be in good (4) or excellent (5) health, and/or with moderate (3) to good (4) structure, shall be replaced on a one-to-one trunk diameter basis. (Example: A 24-inch protected tree in good or excellent condition must be replaced with new trees totaling 24 inches in trunk diameters.)
 All protected trees, determined by the project arborist to have fair (3) or marginal (2) health, and/or with marginal (2) structure, shall be replaced on a two-to-one trunk diameter basis. (Example: A 24-inch protected tree in fair-to-marginal condition must be replaced with new trees totaling 12 inches in trunk diameter.
 All protected trees, determined by the project arborist to have poor (1) health or poor (1) structure, are not required to be replaced.
1. Tree Mitigation. An approved arborist must determine that a tree designated for preservation in a development project has a good chance at long-term survival as determined by an assessment of proposed development impacts. Simply preserving a tree does not excuse it from designated mitigation requirements; it must, in the professional opinion of the arborist, have a good chance to survive after all the impacts of construction are considered.
a. In-Kind Replacement: If the location of replacement tree planting will remain as a natural area suitable for the healthy and long-term growth of native trees, replacement of protected trees should occur in-kind. That is, a native tree species shall be replaced with the same native tree species. If the location of replacement tree planting will be part of an irrigated, ornamental landscape area, replacement of protected trees may occur with a water tolerant oak tree species as identified by the project arborist. If an oak tree species cannot be used the project arborist may recommend a high-value ornamental tree species (as designated by a 70% species rating in the Species Classification and Group Assignment Handbook, which is an official publication of The Western Chapter of the International Society of Arboriculture).
Replacement tree ratios shall be applied as follows:
 24-inch box replacement tree = 2-inch replacement trunk diameter
 36-inch box replacement tree = 3-inch trunk replacement diameter
 48-inch box replacement tree = 4-inch trunk replacement diameter
3-140
Replacement trees shall be a minimum 24-inch box size. If less than 6 inches are required, any combination of box sizes may be utilized. Where more than 6 inches of total replacement trunk diameter are required, the following minimum ratios of replacement tree sizes must be incorporated:
 50% minimum must be a 48-inch box.
 50% may be any combination of 24-inch and 36-inch boxes
Example: If a project requires removal of one 24 protected tree, a total of 24 trunk inches must be replaced. At least 12 of replacement trees must be 48 boxes. This requires at least 3 48 boxes, and the balance of the requirement may be composed of either 24 or 36 boxes. If 36 boxes are chosen, then 4 would be required. A total of 24 of replacement trunk may be composed of 3-48 boxes plus 4-36 boxes.
Example: If a project requires removal of a 12, 26, and 10 protected trees, a total of 48 trunk inches must be replaced. At least 24 of replacement tree must be 48 boxes. This requires at least 6  48 boxes and the balance of the requirement may be composed of either 24 or 36 boxes. If 24 boxes are chosen, then 12 would be required. A total of 48 of replacement trunk may be composed of 6-48 boxes plus 12-24 boxes.
At the time of replacement, equivalent sizes of trunk are required. After ten years time it is expected that replacement trunks will yield an equivalent volume of canopy to that which was originally removed, even though the equivalent canopy will be spread across a greater number of individual trees. This achieves the Towns goal of no net loss of protected tree canopy.
b. In-Lieu Replacement: In the event that a development site is insufficient in size or use to plant any or all of replacement trees, the Town may accept payment of in-lieu fees by the applicant to the Town Oak Tree Fund. In-lieu fees will be utilized by the Town to purchase and install trees in future public open space, park space, or other areas designated for tree planting.
Replacement tree costs for the purposes of satisfying in-lieu fees shall be based on the following scale of typical northern California wholesale tree cost plus average installation cost:
 24-inch box = 2-inch trunk diameter = $400
 36-inch box = 3-inch trunk diameter = $800
 48-inch box = 4-inch trunk diameter = $1,600
3-141
In-lieu fee replacement trees shall be a minimum 24-inch box size. If less than 6 inches are required, any combination of box sizes may be utilized. Where more than 6 inches of total replacement trunk diameter are required, the following minimum ratios of replacement tree sizes must be incorporated:
 50% minimum must be a 48-inch box.
 50% may be any combination of 24-inch and 36-inch boxes
Example: If a total of 24 trunk inches is to be replaced, the in-lieu fee requires half to be 48-inch box and the remainder may be 36-inch and/or 24-inch box. ((3, 48-inch (3 x $1,600), 2, 36-inch (2 x $800), and 3, 24-inch (3 x $400) for a total of $7,600)). (Revised 04/18/07, ORD. 2007-214)
2. Security Deposits. Security deposits may be collected with and subject to the same requirements as site improvements, as outlined in Section 27.36.060 H. Security deposits are subject to a tiered system based on a percentage of tree values with a deposit amount not to exceed $50,000. The project arborist prepares a final evaluation of the protected trees based on impacts, protection, and maintenance during the construction period. If a tree(s) is recommended for removal at the end of construction the security amount collected may not meet the requirements of this ordinance for replacement. The developer shall be subject to the replacement requirements outlined in this ordinance. The developer shall be responsible for payment of the difference between the bond amount and the mitigation amount defined in this ordinance. The health and structural rating of the project arborist report will be used in determining the mitigation amount of the lost tree(s).
B. Existing Residential Lots (additions, accessory structures, etc.) An arborist report is required for residential project sites that may impact protected trees. The Town maintains a list of arborists approved to work on Town projects. If an arborist is utilized who is not on the list that arborists report is subject to a peer review by an approved Town arborist with the cost to be borne by the developer/owner of the project. Private property owners that are considering additions, decks, pools, and/or other accessory uses are required to identify protected trees that are located on the property and may be impacted by the proposed addition/use.
1. Tree Protection/Removal Requirements. The Town requires the land developer to protect and preserve trees during the development/ subdivision of residential parcels. The resulting lots are then sold to property owners with the understanding that the trees should be protected. Property owners may request any number of modifications to their properties that may in turn result in impacts to the protected trees. Lots with protected trees are subject to the following requirements for additions, pools, and/or other accessory uses that may result in an impact to the protected trees.
a. An arborist report is required for all properties considering additions, pools, and/or accessory structures that may have an impact on a protected tree, including improvements within the tree protection zone.
3-142
b. In the event that there is no viable and/or practical alternative to removal of protected trees to accommodate the addition, pool, and/or accessory structure the following shall apply:
1. A request for a Tree Removal Permit for protected trees 15 or greater, determined by the project arborist to be in good (4) or excellent (5) health, and/or with moderate (3) to good (4) structure will require review and action by the Planning Commission at a noticed public hearing. The request will require a Tree Removal Permit, arborist report, statement justifying removal of the tree, and payment of a permit application fee. For protected trees 14 or less which are requested to be removed, the Planning Director shall review the request and make the determination for removal. If the Planning Director authorizes removal, mitigation shall be required either by in-kind replacement or in-lie fee payment, as defined in this ordinance. If the Planning Director denies the request for removal, the decision may be appealed.
2. A request for a Tree Removal Permit for all protected trees, determined by the project arborist to be in fair (3) or marginal (2) health, and/or with marginal (2) structure may be approved and require mitigation. The Planning Director shall review the request and make the determination for removal. If the Planning Director authorizes removal, mitigation shall be required either by in-kind replacement or in-lie fee payment, as defined in this ordinance. If the Planning Director denies the request for removal, the decision may be appealed.
3. A request for a Tree Removal Permit for all protected trees, determined by the project arborist to be in poor (1) health, poor (1) structure, or to be structurally unsafe or hazardous (1), will be approved and will not require mitigation.
c. Denial and/or appeal of a Tree Removal Permit and its conditions is subject to Section 27.36.090  Appeals, Extensions, Revocation.
2. Tree Replacement Requirements:
a. In-Kind Replacement  In-kind replacement shall be the same as outlined in Section A.1.a. The arborist report shall specify the replacement value. The applicant/owner shall include a replacement landscape plan with the Tree Removal Permit. The building permit for the addition, pool, and/or other accessory use shall be conditioned to require installation of the replacement trees, prior to building permit final.
b. In-Lieu Replacement  In-lieu replacement shall be the same as outlined in Section A.1.b. The arborist report shall specify the replacement value. The
3-143
applicant/owner shall pay to the Town the in-lieu fee with the Tree Removal Permit. The building permit for the addition, pool, and/or other accessory use shall be conditioned to require a Tree Removal Permit and payment of the in-lieu fee, prior to initiation of the work.
C. Penalties for Unauthorized Tree Removal. Enforcement and Civil Penalties shall be applied to violations of this Tree Mitigation Ordinance per Section 27.36.100 Enforcement, in Chapter 27.36 of the Tree Preservation and Protection Ordinance.
Illegal or unauthorized removal of any protected tree will require payment of a determined replacement value, as defined in Section 27.36.100, which is different and separate from mitigation replacement as addressed in Section 27.36.061.
27.36.070 - Tree Protection and Preservation Plan
A. Where an applicant proposes to remove one or more protected trees, the Director may require a tree plan for review by the Department.
B. Tree plans shall be prepared by an arborist, horticulturist, or registered landscape architect.
C. All Tree Protection and Preservation Plans must include the following basic information:
1. The location of all trees present that are greater than 6 inches in trunk diameter at a height of 4.5 feet above surrounding grade, including all that will be preserved, removed, or transplanted.
2. All trees that overhang the proposed project site and are located on immediately adjacent properties.
3. The report cover shall include the arborists name, certification number, project reference name and address, and report date.
4. A cover letter describing the project site, the date of inspection and summarizing the total number of trees present, to be removed, and preserved.
5. A site plan that identifies the location of each tree, including its report reference number.
6. Assessment data for each tree.
7. Comments and observations regarding health or structure.
8. Estimate of the impacts of proposed development activities on long-term health and structural integrity.
9. Recommendations for removal or preservation based on the development impacts expected from the proposed plan.
3-144
10. Recommendations for modification of the proposed plan to reduce or eliminate impacts to the tree.
Refer to the Towns TREE TECHNICAL MANUAL for more detailed information related to the preparation and contents of the Tree Protection and Preservation Plan.
D. The Director may waive the requirement for a tree plan or the requirement for a survey based upon a determination that the tree(s) would have little or no ornamental value in an urban setting or that the tree(s) are located so that they would not be impacted by the proposed development.
27.36.080 - Tree Protection Requirements
The Director shall determine during project review whether and to what extent measures will be required to protect the existing trees during construction. This decision shall be based upon the proximity of the area of construction activity to existing protected trees. The protective measures shall include, but are not limited to, the following:
A. Prior to initiating any construction activity on a construction project, including demolition or grading, temporary protective fencing shall be installed at each site tree.
1. Fencing shall be located at the Tree Protection Zone (TPZ) illustrated on the Improvement Plans.
2. Fencing shall serve as a barrier to prevent encroachment of any type by construction activities, equipment, materials storage, or personnel.
B. The Tree Protection Zone (TPZ) is illustrated on the Improvement Plans and represents the area around each tree, or group of trees, which must be protected at all times with tree protection fencing.
1. No encroachment into the TPZ is allowed at any time without approval from the project arborist.
2. Any unauthorized entry into the TPZ is a violation of this Ordinance and shall be subject to enforcement through civil, criminal or administrative remedies, including applicable penalties.
C. Contractors and subcontractors shall direct all equipment and personnel to remain outside the fenced area at all times until project is complete, and shall instruct personnel and sub-contractors as to the purpose and importance of fencing and preservation.
D. No grade changes shall be made within the protective barriers without prior approval by the Director.
E. No attachments or wires other than those of a protective or non-damaging nature shall be attached to a protected tree.
3-145
F. Excavation or landscape preparation within the protective barriers shall be limited to the use of hand tools and small hand held power tools and shall not be of a depth that could cause root damage.
G. When the existing grade around a protected tree is to be raised the project and/or Town arborist shall provide written directions on which method(s) may be used to drain liquids away from the trunk.
H. When the existing grade around a protected tree is to be lowered the project and/or Town arborist shall provide written directions on which method(s) may be used (terracing, retaining wall, etc) to allow the dripline to be left at the original grade.
I. No equipment, solvents, paint, asphalt, or debris of any kind shall be placed, stored, or allowed within the protective barrier.
Refer to the Towns TREE TECHNICAL MANUAL for additional information on tree protection requirements.
27.36.090 - Appeals, Extensions, Revocation
A. Appeals. The decision of the Director shall be considered final unless an appeal is filed in compliance with Chapter 27.52 (Appeals).
B. Expiration/extension. A Tree Removal Permit shall be exercised within one year from the date of approval or other time limit established through a discretionary permit approval. Time extensions, for up to a total of two additional years, may be granted in compliance with Chapter 27.44 (Permit Implementation and Time Extensions). If a Tree Removal Permit is not exercised within the established time frame, and a time extension is not granted, the provisions of Chapter 27.44 shall be initiated to consider the permit expired.
C. Performance guarantee. The applicant/owner may be required to provide adequate performance security for the faithful performance of conditions of approval imposed as part of the Tree Removal Permit.
D. Construction monitoring. Monitoring of tree protection and restoration measure specified as conditions of approval shall be performed by site inspection conducted by the Director.
E. Revocation. A Tree Removal Permit may be revoked or modified, as provided in Section 27.56.050 (Permit Revocation and Modification), with any of the following findings that the tree removal, relocation, or protection activities:
1. Cannot support the original findings;
2. Resulted from misrepresentation or fraud;
3. Has not been implemented in a timely manner;
3-146
4. Has not met, or has violated any condition of approval;
5. It is in violation of any code, law, ordinance, or statute;
6. Is detrimental to public health, safety, or welfare; or
7. Constitutes a nuisance.
27.36.100 - Enforcement
Enforcement. Any person who cuts, damages, or removes a protected tree in violation of this Chapter shall be deemed guilty of a misdemeanor and upon conviction may be punished in compliance with the applicable provisions of the law. A violation of this Chapter shall also constitute a public nuisance and may be abated and/or enforced through civil, criminal, or administrative proceedings in accordance with the Town Code. Further, a violation of this Chapter during construction may result in an immediate stop-work order until permits are obtained and required mitigation procedures are in place.
CIVIL PENALTIES
If a civil action or administrative enforcement is brought by the Town, a civil penalty in an amount not to exceed five thousand dollars ($5,000) per violation may be assessed, against anyone who violates any provision of this Ordinance or the Tree Protection and Preservation Plan.
Where a tree is illegally removed, or damaged to a degree that survival is not expected, the
penalty shall be the replacement value of each tree, and shall be paid to the Town. Replacement values shall be developed using the most recent edition of the Guide for Plant Appraisal, published by the Council of Tree & Landscape Appraisers. If a violation occurs during development, appraised values for each tree will be found in the Tree Protection & Preservation Plan. If a violation occurs outside the development process, values shall be determined by an arborist pre-approved by the Town.
Where a tree is illegally damaged, the damage cannot be fully corrected but the tree is expected to survive, then the penalty shall be the replacement value times the percentage of the tree damaged.
A civil or administrative action may also be implemented to provide appropriate relief to abate, enjoin, or otherwise compel the cessation of such violation.
If civil action is brought by the Town, the court shall award all costs associated with investigation, preparation for trial, costs of the trial, reasonable expenses including overhead and administration costs incurred when prosecuting the action, and reasonable attorney fees, to the prevailing party in such action.

CHAPTER 27.37  MARIJUANA (NONMEDICAL)  INDOOR CULTIVATION
27.37.010 - Purpose of Chapter
It is the purpose of this chapter: to require that the indoor cultivation of marijuana occur only in appropriately secured, enclosed, and ventilated structures so as not to be visible to the general public; to provide for the health, safety and welfare of the public; to prevent odor created by marijuana plants from impacting adjacent properties; and to ensure that personal nonmedical marijuana cultivation remains secure and does not find its way to illicit markets; to establish reasonable limits on the personal cultivation of marijuana for nonmedical purposes within the Town of Windsor as defined by state law and subject to the provisions established herein. Nothing in this chapter is intended to authorize the cultivation, possession, or use of marijuana in violation of state or federal law.
27.37.020 - Applicability
All of the provisions of this chapter shall be immediately enforceable as to the personal indoor cultivation of nonmedical marijuana. Any person legally cultivating marijuana indoors prior to the effective date of this article shall have one hundred twenty (120) days from the effective date of this chapter to comply with the regulations. After the one hundred twenty-day (120) grace period, all the provisions of this article shall be immediately enforceable.
27.37.030 - Standards for Personal Indoor Cultivation (Nonmedical Marijuana)

F. Findings and decision. The review authority may approve or disapprove an application for Use Permit or Minor Use Permit approval. The review authority shall record the decision and the findings on which the decision is based. The review authority may approve a Use Permit or Minor Use Permit only after first finding all of the following:
4-15
1. The proposed use is allowed within the applicable zoning district and complies with all other applicable provisions of this Zoning Ordinance and the Town Code;
2. The proposed use is consistent with the General Plan and any applicable specific plan;
3. The design, location, size, and operating characteristics of the proposed activity are compatible with the existing and future land uses in the vicinity;
4. The site is physically suitable for the type, density and intensity of use being proposed, including access, utilities, and the absence of physical constraints; and
5. Granting the permit would not be detrimental to the public interest, health, safety, convenience, or welfare, or materially injurious to persons, property, or improvements in the vicinity and zoning district in which the property is located.
G. Conditions of approval. In approving a Use Permit or Minor Use Permit, the review authority may impose any conditions (e.g., buffers, landscaping and maintenance, off-site improvements, performance guarantees, screening, surfacing, time limits, etc.) deemed reasonable and necessary to ensure that the approval will comply with the findings required by Subsection E. (Findings and Decision).
H. Post approval procedures. Procedures relating to appeals, performance guarantee, and revocation as identified in Article 5 (Zoning Ordinance Administration), in addition to those identified in Chapter 27.44 (Permit Implementation, Time Limits, and Extensions), shall apply following the approval of a Use Permit or Minor Use Permit application.
27.42.060 - Variances
This Section allows Variances from the development standards of this Zoning Ordinance only when, because of special circumstances applicable to the property, including location, shape, size, surroundings, topography, or other conditions, the strict application of this Zoning Ordinance denies the property owner privileges enjoyed by other property owners in the vicinity and under identical zoning districts.
A. Applicability. A Variance may be granted to waive or modify any requirement of this Zoning Ordinance except allowed land uses, residential density, specific prohibitions (for example, prohibited signs), or procedural requirements. The Director may grant a Minor Variance for a 10 percent maximum adjustment to any provision of this Zoning Ordinance eligible for a Variance. The Commission may grant all other Variances.
B. Application filing and processing. An application for a Variance shall be filed in compliance with Chapter 27.40 (Applications - Filing and Processing).
C. Project review, notice and hearing. Each application shall be analyzed by the Department to ensure that the application is consistent with the purpose of this Chapter. The review authority shall conduct a public hearing on the application. Notice of the
4-16
public hearing shall be provided, and the hearing shall be conducted in compliance with State law.
D. Findings and decision. The review authority may approve a Variance, with or without conditions, only after first making all of the following findings, as applicable.
1. General findings.
a. There are special circumstances applicable to the property (e.g., location, shape, size, surroundings, topography, or other conditions), so that the strict application of this Zoning Ordinance denies the property owner privileges enjoyed by other property owners in the vicinity and under identical zoning districts or creates an unnecessary and non-self created hardship or unreasonable regulation which makes it obviously impractical to require compliance with the development standards.
b. Granting the Variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of substantial property rights possessed by other property owners in the same vicinity and zoning district and denied to the property owner for which the Variance is sought.
c. Granting the Variance is consistent with the General Plan and any applicable specific plan.
2. Findings for off-street parking Variances. For a nonresidential development project proposing to locate a portion of the required parking at an off-site location, or provide in-lieu fees or facilities instead of the required on-site parking spaces, the review authority shall first make both of the following findings in compliance with State law (Government Code Section 65906.5), instead of those required by Subsection D.1 above.
a. The Variance would be an incentive to, and a benefit for, the subject nonresidential development; and
b. The Variance would facilitate access to the subject nonresidential development by patrons of public transit facilities.
E. Conditions of approval. In approving a Variance, the review authority:
1. Shall impose conditions to ensure that the Variance does not grant special privileges inconsistent with the limitations on other properties in the vicinity and zoning district in which the property is located; and
2. May impose conditions (e.g., buffers, landscaping and maintenance, off-site improvements, performance guarantees, screening, surfacing, etc.) deemed reasonable and necessary to ensure that the approval would be in compliance with the findings required by Subsection D. above.
4-17
F. Post approval procedures. Procedures relating to appeals and revocation as identified in Article 5 (Zoning Ordinance Administration), in addition to those identified in Chapter 27.44 (Permit Implementation, Time Limits, and Extensions), shall apply following the approval of a Variance application.
4-18

4-19
3. The land use permit shall remain valid after it has been exercised as long as a building permit is active for the project or a final building inspection or certificate of occupancy have been granted.
4. If a project is to be developed in approved phases, each subsequent phase shall be exercised within two years from the date that the previous phase was exercised, unless otherwise specified in the permit, or the permit shall expire and be deemed void in compliance with Subsection D. below, except where an extension of time is approved in compliance with Subsection B., below.

2. Decision. If the review authority determines that the applicant has not diligently pursued establishing the land use or constructing the project as authorized by the land use permit, or that all delays in progress were not entirely beyond the applicant's control, the review authority shall deem the land use permit expired and void. Otherwise, the review authority may grant one additional time extension in compliance with this Section.
E. Effect of expiration. After the expiration of a land use permit in compliance with Subsection E., no further work shall be done on the site until a new land use permit is first obtained.
27.44.060 - Changes to an Approved Project

d. Do not result in an expansion of the activity.
2. The Director may defer action on the requested change(s) and refer the request to the original review authority for final action.
27.44.070 - Resubmittals
For a period of one year following the approval, disapproval, or revocation/modification of a discretionary entitlement, no application for the same or substantially similar discretionary entitlement for the same site shall be filed.

5-3
7. Limited Incremental Expansion of Non-Conforming Uses and Structures within the Windsor Station Area / Downtown Specific Plan. The Station Area / Downtown Specific Plan set forth a long-range vision for the development of downtown. This vision will evolve over many years, and may require incremental steps. (Revised 02/06/13, ORD 2013-277)
Station Area Plan Expansion of Residential Structures. Expansion to a nonconforming residential structure located in the Station Area / Downtown Specific Plan boundary, zoned Town Center Commercial, but not within the Downtown Core (as defined by the Station Area Plan Figure 2-1 ) may be permitted with Planning Commission approval provided it is in conformance with Section 27.08.040 and is consistent with similar development in the immediate area.
Conversion of residential structures to commercial uses: The conversion or expansion of non-conforming residential to commercial uses or structures outside the downtown core (defined by the Station Area Plan Figure 2-1) and zoned Town Center Commercial, may be permitted at the discretion of the Planning Commission. The intent is the re-use of the existing structures with interior improvements and minor exterior improvements to accommodate commercial uses. Conversion of residential structures to commercial uses is allowed if the following findings of fact can be made in an affirmative manner:
a. The proposed use is consistent with the General Plan.
b. The proposed use is allowed within the applicable zoning district and complies with all other applicable provisions of the Station Area Plan and the Town Code.
c. The design, location, size, and operating characteristics of the proposed use is compatible with the existing and future land uses in the vicinity.
d. The proposed use clearly represents incremental progress towards the fulfillment of the ultimate vision of the Station Area / Downtown Specific Plan by changing the use and or design.
e. The proposed use is not geographically positioned to impede the development of larger projects within the vicinity.
f. The site is physically suitable for the type, intensity of use being proposed, including access, utilities, and the absence of physical constraints.
g. Granting the permit would not be detrimental to the public interest, health, safety, convenience, or welfare, or materially injurious to persons, property, or improvements in the vicinity and zoning district in which the property is located.
h. The design and layout of the proposed development will not interfere with the use and enjoyment of neighboring existing or future developments, and will not create traffic or pedestrian hazards.
5-4
27.50.030 - Agricultural and Residential Exemptions
A. An involuntarily damaged or destroyed agricultural structure, or single- or multi-family dwelling may be reconstructed or replaced with a new structure with the same footprint, height, and number of dwelling units, in compliance with current Building and Fire Code requirements.

3. Without further action by the Town, any further use of the site or structure shall comply with all of the regulations of the applicable zoning district and all other applicable provisions of this Zoning Ordinance.
B. Termination by destruction. Except as provided by Section 27.50.030.A, nonconforming status shall terminate if a nonconforming structure, or a conforming structure occupied by a nonconforming use, is involuntarily damaged or destroyed, provided that the structure may be repaired or rebuilt and reoccupied as follows.
1. If the cost of repairing or replacing the damaged portion of the structure is 50 percent or less of the assessed value of the structure immediately before damage, the structure may be restored and the use continued if the restoration is started within one year of the date of damage and is diligently pursued to completion.
2. Minor Use Permit approval shall be required if the cost of repairing or replacing the damaged portion of the structure is more than 50 percent of the assessed value of the structure immediately before damage. Minor Use Permit approval shall require a finding, in addition to those contained in 27.68.040 (Findings and Decision), that the benefit to the public health, safety or welfare exceeds the detriment inherent in the restoration and continuance of nonconformity.
5-5
27.50.050 - Nonconforming Parcels
A. Legal building site. A nonconforming parcel that does not comply with the applicable area or width requirements of this Zoning Ordinance shall be considered a legal building site if it meets at least one of the following criteria, as documented to the satisfaction of the Director by evidence furnished by the applicant.
1. Approved subdivision. The parcel was created by a recorded subdivision;
2. Individual parcel legally created by deed. The parcel is under one ownership and of record, and was legally created by a recorded deed before the effective date of the zoning amendment that made the parcel nonconforming;
3. Variance or lot line adjustment. The parcel was approved through the Variance procedure or resulted from a lot line adjustment; or
4. Partial government acquisition. The parcel was created in compliance with the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance, but was made nonconforming when a portion was acquired by a governmental entity so that the parcel size is decreased not more than 20 percent and the yard facing a public right-of-way was decreased not more than 50 percent.
B. Subdivision of a nonconforming parcel. No subdivision shall be approved that would increase the nonconformity of an existing parcel or any nonconforming use on the parcel.
27.50.060 - Nonconforming Due to Lack of Use Permit
A. Conformity of uses requiring Use Permits. A use lawfully existing without a Use Permit that would be required by this Zoning Ordinance to have Use Permit approval, shall be deemed conforming only to the extent that it previously existed (e.g., maintain the same site area boundaries, hours of operation, etc.).
B. Previous Use Permits in effect. A use that was authorized by a Use Permit but is not allowed by this Zoning Ordinance in its current location may continue, but only in compliance with the original Use Permit.

amount determined by the Director. These costs shall be recoverable in a civil action in the name of the Town, in a court of competent jurisdiction within the County.

not fully abated or corrected as directed by, and within the time and manner specified in, the notice or letter.
2. The fee shall not apply to the original inspection to document the violations and shall not apply to the first scheduled compliance inspection made after the issuance of a notice or letter, whether or not the correction has been made.
B. Continuation of the original case.

Any action causing or contributing injury to the root system or other parts of a tree, by fire, application of toxic substances, operation of machinery or equipment; improper watering; changing natural grade of land by excavation or filling the drip line area around the trunk; or by attaching signs or artificial material thereby piercing the bark of the tree.
5. Dead Tree - either a tree that is dead, or one that has been so irreparably damaged, or is in such an advanced state of decline that not enough live tissue exists to sustain life. Such a determination must be made by a certified arborist. Once a tree has been determined to be dead then removal is permitted.
6. Diameter at Breast Height (DBH) - the diameter of the tree trunk at four and one-half feet (54) above the natural grade level.

A structural defect is defined as any structural weakness, whether caused by disease or any other means, which results in the deformity or weakness of a tree. Such a condition can be verified by a certified arborist. The Town retains the discretionary right to approve or amend a hazardous rating, in writing, and recommend any action that may reduce the condition to a less-than significant level of hazard.
A tree with a structural defect may not be a hazard if a target is absent within the falling distance of the tree or its parts (e.g., a substandard tree in a non-populated area away from pedestrian pathways may not be considered a hazard).

Multiple trunk trees must possess at least one trunk with the above diameter (based on species) to be considered protected.
16. Protective Tree Fencing - a temporary enclosure erected around a tree to be protected at the boundary of the tree protection zone. The fence serves three primary functions:
 To keep the crown, branch structure and trunk clear from direct contact with, and damage by, equipment, materials or other disturbances;
 To preserve roots and soil in a natural, intact and non-compacted state;
 To identify the tree protection zone in which no soil disturbance is permitted and in which activities are restricted.

18. Significant Groves or Stands of Trees. Groups of trees where the individual trees might not comply with the criteria of this Chapter, however, they represent a significant scenic or natural resource as a result of their grouping. Scenic resources may include entry statements to the Town, scenic corridors along major highways/streets, and/or specific rural, natural, or historic areas. Natural resources may include natural woodlands, riparian habitats, and/or drainage areas.
19. Significant Tree  as determined by the arborist, a significant tree can be identified by size, age, species, unusual character, historical significance, or a combination of these features. When identified by the arborist as significant, exceptional measures to preserve and protect may be required.
20. Site Plan - either a Pre-application Plan, Improvement Plan, or Tentative Map. The Pre-application Plan need only show the surveyed tree locations and the tree driplines (including trees located on neighboring property that overhang the project site).
The Improvement Plan or Tentative Map must show the surveyed tree locations, tree protection zones (TPZ), and tree numbers that correspond to the tree information contained in the Tree Protection and Preservation Plan. Additionally the Improvement Plan or Tentative Map shall show existing site conditions and proposed improvements.
21. Street Tree - any publicly owned tree growing within the Towns right-of-way or an area within a public easement. A permit from the Town is required prior to any work on or around these trees.
22. Target - people, vehicles, structures, other trees or landscape improvements subject to damage by a falling tree.
A tree with a hazardous structure may not be a hazard if a target is absent within the falling distance of the tree or its parts, for example a small tree in a non-populated area, away from pedestrian pathways, might possibly not be considered a hazard.
23. Topping - the practice of cutting back large diameter branches to a stub, or truncating the main stem.
24. Tree Appraisal - a method of determining the monetary value of a tree as it relates to the real estate value of a property, neighborhood or community. When required, a certified arborist determines the trees value by adjusting its basic value by condition, location and species, using the most recent edition of the Guide for Plant Appraisal, published by the Council of Tree and Landscape Appraisers.

25. Tree Injury - a wound resulting from any activity, including but not limited to, excessive pruning, cutting, bruising, scarring, tearing or breaking of roots, bark, trunk, branches or foliage. It also includes damage inflicted on a tree through activities in the tree protection zone such as trenching, excavating, altering grade, paving or compaction. It also includes the application of herbicides or poisons, or any other action that ordinarily would result in damage to a tree.
26. Tree Inspection Report - a written report prepared by the project arborist to document that the specified tree inspection, or any other required procedure, has been accomplished. All necessary mitigation or action items that are required based on conditions existing at the time of inspection shall be noted, as well as any violations of the Tree Preservation Policy or Tree Protection and Preservation Plan.
27. Tree Inventory  a site plan that illustrates the location and driplines of all trees on a proposed project site. An inventory is a recommended submittal in the pre-application stage of development.
28. Tree Protection and Preservation Plan - a plan prepared by a certified arborist that outlines measures to protect and preserve trees on a project. This plan shall include requirements for preservation, establish a tree protection zone (TPZ), specify tree protection during demolition and/or construction, and specify mitigation measures and appraisal values for each tree.
29. Tree Protection Signage - signs measuring a minimum size of 12 x 18 designating the tree protection zone, which is a protected area. Tree protection signs must be attached to the tree protection fencing at maximum intervals of 12 feet apart on all fenced areas.
30. Tree Protection Zone or (TPZ) the area of temporary fenced tree enclosure. The roots that are critical for tree survival are typically found in the upper three feet of soil and may extend beyond the dripline area. Protecting the roots in the TPZ is necessary to ensure the trees survival. The TPZ is a restricted activity zone where no access or soil disturbance is permitted, unless approved, in writing, and supervised by the Project Arborist. A TPZ must be identified for each tree and shown on all applicable Improvement plans.
The TPZ is measured from the dripline of the furthest most tree limb plus a minimum of one inch for every inch of the diameter of the tree or a minimum of 3 beyond the dripline, whichever is greater to provide a protected zone outside the furthest dripline of the tree. (DBH - the diameter of the tree trunk at four and one-half feet (54) above the natural grade level).
The Project Arborist retains the discretionary right to decrease or increase the size of a TPZ at any time.
6-58
31. Tree Removal - complete tree removal either by cutting to the ground, or extraction, and then grinding or pushing over the stump of the tree, and disposing of the remains as directed by the Project Arborist.
32. Trenching - any excavation, whether to provide irrigation, install foundations, lay utility lines, pipe, drainage or other property improvements below grade. Trenching within the TPZ is injurious to roots and tree health and is prohibited, unless approved in writing by the project arborist.
