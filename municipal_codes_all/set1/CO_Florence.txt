PREFACE 
    The Florence Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1976, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of William G. Cox, borough manager. 
    Beginning with Supplement 12, 1-09, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this Code current by regular supplementation. 
    The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 12, 1-09, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance 02-04-2019A, passed March 4, 2019.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This Code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this Code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This Code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this Code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this Code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 12, 1-09, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    As of Supplement No. 12, 1-09, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 12, 1-09, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 12, 1-09, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, the pages of this Code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. 12, 1-09, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM. Electronic files enable us not only to get you your code more quickly but also ensure that it is error-free.

    Signatures need not be all on the same page of paper but if more than one page is necessary they must be securely fastened, and the ground or grounds must be read by the signers each separately, and the signer must subscribe after his name the date of his signing and the number or place of his residence, and he must sign the same of his own free and voluntary act and without intimidation, payment or promise of reward, and the person circulating such petition must make and subscribe an oath on each sheet of signatures thereof, that the signatures thereon are genuine, and a false oath, wilfully so made and subscribed by such person, shall be perjury, and be punished as such.

(Ord. 6-95 (part), 1995). 
2.52.020 - Scope and definitions. 
A.  The Colorado Governmental Immunity Act (the "Act") provides that the City, under certain circumstances, must assume the cost of defending its employees and paying judgments and settlements against its employees. This policy implements the provisions of the Act and applies to the same extent as the Act. This policy also applies to claims brought under federal law as provided by the Act.

(Ord. 6-95 (part), 1995). 
2.52.030 - Policy. 
    Cost of Defense. The City shall be liable for the reasonable costs, including reasonable attorney's fees, of the defense of an employee against a claim if: 
A.  The City Attorney determines that the claim arose out of injuries sustained from an act or omission of the employee occurring or alleged in the complaint to have occurred during the performance of the employee's duties and within the scope of the employee's employment with the City; and 
B.  The City Attorney determines that the employee's act or omission was not willful or wanton; and 
C.  The employee does not compromise or settle the claim without the written consent of this City Council; and 
D.  The employee provided written notice to the City Council, through the City Attorney, of the incident or occurrence which led to the claim, within a reasonable time after the incident or occurrence, if the incident or occurrence could reasonably have been expected to lead to a claim; and 
E.  In the case of an action to which the City is not a party defendant, the employee provided written notice to the City Council, through the City Attorney, of existence of the action against the employee within fifteen (15) days after the commencement of the action. 
(Ord. 6-95 (part), 1995). 
2.52.040 - Legal representation for employee.

Nothing herein shall prohibit an employee from retaining the services of his or her own attorney, but, except as otherwise provided in Section 2.52.090, the fees and costs of those services shall be borne solely by the employee. 
(Ord. 6-95 (part), 1995).

The City will, on the owners behalf, act as the owners agent to the manufacturer of the water meters and equipment to seek manufacturer warranty repair or replacement of that equipment installed, to minimize such cost to the owner. 
2.  The City will at all times supply all related equipment and material for connection to the municipal water system to maintain a uniform standard, except the customer's service line from the meter setting to the customer's point of use.

Additional valves, hydrants, and increased pipe diameters may be required, depending on the length of such main line extensions. If a service main is allowed, it shall include an isolation valve from the branch main and a means of flushing. 
B.  All owners, subdividers, contractors and builders shall submit to the City Manager detailed plans for any proposed utility installations which shall include capacities, sizes, location of mains, fittings, fire hydrants, tanks, pumps and pump houses, and the location of loopings and grids to existing City mains.

Every water main rebate agreement shall also provide that the City shall not be liable to the other party or parties to the agreement for any failure by the City to have collected the appropriate refund amount from a person connecting to the extended or enlarged water main, except that the City may be liable with respect to such refund amount if it is proven by clear and convincing evidence in a legal proceeding that such refund was not distributed after collection as a result of fraud. 
I.  Each party to any such agreement must provide to the City, prior to preparation and execution of the water main rebate agreement, his or her current address and give the City written notice of any change of address occurring during the term of the agreement. Funds collected by the City pursuant to a water main rebate agreement that are not claimed by the party entitled to receive such funds within one (1) year of the City's sending notice of the receipt of such funds to such party at the last known address of such party shall be forfeited to, and become the exclusive property of, the City. The last known address of any such party shall be the address stated in the agreement or the last address communicated to the City by the written notice of change of address required under this subsection. 
J.  All calculations of refunds to be collected by the City and distributed to any party or parties under a water main rebate agreement shall be made by the City Engineer under the following formula: 
Total costs of constructing a line 
Total linear feet of line constructed = Total price per foot Total Price per Foot 
2 = Price per foot of frontage  
Total line frontage of property to be served x Price per foot of frontage = Rebate Amount OR One-half of local engineer's per foot cost used in estimating x Total line frontage of property to be served = Rebate Amount Whichever figure is lower.  
    For purposes of the above calculation, total cost shall not include equipment depreciation, interest on borrowed money, or labor overtime. Calculations of refund amounts shall be based upon the length of frontage of the property of any water user receiving new service from whom rebate amounts are collectable whose property abuts the right-of-way or easement containing the extended or enlarged water main. 
K.  Water main rebate agreements are assignable by the developer with the written consent of the City Council, which consent shall not be unreasonably withheld. Such assignment shall be in writing and subscribed to by the developer and the City.

(Ord 2-88 § 1(part), 1988).

Chapter 17.60 - SPECIAL USE REVIEW 

17.60.010 - Purpose. 
    Although each zoning district is primarily intended for a predominate type of use (such as dwellings in residential districts), there are a number of uses which may or may not be appropriate in a particular district depending upon, for example, the location, nature of the proposed use, character of surrounding development, traffic capacities of adjacent streets and potential environmental effects.

1.  Loading berth capacity shall not be reduced nor eliminated during alteration or adding to an existing use when such facilities are needed. 
2.  Discontinuance of loading berths by a previous use shall not prevent the Building Inspector from requiring a new occupant to provide them if the new use requires such facilities.

At the time of erection of a new structure, addition to or enlargement of an existing structure (if the addition or enlargement exceeds fifty (50) percent of the floor area of the structure), or a change in use, within any district in the City, an adequate sidewalk must be provided at the sole cost of the developer of the parcel. 
B.  The sidewalk(s) must be shown on the site plan or parking plan as outlined in Section 17.68.030(G) of this chapter. 
C.  If there is an existing sidewalk on the property, or between the street surfacing and the parcel's front property line, or front and side property lines if a corner lot, the developer must obtain written approval from the City's Public Works Director to verify the adequacy of that sidewalk.

(Ord. 8-2005 § 2, 2005). 
17.68.030 - Supplementary requirements. 
A.  Requirements of off-street parking and loading shall be as follows: 
1.  The provision and maintenance of off-street parking and loading spaces is a continuing obligation of the property owner, his heirs and assigns. No building permit or occupancy permit shall be issued until plans are presented that show property is and will remain available for exclusive use as off-street parking and loading space. The subsequent use of property for which the building permit is issued shall be conditional upon the unqualified continuance and availability of the amount of parking and loading space required by this title. 
2.  Should the owner or occupant of any lot or building change the use of said lot or building, thereby increasing off-street parking or loading requirements, it shall be unlawful and a violation of this chapter to begin or maintain such altered use until such time as the increased off-street parking or loading requirements are complied with. 
B.  Requirements for types of buildings and uses not specifically listed herein shall be determined by the Board of Adjustment, after a report and recommendation from the Planning Commission based upon the requirements of comparable uses listed herein. 
C.  In the event several uses occupy a single structure or parcel of land, the total requirements for off-street parking shall be the sum of the requirements of the several uses computed separately. 
D.  If approved by the City Council, owners of two (2) or more uses, structures or parcels of land may agree to utilize jointly the same parking and loading spaces when the hours of operation do not overlay, provided that satisfactory legal evidence is presented to the Building Inspector in the form of deeds, leases, or contracts to establish the joint use. 
E.  Off-street parking spaces for dwellings shall be located on the same lot with the dwelling. For uses other than dwelling units required parking spaces shall be located not farther than three hundred (300) feet from the building or use they are required to serve, measured in a straight line from the building. 
F.  Required parking spaces shall be available for the parking of operable passenger automobiles of residents, customers, patrons, and employees only, and shall not be used for storage of vehicles or materials or for the parking of trucks used in conducting the business or use. 
G.  A plan, drawn to a scale of one (1) inch equals two hundred (200) feet, indicating how the sidewalk and off-street parking and loading requirements are to be fulfilled shall accompany an application for a building permit. The plan shall show all elements necessary to indicate that the requirement is being fulfilled, including but not limited to the following: 
1.  Delineation of adequate sidewalks and individual parking and loading spaces, including pavement/surfacing type; 
2.  Circulation area necessary to serve spaces; 
3.  Access to streets and property to be served; 
4.  Curb cuts; 
5.  Turning radii; 
6.  Designation of handicapped spaces; 
7.  Existing top of curb elevation; 
8.  Proposed grades on paving (existing and proposed). 
H.  The parking plan for all commercial, industrial and multifamily projects shall be approved by the Planning Commission. The plan shall not be deemed approved until signed by the Planning Commission and City Manager. Paring plans submitted for residential building permits for one (1) single-family or one (1) duplex dwelling unit will not require approval by the Planning Commission. Projects proposing to use a platted alley for ingress, egress and loading areas will require a notice to all property owners immediately adjacent to the alley proposed for use as access. Notification shall be done by U.S. Mail not later than seven (7) days prior to the Planning Commission meeting when such parking plan shall be reviewed. 
I.  Design requirements for parking lots: 
1.  A minimum of two hundred (200) square feet (e.g., ten (10) feet by twenty (20) feet) shall be provided for each vehicle within an off-street parking space. 
2.  Areas used for parking and maneuvering of vehicles must be paved with concrete or asphalt unless a variance is granted by the Florence Board of Zoning Adjustments. The Board may waive concrete or asphalt paving for projects in the I-1 and I-2 industrial zone districts, or if the public street fronting on the property is unpaved and is not projected for paving within five (5) years from the date of the project's completion. A drainage plan prepared and sealed by a Colorado-registered engineer shall be submitted with the parking plan for all on-site areas proposed for paved surfacing. The engineered drainage plan shall include the following minimum items: 
a.  A site plan, drawn to scale, that shows the parcel boundaries, surrounding and on-site streets and drainage facilities, existing and proposed structures, parking, loading and travel areas, with dimensions; 
b.  A narrative report stating the pertinent assumptions, design criteria, dimensions and volume of all detention and retention basins, slope and flow area of drainage features, and historical and design discharge rates; 
c.  Supporting information and calculations; 
d.  The booklet entitled "Storm Drainage Design Criteria and Drainage Policies for City of Pueblo, Colorado" is an acceptable standard of quality for the engineered drainage plan; 
e.  Stormwater runoff shall not be released from developments at a rate greater than the five-year historic runoff. The amount of runoff to be detained on-site shall be the difference between the one hundred-year runoff under developed conditions and the five-year historic runoff. This includes runoff from the crown of adjacent streets whether they are existing or proposed streets. In all cases it should be assumed that detention is required unless proven otherwise, such as when adequate outfall to a major drainageway is available to discharge one hundred-year flows; 
f.  The drainage plan shall not be deemed approved until written approval is granted by the City Manager, based upon review comments from the City Engineer; 
g.  Engineered drainage plans are not required for one (1) single-family dwelling or one (1) duplex dwelling unit for any commercial or industrial paved area of one thousand (1,000) square feet or less. 
J.  Completion Time for Parking Lots. Required parking spaces shall be improved as required and made available for use before the final inspection is completed by the City Manager. An extension of time may be granted by the Building Inspector providing a performance bond, an irrevocable letter of credit, or its equivalent, is posted equaling one and one-half (1.5) times the cost to complete the improvements as estimated by the City Manager, or his designated agent, provided the parking space is not required for immediate use. In the event the improvements are not completed within one (1) year's time, the irrevocable letter of credit, the bond, or its equivalent shall be forfeited and the improvement thenceforth constructed under the direction of the City.
