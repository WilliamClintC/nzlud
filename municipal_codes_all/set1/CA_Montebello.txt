MONTEBELLO MUNICIPAL CODE 1993 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of 
the City of Montebello, California 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 14, 
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 
  
PREFACE 
The Montebello, California Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1993, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc., its successor in interest. 
Beginning with Supplement No. 14, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this code current by regular supplementation. 
During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of Douglas Barnes, city attorney. 
The code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 14, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance No. 2414, passed March 27, 2019.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
Beginning with Supplement No. 14, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
As of Supplement No. 14, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
Beginning with Supplement No. 14 this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
Beginning with Supplement No. 14, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. The Instruction Sheet will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
When originally published, the pages of this code were consecutively numbered. As of Supplement No. 14, when new pages are inserted with amendments, the pages will follow a "Point Numbering System". (Example: 32, 32.1, 32.2, 32.2.1, 32.2.2., 33). Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) will be left unnumbered but the number will be "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM.

Chapter 1.14 - ADMINISTRATIVE FINES AND PENALTIES 
Sections: 
 
1.14.010 - Purpose and intent. 
A.  This chapter authorizes the imposition of administrative fines on any person who violates any provision of this code in order to encourage and obtain compliance with the provisions of this code for the benefit and protection of the entire city. This chapter governs the imposition, enforcement, collection and administrative review of all administrative fines imposed under the authority of California Government Code Section 53069.4 and the police power of the city. 
B.  The issuance of citations imposing administrative fines may be performed at the discretion of the officials of the city authorized hereunder. The issuance of a citation to any person constitutes but one remedy of the city to address violation of the code by any person and obtain immediate compliance. By adopting this chapter, the city does not intend to limit its authority to employ any other remedy, civil or criminal, to address any violation of this code by any person, which the city may otherwise pursue. 
C.  Every person who applies for and receives a permit, license, land use approval (e.g., subdivision map, conditional use permit, variance) or any other approval required by the city shall comply will all conditions imposed upon the issuance of such permit, license or approval. A violation of any condition of such permit, license or approval shall be subject to an administrative fine under the provisions of this chapter. Likewise, any person who fails to obtain any permit, license, land use approval or any other approval from the city when such a person is so required by this code shall be subject to an administrative fine pursuant to this chapter. 
D.  Because of the serious blighting conditions that result from persistent or prolonged failure to comply with the provisions of this code and the effect of such conditions on the desirability and marketability of surrounding properties and the adverse impacts on the public health, safety and welfare, this chapter imposes strict civil liability upon the owners of real property for all violations of this code existing on their real property.

(Ord. 2284 § 3 (part), 2005)  
1.14.040 - Administrative fines. 
A.  Each person who violates any provision of this code or who fails to comply with any condition imposed on any permit, license, land use approval or other approval issued under or pursuant to this code shall be subject to the imposition and payment of an administrative fine or fines as provided herein. Likewise, any person who fails to obtain any permit, license, land use approval or any other approval from the city when such a person is so required by the code shall be subject to an administrative fine under this chapter. 
B.  The amount of the applicable administrative fines for various violations shall be established by separate resolution of the city council. 
C.  In the case of a violation of the code that is a transient violation, a fine shall be imposed without an opportunity to cure or correct such violation, and the citee shall be required to abate the violation, if necessary, immediately. On the second and each subsequent time that a person is used a citation for the same violation in any twelve-month period, the fine shall be doubled, and the citee shall be liable for the amount of the fine until it is paid, in addition to being responsible for abating the violation. However, the code enforcement officer shall have discretion to issue a citation for any violation referred to in this subsection under the procedures set forth in subsection D of this section. 
D.  In the case of a violation of this code that is a nontransient violation, the code enforcement officer may grant a responsible person or citee a reasonable period of time to correct the violation or violations without incurring any liability to the city for the payment of such fine or fines. Such reasonable period of time shall depend on the nature of the violation and the amount of time needed to correct the violation. The reasonable period of time shall be provided to the responsible party or citee in writing. However, the director of the department that issued the citation may, in his or her sole discretion, extend such period for up to thirty additional days; provided that the violation is of such a nature that requires additional time to correct and the responsible party or citee demonstrates that he or she has made substantial progress to correct the violation or violations, that he or she has been diligent in correcting such violation or violations, and that he or she was unable to correct such violation or violations within the initial reasonable correction period. The responsible party or citee must submit a written request, within five business days of the issuance of the citation to such director seeking such an extension. The request shall contain a description of the corrections made, the corrections remaining to be made, the date when the violation or all of them shall be corrected, and the facts indicating why correcting the violation or violations is not possible or practicable within such initial correction period. The director of the department that issued the citation shall respond in writing within three business days of receipt of the request; and the decision of the director shall be final. Unless the responsible party or citee causes the correction of all of the violations described in the citation within the correction period or such other extended period as may have been granted, the fine or fines imposed by the citation shall become effective on the day following the expiration of the correction period or such other extended period as may have been granted and such fine or fines shall continue to accrue on a daily basis until such violation or violations have been corrected in compliance with the applicable city code provision. 
On the second and each subsequent time that a person is issued a citation for the same violation in any twelve-month period, the fine shall be effective immediately, without any waiting or correction period, and the responsible party or citee shall be liable for the amount of the fine until it is paid, in addition to being responsible for abating the violation. 
E.  All administrative fines imposed hereunder shall be made payable to the city. Payment of any fine or fines shall not excuse the citee from complying with the provision of the code so violated. The issuance of a citation or payment of any fine, or both, shall not bar the city from instituting any other enforcement action or remedy to obtain compliance with the provisions of the code so violated including the issuance of additional civil and/or criminal citations. In the event such other enforcement action includes a court action, and the citation has not been both appealed and resolved in the citee's favor, said court may include in any order issued by that court, an order or judgment requiring payment of any fines theretofore issued and unpaid. 
(Ord. 2291 § 1, 2006; Ord. 2284 § 3 (part), 2005)  
1.14.050 - Administrative hearing request. 
A.  Any citee may contest a citation issued to the citee and the proposed fine by filing a written request for an administrative hearing. To request a hearing, the citee shall sign and file the request form provided by the city clerk. The request form shall state the grounds for contesting the citation and/or the proposed fine. A citee may contest the citation and the proposed fine by denying that the citee owns, possesses, or controls the property where the violation exists, denying that the citee is responsible for the violation described in the citation, denying that a violation exists or existed, or proving that the violation was corrected within the period described in the citation or such further period granted by the applicable director. A citee may not raise any issue or defense at the hearing, or in any subsequent court action, that was not included on the request form. 
B.  To be effective, the request for an administrative hearing must be filed with the city clerk within five business days of the date the citation was issued. If the citee mails the request form, the request form shall be deemed filed with the city clerk on the date on which it is received in the office of the city clerk. Any reference in this chapter to the "city clerk" means the city clerk or his or her designee. 
C.  A citee who has requested an administrative hearing must deposit with the city the amount of the proposed fine to ensure his or her appearance at the hearing. A request for a hearing shall not be complete and shall not be accepted unless it is accompanied by the deposit required by this section. 
D.  Notwithstanding subsection C of this section, any citee who intended to request an administrative hearing and is financially unable to make the advance deposit of the fine or penalty as required herein, may file a request for an advance deposit hardship waiver. The citee shall complete an advance deposit hardship waiver form and return it to the city clerk or his or her designee along with the written request for hearing. The citee may request an advance deposit hardship waiver form by telephone, mail or in person, but shall be solely responsible for assuring its receipt, completing and returning it within the required time. The city clerk or his or her designee may waive the requirement of an advance deposit and issue the advance deposit hardship waiver only if the citee submits the required advance deposit hardship waiver form and includes a sworn affidavit and any supporting documents or materials demonstrating to the satisfaction of the city clerk or his or her designee that it would be a significant financial detriment on the citee to the deposit the full amount of the fine or penalty in advance of the hearing. The requirement for depositing the full amount of the fine or penalty shall be sustained unless or until the city clerk or his or her designee makes this determination. The city clerk's office shall serve written notice of the city clerk or his or her designee's determination on the hardship waiver by certified mail, return receipt requested. Service shall be deemed complete at the time the notice is deposited into the mail and addressed to the citee at the address indicated on the administrative hearing request form. The notice shall include a brief description of the reasons for the city clerk or his or her designee's determination to issue or not issue the advance deposit hardship waiver. The written determination of the city clerk or his or her designee shall be final. If the city clerk or his or her designee determines not to issue an advance deposit hardship waiver, the citee shall remit the deposit amount to the city clerk or his or her designee with ten days of service of that decision, or thirty calendar days from the date of the administrative decision. 
E.  In the event that the citee files a timely request a hearing, the city clerk shall immediately forward such request to the city manager who shall advise the citee by letter, no later than five days after receiving the citee's request for a hearing, of the date, time, and place set for the hearing. The hearing shall be set on a date that is no less than ten days and no more than forty-five days after the date of the notice. The city manager shall also advise the citee that the citee may review those writings in the city's files concerning the violation or violations for which the citation was issued and that the city intends to introduce such writing as the administrative hearing. Upon payment of the city's actual reproduction costs, the citee may have copies thereof. The failure of the citee to appear at the administrative hearing shall constitute a waiver of the citee's right to a hearing on the citation and any defense to the citation that the citee may have had, and the citee's deposit shall be forfeited without further action. 
(Ord. 2284 § 3 (part), 2005)  
1.14.060 - Conduct of administrative hearings. 
An administrative hearing conducted pursuant to this chapter shall comply with the following: 
A.  The hearing shall be conducted by an impartial hearing officer on the date, time and place specified in the citation. The hearing shall proceed solely on the issues or defenses raised in the request for a hearing filed by the citee and all matters not contested in said request shall be deemed admitted. 
B.  The city shall have the burden to establish the truth of any matter in the citation that has been contested by the citee by a preponderance of the evidence. The citation shall be admitted into evidence and shall constitute prima facie evidence of all matters contained therein. In addition, the city may present such other evidence and reports as may be necessary or helpful to the hearing officer to resolve the issues raised by the citee. 
C.  The citee shall be given the opportunity to testify and to present written and oral evidence relevant to the matters raised in the request regarding the violation or violations described in the citation. 
D.  The citation, and other reports prepared by the officer issuing the citation, or at his or her request, concerning the violation or violations or their attempted correction shall be accepted by the hearing officer as prima facie evidence of the violation or violations. 
E.  The hearing shall be conducted informally and the rules of evidence need not be followed provided that the decision of the hearing officer on any material issue may not be based upon hearsay evidence alone. 
F.  The unexcused failure of the citee to appear at the hearing shall constitute a waiver of his or her contest to the citation and the proposed fine or fines and a failure to exhaust administrative remedies concerning the violation or violation described in the citation, and the citee's deposit shall be forfeited without further action. Such failure to appear shall constitute an admission of the truth of all matters contained in the citation and a validation of the fine or fines imposed in the citation, which shall be ordered in the decision of the hearing officer. 
(Ord. 2284 § 3 (part), 2005)  
1.14.070 - Administrative hearing officer and decisions. 
A.  The hearing officer shall be selected by the city manager and when the hearing officer selected is not an employee of the city, may be compensated for the time expended in providing such services based upon a written agreement for that purpose. The hearing officer's employment or compensation shall not be based on the number of citations affirmed or denied by the hearing officer. If the citee so elects in writing prior to the hearing, the citee shall be entitled to pay for one-half of the costs of the services of the hearing officer. 
B.  The hearing officer may continue the hearing on a citation upon the request of the citee, or other citee's representative, or the representative of the city, upon a showing of good cause. All continuance requests shall be made in person or in writing at or before the hearing. If the continuance is granted, a new hearing date shall be set within fifteen days. The citee shall deposit the amount of the estimated costs of the continued hearing as a condition of granting a continuance if the hearing is continued beyond the period that the citee is required to comply with the citation. The hearing officer shall have the authority to issue subpoenas. 
C.  After considering all the evidence and testimony submitted at the hearing, the hearing officer shall issue his or her written decision on the contested citation within five business days. The decision of the hearing officer shall, either uphold or deny the citation or any portion thereof and state the facts and reasons supporting the decision. If the citation is upheld, the hearing officer shall also order the imposition of a fine in the amount stated in the citation, as well as any costs, and compliance with the code within five days or such time as the hearing officer deems reasonable. If the citation is denied, the hearing officer shall order the return of the deposited fine, which return shall occur within sixty days following the written order of the hearing officer. The written decision shall be filed with the city clerk and a copy thereof shall be mailed to the citee. 
D.  All decisions and orders of a hearing officer shall become final unless appealed by the citee as provided herein. 
(Ord. 2284 § 3 (part), 2005)  
1.14.080 - Judicial review. 
A.  The citee or the city may seek judicial review of the decision of the hearing officer by filing an appeal with the Superior Court within twenty calendar days after the citee or the city receives a copy of the decision in accordance with the provisions of California Government Code Section 53069.4. No appeal shall be permitted from a decision based upon the failure of the citee or the city to appear at the administrative hearing or upon any other waiver of the administrative hearing by the citee or the city. 
B.  If an appeal of any decision or order of a hearing officer that ordered the citee to pay any fine or fines, or costs, to the city is affirmed, in whole or part, the judicial officer hearing the appeal shall enter an order requiring the citee to pay such fine or fines, and any costs, to the city and said order on appeal shall constitute a money judgment in favor of the city against the citee. 
(Ord. 2284 § 3 (part), 2005)  
1.14.090 - Collection of fines. 
A.  Each final order of a hearing officer that establishes the amount if a fine or fines, or costs, payable by a citee to the city shall constitute a money judgment. Each such money judgment shall be enforceable pursuant to the general laws of the state of California. 
B.  Each final order of a hearing officer that establishes the amount of a fine or fines, and any costs, payable by a citee to the city shall also constitute a sister state judgment. To enforce any such sister state judgment, the city may apply for the entry of a judgment pursuant to Chapter 1 (commencing with Section 1710.10) of Title 11 of Part 3 of the Code of Civil Procedure. 
C.  In addition to any other remedy available to the city, the city may also request that the fine or fines, and any costs, imposed by an order of a hearing officer be collected as a lien or assessment against the property on which the violation or violations occurred by requesting the city council to adopt an appropriate resolution to record such lien or place the amount of said fine or fines, and any costs, on the Los Angeles County tax rolls for collection. For assessments, the resolution of the city council shall conform with the county of Los Angeles auditor/controller-recorder's policies and procedures for applying special assessments to the tax rolls. The following procedures shall apply to such liens or assessments: 
1.  A notice of proposed lien or assessment shall be served on the owner of the property in the same manner as the administrative citation that was served on the owner. The notice shall state the amount of the fine or fines, and any costs, sought to be imposed as a lien or assessment, the legal description of the property on which the lien or assessment is sought to be imposed and the owner's right to appeal said proposed action by filing a written appeal within ten days from the date of service or mailing of said notice. The notice shall warn the owner that a failure to file a written appeal with the city clerk within said ten-day period shall constitute a waiver of the owner's right to appeal the imposition of the proposed lien or assessment on the owner's property. If the city council, by resolution, adopts a fee to defray the expenses to process and conduct a hearing on said appeal, the notice also shall state the amount of the fee and payment of the fee is a condition precedent to the effectiveness of the owner's right to appeal. 
2.  Within ten days from the date of service or mailing of said notice, the property owner may file a written appeal to the proposed lien or assessment and any shall deposit required fee with the city clerk or his or her designee or waive the right to such an appeal. The city council shall hear the appeal at its first regular meeting that is at least fourteen calendar days after the date on which the appeal was filed. Written notice of the hearing date shall be served on the owner, at least, ten days prior to the hearing on the appeal. At the hearing on the appeal, the city council shall consider the order of the hearing officer imposing the fine or fines on the citee, the computation of the amount of the proposed lien or assessment, the evidence that the owner owns the property on which the lien or assessment is sought to be imposed, evidence that the record owner of the property on which the lien or assessment is sought has been served with the citation in accordance with this chapter, and evidence that the violation or violations supporting the order of the hearing officer occurred at or was related to the property on which the assessment lien is sought to be imposed. At the conclusion of the hearing, the city council may adopt, or decline to adopt, a resolution to place a lien or assessment on the property of the owner. The city council also may modify the amount of the proposed lien or assessment. The decision of the city council shall be final. 
3.  If no appeal is filed pursuant hereto, the city manager shall also cause the preparation and submittal of a resolution to the city council that imposes a lien or assessment on the property of the owner. The city council shall adopt the proposed resolution unless it determines that such a lien or assessment would not be appropriate. 
4.  The tax collector's power of sale shall not be affected by the failure of the property owner to receive notice. The assessment may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes are collected, and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary municipal taxes. All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of municipal taxes shall be applicable to the special assessment. However, if any real property to which the citation relates has been transferred or conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for value, or if a lien of a bona fide encumbrancer for value has been created and attaches thereon, prior to the date on which the first installment of the taxes would become delinquent, then the amount shall not result in a lien against the real property but instead shall be transferred to the unsecured roll for collection. 
D.  Notwithstanding any of the remedies for collection of unpaid fines contained in this section, the city manager is authorized to enter into agreements with responsible parties or citees for the payment of fines and penalties over a fixed term upon terms that are acceptable to the city manager.

The city manager shall give written notice of such demotion to each employee to be demoted, such order of demotion shall be effective on the thirtieth day after the giving of such notice. If within ten days after the giving of such notice, an employee files with the city manager a written statement declining such demotion, that employee's service with the city shall be terminated effective the thirtieth day after the giving of such notice.

If more than one employee holds such a position, all employees holding the position shall be ranked based on their length of service with the city; an order of termination shall be given as to the employee or employees having the lesser lengths of service in the position.

Where an employee holding a position, which is ranked last in a family of positions, is preempted such position by reason of the demotion process, he shall, upon the thirtieth day after the giving of notice thereof, be terminated from the city's service. 
F.  Reemployment List. An employee who is demoted to a lesser position, or who is terminated by reason of a reduction in force accomplished pursuant to this section, shall, automatically, have his name placed on a reemployment list for the position which he formerly held.

To adopt a sales and use tax ordinance which can be administered in a manner that will, to the degree possible consistent with the provisions of Part 1.5 of Division 2 of the Revenue and Taxation Code, minimize the cost of collecting city sales and use taxes and at the same time minimize the burden of record keeping upon persons subject to taxation under the provisions of this chapter.

Chapter 3.40 - TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX 
Sections: 
 
3.40.010 - Title. 
The tax levied by this chapter shall be known as the "transient occupancy tax." 
(Prior code § 6630)  
3.40.020 - Definitions. 
Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions contained in this section shall govern the construction of this chapter: 
"Hotel" means any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied, or intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodging house, rooming-house, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, mobile home or house trailer at a fixed location, or other similar structure or portion thereof. 
"Occupancy" means the use or possession, or the right to the use or possession of any room or rooms or portion thereof, in any hotel for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes. 
"Operator" means the person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his or her functions through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for purposes of this chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his or her principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both. 
"Person" means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate, or any other group or combination acting as a unit. 
"Rent" means the consideration charged, whether or not received for occupancy of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and property and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever. 
"Tax administrator" means the license collector of the city. 
"Transient" means any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other agreement for a period of thirty consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of thirty days has expired unless there is an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy. In determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date of this chapter may be considered. 
(Prior code § 6631)  
3.40.030 - Tax imposed. 
A.  For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to, and shall pay, a tax in the amount of thirty-seven percent of the rent charged by the operator. The tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the city, which is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the city. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient's ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the tax administrator may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the tax administrator. 
B.  The tax imposed by this section shall be increased or decreased annually as of July 1 of each calendar year, commencing on July 1, 1979, in an amount equal to the increase or decrease from the base index in the then latest available consumer price index, as prepared by the U.S. Department of Labor, Bureau of Statistics, for the Los Angeles-Riverside-Orange County area. The last index published for the month of June 1978 shall be deemed to be the base index for the purpose of this section.

A.  Any person as to whom, or any occupancy as to which, it is beyond the power of the city to impose the tax herein provided; 
B.  Any federal or state officer or employee when on official business; 
C.  Any officer or employee of a foreign government who is exempt by reason of express provision of federal law or international treaty.

The certificate shall, among other things, state the following: 
A.  The name of the operator; 
B.  The address of the hotel; 
C.  The date upon which the certificate was issued; and 
D.  The following statement: 
This Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate signifies that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of this part by registering with the Tax Administrator the purpose of collecting from transients the Transient Occupancy Tax and remitting said tax to the Tax Administrator. This certificate does not authorize any person to conduct any unlawful business or to conduct any lawful business in an unlawful manner, nor to operate a hotel without strictly complying with all local applicable laws, including but not limited to those requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or office of this City. This certificate does not constitute a permit. 
(Prior code § 6635)  
3.40.060 - Collection. 
Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this chapter to the same extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of rent charged, and each transient shall receive a receipt for payment from the operator. No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner hereinafter provided. 
(Prior code § 6634)  
3.40.070 - Reporting and remitting. 
Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following the close of each calendar quarter, or at the close of any shorter reporting period which may be established by the tax administrator, make a return to the tax administrator, on forms provided by him or her, of the total rents charged and received and the amount of tax collected for transient occupancies. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the tax administrator. The tax administrator may establish shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder if he or she deems it necessary in order to insure collection of the tax and he or she may require further information in the return. Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust for the account of the city until payment thereof is made to the tax administrator. 
(Prior code § 6636)  
3.40.080 - Recordkeeping. 
It shall be the duty of every operator liable for the collection and payment to the city of any tax imposed by this chapter, to keep and preserve, for a period of three years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of such tax as he or she may have been liable for collection of and payment to the city, which records the tax administrator shall have the right to inspect at all reasonable times. 
(Prior code § 6639)  
3.40.090 - Refunds. 
A.  Whenever the amount of any tax, interest or penalty has been overpaid or paid more than once, or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city under this chapter, it may be refunded as provided in subsection B of this section provided a claim in writing therefor, stating under penalty of perjury the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded, if filed with the tax administrator within three years of the date of payment. The claim shall be on forms furnished by the tax administrator. 
B.  An operator may claim a refund, or take as credit against taxes collected and remitted, the amount overpaid, paid more than once or erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner prescribed by the tax administrator that the person from whom the tax has been collected was not a transient; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to the transient or credited to rent subsequently payable by the transient to the operator. 
(Prior code § 6641)  
3.40.100 - Failure to collect and report tax. 
If any operator shall fail or refuse to collect the tax and to make, within the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of the tax or portion thereof required by this chapter, the tax administrator shall proceed in such manner as he or she may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to base his or her estimate of the tax due. As soon as the tax administrator shall procure such facts and information as he or she is able to obtain, upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by any operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, he or she shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by this chapter. In case such determination is made, the tax administrator shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at his or her last known place of address. Such operator may within ten days after the serving or mailing of such notice make application in writing to the tax administrator for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the tax administrator shall become final and conclusive, and immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the tax administrator shall give not less than five days' written notice, in the manner prescribed herein, to the operator to show cause, at a time and place fixed in the notice, why the amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing, the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing the tax administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen days unless an appeal is taken as provided in Section 3.40.110. 
(Prior code § 6638)  
3.40.110 - Appeals. 
Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the tax administrator with respect to the amount of such tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the city council by filing a notice of appeal with the city clerk within fifteen days of serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The council shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal, and the city clerk shall give five days' notice in writing thereof, to such operator at his or her last known place of address. The findings of the council shall be final and conclusive, and shall be served upon the appellant in the manner previously prescribed for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of notice. 
(Prior code § 6639)  
3.40.120 - Penalties and interest. 
A.  Original Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any portion of any tax imposed by this chapter, within the time required, shall pay a penalty of ten percent of the amount of the tax, in addition to the amount of the tax. 
B.  Continued Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any delinquent remittance on or before a period of thirty days following the date on which the remittance first became delinquent, shall pay a second delinquency penalty of ten percent of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax and the ten percent penalty first imposed. 
C.  Fraud. If the tax administrator determines that the nonpayment of any remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of twenty-five percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto in addition to the penalties stated in subsections A and B of this section. 
D.  Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the rate of one-half of one percent per month or fraction thereof on the amount of tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until paid. 
E.  Penalties Merged with Tax. Every penalty imposed and such interest as accrues under the provisions of this section shall become a part of the tax herein required to be paid. 
(Prior code § 6637)

A statement as to all grounds for appeal in sufficient detail to enable the city council to understand the nature of the controversy, however, a licensee/permittee may only challenge a summary suspension/revocation based upon the grounds for the suspension/revocation and not the license collector's determination that such grounds existed to the extent or degree that it creates an imminent peril to the public health, welfare, or safety;

The appellant shall be given an opportunity to testify and to present written and/or oral evidence relevant to the matters raised in the request for an appeal filed by the appellant, and shall have the right to examine and cross-examine any documents and witnesses presented by the city in support of the denial, suspension or revocation. The unexcused failure of the appellant to appear at the appeal hearing shall constitute a withdrawal of his/her request for an appeal hearing and the denial, suspension, or revocation as issued by the license collector shall be deemed final and binding; 
d.  Appeals hearings are to be conducted informally, and formal rules of evidence need not be followed; 
e.  Written notice of the city council's determination of whether to suspend, revoke, reinstate or conditionally reinstate the license and/or permit shall be issued to the appealing party within ten business days of the decision. The determination of the city council shall be final and conclusive;

Chapter 5.76 - ADULT BUSINESS LICENSING 
Sections:  
Article 1. - General 
 
5.76.010 - Purpose and intent. 
The purpose of this chapter is to regulate adult businesses to promote the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city of Montebello. The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually oriented materials. It is recognized that adult businesses have a serious deleterious effect upon adjacent areas, as well as the areas in which they are located. It is therefore the purpose of this chapter to establish standards for the conduct of adult businesses which will protect the public health, safety and welfare, preserve locally recognized values of community appearance, minimize the potential for nuisances related to the operation of adult businesses, and maintain local property values. 
In approving the licensing regulations contained in this chapter, the city council has reviewed detailed studies, reports and letters prepared by other jurisdictions and its own staff with respect to the detrimental social, health and economic effects on persons and properties surrounding adult businesses. These studies included Upland, California (1992); Garden Grove, California (1991); Tucson, Arizona (1990); Seattle, Washington (1989); Austin, Texas (1986); Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (1986); Indianapolis, Indiana (1984); Houston, Texas (1983); Beaumont, Texas (1982); Minneapolis, Minnesota (1980); Phoenix, Arizona (1979); Whittier, California (1978); Amarillo, Texas (1977); Cleveland, Ohio (1977); Los Angeles, California (1977); State of Minnesota, Attorney General Report (1989); Newport News, Virginia (1996); St. Paul, Minnesota (1987); Corpus Christi, Texas (1995); and National Law Center (1995) (collectively "studies"). The studies substantiate the adverse, secondary effects of adult businesses. 
A.  Based on the foregoing studies and the other evidence presented, the city council finds that: 
1.  Adult businesses are linked to increases in the crime rates in those areas in which they are located and that surround them; and 
2.  Both the proximity of adult businesses to sensitive land uses and the concentration of adult businesses tend to result in the blighting and downgrading of the areas in which they are located. 
3.  Unregulated adult businesses create serious public health concerns and hazards since the studies and cases demonstrate that such businesses have been linked to the spread of communicable and sexually-transmitted diseases. 
4.  Special regulation of adult businesses is necessary to ensure that their adverse secondary effects will not contribute to an increase in the crime rates or the blighting or downgrading of the areas in which they are located or surrounding areas. The need for special regulation is based on the recognition that adult businesses have serious objectionable operational characteristics, particularly when several of them are concentrated under certain circumstances or located in direct proximity to sensitive uses such as residential zones and uses, parks, schools, churches or day care centers. 
5.  It is the purpose and intent of these special regulations to prevent the establishment and operation of adult businesses in a manner that would create such adverse secondary effects. Thus, in order to protect and preserve the public health, safety, and welfare of the citizenry, especially minors, special regulations are necessary. 
6.  The protection and preservation of the public health, safety and welfare require that certain operational requirements for adult businesses also be imposed. 
B.  In adopting these regulations, the city council is mindful of legal principles relating to regulation of adult businesses and does not intend to suppress or infringe upon any expressive activities protected by the First Amendments of the United States and California Constitutions, but instead desires to enact reasonable time, place, and manner regulations that address the adverse secondary effects of adult businesses. The city council has considered decisions of the United States Supreme Court regarding adverse secondary effects and the local regulation of adult businesses, including but not limited to: Young v. American Mini Theaters, Inc., 427 U.S. 50 (1976) (Reh. denied 429 U.S. 873); Renton v. Playtime Theaters, 475 U.S. 41(1986) (Reh. denied 475 U.S. 1132); FW/PBS. Inc. v. Dallas, 493 U.S. 215 (1990); Barnes v. Glenn Theater, 501 U.S. 560 (1991), and City of Erie v. Paps A.M. (2000) 529 U.S. (2000 Daily Journal DAR 3255), United States Court of Appeals 9th Circuit decisions, including but not limited to: Topanga Press, et al. v. City of Los Angeles, 989 F.2d 1524 (1993); Kev, Inc. v. Kitsap County, 793 F.2d 1053 (9th Cir. 1986); Colacurcio v. City of Kent, 163 F.3d 545 (9th Cir. 1998), pet. For cert. Filed (1999); several California cases including but not limited to: Tily B. v. City of Newport Beach, 69 Cal. App. 4th 1 (1998); City of National City v. Wiener, 3 Cal. 4th 832 (1993); People v. Superior Court (Lucero) 49 Cal. 3d 14 (1989); and City of Vallejo v. Adult Books, et al., 167 Cal. App. 3d 1169 (1985); and other federal cases including Lakeland Lounge v. City of Jacksonville (5th Cir. 1992) 973 F.2d 1255, Hang On, Inc. v. Arlington (5th Cir. 1995) 65 F.3d 1248, Mitchell v. Commission on Adult Entertainment (3rd Cir. 1993) 10 F.3d 123, International Eateries v. Broward County (11th Cir. 1991) 941 F.2d 1157, and Star Satellite v. City of Biloxi (5th Cir. 1986) 779 F.2d 1074. 
C.  The city council hereby adopts each of the regulations contained in this chapter as a means to reasonably address the adverse secondary effects of adult businesses.

1.  The information presented in the application is inaccurate or false. Intentionally supplying inaccurate or false information shall be a violation of this chapter. 
2.  The application seeks authorization for tobacco retailing at a location for which this chapter prohibits issuance of tobacco retailer licenses. However, this subparagraph shall not constitute a basis for denial of a license if the applicant provides the city with documentation demonstrating by clear and convincing evidence that the applicant has acquired or is acquiring the location or business that was otherwise legally operating at the time of enactment of this chapter. 
3.  The application seeks authorization for tobacco retailing for a proprietor to whom this chapter prohibits a license to be issued. 
4.  The application seeks authorization for tobacco retailing that is prohibited pursuant to this chapter, (e.g., mobile vending), that is unlawful pursuant to this Code, or that is unlawful pursuant to any other law. 
B.  Should an application be denied for any of the foregoing reasons, the chief of police shall issue a written notice of decision to deny such application within fifteen days of receipt of a complete application stating the basis for such denial. 
C.  Within ten days of receipt of such decision, an applicant who is aggrieved by the decision declining to issue such permit may file a written letter of appeal along with the appeal fee as specified by the citywide user fees with the city manager, appealing the decision of the chief to the city manager. The letter of appeal shall briefly outline the basis for such appeal. The city manager upon receipt of such written letter of appeal, shall obtain from the chief all of the files applicable to the application.

The city manager shall affirm, reverse or modify, in whole or in part, the decision as rendered by the chief of police. The city manager shall, promptly, give written notice, to the applicant and any other person requesting the same, of his decision, together with the reasons therefore. The decision of the city manager shall be final and conclusive in the absence of an appeal to the city council as hereinafter provided. (Prior code § 4254 (part)) 
D.  Any applicant who is aggrieved by a decision of the city manager, as hereinbefore provided, shall have the right to appeal such decision to the city council. Such an appeal shall be perfected by the filing of a written letter of appeal, briefly stating the grounds therefore, with the city clerk, within ten days after the giving of notice of the city manager's decision. Upon receipt of a letter of appeal, the city clerk shall place the same on the city council's agenda at its next most convenient meeting. The city clerk shall give the applicant, and any other person requesting the same, ten days' written notice of the time and place of such hearing before the council. At such time and place, the city council shall hear the matter, and shall, thereafter, issue, conditionally issue, or decline to issue, the permit as requested. The city council shall give the applicant and any other interested person the right to present any relevant evidence bearing upon such appeal. The burden of proof shall be upon the applicant to show that the action of the city manager was arbitrary, capricious or outside the scope of authority granted to him by the provisions of the chapter. The decision of the city council shall be final and conclusive.

B.  Notwithstanding any other provision of this chapter, prior violations at a location shall continue to be counted against a location and license ineligibility periods shall continue to apply to a location unless: 
1.  The location has been fully transferred to a new proprietor or fully transferred to entirely new proprietors; and 
2.  The new proprietor(s) provide the city with clear and convincing evidence that the new proprietor(s) have acquired or is acquiring the location in an arm's length transaction. 
(Ord. No. 2335, § 2, 9-23-2009)  
5.80.090 - License conveys a limited, conditional privilege. 
Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to grant any person obtaining and maintaining a tobacco retailer's license any status or right other than the limited conditional privilege to act as a tobacco retailer at the location in the city identified on the face of the permit. For example, nothing in this chapter shall be construed to render inapplicable, supersede, or apply in lieu of, any other provision of applicable law, including but not limited to, any provision of this Code or any condition or limitation on smoking in an enclosed place of employment pursuant to California Labor Code section 6404.5. For example, obtaining a tobacco retailer license does not make the retailer a "retail or wholesale tobacco shop" for the purposes of California Labor Code section 6404.5.

C.  Appeal of Suspension and/or Revocation. The decision of the department is appealable to the city council and must be filed with the city clerk within ten days of receipt of the determination of violation. An appeal shall stay all proceedings in furtherance of the appealed action. 
D.  Revocation of License Wrongly Issued. A tobacco retailer's license shall be revoked if the department finds, after the licensee is afforded notice and an opportunity to be heard, that one or more of the bases for denial of a license under Section 5.80.060 existed at the time application was made or at any time before the license issued.

The decision by the department may be appealed pursuant to the procedures set forth in Section 5.80.120(C). Forfeited tobacco products and tobacco paraphernalia shall be destroyed after all internal appeals have been exhausted and the time in which to seek judicial review pursuant to California Code of Civil Procedure section 1094.6 or other applicable law has expired without the filing of a lawsuit or, if such a suit is filed, after judgment in that suit becomes final. 
C.  For the purposes of the civil remedies provided in this chapter:

B.  Abatement. If the city manager or designee is unable to make contact as hereinabove noted, or if the appropriate persons after notification do not take action within such time as may be specified, then the city manager or designee may take all actions deemed necessary to remove, repair or isolate such imminently dangerous condition or conditions, with the use of city forces or a contractor engaged by the city.

C.  Sweeping Litter Into Gutters Prohibited.

This section grants specific authority to any court of competent jurisdiction to grant an award of costs pursuant to law, and award attorney's fees pursuant to Section 1.12.050 of this code.

D.  Article X, Section 2 of the California Constitution declares that the general welfare requires that water resources be put to beneficial use, waste or unreasonable use or unreasonable method of use of water are to be prevented, and conservation of water is to be fully exercised with a view to the reasonable and beneficial use of available water supplies. 
E.  Article XI, Section 7 of the California Constitution declares that a city or county may make and enforce within its limits all local, police, sanitary, and other ordinances and regulations not in conflict with general laws. 
F.  California Water Code section 375 authorizes water suppliers to adopt and enforce a comprehensive water conservation program to reduce water consumption and conserve supplies. 
G.  The adoption and enforcement of a water conservation and supply shortage program is necessary to manage the City of Montebello's potable water supply in the short and long-term and to avoid or minimize the effects of drought and shortage within the City of Montebello. Such a program is essential to ensure a reliable and sustainable minimum supply of water for the public health, safety and welfare. 
(Ord. No. 2333, § 1, 7-22-2009)  
8.29.030 - Declaration of purpose and intent. 
A.  The purpose of this chapter is to replace Chapter 8.28 and to establish a water conservation and supply shortage program that will reduce water consumption within the City of Montebello through conservation, enable effective water supply planning, assure reasonable and beneficial use of water, prevent waste of water, and maximize the efficient use of water within the City of Montebello to avoid and minimize the effect and hardship of water shortage to the greatest extent possible. 
B.  This chapter establishes permanent water conservation standards intended to alter behavior related to water use efficiency at all times and further establishes three levels of water supply shortage response actions to be implemented during times of declared water shortage or declared water shortage emergency, with increasing restrictions on water use in response to worsening drought or emergency conditions and decreasing supplies.

8.36.110 - Control of pollutants from new developments/redevelopment projects. 
A.  Objective. The provisions of this section establish requirements for construction activities and facility operations of development and redevelopment projects to comply with the current municipal NPDES permit, lessen the water quality impacts of development by using smart growth practices, and integrate LID practices and standards for stormwater pollution mitigation through means of infiltration, evapotranspiration, biofiltration, and rainfall harvest and use. LID shall be inclusive of new development and/or redevelopment requirements. 
B.  Scope. This section contains requirements for stormwater pollution control measures in development and redevelopment projects and authorizes the city to further define and adopt stormwater pollution control measures, and to develop LID principles and requirements, including but not limited to the objectives and specifications for integration of LID strategies, grant waivers from the LID requirements, and collect funds for projects that are granted waivers. Except as otherwise provided herein, the city shall administer, implement and enforce the provisions of this section. 
C.  Applicability. Development projects subject to permittee conditioning and approval for the design and implementation of post-construction controls to mitigate stormwater pollution, prior to completion of the project(s), are: 
(1)  All development projects equal to one acre or greater of disturbed area that adds more than ten thousand square feet of impervious surface area.

(6)  Parking lots with five thousand square feet or more of impervious surface area, or with twenty-five or more parking spaces. 
(7)  Streets and roads construction projects with construction costs greater than five hundred thousand dollars and add at least ten thousand square feet or more of impervious surface area. Street and road construction applies to standalone streets, roads, highways, and freeway projects, and also applies to streets within larger projects. 
(8)  Automotive service facilities (Standard Industrial Classification (SIC) of 5013, 5014, 5511, 5541, 7532-7534 and 7536-7539) 5,000 square feet or more of surface area. 
(9)  Projects located in or directly adjacent to, or discharging directly to an environmentally sensitive area (ESA) (as defined in California Public Resources Code Section 30107.5), where the development will: 
a.  Discharge stormwater runoff that is likely to impact a sensitive biological species or habitat; and 
b.  Create two thousand five hundred square feet or more of impervious surface area 
(10)  Single-family hillside homes. 
(11)  Redevelopment projects. 
a.  Land disturbing activity that results in the creation or addition or replacement of five thousand square feet or more of impervious surface area on an already developed site on planning priority project categories. 
b.  Where redevelopment results in an alteration to more than fifty percent of impervious surfaces of a previously existing development, and the existing development was not subject to post-construction stormwater quality control requirements, the entire project must be mitigated. 
c.  Where redevelopment results in an alteration of less than fifty percent of impervious surfaces of a previously existing development, and the existing development was not subject to post-construction stormwater quality control requirements, only the alteration must be mitigated, and not the entire development. 
d.  Redevelopment does not include routine maintenance activities (as defined in Section 8.36.020) or emergency redevelopment activity required to protect public health and safety. Impervious surface replacement, such as the reconstruction of parking lots and roadways which does not disturb additional area and maintains the original grade and alignment, is considered a routine maintenance activity. Redevelopment does not include the repaving of existing roads to maintain original line and grade. 
e.  Existing single-family dwelling and accessory structures are exempt from the redevelopment requirements unless such projects create, add, or replace ten thousand square feet of impervious surface area. 
D.  Effective Date. The planning and land development requirements contained in Section 7 of Part VI.D of the municipal NPDES permit shall become effective ninety days from the adoption of the order (February 6, 2013). This includes planning priority projects that are discretionary permit projects or project phases that have not been deemed complete for processing, or discretionary permit projects without vesting tentative maps that have not requested and received an extension of previously granted approvals within ninety days of adoption of the order. Projects that have been deemed complete within ninety days of adoption of the order are not subject to the requirements [in] Section 7. 
E.  Specific Requirements. The site for every planning priority project shall be designed to control pollutants, pollutant loads, and runoff volume to the maximum extent feasible by minimizing impervious surface area and controlling runoff from impervious surfaces through infiltration, evapotranspiration, bioretention and/or rainfall harvest and use. 
(1)  A new single-family hillside home development shall include mitigation measures to: 
a.  Conserve natural areas; 
b.  Protect slopes and channels; 
c.  Provide storm drain system stenciling and signage; 
d.  Divert roof runoff to vegetated areas before discharge unless the diversion would result in slope instability; and 
e.  Direct surface flow to vegetated areas before discharge, unless the diversion would result in slope instability. 
(2)  Street and road construction projects with construction costs greater than five hundred thousand and add at least ten thousand square feet or more of impervious surface shall follow USEPA guidance regarding Managing Wet Weather with Green Infrastructure: Green Streets (December 2008 EPA-833-F-08-009) to the maximum extent practicable. 
(3)  The remainder of planning priority projects shall prepare a LID plan to comply with the following: 
a.  Retain stormwater runoff onsite for the stormwater quality design volume (SWQDv) defined as the runoff from: 
i.  The eighty-fifth percentile twenty-four-hour runoff event as determined from the Los Angeles County 85th percentile precipitation isohyetal map; or 
ii.  The volume of runoff produced from a three-quarter-inch, twenty-four-hour rain event, whichever is greater. 
b.  Minimize hydromodification impacts to natural drainage systems as defined in Order No. R4-2012-0175. 
c.  To demonstrate technical infeasibility, the project applicant must demonstrate that the project cannot reliably retain one hundred percent of the SWQDv on-site, even with the maximum application of green roofs and rainwater harvest and use, and that compliance with the applicable post-construction requirements would be technically infeasible by submitting a site-specific hydrologic and/or design analysis conducted and endorsed by a registered professional engineer, geologist, architect, and/or landscape architect. Technical infeasibility may result from conditions including the following: 
i.  The infiltration rate of saturated in-situ soils is less than 0.3 inch per hour and it is not technically feasible to amend the in-situ soils to attain an infiltration rate necessary to achieve reliable performance of infiltration or bioretention BMPs in retaining the SWQDv onsite. 
ii.  Locations where seasonal high groundwater is within five to ten feet of surface grade; 
iii.  Locations within one hundred feet of a groundwater well used for drinking water; 
iv.  Brownfield development sites or other locations where pollutant mobilization is a documented concern; 
v.  Locations with potential geotechnical hazards; 
vi.  Smart growth, infill, specific plans, or redevelopment locations where the density and/or nature of the project would create significant difficulty for compliance with the onsite volume retention requirement. 
d.  If partial or complete onsite retention is technically infeasible, the project site may biofiltrate one and one-half times the portion of the remaining SWQDv that is not reliably retained onsite. Biofiltration BMPs must adhere to the design specifications provided in Order No. R4-2012-0175. Additional alternative compliance options such as offsite infiltration and groundwater replenishment projects may be available to the project site. The project site should contact the city of Montebello to determine eligibility. 
e.  The remaining SWQDv that cannot be retained or biofiltered onsite must be treated onsite to reduce pollutant loading. BMPs must be selected and designed to meet pollutant-specific benchmarks as required per Order No. R4-2012-0175. Flow-through BMPs may be used to treat the remaining SWQDv and must be sized based on a rainfall intensity of: 
i.  0.2 inches per hour, or 
ii.  The one year, one-hour rainfall intensity as determined from the most recent Los Angeles County isohyetal map, whichever is greater. 
F.  A multi-phased project may comply with the standards and requirements of this section for all of its phases by: (a) designing a system acceptable to the city and satisfying the standards and requirements of this chapter for the entire site during the first phase, and (b) implementing the standards and requirements of this chapter for each phase of development or redevelopment of the site during the first phase or prior to commencement of construction of a later phase, to the extent necessary to treat the stormwater from such later phase. For purposes of this section, "multi-phased project" shall mean any planning priority project implemented over more than one phase. The site of a multi-phased project shall include any land and water area designed and used to store, treat, or manage stormwater runoff in connection with the development of redevelopment, including any tracts, lots, or parcels of real property, whether developed or not, associated with, functionally connected to, or under common ownership or control with such development or redevelopment. 
G.  Additional Requirements. The site for projects not classified with general applicability listed in paragraph C of this section, but resulting in the creation or addition or replacement of five hundred square feet or more of impervious surface area shall be designed to control pollutants, pollutant loads, and runoff volume per requirements listed herein.

Chapter 9.40 - MULTIPLE POLICE RESPONSES 
 
9.40.010 - Findings and purpose. 
A.  Some events become loud and unruly to the point that they constitute a threat to the peace, health, safety, or general welfare of the public through excessive consumption of alcohol, and increased incidents of fighting, litter, noise and other conditions detrimental to the community. Further, police resources and personnel are routinely dedicated to specific locations in particular in response to a series of crimes and offenses. 
B.  The city is required to make multiple responses to such loud or unruly events, or repeated events, offenses, and crimes at a particular location, in order to restore and maintain the peace and protect public health, safety or general welfare. Such events diminish the quality of life in the city, create a burden on scarce city resources, and can result in police responses to regular and emergency calls being delayed and police protection to the rest of the city being reduced. Conditions resulting from such events thereby constitute a public nuisance subject to abatement by any means authorized by law. 
C.  In order to discourage the occurrence of repeated loud, unruly events and repeated crimes and offenses at particular locations, to reduce the detrimental effects of such events, and to ensure continued availability of resources to abate these nuisances, the city seeks to deter such violations by setting forth a mechanism for recovery of such nuisance abatement costs and penalties, as set forth in this chapter.

Any interested person requiring terminal or truck yard access for interstate trucks from the federally designated highway system shall submit an application, on a form provided by the city, together with such information as may be required by the director of public works and appropriate fees of the city. No such application shall be accepted unless a conditional use permit for a truck terminal or truck yard has been issued for the applicant's facility, if required under Title 17 of this code.

10.52.030 - Terminals and truck yards/routesPermitApplicationInvestigation. 
A.  Upon receipt of an application, the director of public works will cause an investigation to be made to ascertain whether or not the proposed terminal or truck yard facility meets the requirements for an interstate truck terminal. Upon approval of that designation, the director of public works will then determine the capability of the route requested and alternate routes, whether requested or not. Determination or route capability will include, without limitation, a review of the adequacy of turning radii and lane widths of ramps, intersections, highways and general traffic conditions such as site distance, speed, and traffic volumes. No access from a federally designated highway system will be approved without the concurrent approval of Caltrans.

10.52.060 - Truck routesRetrofitting. 
A.  If all feasible routes to a requested terminal or truck yard are found unsatisfactory by the director of public works, the applicant may request retrofitting of the deficiencies. All costs of engineering, construction and inspection will be the responsibility of the applicant. Except when retrofitting of deficiencies is within the jurisdiction of Caltrans, the actual construction will be performed by the city or by a contractor acceptable to it, and in all cases involving work on public property such work shall be subject to the competitive bidding requirements for public work projects established by state law. 
B.  When the work is to be done by the city, the applicant shall deposit with the city the estimated cost of retrofitting. Adjustments between the estimated and actual costs shall be made after completion of the work, and any difference between the actual and the estimated costs shall be billed or refunded to the applicant, as the case may be. When the work is to be done by the applicant, the applicant may file with the director of public works a statement detailing the actual cost of the retrofitting. 
C.  If at any time within five years from the date of completion of the retrofitting by the applicant, should any applicant seek terminal truck yard approval which would use the route upon which such retrofitting was accomplished, any such applicant's fee shall include that applicant's proportionate share of the retrofitting, as determined by the director of public works, which fee shall be disbursed by the city to the applicant who paid for the retrofitting as well as to any other applicant who contributed to the costs of retrofitting under this section. Nothing herein shall require the payment of a proportionate fee if the applicant doing the work failed to file the report with the director of public works required under subsection B of this section. 
(Ord. 2058 § 1 (part), 1991: prior code § 3204.22)

(Ord. 2058 § 1 (part), 1991: prior code § 3204.23)  
10.52.080 - Appeals.

Chapter 12.12 - STREET BANNERS 
Sections: 
 
12.12.010 - Purpose. 
Regulating the placement of street banners is required given the nature of the forum and the conflicting interest involved. The First Amendment interests of speakers who desire to use street banners to exercise expressive activity must be balanced against the privacy interests of residents in not being bombarded by political propaganda. The denial of access to political messages reflects the city's recognition that commuters and pedestrians exposed to political messages placed on banners over public thoroughfares are incapable of declining to receive those messages. Commuters and pedestrians exposed to political street banners are not like the passerby who may be offered a pamphlet on the street but who cannot be made to take it. Furthermore, the city's interest on avoiding the reality an appearance of government favoritism or entanglement with a particular viewpoint is served by excluding political messages on street banners. Limiting access to Montebello-based nonprofit service groups and charitable health and welfare agencies serves to promote the city's interest in maximizing private support of social programs that may otherwise have to be supported by government funds. The city does not intend to create a public forum by its granting of selective access to public service groups. Nothing in this chapter shall be interpreted or used to foreclose other alternative channels of communication for political expression.

The fee required by this section may be waived by the building official if he finds that the applicant is an organization which would be exempt from the payment of the city business license pursuant to Section 5.04.060.

At the time and place set for the city council hearing upon such an appeal, the city council shall consider any applicable staff report or other pertinent material concerning such decision appealed from; the hearing in such case need not be a formal public hearing as is required in zoning cases, but the city council shall give the appealing party and any other interested person a reasonable opportunity to be heard and present relevant evidence.

(Ord. 2097 § 1 (part), 1994)  
12.17.080 - Grounds for denial of application for a special event permit. 
A.  The city manager shall approve an application for a special event permit unless he/she determines from a consideration of the application, or other pertinent information, that: 
1.  Information contained in the application, or supplemental information requested from the applicant, is found to be false in any material detail. 
2.  The applicant fails to complete the application form after having been notified of the additional information or documents required. 
3.  The sole purpose of the event is advertising of any product, good, ware, merchandise or event, and is designed to be held solely for private profit. 
4.  Another special event permit application has been received prior in time, or had already been approved, to hold another special event at the same time and place requested by the applicant, or is so close in time and place as to cause undue traffic congestion, or the police department is unable to meet the needs for police services for both special events. 
5.  The time, route or size of the special event will substantially interrupt the safe and orderly movement of traffic contiguous to the event site or route, or disrupt the use of a street at a time when it is usually subject to great traffic congestion. 
6.  The concentration of persons, animals and vehicles at the site of the special event, or the assembly and disbanding areas around the special event, will prevent proper police, fire or ambulance services to areas contiguous to the special event. 
7.  The size of the special event will require diversion of so great a number of police officers of the city to insure that participants stay within the boundaries or route of the special event, or to protect participants in the special event, as to prevent normal protection to the rest of the city. Nothing herein authorizes denial of a permit when additional peace officers would be available to the city under applicable state law and mutual aid plans, if requested by the city in advance of the special event. Nothing herein authorizes denial of a permit because of the need to protect participants from the conduct of others, if reasonable permit conditions can be imposed to allow for adequate protection of special event participants with the number of police officers available to police the special event. 
8.  The special event, if moving along a route, will not move from its point of origin to its point of termination in three hours or less. 
9.  The location of the special event will substantially interfere with any construction or maintenance work scheduled to take place upon or along the city streets, or a previously granted encroachment permit. 
10.  The special event shall occur at a time when a school is in session at a route or location adjacent to the school or class thereof, and the noise created by the activities of the special event would substantially disrupt the educational activities of the school or class thereof. 
B.  When the grounds for denial of an application for permit specified in subsections (A)(4) through (A)(10) of this section can be corrected by altering the date, time, duration, route or location of the special event, the city manager shall instead of denying the application conditionally approve the application upon the applicant's acceptance of conditions for permit issuance. The conditions imposed shall provide for only such modification of the applicant's proposed special event as are necessary to achieve compliance with subsections (A)(4) through (A)(10) of this section. 
(Ord. 2097 § 1 (part), 1994)  
12.17.090 - Permit conditions. 
The city manager may condition the issuance of a special event permit by imposing reasonable requirements concerning the time, place and manner of the special event, and such requirements as are necessary to protect the safety or persons and property, and the control of traffic; provided such conditions shall not unreasonably restrict the right of free speech.

A.  Granting of Variance. Before any variance hereunder is approved, the applicant must show to the satisfaction of the city council the existence of all the following facts: 
1.  That there are exceptional or extraordinary circumstances or conditions which apply to the proposed or existing building or structure by reason of its type of construction or proposed usage, which do not generally apply to other buildings or structures; 
2.  That without the granting of such a variance the proposed or existing building or structure cannot be accommodated by reason of the building regulations imposed by the code; 
3.  That the granting of the variance will not constitute a special privilege nor will the building or structure be structurally inadequate or hazardous nor will it constitute a fire hazard; and 
4.  That the granting of such variance will be consistent with the purpose and intent of the provisions of the California Building Code. 
B.  Procedure. 
1.  A person desiring to obtain a variance from the provisions of the building regulations of this city shall file a written application therefore with the building official. The application shall be upon a form prepared by the building official and shall contain the following information:

The applicant shall have the burden of proof to show that all of the facts required by subsection B of this section are present and apply to his application. Based upon the evidence presented, and any applicable staff reports submitted, the city council shall approve, conditionally approve, or deny such application. If the council finds such facts are present, it shall approve the variance. 
2.  Such approval may be conditioned so as to render the construction or reconstruction consistent with the purpose of the building regulations, and compatible with adjacent and surrounding uses. If such facts are found not to exist the application shall be denied.

15.36.030 - Purpose. 
A.  The purpose of this chapter is to promote public safety and welfare by reducing the risk of death or injury that may result from the effects of earthquakes on unreinforced masonry bearing wall buildings constructed before 1934. Such buildings have been widely recognized for their sustaining of life hazardous damage as a result of partial or complete collapse during past moderate to strong earthquakes. 
B.  The provisions of the ordinance codified in this chapter establish minimum standards for structural seismic resistance for the purpose of reducing risk of life loss or injury and will not necessarily prevent loss of life or injury or prevent earthquake damage to an existing building which complies with these standards. This chapter does not require existing electrical, plumbing, mechanical or fire safety systems to be altered unless they constitute a hazard to life or property. 
C.  This chapter provides systematic procedures and standards for identification and classification of unreinforced masonry bearing wall buildings based on their present use. Priorities, time periods and standards are also established under which these buildings are required to be structurally analyzed and anchored. Where the analysis determines deficiencies, this chapter requires the building be strengthened or demolished.

Alternate methods of testing may be approved by the Building Official. The quality of mortar in all masonry walls shall be determined by performing in-place shear tests or by testing eight (8) inch diameter cores. Alternative methods of testing may be approved by the Building Official. Nothing shall prevent pointing with mortar of all the masonry wall joints before the tests are first made. Prior to any pointing, the mortar joints must be raked and cleaned to remove loose and deteriorated mortar. Mortar for pointing shall be Type S or N except masonry cements shall not be used. All preparation and mortar pointing shall be done under continuous inspection of a registered deputy building inspector. At the conclusion of the inspection, the inspector shall submit a written report to the licensed engineer or architect responsible for the seismic analysis of the building setting forth the result of the work inspected. Such report shall be submitted to the Building Official for approval as part of the structural analysis. All testing shall be performed in accordance with the requirements specified in this subsection by a testing agency approved by the Building Official. An accurate record of all such tests and their location in the building shall be recorded and these results shall be submitted to the Building Official for approval as part of the structural analysis. 
(2) Number and Location of Tests. The minimum number of tests shall be two (2) per wall or line of wall elements resisting a common force, or one (1) per fifteen hundred (1,500) square feet of wall surface, with a minimum of eight (8) tests in any case. The exact test or core location shall be determined at the building site by the licensed engineer or architect responsible for the seismic analysis of the subject building. 
(3) In-Place Shear Tests. The bed joints of the outer width of the masonry shall be tested in shear by laterally displacing a single brick relative to the adjacent bricks in the width. The opposite head joint of the brick to be tested shall be removed and cleaned prior to testing. The minimum quality mortar in eighty (80) percent of the shear tests shall not be less than the total of thirty (30) psi plus the axial stress in the wall at the point of the test. The shear stress shall be based on the gross area of both bed joints and shall be that at which movement of the brick is first observed. 
(4) Core Tests. A minimum number of mortar test specimens equal to the number of required cores shall be prepared from the cores and tested as specified herein. The mortar joint of the outer with of the masonry core shall be tested in shear by placing the circular core section in a compression testing machine with the mortar bed joint rotated fifteen (15) degrees from the axis of the applied load. The mortar joint tested in shear shall have an average ultimate stress of twenty (20) psi based on the gross area. The average shall be obtained from the total number of cores made. The average shall be obtained from the total number of cores made. If test specimens cannot be made from cores taken then shear value shall be reported as zero. 
(f) TESTING OF SHEAR BOLTS. One-fourth (¼) of all new shear bolts and dowels embedded in unreinforced masonry walls shall be tested by a registered deputy building inspector using a torque calibrated wrench to the following minimum torques: 
One-half (½) inch diameter bolts or dowelsforty (40) foot-lbs. 
Five-eighths (?) inch diameter bolts or dowelsfifty (50) foot-lbs. 
Three-fourths (¾) inch diameter bolts or dowelssixty (60) foot-lbs. 
No bolts exceeding one-fourth (¼) inch shall be used. All nuts shall be installed over malleable iron or plate washers when bearing on wood, and heavy cut washers when hearing on steel. 
(g) DETERMINATION OF ALLOWABLE STRESSES FOR DESIGN METHODS BASED ON TEST RESULTS. 
(1) Design Shear Values. Design seismic in-place shear stresses shall be substantiated by tests performed as specified in Section 1613.10(e)(3) and (4). Design stresses shall be related to test results obtained in accordance with Table No. 23-U. Intermediate values between three (3) and ten (10) psi may be interpolated. 
(2) Design Compression and Tension Values. Compression stresses for unreinforced masonry having a minimum design shear value of three (3) psi shall not exceed one hundred (100) psi. Design tension values for unreinforced masonry shall not be permitted. 
(h) Five (5) percent of the existing rod anchors utilized as all or part of the required wall anchors shall be tested in pullout by an approved testing laboratory. The minimum number tested shall be four (4) per floor, with two (2) tests at walls with joist framing into the wall and two (2) tests at walls with joist parallel to the wall. The test apparatus shall be supported on the masonry wall of a minimum distance of the wall thickness from the anchor tested. The rod anchor shall be given a preload of three hundred (300) pounds prior to establishing a datum for recording elongation. The tension test load report shall be recorded at one-eighth (?) inch relative movement of the anchor and the adjacent masonry surface. Results of all tests shall be reported. The report shall include the test results as related to the wall thickness and joint orientation. The allowable resistance value of the existing anchors shall be forty (40) percent of the average of those tested anchors having the same wall thickness and joint orientation. 
(i) Qualification tests for devices used for wall anchorage shall be tested with the entire tension load carried on the enlarged head at the exterior face of the wall. Bond on the part of the device between the enlarged head and the interior wall face shall be eliminated for the qualification tests. The resistance value assigned the device shall be twenty (20) percent of the average of the ultimate loads.

Chapter 15.40 - FLOOD DAMAGE PREVENTION 
 
15.40.010 - Statutory authorization. 
The legislature of the state of California has in Government Code Sections 65302, 65560 and 65800, conferred upon local government units authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the city council of the city of Montebello does adopt the following floodplain management regulations. 
(Ord. 2174A § 1, 1998: prior code § 9001.1)  
15.40.020 - Findings. 
A.  The flood hazard areas of the city are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety and general welfare. 
B.  These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative effect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities also contribute to the flood loss. 
(Ord. 2174A § 2, 1998: prior code § 9001.2)  
15.40.030 - Purpose. 
It is the purpose of this chapter to promote public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by provisions designed to: 
A.  Protect human life and health; 
B.  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
C.  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
D.  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
E.  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
F.  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazards as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage; 
G.  Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and 
H.  Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. 
(Ord. 2174A § 3, 1998: prior code § 9001.3)  
15.40.040 - Content and provisions. 
In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes methods and provisions to: 
A.  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities; 
B.  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve as such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
C.  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channel, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters; 
D.  Control filling, grading, dredging, and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
E.  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert floodwaters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. 
(Ord. 2174A § 4, 1998: prior code § 9001.4)  
15.40.050 - Applicability. 
This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazards, and areas of mudslide (i.e., mudflow) hazards within the jurisdiction of the city. 
(Ord. 2174A § 5, 1998: prior code § 9003.1)  
15.40.060 - Definitions.

"Fraud and victimization" as related to Sections 15.40.280 through 15.40.300, variances, of this chapter, means that the variances granted must not cause fraud or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the city will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty to one hundred years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk damage from flood, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates. 
"Functionally dependent use" means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water.

The city requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. 
"Highest adjacent grade" means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of the structure. 
"Historic structure" means any structure that is: 
1.  Listed individually in the National Registry of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register;

a.  The wet floodproofing standard in Section 15.40.210C. 
b.  The anchoring standards in Section 15.40.190. 
c.  The construction materials and methods standards in Section 15.40.200. 
d.  The standards for utilities in Section 15.40.220. 
2.  For residential structures, all subgrade enclosed areas are prohibited as they are considered to be basements (see "basement"). This prohibition includes below-grade garages and storage areas. 
"Manufactured home" means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "recreational vehicle."

"Start of construction" includes substantial improvement and other proposed new development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty days from the date of the permit. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufacture home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparations, such as clearing, grading and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation of the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, floor, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building.

15.40.250 - Standards for recreational vehicles. 
All recreational vehicles placed on sites within Zones A1-30, AH and AE on the community's flood insurance rate map will either: 
A.  Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty consecutive days, and be fully licensed and ready for highway use (a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions), or 
B.  Meet the permit requirements of Sections 15.40.140 through 15.40.170 of this chapter and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes in Section 15.40.240A. 
(Ord. 2174A § 25, 1998: Ord. 2075 § 2 (part), 1992: prior code § 9005.5)  
15.40.260 - Floodways. 
Located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 15.40.080 are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of floodwaters which carry debris, potential projectiles and erosion potential, the following provisions apply: 
A.  Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvement, and other new development unless certification by a registered professional engineer or architect is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in [the base] flood elevation during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
B.  If subsection A of this section is satisfied, all new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Sections 15.40.180 through 15.40.270. 
(Ord. 2174A § 26, 1998: Ord. 2075 § 2 (part), 1992: prior code § 9005.6)  
15.40.270 - AR zone areas. 
Within areas designated as AR, AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/AO, or AR/A as established under Section 15.40.080, the following standards shall apply: 
A.  Developed Areas. All new construction in areas designated as developed areas shall meet the standards of Sections 15.40.180 through 15.40.270 using the lower of either the AR base flood elevation or the elevation that is three feet above the highest adjacent grade. 
B.  Areas Not Designated as Developed Areas. All new construction in areas that are not designated as developed areas: 
1.  Where the AR flood depth is equal to or less than five feet above the highest adjacent grade, shall meet the standards of Sections 15.40.180 through 15.40.270 using the lower of either the AR base flood elevation or the elevation that is three feet above the highest adjacent grade; or 
2.  Where the AR flood depth is greater than five feet above the highest adjacent grade, shall meet the standards of Sections 15.40.180 through 15.40.270 using the AR base flood elevation. 
C.  Dual Zone Areas. 
1.  All new construction in areas within Zone AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/AO, AR/A shall meet the standards of Sections 15.40.180 through 15.40.270 using the higher of either the applicable AR Zone elevation (as determined from subsections A or B of this section) or the base flood elevation (or flood depth) for the underlying A1-30, AE, AH, AO, or A Zone. 
2.  All substantial improvements to existing construction within Zones AR/A1-30, AR/AE, AR/AH, AR/AO, or AR/A shall meet the standards of Sections 15.40.180 through 15.40.270 using the base flood elevation (or flood depth) for the underlying A1-30, AE, AH, AO, or A zone. 
(Ord. 2174A § 27, 1998)  
15.40.280 - Nature of variances. 
A.  The variance criteria set forth in this section are based on the general principal of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristics must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners. 
B.  It is the duty of the city to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood ordinance are quite rare. The long-term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if the variances are strictly limited, Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. 
(Ord. 2174A § 28, 1998: Ord. 2075 § 6 (part), 1992: prior code § 9006.1)  
15.40.290 - VariancesAppeal board. 
A.  In passing upon requests for variances, the city shall consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and the: 
1.  Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
2.  Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
3.  Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property; 
4.  Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
5.  Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
6.  Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
7.  Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
8.  Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
9.  Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
10.  Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of use, and sediment transport of the floodwaters expected at the site; and 
11.  Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges. 
B.  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that: 
1.  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage; and 
2.  Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. It is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the county recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land. 
C.  The floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the federal insurance administration, federal emergency management agency. 
(Ord. 2174A § 29, 1998: Ord. 2075 § 6 (part), 1992: prior code § 9006.1 (part))  
15.40.300 - VariancesConditions. 
A.  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the procedures of Sections 15.40.140 through 15.40.270 of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
B.  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "historic structures" (as defined in Section 15.40.060 of this chapter) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
C.  Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
D.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the "minimum necessary" considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the city need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the city believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance. 
E.  Variances shall only be issued upon a: 
1.  Showing of good and sufficient cause; 
2.  Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional "hardship" (as defined in Section 15.40.060 of this chapter) to the applicant; and 
3.  Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance (as defined in Section 15.40.060 - see "Public safety or nuisance"), cause fraud or victimization (as defined in Section 15.40.060) of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
F.  Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of Sections 15.40.300A through 15.40.300E are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance. 
G.  Upon consideration of the factors of Section 15.40.290A and the purpose of this chapter, the city may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

No permit shall be issued to relocate any building or structure which is so constructed or in such condition as to be dangerous; or which is infested with pests or unsanitary; or which is so dilapidated, defective, unsightly or in such condition of deterioration or disrepair, or of such appearance or architectural design that its location at the proposed site would cause depreciation of the value or enjoyment of the neighboring properties, or cause appreciable harm to or be materially detrimental to the property or improvements in the district within a radius of one thousand feet from the proposed site; or if the proposed use is prohibited by the zoning laws of the city; or if the structure is of a type prohibited, at the proposed location, by any fire district regulations, or by any other law or ordinance; provided, however, that if the condition of the building or structure, in the judgment of the city council and building inspector, admits of practicable and effective correction or repair, the permit may be issued upon condition as hereinafter provided. 
B.  If the unlawful, dangerous or defective condition of the building or structure proposed to be relocated is such that remedy or correction cannot practicably and effectively be made, the permit shall be denied. In order to determine any of the matters presented by the application, the city council may cause to be made any investigation required in its discretion. 
C.  If the city council shall deem it necessary or expedient to do so, it may, in granting any relocation permit, impose thereon such terms and conditions as it may deem reasonable and proper, including, but not limited to, the requirements of changes, alterations, additions or repairs to be made to or upon the building or structure, to the end that the relocation thereof will not be materially detrimental or injurious to public safety or public welfare or to the property and improvements, or either, in the district, as hereinbefore limited, to which it is to be moved. All repair of dry rot and termite damage shall be completed before moving. The terms and conditions upon which each permit is granted shall be written upon the permit or appended in writing thereto. 
(Prior code §§ 8405, 8406 and 8407)  
15.44.080 - Deposit. 
When a building is to be moved from a location within the city, to a location outside the city, a cash deposit or instrument of credit, in the amount of three hundred dollars shall be required to insure that all foundations, piers, concrete work, waste or rubbish of any kind be removed from the lot within ten days after the building or structure has been removed therefrom. If such work is not accomplished within the period of time, the city shall be empowered to remove all such debris, the cost of which shall be charged against the cash deposit or instrument of credit, and the deposit balance, if any, shall be remitted to the depositor. If any additional funds are expended in removing such debris, the same shall be a proper charge against the permit holder. 
(Prior code § 8401 (part))  
15.44.090 - BondRequired. 
No relocation permit shall be issued unless the applicant therefor shall first post with the city council a bond executed by the owner of the premises where the building or structure is to be located, as principal, and by a surety company authorized to do business in this state, as surety. The bond, which shall be in form joint and several, shall name the city as obligee, and shall be in an amount equal to the cost, plus ten percent of the work required to be done in order to comply with all of the conditions of such relocation permit, as estimated by the building inspector. In lieu of a surety bond, the applicant may post a bond executed by the owner, as principal, and which is secured by a deposit of cash in the amount named above, and conditioned as required in the case of a surety bond. Such a bond as so secured is hereinafter called a "cash bond" for the purposes of this chapter. 
(Prior code § 8408)  
15.44.100 - BondConditions. 
Every bond posted pursuant to this chapter shall be conditioned as follows: 
A.  That each and all of the terms and conditions of this chapter and the relocation permit shall be complied with to the satisfaction of the city council; 
B.  That all of the work required to be done pursuant to the conditions of the relocation permit shall be fully performed and completed within the time limit specified in the relocation permit; or, if no time limit is specified, within ninety days after the date of its issuance. The time limit herein specified, or the time limited specified in any permit, may be extended for good and sufficient cause by the city council, but no time limit shall exceed six months from the date of issuance of the permit. No such extension of time shall be valid unless written, and no such extension shall release any surety upon any bond. 
(Prior code § 8409)  
15.44.110 - BondTerms. 
A.  The term of each bond posted pursuant to this chapter shall begin upon the date of the posting thereof and shall end upon the completion, to the satisfaction of the city council, of the performance of all the terms and conditions of the relocation permit. Such completion shall be evidenced by a statement thereof, signed by the building inspector, a copy of which will be sent to any surety or principal upon request. 
B.  When a cash bond has been posted, the cash shall be returned to the depositor, or to his successors or assigns, upon the termination of the bond, except any portion thereof that may have been used or deducted as elsewhere in this chapter provided. 
(Prior code § 8414)  
15.44.120 - Default in performance. 
A.  Notice. Whenever the city council shall find that a default has occurred in the performance of any term or condition of any permit, written notice thereof shall be given to the principal and to the surety on the bond. Such notice shall state the work to be done, the estimated cost thereof, and the period of time deemed by the city council to be reasonably necessary for the completion of such work. 
B.  Duty of Surety. After receipt of such notice the surety must, within therein time specified, either cause the required work to be performed, or, failing therein, must pay over to the city council, the estimated cost of doing the work, as set forth in the notice, plus an additional sum equal to ten percent of the estimated cost. Upon the receipt of such moneys the city council shall proceed, by such mode as it deems convenient, to cause the required work to be performed and completed, but no liability shall be incurred therein other than for the expenditure of the same sum in hand therefor. 
C.  Cash Bond. If a cash bond has been posted, notice of default, as provided above, shall be given to the principal, and if compliance is not had within the time specified, the city council shall proceed without delay, and without further notice or proceedings whatever, to use the cash deposit or any portion of such deposit to cause the required work to be done, by contract or otherwise, in the discretion of the city council. The balance if any, of such cash deposit shall, upon the completion of the work, be returned to the depositor, or to his successors or assigns, after deducting the cost of the work plus ten percent thereof. 
D.  Option to Complete Structure or Clear Site. When any default has occurred, on the part of the principal under the preceding provisions, the surety shall have the option, in lieu of completing the work required, to demolish the building or structure, and to clear, clean and restore the site. If the surety shall fail to complete the work or demolish the building or structure and to clear, clean and restore the site as herein provided, the city council shall have the same option.

Where fills are made on hillsides or slopes greater than one foot, measured vertically, to five feet, measured horizontally, steps or benches shall be cut into the original ground before filling is begun. The design of the steps or benches shall be subject to review and approval by the city engineer. 
D.  After the foundation area for the fill has been cleared and scarified, it shall be disced or bladed until it is uniform and free from large clods, brought to the proper moisture content, and compacted in the same manner and to the same degree as required for the fill material. 
(Prior code § 8713 (F))  
15.48.440 - FillsFill materials. 
Fill material shall consist of soils and materials selected and approved in writing by the soils engineer. The soils and materials used shall be essentially free of rocks greater than six inches in diameter and shall not contain paper, wood, glass, metal, cardboard or other deleterious substances. 
(Prior code § 8713 (J))  
15.48.450 - FillsPlacing, spreading and compacting fill material. 
A.  The selected fill material shall be placed in layers which when compacted shall not exceed six inches per layer. Each layer shall be spread evenly and shall be thoroughly mixed during the spreading to insure uniformity of material in each layer. 
B.  When moisture content of the fill material is below that specified by the soils engineer, water shall be added and thoroughly dispersed until the moisture content is as specified to permit the required degree of compaction. 
C.  When the moisture content of the fill material is above that specified by the soils engineer, the fill material shall be aerated by blading or other satisfactory methods until the moisture content is as specified. 
D.  After each layer has been placed, mixed and spread evenly, it shall be thoroughly compacted to not less than ninety percent of maximum dry density. Compaction shall be by means of tamping, sheepsfoot rollers, multiple-wheel pneumatic-tired rollers, or other approved methods that leave the fills free of cleavage planes. Compaction shall be accomplished while the fill material is at the specified moisture content and shall be over the entire fill area. 
E.  Field density tests shall be made at a frequency to be determined by the soils engineer, but in no case shall the tests be made at greater intervals than every two feet of fill measured vertically, and at least one test shall be made for each five hundred cubic yards of fill.

D.  The planting and irrigation systems required by this section shall be installed as soon as is practicable after rough grading. Prior to final approval of grading and before the release of the grading bond, the planting shall be well established and growing on the slopes, except as hereinafter set forth. 
E.  Temporary Planting. The city engineer shall permit the temporary planting of fill or cut slopes where, to require permanent planting, prior to the final approval of grading, would constitute a hardship to the owner or contractor; provided, that in addition to such temporary planting, the owner or applicant makes a cash deposit with the city, or instrument of credit, to insure that within a reasonable period of time permanent plantings an irrigation system will be installed in accordance with the provisions hereof. 
(Prior code § 8716)  
15.48.490 - Excavations and fills in old dumpsites. 
A.  Extensive accumulations of deleterious materials encountered, or known to exist, in old dumpsites may be permitted to remain if, in the opinion of the city engineer, the deleterious materials will not constitute a hazard to life or property. 
B.  When a site is to be graded pursuant to the provisions of this chapter and where extensive accumulations of deleterious materials are known to exist or are subsequently encountered during grading operations, such deleterious materials may be permitted to remain if, in the opinion of the city engineer, they will not constitute a hazard to life or property. In the event that the deleterious materials are permitted to remain, they shall be so placed upon he site as to avoid any hazardous condition and the grading plan shall be prepared or revised to correctly record the location and extent of the materials. The placing of such materials upon any site in the city is specifically prohibited after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter, except as may be permitted pursuant to the zoning code of the city. 
(Prior code § 8717)  
15.48.500 - Drainage.

16.24.020 - Purpose and intent. 
A.  The purpose of this chapter is to establish procedures necessary for the implementation of the Vesting Tentative Map Statute, and to supplement the provisions of the Subdivision Map Act (Government Code Section 66410 et. seq.) and the subdivision regulations of the city.

16.24.070 - Development rights. 
A.  The approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall confer a vested right in the subdivider, or assignee, to proceed with development in substantial compliance with the ordinances, policies and standards of the city in effect at the time the vesting tentative map is deemed complete. 
B.  Notwithstanding subsection A of this section, a permit, approval, extension or entitlement may be made conditional or denied if any of the following standards are determined: 
1.  A failure to do so would place the residents of a subdivision or immediate community, or both, in a condition dangerous to their health or safety, or both; 
2.  The condition or denial is required in order to comply with state or federal law. 
C.  Whenever a subdivider files a vesting tentative map for a subdivision whose intended development is inconsistent with the zoning ordinance in existence at the time, that inconsistency shall be noted on the map. The city may deny such a vesting tentative map or approve it conditioned on the subdivider, or his/her designee, obtaining the necessary change in the zoning ordinance to eliminate the inconsistency. If a change in the zoning ordinance is obtained, the approved or conditionally approved vesting tentative map shall confer the vested right to proceed with the development, notwithstanding subsection A of this section, in substantial compliance with the change in the zoning ordinance and the map, as approved. 
D.  Notwithstanding any provision of this chapter, a property owner or his/her designee may seek approvals or permits for development which depart from the ordinances, policies, and standards described herein and such approvals or permits may be granted or issued to the extent that the departures are authorized under applicable law.

An additional one-year extension may be granted by the planning commission upon application by the subdivider. If the extension is denied, the subdivider may appeal to the city council within fifteen calendar days of such a decision. 
C.  Where several final maps are recorded on various phases of a project by a single vesting tentative map, the one-year period described in subsection A of this section, shall begin for each phase when the final map for that phase is recorded. 
D.  The initial time period set forth in subdivision B of this section, shall be automatically extended by any time used thereafter by the city for processing a complete application for a grading permit or for design or architectural review if such time exceeds thirty days, from the date a complete application for such permit or review is filed. 
E.  If the subdivider submits a complete application for a building permit during the periods of time specified in this chapter, the vested rights conferred by this chapter shall continue until the expiration of that permit, or any extension of that permit. 
F.  Any subdivider holding an unexpired building permit may apply for extension of time within which he must commence work under that permit when he is unable to commence work within the time required by this chapter for good and satisfactory reasons. The building official may extend the time for beginning construction by the subdivider for a period not to exceed one hundred eighty days upon written request by the subdivider showing that circumstances beyond his control have prevented action from being taken.

17.04.040 - Division of zoning map. 
The zoning map may, for convenience, be divided into parts, and each part may, for purposes of more readily identifying areas within the zoning map, be subdivided into units, and these parts and units may be separately employed for purposes of amending the zoning map or for any official reference to the zoning map. 
(Prior code § 9211.3)  
17.04.050 - Changes in boundaries. 
Changes in the boundaries of the zones shall be made by ordinance adopting an amended zoning map, or part of the map, or unit of a part of the zoning map. These maps, when adopted, shall be published in the manner prescribed by law and become a part of this title. 
(Prior code § 9211.4)

A.  Where such boundaries are indicated as approximately following street and alley lines or lot lines, such lines shall be construed to be the zone boundaries. 
B.  In the case of unsubdivided property, and where a zone boundary divides a lot, the location of such boundaries, unless the same are indicated by dimensions, shall be determined by use of the scale appearing on the zoning map. 
C.  Where a public street or alley is officially vacated or abandoned, the street or alley will acquire the classification of the property to which it reverts. 
D.  Areas of dedicated streets or alleys and railroad rights-of-way, other than such as are designated on the zoning map as being classified in one of the zones provided in this title, shall be deemed to be the unclassified and, in the case of streets, permitted to be used for purposes lawfully allowed, and in the case of railroad rights-of-way, permitted to be used solely for the purpose of accommodating tracks, signals, other operative devices and the movement of rolling stock. 
(Prior code § 9211.5)  
17.04.070 - Classification of annexed lands and unclassified property. 
A.  Any property which, for any reason, is not designated on the zoning map or in this title as being classified in any of the zones established herein, shall be deemed to be temporarily zoned R-1 until the land is classified after being processed as an amendment to the zone plan pursuant to this title and Chapter 1, Title 7 of the Government Code. 
B.  Areas annexed to the city shall be classified in the zone under this title most comparable to the zone classification for the annexed area in the county at the time of annexation, unless the city council adopts a different classification in the manner provided for zone changes in this title. Such zone changes, variances or conditional use permits may be initiated and heard prior to the effective date of annexation. Any zone changes, variances or conditional use permits granted would be in effect upon annexation. 
(Prior code § 9211.6)  
17.04.080 - Limitation on land use.

(Prior code § 9211.7)  
17.04.090 - Compliance with code requirements. 
Compliance with the provisions of the zoning code shall not, in any case, be deemed to be a waiver of the requirements of Chapters 5.04 and 12.16 of this code, or any other provision of the municipal code, requiring the issuance of a license or permit, or both, for the conduct of a business or any other activity. 
(Prior code § 9211.8)

An accessory dwelling unit that is attached to the primary dwelling may be established utilizing a portion of the living area within the primary dwelling, or as an addition and utilizing a portion of the living area of the primary dwelling, or designed strictly as an addition to the primary dwelling unit. However, the increased floor area of an attached second unit shall not exceed thirty-five percent of the existing living area of the primary dwelling unit. 
11.  No accessory dwelling unit shall be permitted unless the primary dwelling unit provides parking in compliance with Exhibit 17.52.050. Additional parking for an accessory dwelling unit shall be provided with one off-street parking space per unit. Such parking space shall be enclosed with a garage door opening.

In addition, the establishment of an accessory unit shall preclude the renting of individual bedrooms to boarders in the primary and/or accessory dwelling units pursuant to Section 17.14.020 which would otherwise apply. 
21.  An owner of the property upon which an accessory dwelling unit is located who has at least a fifty percent ownership of the property must utilize either the primary dwelling or the accessory dwelling as their principal place of full-time residence. 
22.  The accessory dwelling unit shall not be owned or sold separately from the primary dwelling unit. 
D.  Nothing in this section shall prevent the construction of multiple-family dwellings otherwise permitted in any multiple-family zone and under applicable development standard of the appropriate zone.

(Prior code § 9237.2 (I))  
17.22.105 - Development standardsColor. 
A.  The purposes of this section are to establish exterior color standards for structures in the commercial zone to ensure that such structures (except those structures used solely for residential purposes) remain compatible and consistent with surrounding development and the desired character of the community, to promote a positive and attractive business environment in the city and to implement the goals and policies of the city's design guidelines. Providing for exterior color standards will create a sense of aesthetic harmony and encourage higher quality development, therefore improving the quality of life and overall image of the city. For purpose of this section, the term "structures" shall refer solely to the following: buildings, accessory buildings, and fences. 
B.  Consistent with the city of Montebello's design guidelines for commercial development, the primary body color of the exterior of a structure in the commercial zone shall be painted or colored in earth tones and neutral colors. Examples of earth tone or neutral colors include off-whites, siennas, light greys, beiges, tans, browns or other similarly subdued tones, shades, or colors. When choosing exterior colors, consideration shall be given to the color of other structures nearby, with the objective being that the exterior colors of adjacent or surrounding structures complement one another. 
C.  While earth tones and neutral colors shall serve as the dominant overall primary body color of the exterior of a structure within the commercial zone, brighter colors may be used to accent other structural elements such as doors, window frames and other architectural features. Neon colored paint shall not be allowed on any structure. Such brighter colors and the placement of such brighter colors shall complement the primary body color of the structure as well as highlight decorative details, such as ornaments, trims, fascias, inlays, tile, ironworks, awnings and other architectural features of the structure. 
D.  These color standards shall apply to the color of new structures in the commercial zone as well as the re-painting and color of existing structures in the commercial zone. For purposes of this section, "existing structures" shall mean any structure (whether occupied or vacant) located in the commercial zone which is built and in existence prior to the effective date of this section of the zoning code. 
E.  Any property owner or designated representative of the owner of any existing structure in the commercial zone whose existing exterior color(s) do not comply with the color standards set forth herein at the time this section becomes effective shall have eighteen months from the effective date of this section to comply with the provisions herein. Moreover, if an existing structure in the commercial zone is re-painted after this section becomes effective and the color(s) used do not conform to these color standards, it shall be subject to code enforcement for compliance. 
F.  Exterior ColorsExisting Structures. 
1.  Permits shall be required to re-paint the exterior of any existing structure in the commercial zone, provided that no fee shall be charged by the city of Montebello for processing or obtaining the permit. In order to obtain the permit to re-paint the existing structure, the property owner or designated representative of the owner of any existing structure in the commercial zone shall submit the proposed exterior color plan to the city's planning division in order to determine if the color plan complies with the color standards set forth herein. For purpose of this section, the terms "exterior color plan," "color plan" or "color plans" shall all refer to any document or rendering describing or depicting the exterior colors to be used on the structure, including but not limited to, a color and materials board or exterior paint color samples. A good faith effort in achieving color compatibility and harmony with adjacent structures is required by all applicants. The planning division shall review and make a determination regarding the proposed color plan. If the color plan is approved by the planning division, a permit shall thereafter be issued to the property owner or designated representative of the owner of the existing structure. If the color plan is not approved by the planning division, the matter may be appealed to the design review board with no fee assessed upon the applicant for purpose of the appeal. As part of the appeal, the applicant may provide a written explanation describing why the proposed color plan is required or that no other alternative color scheme can be employed. The design review board shall review appeals and approve, approve with conditions, or deny the proposed color plans. The decision of the design review board is final. 
2.  With respect to administrative projects other than re-painting of existing structures in the commercial zone, the exterior color plans shall be reviewed by the planning division for compliance with the color standards herein. Any property owner or designated agent of the owner of an existing structure in the commercial zone objecting to a determination or disapproval of the exterior color plans by the planning division may appeal the matter to the design review board. No fee shall be assessed upon the applicant for purpose of the appeal. As part of the appeal, the applicant may provide a written explanation describing why the proposed color plan is required or that no other alternative color scheme can be employed. The design review board shall review appeals and approve, approve with conditions, or deny the proposed color plans of the existing structure in the commercial zone. The decision of the design review board shall be final. 
3.  With respect to discretionary projects (or projects requiring planning commission or city council review) involving existing structures in the commercial zone, the exterior color plans shall be reviewed by the design review board for compliance with the color standards herein. Any property owner or designated agent of the owner of an existing structure in the commercial zone objecting to a determination or disapproval of the exterior color plan by the design review board may appeal the matter to the city council and pay the requisite fee for the appeal. As part of the appeal, the applicant may provide a written explanation describing why the proposed color plan is required or that no other alternative color scheme can be employed. The city council shall review appeals and approve, approve with conditions, or deny the proposed color plans of the existing structure in the commercial zone. The decision of the city council shall be final. 
G.  Exterior ColorsNew Structures. 
1.  Exterior colors to be used on new structures in the commercial zone shall be reviewed either by the planning division or the design review board as part of its general review process for administrative or discretionary projects. Exterior color review shall be required upon request for any permit or other type of building or land use entitlement required by this code with respect to the construction or development of any new structure in the commercial zone. Proposed color plans shall be provided by the applicant as required by the planning division or the design review board. A good faith effort in achieving color compatibility and harmony with adjacent structures is required of all applicants. 
2.  With respect to administrative projects, the planning division shall review the proposed color plans. Any applicant objecting to a determination or disapproval of the exterior color plans by the planning division may appeal the matter to design review board with no fee assessed upon the applicant for purpose of the appeal. For purpose of appeal, the applicant may provide a written explanation describing why the proposed color plan is required or that no other alternative color scheme can be employed. With respect to discretionary projects, the planning division shall present the exterior color plans to the design review board. The design review board shall review the proposed color plans and determine compliance with the color standards herein. In reviewing the proposed color plans, the design review board can approve, approve with conditions, or deny the proposed color plans. If the proposed color plans are not approved by the design review board, the applicant can modify the proposed color plans and resubmit them to the design review board, or appeal the matter to the city council within fourteen days of the design review board's action, or the next city council meeting, whichever is sooner. The decision of the city council regarding the appeal of the design review board's determination shall be final.

The purposes of this section are to establish exterior color standards for structures in the manufacturing zone to ensure that such structures (except those structures used solely for residential purposes) remain compatible and consistent with surrounding development and the desired character of the community, to promote a positive and attractive industrial or manufacturing environment in the city and to implement the goals and policies of the city's design guidelines. Providing for exterior color standards will create a sense of aesthetic harmony and encourage higher quality development, therefore improving the quality of life and overall image of the city. For purpose of this section, the term "structures" shall refer solely to the following: buildings, accessory buildings, and fences. 
B.  Consistent with the city of Montebello's design guidelines for industrial development, the primary body color of the exterior of a structure in the manufacturing zone shall be painted or colored in earth tones and neutral colors. Examples of earth tone or neutral colors include off-whites, siennas, light greys, beiges, tans, browns or other similarly subdued tones, shades, or colors. When choosing exterior colors, consideration shall be given to the color of other structures nearby, with the objective being that the exterior colors of adjacent structures complement one another. 
C.  While earth tones and neutral colors shall serve as the dominant overall primary body color of the exterior of a structure in the manufacturing zone, brighter colors may be used to accent other structural elements, such as doors, window frames and other architectural features. Neon colored paint shall not be allowed on any structure. Such brighter colors shall complement the primary body color of the structure as well as highlight decorative details, such as ornaments, trims, fascias, inlays, tile, ironworks, awnings and other architectural features of the structure. 
D.  These color standards shall apply to the color of new structures in the manufacturing zone as well as the re-painting and color of existing structures in the manufacturing zone. For purposes of this section, "existing structures" shall mean any structure located in the manufacturing zone which is built and in existence prior to the effective date of this section of the zoning code. 
E.  Any property owner or designated representative of the owner of any, existing structure in the manufacturing zone whose existing exterior color(s) do not comply with the color standards set forth herein at the time this section becomes effective shall have eighteen months from the effective date of this section to comply with the provisions herein. Moreover, if an existing structure in the manufacturing zone is re-painted after this section becomes effective and the color(s) used do not conform to these color standards, it shall be subject to code enforcement for compliance. 
F.  Exterior ColorsNew Structures. 
1.  Permits shall be required to re-paint the exterior of any existing structure in the manufacturing zone, provided that no fee shall be charged by the city of Montebello for processing or obtaining the permit. In order to obtain the permit to re-paint the existing structure, the property owner or designated representative of the owner of any existing structure in the manufacturing zone shall submit the proposed exterior color plan to the city's planning division in order to determine if the color plan complies with the color standards set forth herein. For purpose of this section, the terms "exterior color plan," "color plan" or "color plans" shall all refer to any document or rendering describing or depicting the exterior colors to be used on the structure, including but not limited to, a color and materials board or exterior paint color samples. A good faith effort in achieving color compatibility and harmony with adjacent structures is required by all applicants. The planning division shall review and make a determination regarding the proposed color plan. If the color plan is approved by the planning division, a permit shall thereafter be issued to the property owner or designated representative of the owner of the existing structure. If the color plan is not approved by the planning division, the matter may be appealed to the design review board with no fee assessed upon the applicant for purpose of the appeal. As part of the appeal, the applicant may provide a written explanation describing why the proposed color plan is required or that no other alternative color scheme can be employed. The design review board shall review appeals and approve, approve with conditions, or deny the proposed color plans. The decision of the planning commission is final. 
2.  With respect to administrative projects other than re-painting of existing structures in the manufacturing zone, the exterior color plans shall be reviewed by the planning division for compliance with the color standards herein. Any property owner or designated agent of the owner of an existing structure in the manufacturing zone objecting to a determination or disapproval of the exterior color plans by the planning division may appeal the matter to the design review board. No fee shall be assessed upon the applicant for purpose of the appeal. As part of the appeal, the applicant may provide a written explanation describing why the proposed color plan is required or that no other alternative color scheme can be employed. The planning commission shall review appeals and approve, approve with conditions, or deny the proposed color plans of the existing structure in the manufacturing zone. The decision of the design review board shall be final. 
3.  With respect to discretionary projects (or projects requiring planning commission or city council review) involving existing structures in the manufacturing zone, the exterior color plans shall be reviewed by the design review board for compliance with the color standards herein. Any property owner or designated agent of the owner of an existing structure in the manufacturing zone objecting to a determination or disapproval of the exterior color plan by the design review board may appeal the matter to the city council and pay the requisite fee for the appeal. As part of the appeal, the applicant may provide a written explanation describing why the proposed color plan is required or that no other alternative color scheme can be employed. The city council shall review appeals and approve, approve with conditions, or deny the proposed color plans of the existing structure in the manufacturing zone. The decision of the city council shall be final.

A.  Site Improvements and Operating Standards. All new heavy trucking uses, as defined in Chapter 17.08 of this code, that are established after the effective date of this chapter shall comply with all applicable requirements of this code and the zoning district in which the use is located in addition to the distance requirement of Section 17.37.030.B. 
B.  Distance Requirements. 
1.  Five Hundred Feet Separation Required. A new heavy trucking use, as defined in Chapter 17.08 of this code, shall not be established on any parcel or lot located within five hundred feet of any residential zone or other sensitive land use. A sensitive land use shall include (i) a public or private kindergarten, elementary, middle, junior high or high school; (ii) a licensed child-care facility or preschool other than a small or large family day care facility; (iii) playground; (iv) youth center; (v) recreational facility; (vi) park; or (vii) library. 
2.  How to Measure Operation. The distance between any parcel or lot used for heavy trucking uses and the residential zone or sensitive land uses detailed above shall be measured in a straight line, without regard to intervening structures, from the closest property line of the parcel or lot used for heavy trucking uses to the closest property line of the residentially zoned property, or sensitive land use. 
(Ord. No. 2342, § 6, 6-22-2011)  
17.37.040 - Existing heavy trucking uses. 
All existing heavy trucking uses at the time this chapter becomes effective, and without an effective conditional use permit, shall be considered exempt from the abatement action of Code Amendment No. 3-89 provided that these uses make an application for exemption and complete the conditions and requirements listed in the notice to comply described in Section 17.37.040.B.2 of this section within twenty-four months of the effective date of this chapter ("compliance term"). There shall be no extensions granted to the compliance term. Failure to comply with the requirements of this section by any of the affected parties will result in the enforcement of an abatement order by the city. 
A.  Site Improvements and Operating Standards. All existing heavy trucking uses, as identified in the paragraph above, shall demonstrate compliance with applicable standards of this code and the zoning district in which the use is located, including but not limited to those regulating lighting and glare, landscaping, screening, noise, vibration, and hazardous substances. Additionally, the following standards shall apply to all applicable uses: 
1.  A solid decorative wall of at least eight feet in height must be constructed along all property lines abutting, or across an alley from, a residentially zoned property (except that in the required front yard setback of a residential use a three-foot decorative wall shall be constructed and additional non view-obscuring wrought iron may be placed on top of the three-foot wall). A wall shall be considered decorative if it incorporates architectural variation on its surface (i.e. slumpstone, stuccoed, split-face or similar). 
2.  A landscaped planter of a minimum of ten feet wide shall be required along all property lines abutting a residentially zoned property. The planter shall be fully irrigated and subject to the review and approval of a landscape and irrigation plan by the city's planning division. The landscape plan shall complement the solid eight-foot wall in providing a visual screen and physical separation from the abutting residentially zoned property and shall discourage plant materials susceptible to vermin such as ivy and vines. 
3.  A photometric plan shall be submitted for review and approval by the city's planning division prior to the issuance of a business license and a certificate of occupancy. The photometric plan shall show lighting levels that do not exceed 0.5 footcandles along any property lines abutting a residentially zoned property. 
4.  All trash areas and storage of trash/utility bins shall be located a minimum of one hundred feet from any property line shared with a residentially zoned property. 
5.  Any areas used for the parking of trucks, trailers, or fleet vehicles shall be located a minimum of one hundred feet from any property line shared with a residential zone. Customer or employee parking shall be permitted within the one hundred-foot buffer. 
The director, at his/her discretion, may grant specific deviations from these standards (or the standards of this code and the zoning district in which the use is located) for existing heavy trucking uses satisfying the requirements of this chapter if strict compliance with these conditions and requirements is impeded by existing physical constraints or limitations of the affected sites. 
B.  Exemption Process. 
1.  Application. All existing heavy trucking uses at the time of this chapter, without an effective conditional use permit, as described above, which desire to be exempt from the enforcement of the abatement action, may file a "request for exemption" (the "request") with the planning division. The request shall consist of all of the following items: 
a.  An "abatement exemption" application, which must include the names and signatures of both the business operator(s) and the property owner(s); and 
b.  A plot plan of the entire subject property site showing all existing and proposed buildings and uses, landscaped areas, parking areas, storage areas, lighting, adjacent uses, and any other data as may be required by the planning division to adequately review the exemption request. 
c.  A filing fee in the amount equal to a preliminary plan review, as established in the user fees by resolution of the Montebello City Council. 
2.  Review. Within fifteen working days of the date of filing a complete abatement exemption application by the applicant, planning staff shall review the plot plan, perform the required site inspection, evaluate the findings and issue a "notice to comply" listing all pertinent site improvements and operating requirements to be implemented by the applicant. If site improvements are required, planning staff shall stipulate a specific timeframe to complete the improvements and shall issue a "site improvement completion" form upon satisfactory completion of all the required operations and improvements. 
3.  Nonconforming Status. Any existing heavy trucking use issued a site improvement completion form as a result of this code amendment shall no longer be considered a nonconforming use, as regulated by Chapter 17.54 of this code, and as such shall not be subject to the abatement period applicable to nonconforming uses. 
C.  Intensification, Expansion. The intensification, expansion, or substantial alteration of an existing heavy trucking use will not be permitted unless all applicable requirements of this code and the zone in which the use is located are met in addition to the operation standards of Section 17.37.030.A for the affected areas of the proposal. The distance requirement in Section 17.37.030 shall not apply to the intensification, expansion, or substantial alteration of a heavy trucking use in existence at the time of the effective date of this chapter and qualified for an exemption from the abatement order resulting from Code Amendment 3-89.

Note Prior code history: Prior code §§ 92509250.13. 
 
17.38.010 - Planned development districts defined. 
A plan development district ("PD") is master planning mechanism for the development of larger parcels of land in residential, commercial and manufacturing zones where the existing underlying development standards do not functionally allow for reasonable development. This master planning mechanism allows for a comprehensive approach to development on a single parcel or contiguous parcels of land under single or joint ownership, and allow for flexibility in land use controls typically required by another zoning designation. The planned development mechanism encourages the use of modern planning and development techniques thereby ensuring more efficient utilization of land in the community. An approved planned development will be designated on the official zoning map with a "PD" designation. A precise plan of development ("the Plan") shall be adopted along with the "PD" designation as the implementation tool for the planned development. 
(Ord. 2290 § 4 (part), 2006)  
17.38.020 - Purpose. 
A plan development district designation is a reasonably flexible development tool that: 
A.  Provides for sound and efficient development of a parcel or parcels of land with unique topographic land features and/or having irregular shape, and/or parcels affected by incompatible land uses on adjacent properties; 
B.  Insures the preservation of natural land features, open space, and other valuable and desirable environmental features of a particular area; 
C.  Allows the development of large residential, commercial and industrial projects in such a manner to insure that such proposed development is consistent with the elements of the general plan, any applicable specific plan, and to assure that such development will be compatible with surrounding existing and proposed land uses; 
D.  Reduces or eliminates the rigidity, delays, and inequities that otherwise may result from the application of land use regulations and administrative procedures designed for small parcels of land; 
E.  Allows for mixed-use (commercial/residential) development in such a manner as to insure that such proposed development is consistent with the elements of the general plan, any applicable specific plan, and to assure that such development will be compatible with surrounding existing and proposed land uses; 
F.  Encourages architectural design diversity and avoids monotony in large developments by allowing greater freedom in the design of architectural elements to provide access, light, open space, and amenities in an aesthetically pleasing manner; 
G.  Provides for maintenance of the open space for those who will directly benefit from it; 
H.  Encourages the assembly of properties that might otherwise be developed in unrelated increments to the detriment of surrounding neighborhoods; and/or 
I.  Encourages a more efficient use of public and/or private services and facilities. 
(Ord. 2290 § 4 (part), 2006)  
17.38.030 - Definitions. 
In addition to the definitions contained in Chapter 17.08 of this code, the following words and phrases shall, for the purposes of this chapter, be designated as follows, unless it is clearly apparent from the context that another meaning is intended: 
"Building coverage" means all land within the planned development covered by buildings, garage building area, carport building area and other enclosed areas. All area coverage shall be computed at ground level. 
"Common open space" means a parcel or parcels of land, or of water, or a combination, within the site designated for a planned development and designated and intended for the use or enjoyment of all or certain of the owners and/or occupants of the planned development. Common open space may contain such complementary structures and improvements as are necessary or desirable and appropriate for the benefit and enjoyment of all or certain of the owners and/or occupants of the planned development. 
"Covenants, conditions and restrictions (CC&Rs)" means a term used to describe restrictive limitations, usually recorded as covenants, that may be placed on property and its use, and which are usually made a condition of holding title or lease. The CC&Rs are intended to preserve the physical nature and character of the development. 
"Open space" refers to unimproved land, landscaped areas, improved recreation areas, recreational buildings and structures totally accessory to recreational uses, and water surfaces, all within the planned development. Open space does not include streets, public or private parking areas, storage areas or areas covered by any building, garage, carport or other structures except recreational structures. 
"Precise plan of development" or "PPD" means the written and graphic materials describing the characteristics of a planned development, including, but not limited to, a plat of subdivision, all covenants relating to use; design, location and bulk of buildings and other structures; intensity of use or density of development; streets, vehicular circulation lanes, walkways and parking facilities. 
(Ord. 2290 § 4 (part), 2006)  
17.38.040 - Minimum site area. 
The parcel(s) proposed to be developed utilizing the planned development procedures and designation must have an area of at least: 
A.  Two acres for multiple occupancy by commercial and/or industrial uses; 
B.  One acre for mixed-uses (commercial/residential); and/or 
C.  One-half acre for a residential uses when the housing units share a common open space and/or a common pedestrian and/or vehicular access to and from a public right-of-way. 
(Ord. 2290 § 4 (part), 2006)  
17.38.050 - Planned development districtCreation and map designation. 
Planned development districts shall be created in the same manner as property is reclassified from one zoning classification to another within the city (see Chapter 17.76 of this code, Zone Changes). When a planned development district has been created, it shall be designated upon the zoning map of the city, as an overlay zone, by adding the parenthetically enclosed letters "PD," after the zoning symbol indicating the zone in which the subject property is included. 
(Ord. 2290 § 4 (part), 2006)  
17.38.060 - Permitted uses and densities. 
The uses and densities within a planned development district must be in accordance with the underlying zoning classification for the lots in the PD. These zoning classifications are established by the zoning map of the city (prior code § 9250.2). Strict adherence to the underlying range of uses and/or density requirements may not be necessary if a reasonable mix of uses and densities can be designed to be compatible with one another within the PD and with those existing and/or proposed uses in the immediately surrounding properties provided that the mix of uses and densities is consistent with the overlying designations of the general plan for the lots in the PD. The establishment and operation of any use in the approved PD shall be in compliance with the requirements of the underlying zoning classifications and/or pursuant to Section 17.70.030, unless specifically exempted by the approved plan. 
(Ord. 2290 § 4 (part), 2006)  
17.38.070 - Development standards. 
Any development classified in a PD designation, including, but not limited to, the construction and maintenance of buildings and structures shall be accomplished in accordance with the zoning regulations applicable to the underlying zone, unless the zoning regulations and/or the development standards are made inapplicable by an express condition of the PD designation, in which case, the conditions of the PD designation take precedence. The required precise plan of development shall conform to the following design criteria: 
A.  The plan shall be comprehensive, with respect to land, buildings, landscaping and their interrelationships; 
B.  The plan shall provide for adequate open space, circulation, off-street parking and pertinent amenities. Buildings, structures and facilities in the project site shall be well integrated, oriented and related to the topographic and natural landscape features of the site, as well as the surrounding development patterns. In situations where multi-story structures are proposed to be developed abutting residentially developed properties, due consideration should be given to the privacy of the existing residential uses; 
C.  The internal street system shall not be a dominant feature in the overall design; rather it should be designed for the efficient and safe flow of vehicles without creating a disruptive influence on the activity and function of any common areas and facilities in the project site; 
D.  Common areas and recreational facilities (if provided) shall be readily accessible to the occupants of the dwelling units and shall be related to any common open space provided in the project site; 
E.  Architectural harmony within the development and design compatibility with the surrounding existing and expected future development shall be obtained so far as feasible; 
F.  The development characteristics such as lot area, frontage and width, coverage, density, yards/setbacks, building heights, landscaping and parking depicted in the plan shall be the standards of the underlying zoning designations. Exceptions to these standards may be allowed by the planning commission and city council when it can be demonstrated that such modified standards would result in more desirable development and are warranted in terms of the relationship of the total proposed development or units thereof to the general plan. 
(Ord. 2290 § 4 (part), 2006)  
17.38.080 - Planned development district designation and precise plan of development approvalApplication requirements.

Chapter 17.44 - OIL AND GAS PRODUCTION DISTRICT 
 
17.44.010 - Purpose. 
The purpose of the oil and gas production (O) district shall be to allow the economic recovery of oil and gas in certain areas of the city which are or will be a part of a recognized oil and gas field but which are zoned for more restricted uses. The exploration for and production of oil and gas shall be permitted subject only to such limitations, safeguards and controls which are deemed necessary to protect the land values and surface uses of surrounding areas. 
(Prior code § 9253)  
17.44.020 - Superimposed natureDesignationPrecedence. 
The O district shall be in the nature of a superimposed district. Land so classified shall also be classified in one or more other zones. Property so classified shall be delineated on the zoning map by a combination of the zone symbols (for example: M-1-O for light manufacturing and oil and gas production district). The regulations hereof shall be in addition to those regulations in the underlying zone. In the event of a conflict between the provisions hereof and the provisions of an underlying zone, the oil and gas production district provisions take precedence. 
(Prior code § 9253.1)  
17.44.030 - Principal permitted uses. 
The following are the principal permitted uses in the oil and gas production district: 
A.  Any use permitted in the underlying zone;

(Prior code § 9253.2)  
17.44.040 - Property development standards. 
Property development standards set forth in the underlying zones shall apply, except that the standards shall not apply to the exploration or the drilling, production, extraction, storing or removal of oil and gas; provided that the uses are in compliance with the provisions of Chapter 5.52 of this code. 
(Ord. 2070 § 34, 1992: prior code § 9253.3)  
17.44.050 - Applicability. 
The provisions hereof shall not be applicable to any property unless the commission and council have conducted public hearings, and made the findings required in a zone reclassification matter. (See Chapter 17.76 of this code, zone change process.) 
(Prior code § 9253.4)  
Chapter 17.46 - HEIGHT OVERLAY ZONE 
 
17.46.010 - Purpose. 
The purpose of the height modifying zone shall be to promote orderly, harmonious development of areas and to insure that the height of buildings and structures will be compatible with adjacent development. 
(Prior code § 9254)  
17.46.020 - Modifying natureDesignationPrecedence. 
The height overlay zone shall be in the nature of a modifying zone. Land so classified shall also be classified in one or more other zones. Property so classified shall be delineated on the zoning map by a combination of zone symbols. For example, R-3-H-50 means residential, multiple-family, building height up to fifty feet. The height regulations in this section shall supersede the height regulations in the underlying zone. 
(Prior code § 9254.1)  
17.46.030 - Height regulations. 
Whenever any property on the zoning map of the city has in addition to its zone designation the symbol "H" followed by a numerical figure, the provisions hereof shall apply concerning height limitations for any buildings or structures located, or to be located upon such property. The height of buildings or structures in an H-zone cannot exceed the numerical figure following the H on the zoning map. 
(Prior code § 9254.2)  
17.46.040 - Applicability. 
The provisions hereof shall not be applicable to any property unless the commission and council have conducted public hearings, and made the findings required in a zone reclassification matter. (See Chapter 17.76 of this code, zone reclassification.) 
(Prior code § 9254.3)  
Chapter 17.48 - DENSITY OVERLAY ZONE 
 
17.48.010 - Purpose. 
The purpose of the density modifying zone shall be to promote the orderly, harmonious development of residential areas and to insure that densities are consistent with the city's general plan. 
(Prior code § 9255)  
17.48.020 - Modifying natureDesignationPrecedence. 
The density overly zone shall be in the nature of a modifying zone. Land so classified shall also be classified in one or more zones. Property so classified shall be delineated on the zoning map by a combination of the zone symbols. For example, R-3-D-14 means multi-family, fourteen dwelling units per acre. The regulations hereof on the density modifying zone shall supersede the density regulations in the underlying zone. 
(Prior code § 9255.1)  
17.48.030 - Density regulations. 
Whenever any property on the zoning map which is zoned residential has in addition to its zone designation a symbol "D" followed by a numerical figure, the provisions hereof shall apply regarding the total number of dwelling units located, or to be located on the property. The numerical figure following the "D" indicates the maximum number of dwelling units allowed per acre. 
(Prior code § 9255.2)  
17.48.040 - Applicability. 
The provisions hereof shall not be made applicable to any property unless the commission and council have conducted public hearings and made the findings required in a zone reclassification matter. (See Chapter 17.76 of this code, zone reclassification.) 
(Prior code § 9255.3)  
Chapter 17.49 - BROWNFIELD OVERLAY DISTRICT 
 
17.49.010 - Brownfield overlay district established and defined. 
A.  The city of Montebello establishes a Brownfield overlay district in the approximately fifty-five acre Brownfield area that was previously used as a landfill in an effort to allow and cluster certain heavy trucking uses that were deleted from the zoning code on November 22, 1989. Subsequent to the adoption of Ordinance No. 2001 amending the industrial development standards, no new heavy trucking uses were permitted in any zones of the city, and a twenty-year abatement period was established for the previously existing nonconforming uses. 
B.  The Brownfield overlay district shall be located south of the Atchison Topeka and Santa Fe railroad tracks near Maynard Road, west of the Rio Hondo Percolation Basin (Bluff Road), north of Slauson Avenue, and east from the railroad spur just to the west of Chapin Road. The specific boundaries of the Brownfield overlay district are identified on Exhibit "A," which is attached to and is made part of this chapter. An approved Brownfield overlay district will be designated on the official zoning map with a "BF" designation. 
(Ord. 2307 § 3 (part), 2007)  
17.49.020 - Purpose. 
The establishment of the Brownfield overlay district is a short-term solution that will: 
A.  Allow certain heavy trucking uses such as truck terminals, truck transportation yards and truck storage yards that were previously deleted from the zoning code, to temporarily exist in the Brownfield area at this time; 
B.  Promote the better utilization of land with minimal improvements while more in-depth environmental studies are conducted to determine the extent of the mitigation necessary for the Brownfield area; 
C.  Cluster certain heavy trucking uses that would not require substantial development, but only minor physical improvements that would visually improve the Brownfield area; and 
D.  Provide time for the city to complete its Phase II Environmental study and address all facets of the potential surface and subsurface problems in the Brownfield area, and to formulate a specific plan for the ultimate establishment of appropriate uses therein. 
(Ord. 2307 § 3 (part), 2007)  
17.49.030 - Definitions. 
In addition to the definitions contained in Chapter 17.08 of this code, the following words and phrases shall, for the purposes hereof, be designated as follows, unless it is clearly apparent from the context that another meaning is intended: 
"Brownfield area" means the real property consisting of approximately fifty-five acres identified on the Exhibit A at the end of this chapter, the expansion, redevelopment, or reuse of which may be complicated by the presence or potential presence of a hazardous substance, pollutant, or contaminant. 
"Truck terminal, draying or freight" means a facility that specializes in the transfer of freight. The terminal is not the point or the final destination of the freight. 
"Truck transfer, moving and storage" means a facility that may be similar to a recreational vehicle storage lot, but is intended for the storage of trucks and truck trailers overnight or for longer periods of time. 
"Truck transportation yard" means a location where the trucks that are operating at a truck terminal are stored when not in use. May also be the location where trucks are stored (overnight) and then dispatched to their destination(s).

2.  Truck transportation yards; 
3.  Truck transfer, moving and storage. 
B.  The director of planning and economic development may deem additional uses to be permitted based on a finding that the use is similar in nature and operation to the permitted uses listed in this subsection. 
(Ord. 2307 § 3 (part), 2007)  
17.49.050 - Prohibited uses. 
A.  All uses and accessory uses of the underlying zone listed in Chapter 17.36 of the zoning code and Appendix A, index of primary uses, specifically prohibited for the M-2 heavy manufacturing zoning district, shall be prohibited in the Brownfield overlay district except as otherwise specified in this chapter. 
B.  The director of planning and economic development may deem additional uses to be prohibited based on a finding that the use is similar in nature, and operation to the prohibited uses listed in subsection A of this section.

(Ord. 2307 § 3 (part), 2007)  
17.49.070 - Sunset date. 
A.  The Brownfield overlay district is established on an interim basis only. The provisions of this chapter establishing the Brownfield overlay district and permitting the uses specified in Section 17.49.040 to exist in the Brownfield area shall only be in effect through November 22, 2019, (the "Sunset Date") and shall automatically be repealed as of that date unless one of the following occurs before the sunset date: 
1.  An ordinance enacted after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this chapter extends or repeals sunset date; or 
2.  The city council of the city of Montebello adopts a specific plan or other zoning ordinance, which allows the heavy trucking uses permitted by this chapter to continue or remain beyond the sunset date. 
B.  If neither subsection (A)(1) nor (A)(2) of this section occurs prior to the sunset date, all truck transfer, moving and storage, truck terminal, draying or freight and truck transportation yard uses in the Brownfield overlay district (and any such similar uses as may have been established pursuant to the provisions of this chapter) shall become nonconforming uses, subject to the abatement/amortization period set forth in the following Section 17.49.080. 
(Ord. 2307 § 3 (part), 2007)  
17.49.080 - Abatement/amortization period. 
Except as specifically set forth otherwise in this section, the provisions of Chapter 17.54 of this code governing nonconforming uses shall apply to all truck transfer, moving and storage; truck terminal, draying or freight and truck transportation yard uses in the Brownfield overlay district (and any such similar uses as may have been established pursuant to the provisions of this chapter) as of the sunset date.

All truck transfer, moving and storage; truck terminal, draying or freight and truck transportation yard uses in the Brownfield overlay district (and such similar uses as may have been established pursuant to the provisions of this chapter) which have become nonconforming as of the sunset date (November 22, 2019), shall be permitted to continue such uses for a period not to exceed three years following the sunset date. 
B.  Following the sunset date, the director of planning and economic development shall cause official notification to be sent via certified mail to the legal property owner of record as it appears in the county tax roll, stating the nonconforming status of such truck transfer, moving and storage; truck terminal, draying or freight; truck transportation yard or such similar business use on the property, as well as the start date of the abatement/amortization period. If the operator of such truck transfer, moving and storage; truck terminal, draying or freight; truck transportation yard or such similar business use is different from that of the legal property owner, additional notification shall be sent to the business operator by certified mail. Failure to issue such a notice shall not prejudice the city's rights to subsequently issue a written order of abatement pursuant to Chapter 17.54 of this code or to subsequently require compliance with the then-applicable laws of the city. 
C.  On November 22, 2022, the conclusion of the three year abatement/amortization period set forth in this section, all nonconforming truck transfer, moving and storage; truck terminal, draying or freight and truck transportation yard uses in the Brownfield overlay district (and any such similar uses as may have been established therein pursuant to the provisions of this chapter) shall cease operation.

If the whole of any through lot is improved as one building site, the main building shall conform to the zone classification of the frontage occupied by such main building, and no accessory building shall be located closer to either street than the distance constituting the required front yard on such street. 
(Prior code § 9245.15)  
17.50.160 - Reduction of lot area. 
No lot area shall be so reduced or diminished that the lot area, yards or other open spaces shall be smaller than prescribed hereby, nor shall the density of population be increased in any manner except in conformity with regulations established by this code. 
(Prior code § 9245.16)

(Ord. 2167 § 6, 1997: prior code § 9247.2)  
17.54.040 - Nonconforming buildings and structures. 
The following section applies to all nonconforming buildings and structures. (See Chapter 17.08 of this code, Definitions.) 
A.  Conforming Buildings. This section shall not place any limitation upon reconstruction, repair or remodeling by the property owner where the building or structure is conforming but the use is not. 
B.  NonconformityTermination and Abatement. 
1.  Termination. Nonconforming buildings and structures may continue in all zones unless any of the following occurs: 
a.  The nonconforming building or structure has been removed or demolished (that is, more than fifty percent of the exterior walls are removed) for any reason except as provided in subsection C of this section; 
b.  There is a change from a nonconforming use to a conforming use; or 
c.  There is an increase or enlargement of the area, space or volume of the building, structure or land devoted to the nonconforming use, except as provided here. 
2.  Abatement By Operation of Law. Nonconforming buildings and structures shall be abated, and usage shall be terminated upon the expiration of the periods of time indicated hereafter in this subdivision. The period of time shall begin on the date that such use, building or structure first became nonconforming by reason of the provisions of the zoning regulations of the city: 
a.  The nonconforming building or structure has been abandoned for six months or more; or 
b.  A nonconforming building or structure housing a nonconforming use: five years; or 
c.  Nonconforming buildings or structures shall be abated, and the usage terminated, within the periods of time as herein set forth, based on the type of construction as defined in the building regulations of the city, as follows: 
i.  Type IV and type V buildings per 1985 Uniform Building Code (light incombustible frame and wood frame buildings and structures): thirty-five years; and 
ii.  Type III buildings per 1985 Uniform Building Code (heavy timber construction and ordinary masonry buildings and structures): forty years; and

iv.  Metal buildings: five years. 
C.  Repair, Maintenance, Addition, Alteration and Replacement. The provisions apply to all nonconforming buildings and structures. 
1.  Ordinary Repaired Maintenance. The ordinary repair and maintenance of a nonconforming commercial or industrial building in any zone, or a residential building in a commercial or industrial zone, is permitted and encouraged; provided, that the cost does not exceed fifteen percent in any twelve-month period, of the fair market value of the building or structure at the commencement of rehabilitation. 
2.  Eminent Domain. Where a portion of a nonconforming building or structure is taken for any public use by any agency having the power of eminent domain, the building or structure may be repaired, reconstructed or remodeled. The repair, reconstruction or remodeling must be limited to rendering the building safe for continued use. 
3.  Partial Destruction. If a nonconforming building or structure is damaged or partially destroyed, it may be restored to the condition in which it existed immediately prior to the occurrence of such casualty; provided, that the total reconstruction cost does not exceed thirty-seven percent of the fair market value of the building or structure. In addition, all such construction and/or repair work shall be completed within a period of one year from the date of the occurrence of the casualty. For the purposes of this section, units under condominium ownership that are located in one building will be considered as separate units. 
4.  Elimination of Nonconformity. Alterations and/or additions shall be permitted in order to render the building or structure in conformity with the provisions of this title. 
5.  Compliance with Laws. In order to comply with any law, other than zoning regulations, enacted after the adoption of the provisions hereof, alterations and/or additions shall be permitted. 
6.  No Extension of Termination Date. Accomplishment of any work permitted pursuant to this section shall not extend the termination date of the nonconforming use, building or structure. 
D.  Nonconforming Buildings or StructuresProvisions for Each Zone. In addition to the preceding, the following provisions provide regulations by zone for nonconforming buildings and structures, regardless of whether or not such building or structure is the primary structure on the site: 
1.  Residential Zones. 
a.  Repair, Maintenance, Addition, Alteration and Replacement. The aforementioned work on nonconforming buildings and structures is permitted under the following conditions: 
i.  Any nonconforming dwelling unit, which is nonconforming solely by reason of deficient off-street parking facilities (see Chapter 17.52 of this code for the off-street parking requirements chart); provided, that the number of dwelling units on the lot does not increase. In addition, such construction or reconstruction can not result in any portion of a building or structure being located on the only portion of the lot physically available for required off-street parking facilities or access thereto or any required yard or open space area; or 
ii.  Where a second unit is a legal nonconforming structure, and the primary unit is conforming, additions and alterations to the primary unit may be allowed, subject to a scheduled review and approval by the planning commission. The primary unit shall be the largest unit, or in case both units are the same size, the front unit shall be considered primary. 
iii.  Any building which is rendered legal nonconforming by the adoption of the residential development standards on April 28, 1986, and which is totally destroyed by fire, earthquake or other calamity beyond the control of the owner, may be reconstructed with the same number of dwelling units it had prior to such fire, earthquake or other calamity; provided, that as reconstructed it shall comply with all other building and zoning ordinance requirements. 
iv.  The ordinary repair and maintenance of a nonconforming residential building in a residential zone shall be permitted under the following limitations; provided, that in no case shall the structure be altered to expand the use or increase the nonconformity: 
(A)  No limit shall be placed on work which would improve the health and life safety features of the building. The health and life safety related work shall be defined as that necessary to meet the city's adopted building, electrical, plumbing, mechanical, fire and health codes. 
(B)  The cost of the nonhealth and safety related repairs and maintenance in any twelve-month period shall be limited to thirty-seven percent of the fair market value of the building or structure prior to the commencement of rehabilitation. 
b.  NonconformityYard Areas. If a nonconforming building or structure is nonconforming because of a failure to observe required yard areas, the same may be altered or added to so long as the addition or enlargement will not encroach into required setback area more than the existing encroachment of the building, except that: 
i.  In no event shall the addition or enlargement be closer than three feet to the internal side or rear lot line; and 
ii.  In no event shall any addition or enlargement be made into the front setback or side setback, except to enclose an existing porch, or to add an enclosed entryway; provided, that the enclosure does not encroach into the front setback or side street setback more than the existing encroachment of the facade closest to the right-of-way; and 
iii.  In all other respects such additions or alterations shall conform to all other required yard and open space requirements (for required yard areas, see residential development standards and minimum setback requirements Exhibits, Chapters 17.10 through 17.20 of this code); and 
iv.  Nonconforming Fencing. If a fence in a residential zone is nonconforming and is damaged or partially destroyed to the point where the total reconstruction cost exceeds twenty-five percent of the existing fence, the fence must be completely removed or replaced with a conforming fence at the proper setbacks. 
2.  Commercial and Industrial Zones. Alteration, enlargement and replacement of nonconforming buildings and structures are permitted under the following conditions: 
a.  NonconformityParking Facilities. Such work shall be permitted for any building or structure which is nonconforming solely with respect to its existing parking facilities in accordance with the following: 
i.  If the total cost of such work to be performed exceeds thirty-seven percent of the fair market value of the building, then parking for the entire building as altered should be provided per Section 17.52.050. 
ii.  If the total cost of the work to be performed is less than or equal to thirty-seven percent of the fair market value of the building, and no additional parking spaces would otherwise be required for such work, then no additional parking spaces are required. 
iii.  If the total cost of the work performed is less than or equal to thirty-seven percent of the fair market value of the building, and such work would in itself require an additional number of parking spaces, then the minimum number of spaces shall be the greater of the following up to the number of spaces which would make the building as altered conform to Section 17.52.050: 
(A)  Seventy-five percent of the already existing number of spaces in the parking facility; or 
(B)  The number of spaces required for the alteration or enlargement. 
b.  Fee In Lieu of Parking. In lieu of providing the number of spaces required by subsection D(2)(a) of this section and upon application by the property owner, the city may, at its discretion, accept payment of fees or alternative methods to provide for the required parking off-site; provided, that such alternative is determined to be feasible and substantially equivalent to the provision of parking on-site. 
c.  Decorative Facade. If a building or structure is nonconforming solely due to lack of a decorative facade, any addition, alteration or replacement in excess of fifteen percent of the fair market value in any twelve-month period will require that the building be made to conform with all provisions of this code. 
(Ord. 2047 §§ 5 and 6, 1991: prior code § 9247.3)  
17.54.050 - Nonconforming uses. 
The following section applies to all nonconforming uses (see Chapter 17.08 of this code, Definitions) regardless of whether or not such use occupies whole or part of a lot or space. 
A.  Abandonment and Termination. Nonconforming uses may continue in all zones unless any of the following conditions occur: 
1.  There is a change from one use to a different use, or 
2.  There is an increase or enlargement of the area, space or volume of the building, structure or land devoted to the nonconforming use, except as provided here; or 
B.  Abatement by Operation of Law. Nonconforming buildings, uses and structures shall be abated, and usage shall be terminated, upon the expiration of the periods of time indicated hereafter in this subsection. The period of time shall begin on the date that such use, building or structure first became nonconforming by reason of the provisions of the zoning regulations of the city. 
1.  The nonconforming use has been abandoned for six months or more, or 
2.  Where the property is unimproved or paved; one year, or 
3.  Where the property is unimproved or paved, except for structures of a type for which the building code does not require a building permit, or which contain less than four hundred square feet of gross floor area: three years, or 
4.  A nonconforming use housed in a nonconforming building or structure shall be terminated within five years, or 
5.  A nonconforming use of a conforming building or structure: twenty years, except for such uses which are nonconforming solely by reason of a lack of off-street parking facilities. 
(Prior code § 9247.4)  
17.54.060 - Exemptions and exceptions. 
A.  Change of Use. A permitted use which is nonconforming only because it does not meet the requirements of the standards of development for that zone or the off-street parking requirements may be changed to a similar or less intense use permitted in the zone. No change of use shall extend the termination date for the original nonconforming use. 
B.  Buildings or Structures Under Construction. Any building or structure for which a building permit has been issued, and is in force prior to the operative date of any amendment to the provisions of this title which has the effect of rendering the building or structure nonconforming, may be completed and used; provided, that it is completed in accordance with the plans and specifications upon which the building permit was issued. The building permit must be validly issued and remain unrevoked and unexpired. 
C.  Existing Variances and Conditional Use Permits. No use, building or structure shall be defined as nonconforming for the purpose hereof, where it was previously authorized by a zone variance or conditional use permit, so long as the use, building or structure conforms with the terms and conditions of the variance or permit. The variance or permit must be validly issued and remain unrevoked and unexpired. 
D.  Public Utilities Exempted. The previous provisions hereof concerning the required removal of nonconforming buildings and uses, and the reconstruction of nonconforming buildings partially destroyed, shall not apply to public utility buildings and structures when such buildings and structures pertain directly to the rendering of the service or distribution of a utility, nor shall any provision hereof be applied so as to prevent the expansion, modernization or replacement of such public utility buildings, structures, equipment and features used directly for the delivery or distribution of the service. 
E.  Public Acquisition. Whenever any lot, building or any structure is rendered nonconforming within the meaning of this code by reason of a reduction in a required yard area, lot area or reduction in off-street parking facilities occurring by reason of 
(1)  Dedication to, or purchase by the city for any public purpose, or 
(2)  Eminent domain proceedings, the same shall be considered as conforming to the same extent as prior to the dedication or eminent domain proceedings; provided, that if the buildings and/or structures located on the lot are partially destroyed after such acquisition so that the reconstruction cost would exceed more than fifty percent of the fair market value of such building or structure, such reconstruction shall not take place unless compliance is had with Chapter 17.52 of this code, Off-Street Parking. 
F.  Nonconforming Uses in Conforming Buildings. A nonconforming use of a conforming building or structure which is nonconforming exclusively by reason of an inadequate number of off-street parking spaces shall conform to all of the provisions of this code, including, but not limited to, the off-street parking requirements hereof: 
1.  Where such building or structure is partially destroyed within the meaning of Section 17.54.040(C)(3); or 
2.  Where such nonconforming use is terminated as described in Section 17.54.050 (A) and (B). 
(Prior code § 9247.5)  
17.54.070 - Abatement procedure. 
A.  Where any of the facts set forth in this chapter are found to exist by the director of planning, or where he finds that the abatement period, as to a building, use or structure, as set forth in this chapter has expired, he shall issue a written order of abatement (hereafter "order"), and give notice. The order shall contain a description of the property affected; the basis for the issuance of such order; and the time within which the use shall terminate. The order shall be final and conclusive thirty days after the date of the giving of notice in the absence of an appeal. The decision of the director of planning may be appealed as described in Sections 17.54.090 and 17.54.100 as hereafter provided. The utilization of the nonconforming building, structure and/or use which is the subject of such an order, shall be terminated within the time specified in such order. The time for termination shall not exceed one year. Failure to issue a notice shall not prejudice the city's rights to subsequently issue such an order or subsequently to require compliance with the then applicable laws of the city. 
B.  Upon issuance of a written order of abatement by the director of planning, notice shall be given by mailing a copy of such order addressed to the owners and/or persons in possession of the property to which the order relates. Postage will be prepaid and addressed to their last known address as determined from records available to the director of planning, alternately, the director of planning may personally serve such person with copies of the order. 
(Ord. 2167 § 7, 1997: prior code § 9247.6)  
17.54.080 - Fair market value determination. 
A.  If the property owner disagrees with the planning department's determination of the fair market value of a legal nonconforming building for the purpose of administering any part of this chapter, the property owner may appeal this decision to the planning commission, with a further right of appeal to the city council.

17.54.090 - Appeal of abatement order. 
A.  Appeal. A recipient of an abatement order may appeal the director of planning's determination to the planning commission as provided in Chapter 17.78 of this code. Alternatively, the recipient using the same procedures, may request an extension of the amortization period applicable to the recipient's nonconforming use, building or structure. 
B.  Standard of Review. On appeal, the commission shall conduct a public hearing at which it shall uphold the director's determination and deny any requested extension unless the commission makes one or more of the following findings: 
1.  That the director wrongly determined that the use, building or structure subject to abatement is nonconforming; 
2.  That the director wrongly determined that the amortization period of the use, building or structure subject to abatement had expired; 
3.  That the director wrongly determined that the use, building or structure had been abandoned for a period of at least six months; 
4.  That to require cessation of such use, building or structure would impair the property rights of any person to such an extent as to be an unconstitutional taking of property; or 
5.  That such use, building or structure does not now and will not during the extension period requested: 
a.  Adversely affect the health, peace or welfare of persons residing or working in the surrounding area; and 
b.  Be materially detrimental to the use, enjoyment or valuation of the property of other persons located in the vicinity of the site; and 
c.  Jeopardize, endanger or otherwise constitute a menace to the public health, safety or general welfare. 
If circumstances exist as described in subsections (B)(3), (4) or (5) of this section, the commission may, but is not obligated to, extend the amortization period of a nonconforming use, building or structure. 
C.  Conditional Approvals. The commission, in approving an application to extend an amortization period may impose conditions which it deems necessary to insure that the extension will satisfy the required findings set forth in subsection (B)(5) of this section or to mitigate against any harm associated with a nonconforming use, building or structure if the commission makes a finding under subsection (B)(4) of this section. 
D.  Limitations on extensions of an amortization period. Extensions of an amortization period granted by the commission shall not be greater than ten years. 
E.  Evidentiary Burden. A person appealing a determination of the director or requesting an extension of an amortization period has the burden of proving that the findings required by subsection B of this section are satisfied.

(Ord. 2167 § 8, 1997)  
17.54.100 - Special amortization of nonconforming uses prior to expiration of amortization period. 
A.  Notwithstanding any contrary provision within this code, the director of planning may issue or recommend that the planning commission issue a special amortization order requiring the termination of a nonconforming use, building or structure prior to the date on which that use, building or structure would lose its legal nonconforming entitlement under this code. The order shall not require termination of the use, building or structure for at least one year from the date of the order, and shall not reduce the amortization period originally accorded to the use, structure or building by more than one-half. The abatement order shall be issued only if the director or commission concludes that: 
1.  Continuation of the nonconforming use, building or structure will adversely affect the health, peace or welfare of persons residing or working in the surrounding area; 
2.  Any alterations to the improvements on the property necessary to fully or partially satisfy the then current zoning will not result in a taking of property or a violation of law; and 
3.  Any cessation of a use on the property necessary to fully or partially satisfy the then current zoning will not result in a taking of property or a violation of law. 
B.  Appeal. A property or business owner affected by an order issued under this section may appeal that determination as provided in Chapter 17.78 of this code. An order may be sustained by the commission in its original, a modified or a conditional form if the commission makes the findings required by subdivision A. An order may be set aside if the commission cannot make the findings required by subdivision A or the commission finds that setting aside the order will serve the general welfare, equity or fairness. 
C.  Evidentiary Burden. The city shall have the burden to present evidence to sustain the findings required by subsection (A)(1). The property or business owner shall have the burden to make all other evidentiary showings. No evidence shall be considered in connection with such an application except for evidence contained in the application presented to the commission, reports prepared by the city, testimony presented at a hearing or other evidentiary submissions made at or prior to the hearing. 
D.  Other City Powers. Nothing in this section shall restrict the powers of the city to control or terminate a nonconforming use, building or structure using any power or remedies available to the city under this code or state law, including the power to abate nuisances. 
(Ord. 2167 § 9, 1997)

A property owner may also make such a request after the expiration of such time periods has passed. 
A.  Standard of Review. Upon receiving such a request, the commission shall conduct a public hearing at which it shall deny any requested extension unless the commission makes the findings as specified in Section 17.54.090(B)(4) or (5) of this chapter. If circumstances exist as described in Section 17.54.090(B)(4) or (5) of this chapter, the commission may, but is not obligated to, extend the amortization period of a nonconforming use, building or structure. 
B.  Conditional Approvals. The commission in approving such an extension may impose conditions which it deems necessary to insure that the extension will satisfy the required findings set forth in Section 17.54.090(B)(5) or to mitigate the impacts of an extension pursuant to Section 17.54.090(B)(4). 
C.  Limitations on Extensions of an Amortization Period. Extensions of an amortization period granted by the commission shall not be greater than ten years. Nothing in this section shall prohibit the approval of additional extensions of an amortization period. 
D.  Evidentiary Burden. A person requesting an extension of an amortization period has the burden of proving that the findings required by Section 17.54.090(B)(4) or (5) are satisfied. No evidence shall be considered in connection with such an application except for evidence contained in the application presented to the commission, reports prepared by the city, testimony presented at a hearing or other evidentiary submissions made at or prior to the hearing. 
(Ord. 2167 § 10, 1997)

A.  Standard of Review. Upon receiving such a request, the commission shall conduct a public hearing at which time it shall deny any requested transfer of entitlement unless it makes the following findings: 
1.  That such use at the proposed location will promote the overall health and welfare of the city; and 
2.  Negative impacts on the city will be reduced if the use is relocated from its current location to the proposed location. 
B.  Amortization Period for New Location. Upon the commission approving such a request, the remaining amount of the amortization period for the nonconforming entitlement shall transfer to the new location. Extensions of the amortization period or special amortization periods may be granted as specified in Sections 17.54.100 and 17.54.110. The commission shall also have the authority to approve a shorter amortization period than is otherwise specified in Sections 17.54.100 and 17.54.110. 
C.  Conditional Approvals. The commission in approving such a transfer of nonconforming entitlements may impose conditions which it deems necessary to insure that the transfer will satisfy the required findings as specified in subsection A of this section.

Chapter 17.60 - ADULT BUSINESS ZONING REGULATIONS* 
 
17.60.010 - Findings. 
It is the purpose and intent of this chapter to provide for the reasonable and uniform regulation of adult businesses in the city. It is recognized that adult businesses have a serious deleterious effect upon adjacent areas, as well as the areas in which they are located. It is therefore the purpose of this chapter to establish criteria and standards for the establishment and conduct of adult businesses which will protect the public health, safety and welfare, preserve locally recognized values of community appearance, minimize the potential for nuisances related to the operation of adult businesses, and maintain local property values. 
It is the purpose and intent of this chapter to establish proper regulations and to provide for a reasonable number of approximately located sites for adult businesses within the city, based upon the following findings: 
A.  The city council has reviewed the detailed studies, reports and letters prepared by other jurisdictions and its own staff with respect to the detrimental social, health and economic effects on persons and properties surrounding adult businesses. These studies included Upland, California (1992); Garden Grove, California (1991); Tucson, Arizona (1990); Seattle, Washington (1989); Austin, Texas (1986); Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (1986); Indianapolis, Indiana (1984); Houston, Texas (1983); Beaumont ,Texas (1982); Minneapolis, Minnesota (1980); Phoenix, Arizona (1979); Whittier, California (1978); Amarillo, Texas (1977); Cleveland, Ohio (1977); Los Angeles, California (1977); state of Minnesota, Attorney General Report (1989); Newport News, Virginia (1996); St Paul, Minnesota (1987); Corpus Christi, Texas (1995); and National Law Center (1995); (collectively "studies"). The studies substantiate the adverse, secondary effects of adult businesses. 
B.  Based on the foregoing studies and the other evidence presented, the city council finds that: 
1.  Adult businesses are linked to increases in the crime rates of those areas in which they are located and that surround them; and 
2.  Both the proximity of adult businesses to sensitive land uses and the concentration of adult businesses tend to result in the blighting and downgrading of the areas in which they are located. 
C.  The studies conducted in various communities in other jurisdictions have demonstrated that the proximity and concentration of adult businesses adjacent to residential, recreational, religious, educational or other adult businesses can cause other businesses and residents to move elsewhere. 
D.  The studies conducted in various communities in other jurisdictions have demonstrated that adult businesses are linked to increases in the crime rates and blighting of those areas in which they are located and that surround them. 
E.  The special regulation of adult businesses is necessary to ensure that their adverse secondary effects will not contribute to an increase in the crime rates or the blighting or downgrading of the areas in which they are located or surrounding areas. The need for the special regulation is based on the recognition that adult businesses have serious objectionable operational characteristics, particularly when several of them are concentrated under certain circumstances or located in direct proximity with sensitive uses such as residential zones and uses, parks schools, churches or day care centers, thereby having a deleterious effect upon the adjacent areas. 
F.  It is the purpose and intent of these special regulations to prevent the concentration or location of adult businesses in a manner that would create such adverse secondary effects. Thus, in order to protect and preserve the public health, safety and welfare of the citizenry, especially including minors, the special regulation of the time, place and manner of the location and operation of adult businesses is necessary. 
G.  The protection and preservation of the public health, safety and welfare require that certain distances be maintained between adult businesses and residential uses and zones, churches, schools, day care centers, parks and other adult businesses. 
H.  The need to regulate the proximity of adult businesses to sensitive land uses such as residential, religious, educational, recreational and other adult businesses are documented in studies conducted by other jurisdictions as listed elsewhere in this section. 
I.  The report of the state of Minnesota Attorney General's Working Group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses dated June 6, 1986, indicated that: 
1.  Community impacts of sexually oriented businesses are primarily a function of two variables, proximity to residential areas and concentration. Property values are directly affected within a small radius, typically one block, of the location of a sexually oriented business. Concentration may compound depression of property values and may lead to an increase of crime sufficient to change the quality of life and perceived desirability of property in a neighborhood; and 
2.  The impacts of sexually oriented businesses are exacerbated when they are located near each other. When sexually oriented businesses have multiple uses (i.e. theater, bookstore, nude dancing, peep booths), one building can have the impact of several separate businesses. 
J.  In consideration of the findings of the report of the state of Minnesota Attorney General's Working Group on the regulation of sexually oriented businesses dated June 6, 1986, it is appropriate to prohibit the concentration of multiple adult businesses within one building in order to mitigate the compounded adverse secondary effects associated with such concentrations as described above. 
K.  The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials, including sexually-oriented materials, that are protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution and the relevant provisions of the California State Constitution. 
L.  The proposed parking standards are necessary in the interests of the public health, safety and welfare to provide for an appropriate amount of off-street parking. 
M.  The city council takes legislative notice of the Penal Code provisions authorizing local governments to regulate matter that is harmful to minors (e.g. Penal Code Section 313 et seq.) The city council further takes legislative notice of cases that recognize that protection of minors from sexually explicit materials is a compelling government interest, including, but not limited to, Crawfore v. Lungren (9th Cir., 1996) 96 F.3d 380, cert. denied 520 U.S. 1117 (1997) and Berry v. City of Santa Barbara (1995) 40 Cal.App.4th 1075. 
N.  In adopting these regulations, the city council is mindful of legal principles relating to regulation of adult businesses and does not intend to suppress or infringe upon any expressive activities protected by the First Amendments of the United States and California Constitutions, but instead desires to enact reasonable time, place and manner regulations that address the adverse secondary effects of adult businesses. The city council has considered decisions of the United States Supreme Court regarding adverse secondary effects and the local regulation of adult businesses, including but not limited to: Young v. American Mini Theaters, Inc., 427 U.S. 50 (1976) (Reh. denied 429 U.S. 873); Renton v. Playtime Theaters, 475 U.S. 41 (1986) (Reh. denied 475 U.S. 1132); FW/PBS. Inc. v. Dallas, 493 U.S. 215 (1990); Barnes v. Glenn Theater, 501 U.S. 560 (1991), and City of Erie v. Paps A.M. (2000) 529 U.S. (2000 Daily Journal DAR 3255), United States Court of Appeals 9th Circuit decisions, including but not limited to: Topanga Press, et al. v. City of Los Angeles, 989 F.2d 1524 (1993); Kev, Inc. v. Kitsap County, 793 F.2d 1053 (9th Cir. 1986); Colacurcio v. City of Kent, 163 F.3d 545 (9th Cir. 1998), pet. For cert. Filed (1999); several California cases including but not limited to: Tily B. v. City of Newport Beach, 69 Cal.App.4th 1 (1998); City of National City v. Wiener, 3 Cal. 4th 832 (1993); People v. Superior Court (Lucero) 49 Cal.3d 14 (1989); and City of Vallejo v. Adult Books, et al., 167 Cal.App.3d 1169 (1985); and other federal cases including Lakeland Lounge v. City of Jacksonville (5th Cir. 1992) 973 F.2d 1255, Hang On, Inc. v. Arlington (5th Cir. 1995) 65 F.3d 1248, Mitchell v. Commission on Adult Entertainment (3rd Cir. 1993) 10 F.3d 123, International Eateries v. Broward County (11th Cir. 1991) 941 F.2d 1157, and Star Satellite v. City of Biloxi (5th Cir. 1986) 779 F.2d 1074. 
O.  The city has conducted its own study of its land use districts and planning areas and has determined that the establishment of adult business in the M-1 and M-2 zone designations is appropriate, subject to locational and distance requirements that promote the health, safety and general welfare of the public. The city also evaluated the locational and distance regulations in this chapter for separating adult businesses from sensitive land uses, and other adult businesses, and determined the location and distance requirements are appropriate to promote the health, safety and general welfare of the public. 
P.  The locational requirements do not unreasonably restrict the establishment or operation of constitutionally protected speech in the city and a sufficient reasonable number of appropriate locations for adult businesses are provided. 
Q.  The city council recognizes that the standards and regulations in this chapter do not preclude reasonable alternative avenues of communication. The city council takes note of the proximity of at least five adult businesses within thirty minutes (drive time) of the city in determining that the proposed standards do not preclude reasonable alternative avenues of communication. 
R.  The city council recognizes that a sufficient number of appropriate locations for establishing an adult business in the city are provided considering the city's predominant residential character (approximately fifty-nine percent is zoned for residential land use) and the fact that no formal requests to establish an adult business have been received by planning department staff. 
S.  Finally, the city council also takes note of the proliferation of adult material on the Internet and its availability as an alternative avenue of communication. The city council also considers and relies on published decisions examining the proliferation of communications on the Internet. Reno v. American Civil Liberties Union (1997) 521 U.S. 844 (the principal channel through which many Americans now transmit and receive sexually explicit communication is the Internet); see also: Anheuser-Busch v. Schmoke, 101 F.3d 325, 329 (4th. Cir. 1996) (rejecting First Amendment challenge to Baltimore ordinance restricting alcohol advertisements on billboards and acknowledging that the Internet is an available channel of communication); U.S. V. Hockings, 129 F.3d 1069 (9th Cir. 1997); and U.S. v. Thomas, 74 F.3d 701 (6th Cir. 1996) (cert denied 519 U.S. 820). The emergence of the Internet provides a virtually unlimited additional source of adult oriented sexual material available to persons without regard to geographic boundaries. An adult business no longer needs to be actually physically located within a city to be available to the community.

Chapter 17.61 - ALCOHOLIC BEVERAGE ESTABLISHMENTS 
 
17.61.010 - Purpose and intent. 
The purpose of this chapter is to preserve a healthy environment for residents and businesses by establishing a set of consistent standards for the safe operation of alcoholic beverage establishments. It is recognized that hospitality, entertainment, recreation and related businesses are a significant part of the city's economy, and that alcoholic beverage sales are important to the operation of these businesses. It is also recognized that alcohol abuse can create environments which jeopardize the continued success of these businesses and seriously affect the health, safety and general welfare in surrounding areas, particularly residential neighborhoods. 
The city council finds and determines that establishments engaged in the on-sale and off-sale of alcoholic beverages present problems that are encountered by residents of Montebello, including, but not limited to, littering, loitering, obstruction of pedestrian traffic, vehicular traffic, parking crime, interference with children on their way to school, interference with shoppers using the streets, defacement and damaging of structures, discouragement of more desirable and needed commercial uses and other similar zoning problems connected primarily with the operation of establishments engaged in the sale of alcoholic beverages for consumption on and off the premises. 
This chapter is intended to deal with and prevent these alcohol-related problems and conditions by: (a) imposing restrictions on the location of such establishments in relation to one another and in relation to facilities primarily devoted to use by children and families and the general public; and (b) requiring that each establishment obtain a conditional use permit in connection with its business operations or its events and activities which involve the sale of alcoholic beverages, and imposing conditions therein on a case by case basis, thereby limiting the number of such establishments in the city and preventing undesirable community impact of such uses by the imposition of reasonable conditions upon the operation of all such uses, both existing and in the future.

A.  Sign Area. 
1.  Cabinet Signs. The area of a cabinet sign is determined by the area of the sign face(s) enclosed by a frame or cabinet and is determined by the outer dimensions of the frame or cabinet surrounding the sign area. This includes the total area of the copy and the background. This applies to wall mounted cabinet signs and cabinet signs mounted on freestanding pole structures. (See Figures 17.62.070A and 17.62.070B) Architectural features are not considered in the sign area. (See Figure 17.62.070B) 
Figure 17.62.070A 
  
Figure 17.62.070B 
  
2.  Channel Letters and Individual Elements. When signs are constructed of individual elements such as channel letters and attached to a building wall, the sign area is determined by calculating the area of an imaginary box drawn around the most exterior area of all the letters and/or elements. (See Figure 17.62.070C) 
Figure 17.62.070C 
  
3.  Awnings. When signs are incorporated into an awning, the sign area is determined by computing the area of an imaginary box drawn around the sign elements. 
4.  Multiple Sign Cabinets. For freestanding signs that contain multiple cabinets on one structure, the area of each cabinet counts toward a combined total. If these are double or multiple faced cabinets, the sign area shall be calculated to include all faces of the sign. (See Figure 17.62.070D) 
Figure 17.62.070D 
  
B.  Height. The overall height of a sign or sign structure is measured from the ground directly below the sign to the highest point of the sign or sign structure. (See Figure 17.62.070E) 
C.  Clearance. Clearance is measured from the ground directly below the sign to the bottom of the sign structure enclosing the sign face. (See Figure 17.62.070E)

17.62.140 - Planned sign program. 
The purpose of a planned sign program is to encourage consistency of design and regulation and to allow flexibility of design for signs which are harmonious throughout a commercial or industrial development and which promote a positive identification and image. A planned sign program may be approved for freeway signs or for commercial or industrial centers on sites of twenty thousand square feet or more. An application for such program must be reviewed and approved by the planning commission. A planned sign program is intended to provide maximum incentive and latitude to encourage variety and good design of signs, and to allow response to special circumstances, but shall not be used to circumvent the objectives of this chapter. It is intended that signs approved per a planned sign program not be subject to the specific limitations contained in the foregoing provisions of this chapter, but that such signs be equal to or better than that which the specific code standards would otherwise yield. A planned sign program shall be evaluated on the merit of the program being presented (i.e., comprehensiveness, consistency, aesthetics, orientation and need of the advertisement). Conditions may be imposed to the extent that findings required for a sign program cannot be made without imposition of those conditions. 
A.  Review Standards. A planned sign program may be approved or conditionally approved by the planning commission only if the following findings are made: 
1.  The proposed signs are consistent with the intent of this chapter, the general plan and any applicable specific plans; 
2.  The proposed signs are aesthetically and architecturally consistent with each other; 
3.  The proposed signs are aesthetically and architecturally compatible with the buildings and developments they identify, taking into account building materials, colors and design; 
4.  The proposed signs are aesthetically compatible with the surrounding commercial development and existing sign treatment in the vicinity; and 
5.  Approval does not constitute a grant of special privilege or allow substantially greater overall visibility than the standard provisions of this chapter would otherwise provide. 
B.  Planned Sign ProgramApplication Form, Filing Fee. Application for a planned sign program shall be made by the property owner, the owner of an existing or proposed business on the site, or an authorized agent thereof, to the planning commission on a form provided for that purpose by the city. Such application shall be submitted to the planning department accompanied by filing fees in an amount established by resolution of the city council. 
1.  The following shall be submitted as a part of the application: 
a.  A completed application on a form provided for this purpose by the planning department; 
b.  A planned sign program narrative which provides a written description of the goals, objectives and sign criteria; and 
c.  Seventeen copies of the following: 
i.  A fully dimensioned and detailed plot plan of the site indicating the location of all existing and proposed signs, 
ii.  Facade elevations of all buildings showing all existing or proposed signs, 
iii.  Architectural details of all signs and sign structures, and

17.64.070 - Construction and demolition debris collection. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of this Section of Title 17 is to: 
1.  Implement California law as embodied in the California Waste Management Act of 1989 (California Public Resources Code Sections 40000 et seq.). Towards this end, the City of Montebello is required to prepare, adopt and implement source reduction and recycling plans to reach in order to meet these goals. 
2.  Promote the reduction of solid waste and is required to make substantial reductions in the volume of waste materials going to the landfills. 
3.  Acknowledge that solid waste materials from construction, demolition, and the renovation of buildings represent a significant portion of the volume of waste presently coming from the City of Montebello and much of this waste is particularly suitable for recycling and reuse. 
4.  Commit to the reduction of waste through the establishment of programs for recycling and salvaging of construction and demolition (C&D) waste. 
B.  CALGreen Requirements. The State of California requires certain construction projects to divert the current required percentage of project generated construction materials from disposal in landfills. This section of Title 17 of the City of Montebello Municipal Code will implement the state requirements at the local level. 
C.  Thresholds for Covered Projects. The following thresholds must be used to determine if a project is a covered project: 
1.  Private project where all construction, demolition, and renovation are projected to be one thousand square feet or greater, and all demolition-only projects shall be considered covered projects. 
2.  All city-sponsored construction, demolition and renovation projects that are projected to be one thousand square feet or greater shall be subject to this chapter, and consequently, shall be considered covered projects. 
D.  Diversion Requirements (Goals). The diversion goal for asphalt and concrete demolition debris will conform to state requirements. Clean inert waste used in engineered fills may not be counted as disposal or diversion (CalRecycle's CDI regulations [PRC Section 41821.3(h)]). 
E.  Waste Management Plan (WMP). 
1.  Application Submittal. Applicant(s) for construction or demolition permits involving a covered project is required to complete and submit a waste management plan (WMP), on a form approved by the City of Montebello for this purpose. The WMP shall be included in the application packet for the construction or demolition permit. The completed WMP shall be reviewed and approved by the compliance official prior to the issuance of a building permit, and shall indicate all of the following: 
a.  The estimated volume or weight of the project C&D material, by material type, to be generated (in estimating the volume or weight of materials identified in the WMP, the applicant shall use the conversion rates approved by the city for this purpose); 
b.  The maximum volume or weight of the materials that may be feasibly diverted or recycled; 
c.  The vendor or facility where the applicant proposes to use, collect or receive that material; and, 
d.  The estimated volume or weight of C&D materials that will be disposed of in Class III landfills and inert disposal facilities. 
2.  Performance Security Deposit. As a condition precedent to the issuance of any permit for construction or demolition for a covered project, the applicant shall submit a performance security deposit to the building and safety division along with the submittal of the WMP: 
a.  For construction and demolition projects, the amount of the performance security shall be calculated as the lesser of three percent of total project cost or thirty thousand dollars. 
b.  For demolition-only projects, the amount of the performance security required shall be calculated at the rate of one dollar per square-foot with a one thousand-dollar minimum and thirty thousand-dollar maximum. 
c.  The City of Montebello intends to use the deposit for the payment of diversion deposit refunds, as well as administrative costs associated with the C&D diversion program and/or program costs associated with the C&D diversion program, including infrastructure improvements to facilitate C&D waste diversion. 
3.  Compliance with WMP. Within thirty days after the completion of the demolition phase of any covered project, the applicant shall submit to the WMP compliance official, documentation that the diversion requirement for the project has been met. The applicant shall provide a summary of efforts used to meet the diversion requirement and also provide the following documentation: 
a.  Receipts from the vendor or facility which collected or received each material showing the actual weight or volume of that material; 
b.  Weight slips/count of material salvaged or reused in current project; 
c.  A copy of the previously approved WMP for the project adding the actual volume or weight of each material type diverted and disposed of in landfills; 
d.  Any additional information the applicant believes is relevant to determining its efforts to comply in good faith with this section; 
e.  The WMP compliance Official shall review the information submitted under subsections a. through d. of this section to determine whether the applicant has complied with the diversion requirement as follows: 
i.  If the WMP compliance Official determines that the applicant has fully complied with the diversion requirement applicable to the project, he or she shall cause the full performance security to be released to the applicant. 
ii.  If the WMP compliance official determines that the diversion requirement has not been met, he or she shall return only that portion of the performance security equivalent to the portion of C&D material actually diverted compared to the portion that should have been diverted according to the WMP. Any portion of the performance security not released to the applicant shall be forfeited to the city, and shall be used to recover any city costs associated with sorting of mixed C&D loads, and its transfer. If the WMP compliance official determines that the applicant has fully failed to comply with the diversion requirement or if the applicant fails to submit the documentation required by subsections 1. through 4. of this section within the required time period, then the entire performance security shall be forfeited to the city. All forfeited performance securities shall be used to recover city costs associated with sorting of mixed C&D loads, and its transfer. The city may, by formal resolution, modify the amount of the required deposit. 
F.  Weighing of Wastes. Applicants shall ensure that all C&D material diverted or disposed of in landfills are measured and recorded using the most accurate method of measurement available. To the extent practical, all C&D material shall be weighted by measurement on scales. Such scales shall be in compliance with all state and county regulatory requirements for accuracy and maintenance. For C&D material for which weighing is not practical due to small size or other considerations, a volumetric measurement shall be used. For conversion of volumetric measurements by weight, the applicant shall use the standardized conversion rates approved by the city for this purpose. 
G.  Diversion Requirement Exceptions. If an applicant for a covered project experiences circumstances that the applicant believes make it infeasible to comply with the diversion requirement, the applicant may apply for a diversion requirement exemption at the time that he or she submits the waste management plan required under subsection E: 
1.  Exemptions may be granted based on the following factors: 
a.  Lack of storage space on-site; 
b.  Contamination by hazardous substances; or, 
c.  Low recyclability of specific materials.

k.  Projects where no foundation or other structural building modifications are required. 
3.  The applicant shall indicate on the WMP the maximum rate of diversion he or she believes is feasible for each material and the specific circumstances that he or she believes make it infeasible to comply with the diversion requirement. 
4.  If the WMP compliance official determines that it is infeasible for the Applicant to meet the diversion requirement due to unique circumstances, he or she shall determine the maximum feasible diversion rate for each material and shall indicate this rate on the WMP submitted by the Applicant. 
5.  Upon a denial by the WMP compliance official, the applicant shall have thirty days to resubmit a WMP form in full compliance with subsection E. If the applicant fails to resubmit the WMP, or if the resubmitted WMP does not comply with subsection E, the WMP compliance official shall deny the WMP. 
H.  Appeals. The applicant or any interested person may appeal to the city council from any ruling of the WMP compliance official made pursuant to this chapter in accordance with section. Notice of any appeal from the ruling of the WMP compliance official must be filed within ten days of the date that such ruling is made.
