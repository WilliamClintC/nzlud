CHINO, CALIFORNIA MUNICIPAL CODE 
____________ 
A Codification of the General Ordinances of 
Chino, California 
____________ 
Beginning with Supp. No. 13,
Supplemented by Municipal Code Corporation 
____________ 

> 
PREFACE 
    The Chino Municipal Code, originally published by Book Publishing Company in 1978, has been kept current by regular supplementation by Municipal Code Corporation, its successor in interest. 
    During original codification, the ordinances were compiled, edited and indexed by the editorial staff of Book Publishing Company under the direction of Jimmy Gutierrez, city attorney. 
    The Code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 13, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through 2019-005, passed June 4, 2019.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 13, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    As of Supplement No. 13, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 13, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 13, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Instruction Sheet. 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Instruction Sheet. This guide will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, this code was numbered with consecutive page numbers. As it is amended, new material may require the insertion of new pages that are numbered with hyphens. (Example: 31, 32, 32-1.) Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) are left unnumbered but the number is "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version.

(Prior code § 10-5.) 
1.08.040 - Release-Amount and deposit of bail. 
    The officer releasing an arrested person, as provided in Section 1.08.030, shall as soon as practical file the duplicate notice with the magistrate specified therein.

Editor's note- Ord. No. 2014-014, § 1, adopted Sept. 16, 2014, amended ch. 1.15 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former ch. 1.15, §§ 1.15.010-1.15.090, pertained to similar subject matter, and derived from Ord. 2004-06 § 1 (part), 2004; Ord. 2004-17 §§ 1-5, 2004; Ord. 2005-07 § 1, 2005; Ord. 2007-05 § 1, 2007; Ord.

A.  This chapter makes any violation of this code subject to an administrative citation and fine. A violation includes, but is not limited to, any violation of this code, adopted or uniform code, or other ordinance of the city and for failing to comply with any condition imposed by any entitlement, agreement or environmental document issued or approved under the provisions of this code. 
B.  This chapter establishes the administrative procedures for the imposition, enforcement, collection, and review of administrative citations and fines pursuant to Government Code section 53069.4 and the city's police power. 
C.  The issuance of an administrative citation under this chapter is solely at the city's discretion and is one option the city has to address violations of this code. By adopting this chapter, the city does not intend to limit its discretion to utilize any other remedy, civil or criminal, to enforce the provisions of this code and any other ordinance of the city. 
D.  The purpose of issuing administrative citations pursuant to this chapter is to encourage voluntary and complete compliance with the provisions of this code and to eliminate nuisances for the protection and benefit of the entire community. 
E.  Because of the serious blighting conditions that can result affecting the residents' health and safety, this chapter is intended to impose strict civil liability upon the owners, lessees, and tenants of real property for all violations.

C.  The city may take into consideration the fact that a person has been issued administrative citations when the city is determining whether to grant, suspend, revoke, or deny any permit, license, or any type of land use approval for the person and such administrative citations are evidence that the person has committed acts that are not compatible with the health, safety and general welfare of other persons and businesses in the vicinity. 
(Ord. No. 2014-014, § 1, 2014.) 
1.15.040 - Administrative citation - building or zoning violation.

When an administrative citation is issued for a building or zoning violation under Titles 15 or 20, respectively, and the violation does not pose an immediate danger, a citee shall have at least fifteen calendar days to correct such building or zoning violation. A citee may be given more than fifteen days to correct or otherwise remedy a building violation if deemed necessary and appropriate by the enforcement official. Notwithstanding section 1.15.030, no responsible person shall be liable for an administrative fine unless and until such building or zoning violation continues after the time period allowed for correction as specified on the administrative citation.

The director's decision shall be in writing and is final. The filing of a request for such extension does not, unless granted, extend the correction period or any other time periods set by this chapter.

The second and any subsequent administrative citation(s) issued to a responsible person within twelve months of the first administrative citation shall be effective, due, and payable immediately upon issuance. Additional administrative citations may be issued and fines imposed for every day the violation continues uncorrected from the date the second administrative citation is issued. 
D.  If, upon re-inspection, the enforcement officer determines the violation has been corrected, he or she shall issue a notice to the citee indicating correction has been made.

    An administrative citation may be served as follows: 
A.  An enforcement officer may personally serve the administrative citation on the citee.

Notwithstanding the foregoing, the failure or refusal of a citee to sign the administrative citation shall not affect its validity or the service of the citation. 
B.  Alternatively, an enforcement officer may mail the administrative citation by registered United States mail to the citee. The administrative citation shall be mailed to the citee's address shown on the county's last equalized property tax assessment rolls for a property-related violation, or to any address known for the citee for all other violations. Service shall be deemed complete at the time of deposit into the mail. 
C.  An enforcement officer may post a copy of the administrative citation on the property in a conspicuous place for a property-related violation when the citee resides at an unknown address other than where the violation occurs. A copy of the administrative citation shall also be mailed to the citee at the property address by registered United States mail. 
(Ord. No. 2014-014, § 1, 2014.)

1.15.080 - Administrative fine - payment. 
A.  A fine shall be payable to the city and paid as indicated on the administrative citation within fifteen calendar days from the date the administrative citation is issued. 
B.  Payment of a fine shall not excuse the citee from correcting the code violation. The issuance of an administrative citation and/or payment of a fine does not bar the city from taking any other enforcement action regarding a code violation that is not corrected. 
C.  In the event that a fine imposed pursuant to an administrative citation remains unpaid for ninety days after such administrative citation is issued, the amount of such fine shall be doubled as a late penalty and become due immediately. In the event the citee requests an administrative hearing pursuant to section 1.15.090, the late penalty will be assessed if the fine remains unpaid sixty days after final decision by the hearing officer, as provided herein.

To be effective, the request form must be filed with the city clerk within five business days of the date the citation was issued. If mailed, the request form shall be deemed filed with the city clerk on the date on which it is received in the office of the city clerk. 
B.  A citee who requests a hearing must deposit with the city clerk the amount of the proposed fine to ensure his or her appearance at the hearing. A request for a hearing shall not be complete unless accompanied by the deposit, and shall be rejected. 
C.  In the event the citee files a timely and complete request form and pays the required deposit, the director or designee shall advise the citee in a notice by mail, no later than five days after receiving the citee's request, of the date, time, and location set for the hearing. The hearing shall be set on a date no less than ten days and no more than forty-five days after the date of the notice unless otherwise agreed upon by the city and the citee. 
D.  Failure to timely and properly file a request for a hearing, as set forth herein, shall constitute a waiver of all rights of appeal, and a failure to exhaust administrative remedies. The administrative citation shall then be final. 
E.  The hearing officer shall be selected by the director and compensated for the time expended in providing such service based upon a written agreement for that purpose. The hearing officer's employment or compensation shall not be based on the number of citations affirmed or denied by the hearing officer. 
(Ord. No. 2014-014, § 1, 2014.) 
1.15.100 - Administrative hearing - rules and procedures. 
A.  A hearing requested under this chapter shall be conducted by a hearing officer and shall proceed solely on the issues and defenses raised in the hearing request form. 
B.  The city shall have the burden to establish, by a preponderance of the evidence, the truth of any matter in the citation that has been contested by the citee. The citation and any reports prepared by the enforcement officer shall be admitted into evidence and shall constitute prima facie evidence of the violation(s). The city may present such other evidence as may be necessary or helpful to the hearing officer to resolve the issues raised by the citee. 
C.  The citee shall be given the opportunity to testify and present evidence relevant to the matters raised in the hearing request form regarding the violation(s) described in the citation. 
D.  The hearing shall be conducted informally and the rules of evidence need not be followed, provided the decision of the hearing officer on any material issue may not be based on hearsay evidence alone. 
E.  The unexcused failure of the citee to appear at the hearing shall constitute an admission of the truth of all matters contained in the citation and a validation of the fine or fines imposed in the citation, which shall be ordered in the decision of the hearing officer. 
F.  The hearing officer may continue the hearing on a citation upon the request of the citee, or the citee's representative, or the representative of the city upon a showing of good cause. All continuance requests shall be made in person at the hearing. If the continuance is granted, a new hearing date shall be set within fifteen days. 
G.  After considering all the evidence and testimony submitted at the hearing, the hearing officer shall issue his or her written decision on the contested citation within seven calendar days. The decision of the hearing officer shall either uphold or deny the citation or any portion thereof and state the facts and reasons supporting the decision. The hearing officer also shall order the imposition of a fine in the amount stated in the citation and compliance with the Municipal Code within five days. The original written decision shall be mailed to the city clerk and a copy thereof shall be mailed to the citee. 
H.  All decisions and orders of a hearing officer shall become final unless appealed by the citee as provided herein. 
(Ord. No. 2014-014, § 1, 2014.) 
1.15.110 - Request for judicial review. 
A.  After a hearing officer issues a decision pursuant to an administrative hearing conducted under this chapter, the citee or the city may seek judicial review of that decision by filing an appeal with the superior court having jurisdiction over the violation within twenty calendar days from the date of issuance of the notice of decision in accordance with California Government Code section 53069.4. 
B.  Request for judicial review by appeal is not permitted for a decision based on the citee's failure to appear at the administrative hearing or upon any other waiver of the administrative hearing by the citee or the city. All such decisions shall, therefore, be final. 
(Ord. No. 2014-014, § 1, 2014.) 
1.15.120 - Administrative fines - collection. 
A.  Each final decision of a hearing officer that establishes the amount of a fine(s) payable by a citee to the city shall constitute a money judgment and sister state judgment, enforceable pursuant to applicable laws. 
B.  In addition to any other remedy available to the city, the director or designee may request that the fine or fines imposed by a decision of a hearing officer be collected as an assessment lien on the property on which the violation(s) occurred by requesting the city council to adopt an appropriate resolution to place the amount of said fine or fines on the San Bernardino County tax rolls for collection. The resolution of the city council shall conform with the County of San Bernardino Auditor/Controller-Recorder's policies and procedures for applying special assessments to the tax rolls. The following procedures shall apply to such assessment liens: 
1.  A notice of proposed assessment lien shall be served on the owner of the property in the same manner as the administrative citation was served on the owner or by mailing said notice, by certified mail with a return receipt, to the address shown on the official records of the county assessor. The notice shall state the amount of the fine or fines sought to be imposed as an assessment lien, the legal description of the property on which the assessment lien is sought to be imposed and the owner's right to appeal said proposed action by filing a written appeal within ten days from the date of service or mailing of said notice. The notice shall warn the owner that a failure to file a written appeal with the city clerk within said ten-day period shall constitute a waiver of the owner's right to appeal the imposition of the proposed assessment lien on the owner's property. If the city council, by resolution, adopts a fee to defray the expenses to process and conduct a hearing on said appeal, the notice also shall state the amount of the fee and that payment of the fee is a condition precedent to the effectiveness of the owner's right to appeal. 
2.  Within ten days from the date of service or mailing of said notice, the property owner may file a written appeal to the proposed assessment lien and any required fee with the city clerk or waive the right to such an appeal. The city council shall hear the appeal at its first regular meeting that is at least fourteen calendar days after the date on which the appeal was filed. Written notice of the hearing date shall be served on the owner, at least, ten days prior to the hearing on the appeal. At the hearing on the appeal, the city council shall consider the order of the hearing officer imposing the fine or fines on the citee, the computation of the amount of the proposed assessment lien, the evidence that the owner owns the property on which the assessment lien is sought to be imposed and the evidence that the violation or violations supporting the order of the hearing officer occurred at or was related to the property on which the assessment lien is sought to be imposed. At the conclusion of the hearing, the city council may adopt, or decline to adopt, a resolution to place an assessment lien on the property of the owner. The city council also may modify the amount of the proposed assessment lien. The decision of the city council shall be final. 
3.  If no appeal is filed pursuant hereto, the director shall prepare and submit a resolution to the city council that imposes an assessment lien on the property of the owner. The city council shall adopt the proposed resolution unless it determines that such an assessment lien would not be appropriate.

A.  The Political Reform Act, Government Code Sections 81000, et seq., requires state and local government agencies to adopt and promulgate conflict of interest codes. The Fair Political Practices Commission has adopted a regulation, 2 Cal. Adm. Code Section 18730, which contains the terms of a standard conflict of interest code, which can be incorporated by reference, and which may be amended by the Fair Political Practices Commission to conform to amendments in the Political Reform Act after public notice and hearings. Therefore, the terms of 2 Cal. Adm. Code Section 18730 and any amendments to it duly adopted by the Fair Political Practices Commission are incorporated by reference in the ordinance codified in this chapter and, along with the appendix set forth at the end of this chapter in which officials and employees are designated and disclosure categories are set forth, constitute the conflict of interest code of the City of Chino. 
B.  Pursuant to Section 4(B) of the standard code, designated employees shall file statements of economic interests with the agency which shall make and retain a copy and forward the originals to the code reviewing body which shall be the filing officer. 
C.  Incorporation by reference of the terms of this regulation along with the designation of employees and the formulation of disclosure categories in the appendix referred to at the end of this chapter constitute the adoption and promulgation of a conflict of interest code within the meaning of Government Code Section 87300 or the amendment of a conflict of interest code within the meaning of Government Code Section 87307 if the terms of this regulation are substituted for terms of a conflict of interest code already in effect. A code so amended or adopted and promulgated requires the reporting of reportable items in a manner substantially equivalent to the requirements of Article 2 of Chapter 7 of the Political Reform Act, Government Code Sections 81000, et seq. The requirements of a conflict of interest code are in addition to other requirements of the Political Reform Act, such as the general prohibition against conflicts of interest contained in Government Code Section 87100, and to other state or local laws pertaining to conflicts of interest. 
D.  The terms of a conflict of interest code amended or adopted and promulgated pursuant to this regulation are as set forth in this chapter.

    This code does not establish any disclosure obligation for those designated employees who are also specified in Government Code Section 87200 if they are designated in this code in that same capacity or if the geographical jurisdiction of this agency is the same as or is wholly included within the jurisdiction in which those persons must report their financial interests pursuant to Article 2 of Chapter 7 of the Political Reform Act, Government Code Sections 87200, et seq. Such persons are covered by this code for disqualification purposes only. With respect to all other designated employees, the disclosure categories set forth in the appendix specify which kinds of financial interests are reportable. Such a designated employee shall disclose in his or her statement of economic interests those financial interests he or she has which are of the kind described in the disclosure categories to which he or she is assigned in the appendix.

Chapter 2.68 - MOBILEHOME PARK RENT REGULATION 
Sections: 

2.68.010 - Purpose and intent. 
A.  In 1978, the residents of the City of Chino adopted the current mobilehome park rent stabilization ordinance, as Chapter 2.68 of the Chino Municipal Code. In adopting the ordinance, the residents made the following findings: (1) that there was a shortage of spaces for the location of mobilehomes resulting in a low vacancy rate and rising space rents for mobilehome owners, (2) that mobilehome owners have invested substantial sums in their mobilehomes and appurtenances, (3) that alternate sites for the relocation of mobilehomes are difficult to find, (4) that moving and installation of mobilehomes is expensive with possible damage to them, (5) that the purpose of that chapter is to protect the owners of mobilehomes from unreasonable space rent increases but recognizing the owners of mobilehome parks were entitled to receive a fair return on their investment, (6) and that another purpose of the ordinance is to encourage mobilehome owners to maintain and improve their mobilehomes and to assure that space rent increases do not deter such owners from so doing. 
B.  The residents of the City of Chino find that there continues to be a shortage of mobilehome spaces in the City of Chino. In the past twenty years, no new mobilehome parks have been built in the City of Chino while other housing type has continued to be constructed. Further, the population of the City of Chino has increased by twelve and one half percent from the 1990 to the 2000. Because of this shortage, there is a low vacancy rate and rents are presently rising and causing concern among a substantial number of mobilehome park residents. Because of the high cost of moving mobilehomes and related potential damage to them; the requirements relating to the installation of mobilehomes including permits, landscaping and site preparation; the lack of alternative sites for mobilehomes and the substantial investment of mobilehome owners, there is an imbalance in the supply of mobilehome park spaces compared to the demand for such spaces resulting in pressure to increase space rents. 
C.  Mobilehome owners are in the unique position of having made a substantial investment in a mobilehome that is situated on land that is rented or leased. Therefore, both the park owner and the mobilehome owner have a financial stake in the relationship. Additionally, because mobilehome park spaces are virtually unavailable and relocating difficult and costly, the closure of a mobilehome park or its change of use has serious consequences for mobilehome owners, who may find it impossible to relocate a comparable park. 
D.  The current mobilehome park rent stabilization ordinance has become difficult to administer for a number of reasons including the unwillingness of mobilehome park owners and mobilehome owners to serve as members on the mobilehome park review committee, as currently required, delays in the hearing process due to the inability to constitute the committee, an absence of more clear definitions and standards and the prohibition against amending the ordinance without a vote of the residents of the City of Chino. 
E.  For these reasons, among others, the residents of the City of Chino find and declare the necessity to protect mobilehome owners from unreasonable space rent increases, while at the same time recognizing the need of park owners to receive a fair return on their investment in their mobilehome parks. In addition, the residents of the City of Chino find that it is necessary to permit the city council to amend this ordinance from time to time depending on changes in circumstances that are not now foreseeable.

2.68.090 - Computation and determination of rent increases. 
A.  Formula Increases. Space rents shall be increased annually by no more than sixty-six percent of the total percentage change in the CPI for the applicable CPI adjustment period as determined by the city manager pursuant to this chapter, unless a park owner chooses not to impose a formula increase on any spaces in his or her park, except that the formula increase must be imposed on all spaces in the park that are subject to rent control, or not be imposed on any spaces at all. Calculation of the one-year formula increases shall be from the 1st of January to the 31st of December of each calendar year. Formula increases for any part or all of calendar year 2001 shall be from the date of the last increase before January 1, 2001, to the anniversary date in 2001, then adjusted again for the remainder of 2001, using the last available CPI data before the date on which the determination must be made. In the event that a space rent must be adjusted for a period of less than twelve months, then the change in the CPI shall be applied in the same proportion as the number of months for which the change is contemplated is a proportion of twelve. 
1.  Any park owner or mobilehome owner who wishes to challenge any formula increase must do so by filing an appeal of the city manager's decision within thirty days of the decision. 
2.  The appeal shall be on a form prepared by the director of community development. Failure to file the appeal in a timely manner shall waive any grounds for the appeal, and the appeal shall be rejected by the commission. 
3.  The date of filing the appeal shall be determined by the postmark, if mailed, or by the date of delivery, if presented to the office of the director of community development in person or by messenger. 
4.  The appeal shall be referred to the rent stabilization commission, which shall hold a hearing in accordance with Section 2.68.100(C) of this code. The decision of the commission shall be final. 
B.  Vacancy Increases. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection A of this section, upon vacancy, space rent may be increased up to twenty percent of the then-current maximum allowable rent permitted by this chapter prior to the vacancy; except that if the space becomes vacant because the mobilehome owner renting that space is evicted by court order or abandons the space, the rent on the space may be increased one time to the amount of rent the park charges on spaces exempt from rent control under Section 2.68.030 of this chapter. After that increase, future increases of that space's rent shall be limited to those permitted by Sections 2.68.080 and 2.68.090. 
C.  Adjustments to Assure a Fair Return on Investment. A park owner may file an application, as required by the administrative rules adopted by the commission, to adjust the rent for one, some or all the spaces in a mobilehome park in order to achieve a fair return on the owner's investment in the park. In connection with any such adjustment, all relevant evidence shall be considered including, but not limited to the following: 
1.  The rent being charged by comparable mobilehome parks; 
2.  The amount of investment by the park owner in the mobilehome park, including without limitation, acquisition costs; 
3.  The rate of return on investment earned by the park owner in previous years; 
4.  The rate of return on investment earned by other mobilehome parks in the city and surrounding or comparable areas; 
5.  The mobilehome park's pattern of income and expenses over each of the past five years; 
6.  The quality of the services, amenities and maintenance provided at the mobilehome park and any decrease or increase in services, maintenance and amenities in the current year. 
D.  Special and Limited Rent and Rent Increases. 
1.  Government Required Services. The mobilehome owner shall pay to the park owner, on the herein described terms, no less than ninety days after the park owner has notified the mobilehome owner in writing, the increased costs to the park owner of government required services, which are to be included as part of the mobilehome owner's rent but separately listed items on the monthly statement. 
a.  For the purposes of this chapter, "government required services" shall be defined as services required by governmental agencies which are new or in addition to those services legally required to be provided by the park owner to mobilehome owners or to the mobilehome park on December 31, 2001. 
b.  Such services include fees and charges legally levied by an agency of federal, state or local government upon the park owner. Such services do not include predictable expenses for operation of the mobilehome park, such as common-area utilities expenses or expenses that maintain the safe and healthful use of mobilehome park facilities. 
c.  The park owner's actual out-of-pocket costs of providing government required services may be charged to the mobilehome owner upon sixty days' written notice, using the following formula: amount actually paid by the park owner, divided by the total number of spaces in the mobilehome park, divided by twelve months, equals the sum for government required services to be charged to the mobilehome owner. Notwithstanding the formula described above, only those costs of providing governmental required services in the twelve months immediately preceding the proposed charge shall be reimbursed to the park owner by the mobilehome owner in the manner herein described. The park owner shall charge the mobilehome owner only those costs for government required services that are not reimbursed to the park owner by insurance or other sources. 
2.  Sublease Surcharge. Notwithstanding the provisions of subsection A of this section, upon sublease of a space and/or lease of a mobilehome, the space rent may be increased up to ten percent of the rent otherwise permitted under this chapter. This rent surcharge shall be effective only for the duration of the sublease and shall be eliminated when and if the sublease is terminated. A sublease surcharge shall not become effective until twelve months after the last vacancy increase pursuant to subsection B of this section. The sublease surcharge rent amount shall be calculated separately and shall not be included in the maximum allowable rent for the purposes of calculating formula increases pursuant to subsection A of this section. The provisions of this subsection shall not apply to those spaces granted hardship exemptions pursuant to subsection E of this section for as long as the space is eligible for such exemption. 
E.  Sublease Hardship Exemption. Upon application, the city manager may grant a hardship exemption in connection with the sublease surcharge, which exemption shall last for a term of one year. At the expiration of any particular term of the exemption, the applicant may apply to renew the one year term by again establishing qualification for the exemption. The application and renewal application shall be in the forms provided by the city manager with a copy to the park owner and, shall include sufficient evidence to establish whether the applicant qualifies for an exemption pursuant to this section and shall be signed by the applicant under penalty of perjury. The city manager shall grant the exemption for any qualified applicant. 
1.  Qualification. To qualify for the sublease hardship exemption, the applicant must satisfy all of the following criteria: 
a.  The applicant must own a mobilehome at the applicable park, and must have occupied said mobilehome as his or her primary residence for a minimum of three years prior to applying for this exemption. 
b.  The applicant must present adequate evidence that he or she would qualify for the other city low or very-low income assistance program. 
c.  The combined value of assets owned by the applicant must not exceed one hundred fifty thousand dollars excluding the value of the mobilehome itself. 
d.  No person other than the applicant can declare the applicant as a dependent for purposes of federal or state taxes. 
    In the event that the applicant, after receiving the hardship exemption, at any time ceases to satisfy all of the foregoing criteria, from that point on, the applicant will not be qualified to receive, and shall not receive, the hardship exemption. 
2.  Effect of Exemption. Each applicant who qualifies for the hardship exemption shall be exempt from the sublease surcharge provided in Section 2.68.090(E) of this chapter. 
(Ord. 2004-12 § 1, 2004; Ord. 2003-05 § 6, 2003; Ord. 2001-07 § 2 (part), 2001.) 
2.68.100 - Commission review of rent increases. 
A.  1. In order to implement a rent increase as permitted under Section 2.68.090(C) of this chapter or a rent decrease based on a reduction of housing services, the applicant must file with the director of community development an application and all supporting documents in accordance with the administrative rules adopted by the commission. 
2.  Where the park owner is the applicant, the park owner shall serve each affected mobilehome owner, either personally or by mail, with written notice of the proposed increase, in accordance with state law, and with notice that a request for approval of the increase is being filed with the director of community development. Where a mobilehome owner (or mobilehome owners) is the applicant, the mobilehome owner shall served the affected park owner by mail or personally at the address and to the person designated in the registration form submitted by the park owner to receive notices on behalf of the park owner. The applicant shall file proof of such service with the director of community development concurrent with the filing of the rent increase or decrease application. Copies of the application requesting the increase and all required supporting documentation shall be available to each mobilehome owner requesting same at the park owner's office at the mobilehome park. 
B.  If the director of community development determines that the application or supporting documentation is not complete, accurate, or not in compliance with this chapter or administrative rules of the commission, within twenty-one days of the date on which the application was filed, he or she shall give written notice to the application of the deficiencies and advised of the time in which to comply. 
C.  The director of community development shall set a hearing before the commission on any request complying with the requirements of this chapter no sooner than twenty days and no later than forty days after the application is accepted as complete. The director of community development shall send written notice to the park owner, who shall notice each mobilehome owner sought to be subjected to a rent increase and post such notice in a conspicuous place, of the time and place set for the hearing. If the commission approves an increase as requested, or lower than requested, the same shall take effect as noticed by the owner or as the commission may otherwise direct. 
D.  In the application for rent adjustment under this chapter, the park owner shall indicate which, if any, of the mobilehome spaces are covered by leases or contracts which provide for more than a month-to-month tenancy, together with expiration date of each such lease or contract.

F.  The commission may promulgate regulations to effect the purpose of this section and to assure fair hearings. 
(Ord. 2001-07 § 2 (part), 2001.) 
2.68.120 - Standards for evaluating rent increases. 
A.  Factors for Consideration. In evaluating an application on a proposed rent increase, the commission shall consider all relevant factors including, but not limited to, changes in costs to the park owner's income from the operation of the park, utility rates, property taxes, insurance, advertising, variable mortgage interest rates, governmental assessments and fees, incidental services, employee costs, normal repair and maintenance, capital improvements, addition of amenities or service and the level of rent necessary to permit a fair return on the owner's investment in the mobilehome park. 
B.  Presumption of Fair Rate of Return. Except as provided in subsection C of this section, it shall be presumed that the base rent adjusted pursuant to Section 2.68.090(A) and (B) of this chapter provides a fair return to the park owner. 
C.  Rebutting the Presumption. The commission may determine that the base rent adjusted pursuant to Section 2.68.090(A) and (B) yielded other than a fair return on an owner's investment in the park and thereby adjust the base rent accordingly. In order to make such a determination, the commission must make at least one of the following factual findings: 
1.  The park owner's operating and maintenance expenses in the base year were unusually high or low in comparison to other years. In such instance, adjustments may be made in such expenses so the operating expenses in the base year or subsequent years reflect average expenses for the property over a reasonable period of time. The commission shall consider all relevant factors including the following: 
a.  The mobilehome park owner made or failed to make substantial capital improvements to the park, 
b.  Substantial repairs were made due to damage caused by natural disaster and vandalism, 
c.  Maintenance and repair was below accepted standards so as to cause significant deterioration in the quality of housing services, 
d.  Other expenses were unreasonably high or low, notwithstanding the following of prudent business practice. In making this determination, the fact that property taxes may be higher than in the base year shall not be considered, 
e.  It is not the intent of this chapter to reward inefficient business practices. 
2.  The return on the owner's investment in the park in the base year was unusually high or low in comparison to other years for that park or in comparison to other parks during the base year. For this purpose, the commission shall consider all relevant evidence. 
D.  No Pass Through Expenses. No single expenditure or cost of an improvement shall result in a rent increase unless the factors enumerated herein based upon the totality of the circumstances warrant a space rent increase. 
E.  Availability of a Fair Return of Return. Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to prevent the grant of a rent adjustment upon application by a park owner when required to permit a fair return on the owner's investment in the park. This section is a saving clause, which provides the basis for the city to receive relevant evidence, in accordance with applicable regulations, demonstrating that a park owner is not receiving a fair return on the owner's investment in the park. 
(Ord. 2001-07 § 2 (part), 2001.) 
2.68.130 - Commission decision and authority on rent adjustments. 
A.  A park owner shall bear the burden of proof and the burden of producing evidence on its application; and a mobilehome owner shall bear the burden of proof and the burden of producing evidence on its application. The decision of the commission shall be based on the preponderance of the evidence at the hearing. All parties to the hearing shall be advised of the commission's decision and given a copy of the findings upon which the decision is based. 
B.  Consistent with its findings, the commission may: 
1.  Permit the requested increase to become effective, in whole or in part. 
2.  Deny the increase. 
3.  Order a reduction in rent to a rate determined by the commission, if circumstances justify. 
4.  Order that the park owner reimburse the applicant(s) the full amount, or any part of the amount, of the application fee where (a) the applicant for a rent reduction was successful; (b) the park owner has not proven that the rent reduction ordered or the award of costs would deprive the park owner of a fair return as defined in this chapter; and (c) circumstances otherwise warrant the award of costs to the applicant. 
C.  If the commission finds that an increase that went into effect, or any portion thereof, is not justified, the park owner shall refund the amount found to be unjustified to the mobilehome owner within sixty days after the decision of the commission is issued, plus interest at the annual rate of ten percent. 
D.  If the commission finds that a proposed increase, or any portion thereof, of which mobilehome owners were notified previously, is justified, the commission shall order the mobilehome owner to pay that sum to the park owner, plus interest at the annual rate of ten percent. The park owner shall notify the mobilehome owner in writing of the commission's decision within ten days. The commission shall specify in its order the method of payment of the amount due, either in a lump sum or in monthly installments. If payment is to be in a lump sum, such sum shall be paid no less than ninety days after service of the written notice by the park owner on the mobilehome owner. If payment is to be in monthly installments, no installment shall be due until at least ninety days after service of the written notice by the park owner on the mobilehome owner. 
E.  The decision and findings of the commission shall be final although the commission may reconsider its decision upon an appropriate written request. 
F.  Any party disputing the final decision and findings of the commission may seek review thereof pursuant to Sections 1094.5 and 1094.6 of the California Code of Civil Procedure. 
(Ord. 2003-12 § 5, 2003: Ord. 2003-05 § 8, 2003; Ord. 2001-07 § 2 (part), 2001.) 
2.68.140 - New and prospective mobilehome owners. 
A.  Prior to or at the time of agreeing to rent or lease a space to a new mobilehome owner in a mobilehome park, the park owner shall provide each new mobilehome owner or prospective mobilehome owner with a copy of each of the following documents: 
1.  The mobilehome park rent stabilization ordinance as currently in force; 
2.  A current copy of the Mobilehome Residency Law (California Civil Code Section 798.17; 798.21 and 798.45); 
3.  A sample lease with proposed terms; 
4.  A sample rental agreement with proposed terms, including the protected base rent as calculated under this chapter; 
5.  All rules and regulations of the park. 
B.  Prior to or at the time of agreeing to rent or lease a space to a new mobilehome owner in a mobilehome park, the park owner shall provide each new mobilehome owner or prospective mobilehome owner with the following information: 
1.  The rent charged to the last previous occupant of the space, if the space was subject to rent control under this chapter, along with a copy of the last rent statement payable by the previous occupant; 
2.  Any anticipated assessments that could affect the new or prospective mobilehome owner; 
3.  Any past or pending litigation in the past five years involving rent control in the mobilehome park that could affect the new or prospective mobilehome owner. 
C.  No park owner may require, directly or indirectly, that any mobilehome owner or prospective mobilehome owner sign a lease or rental agreement that provides that it shall be exempt from local rent control or provides for space rent in excess of that permitted by this chapter as a condition of tenancy in the park and no owner may deny a tenancy to a prospective purchaser of a mobilehome in the park on the ground that the prospective purchaser will not sign such a lease or rental agreement. 
D.  No park owner shall attempt to intimidate or influence a prospective mobilehome owner to sign a long-term lease without advising the prospective mobilehome owner that he or she has the option to sign a month-to-month rental agreement. 
E.  The park owner shall provide each prospective mobilehome owner who seeks to rent or lease a space in the mobilehome park a written notice stating that the prospective mobilehome owner is entitled to receive, and has received, the documents and information listed in subsections A and B of this section, and listing the documents and reciting the information that are required. The notice shall contain a place for the mobilehome owner to acknowledge receipt of the notice. The park owner shall sign an acknowledgment that the required notice has been given to the mobilehome owner and provide the mobilehome owner with a copy of the executed acknowledgment. If the prospective mobilehome owner signs a rental agreement or a long-term lease and takes a space in the park, the park owner shall maintain a copy of the acknowledgement and a copy of the notice signed by the mobilehome owner, as long as the mobilehome owner remains in the park. 
F.  If a mobilehome park offers long-term leases to prospective mobilehome owners, the park owner shall post a printed notice in its rental/leasing office, in print no smaller than forty-eight-point, advising prospective mobilehome owners that they have the option to enter into either a month-to-month rental agreement or a long-term lease. 
G.  All mobilehome park owners shall provide to each prospective mobilehome owner a written notice stating that he or she is not required to sign any agreement on the first visit to the mobilehome park, and that, if he or she wishes, he or she may take up to three days to review a proposed rental agreement or long-term lease, including all of the proposed terms, before signing any document. If the prospective mobilehome owner signs a rental agreement or a long-term lease and takes a space in the park, the park owner shall maintain a copy of the notice referred to in this subsection, signed by the mobilehome owner, as long as the mobilehome owner remains in the park. 
(Ord. 2003-12 § 6, 2003: Ord. 2001-07 § 2 (part), 2001.) 
2.68.150 - Mobilehome owner's right of refusal. 
    A mobilehome owner may refuse to pay any increase in rent that is in violation of this chapter. Such refusal to pay shall be a defense in any action brought to recover possession of a mobilehome space or to collect the rent increase. 
(Ord. 2001-07 § 2, 2001.) 
2.68.155 - Avoidance of premiums on sale of mobilehomes. 
A.  It is not the purpose of the city to permit the payment of premiums to mobilehome owners upon the sale of mobilehomes that are subject to rent control under the ordinance codified in this section. Therefore, any mobilehome owner who wishes to sell his or her mobilehome must advise the owner of the mobilehome park in which the mobilehome is located within ten days of listing the mobilehome or placing it on the market, whichever is earlier. The mobilehome owner shall also advise the park owner of the listing price of the mobilehome. Upon entering an escrow for the sale of a mobilehome or prior to consummating a sale of a mobilehome, a mobilehome owner shall provide copies of the documents pertaining to the sale of the mobilehome to the mobilehome park owner. 
B.  Whenever a mobilehome park owner believes that a mobilehome owner is about to sell or has sold a mobilehome at a premium, the mobilehome park owner may petition the mobilehome rent stabilization commission for a hearing to determine whether the mobilehome is being or was sold at a premium. 
C.  The mobilehome rent stabilization commission shall hold a hearing in accordance with the provisions of this code, and in particular, Section 2.68.100 and Section 2.68.110. The director of community development shall notify the park owner and the mobilehome owner of the date, time, and location of the hearing. The park owner shall provide to the director of community development for this purpose the current or last known address of the mobilehome owner. 
D.  If the commission determines that the mobilehome was sold at a premium, the commission shall order the selling mobilehome owner to pay the premium to the park owner within a reasonable time. The decision of the commission shall be final. If the commission determines that a mobilehome was sold at a premium and that the selling mobilehome owner must pay a sum to the park owner, the park owner may file an action in the Superior Court of San Bernardino County to enforce the commission's decision. Such action must be filed within ninety days from the date on which the commission's decision is issued. 
E.  If the commission orders the selling mobilehome owner to pay the premium to the park owner, and the park owner cannot, for any reason, obtain the premium from the selling mobilehome owner despite good faith reasonable efforts to do so, the park owner may petition the commission for a rent increase on the space where the sold mobilehome is located sufficient to reimburse the park owner for the premium, amortized over a reasonable time to be determined by the commission. If it finds that the park owner could not obtain the premium from the selling mobilehome owner despite good faith and reasonable efforts to do so, the commission shall grant the increase. This rent increase may only be imposed if the purchaser who purchased the mobilehome from that seller is renting the space at the time the rent increase is granted. Once the premium is paid, the rent on the space shall be reduced by the amount of the increase the commission granted to reimburse the park owner for the premium. 
(Ord. 2004-12 § 2, 2004; Ord. 2003-12 § 7, 2003: Ord. 2003-05 § 9, 2003.) 
2.68.160 - Retaliatory eviction. 
    Notwithstanding Section 2.68.160, in any action brought to recover possession of a mobilehome space, the court shall consider as grounds for denial any violation of any provision of this chapter. Further, the determination that the action was brought in retaliation for the exercise of any rights conferred by this chapter shall be grounds for denial. Any action brought within one year of a petition or complaint filed with the commission by the mobilehome owner pursuant to this chapter shall be presumed to be retaliatory; this presumption affects the burden of proof, and is rebuttable by the park owner.

2.68.180 - Violations. 
A.  If any park owner demands, accepts, receives or retains any payment of rent in excess of the maximum lawful space rent, as determined under this chapter, then the mobilehome owners in such mobilehome park affected by such violation, individually or by class action, may seek relief in a court of appropriate jurisdiction for injunctive relief and damages. The prevailing party will recover costs and reasonable attorneys' fees as part of any court judgment. 
B.  Any person violating any provision, or failing to comply with any requirement of this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor. Any person convicted of a misdemeanor under the provisions of this chapter shall be punished by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars or by imprisonment for a period of not more than six months, or by both.

(Ord. 75-15 § 14, 1975.) 
Chapter 3.20 - TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX 
Sections: 

3.20.010 - Short title. 
    This chapter shall be known as the "Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax Ordinance of the City of Chino." 
(Prior code § 22-10.) 
3.20.020 - Definitions. 
    For the purpose of this chapter, the following words and phrases shall have the meanings respectively ascribed to them by this section: 
A.  "Hotel" means any structure, or any portion of any structure, which is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodginghouse, roominghouse, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, mobile home or house trailer at a fixed location, or other similar structure or portion thereof. 
B.  "Occupancy" means the use or possession or the right to the use or possession of any room or rooms or portion thereof in any hotel for dwelling, lodging, or sleeping purposes. 
C.  "Operator" means the person who is proprietor of the hotel whether in the capacity of owner, leasee, subleasee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, or any other capacity. Where the operator performs his functions through a managing agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purpose of this chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both. 
D.  "Person" means any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate, or any other group or combination acting as a unit. 
E.  "Rent" means the consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and property and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever. 
F.  "Tax administrator" means the city clerk. 
G.  "Transient" means any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit right of access, license, or other agreement for a period of thirty consecutive calendar days or less, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such person so occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed a transient until the period of thirty days has expired, unless there is an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for a longer period of occupancy. In determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date of this chapter may be considered. 
(Prior code § 22-11.) 
3.20.030 - Imposed-Amount and payment. 
    For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel, each transient is subject to and shall pay a tax in the amount equal to the percentage of the rent charged by the operator as prescribed by resolution. Any surcharges added to the room fee by the operator to recover unanticipated cost increases become part of the rent, and as such, are also subject to this tax. Such tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the city, which is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the city. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid with each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient's ceasing to occupy space in the hotel. If for any reason the tax due is not paid to the operator of the hotel, the tax administrator may require that such tax shall be paid directly to the tax administrator. 
(Ord. 2001-05 § 1 (part), 2001: Ord. 78-13 § 8, 1978: prior code § 22-12.) 
3.20.040 - Registration of hotels-Certificate. 
    Within thirty days after the effective date of this chapter, or within thirty days after commencing business, whichever is later, each operator of any hotel renting occupancy to transients shall register such hotel with the tax administrator and obtain from him a "Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate" to be at all times posted in a conspicuous place on the premises. Such certificate shall, among other things, state the following: 
A.  The name of the operator; 
B.  The address of the hotel; 
C.  The date upon which the certificate was issued; 
D.  "This Transient Occupancy Registration Certificate signifies that the person named on the face hereof has fulfilled the requirements of the Uniform Transient Occupancy Tax Ordinance by registering with the Tax Administrator for the purpose of collecting from transients the Transient Occupancy Tax and remitting said tax to the Tax Administrator. This certificate does not authorize any person to conduct any lawful business in an unlawful manner, nor to operate a hotel without strictly complying with all local applicable laws, including but not limited to those requiring a permit from any board, commission, department or office of this city. This certificate does not constitute a permit." 
(Prior code § 22-15.) 
3.20.050 - Exemptions. 
A.  No tax shall be imposed upon: 
1.  Any person as to whom, or any occupancy as to which, it is beyond the power of the city to impose the tax herein provided; 
2.  Any federal or state officer or employee when on official business; 
3.  Any officer or employee of a foreign government who is exempt by reason of express provision of federal law or international treaty.

(Prior code § 22-13.) 
3.20.060 - Collection by operators. 
    Each operator shall collect the tax imposed by this chapter to the same extent and at the same time as the rent is collected from every transient. The amount of tax shall be separately stated from the amount of the rent charged, and each transient shall receive a receipt for payment from the operator. No operator of a hotel shall advertise or state in any manner, whether directly or indirectly, that the tax or any part thereof will be assumed or absorbed by the operator, or that it will not be added to the rent, or that, if added, any part will be refunded except in the manner provided in this chapter. 
(Prior code § 22-14.) 
3.20.070 - Returns and remittances. 
    Each operator shall, on or before the last day of the month following the close of each calendar quarter, or at the close of any shorter reporting period which may be established by the tax administrator, make a return to the tax administrator on forms provided by him of the total rents charged and received and the amount of tax collected for transient occupancies. At the time the return is filed, the full amount of the tax collected shall be remitted to the tax administrator. The tax administrator may establish shorter reporting periods for any certificate holder if he deems it necessary in order to insure collection of the tax and he may require further information in the return. Returns and payments are due immediately upon cessation of business for any reason. All taxes collected by operators pursuant to this chapter shall be held in trust for the account of the city until payment thereof is made to the tax administrator. 
(Prior code § 22-16.) 
3.20.080 - Operator to retain record for three years. 
    It shall be the duty of every operator liable for the collection and payment to the city of any tax imposed by this chapter to keep and preserve, for a period of three years, all records as may be necessary to determine the amount of such tax as he may have been liable for the collection of and payment to the city, which records the tax administrator shall have the right to inspect at all reasonable times. 
(Prior code § 22-20.) 
3.20.090 - Failure to remit tax-Penalties. 
A.  Original Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter within the time required shall pay a penalty of ten percent of the amount of the tax in addition to the amount of the tax. 
B.  Continued Delinquency. Any operator who fails to remit any delinquent remittance on or before a period of thirty days following the date on which the remittance first became delinquent shall pay a second delinquency penalty of ten percent of the amount of the tax, in addition to the amount of the tax and the ten percent penalty first imposed. 
C.  Fraud. If the tax administrator determines that the nonpayment of any remittance due under this chapter is due to fraud, a penalty of twenty-five percent of the amount of the tax shall be added thereto, in addition to the penalties stated in subsections A and B of this section. 
D.  Interest. In addition to the penalties imposed, any operator who fails to remit any tax imposed by this chapter shall pay interest at the rate of one-half of one percent per month or fraction thereof on the amount of the tax, exclusive of penalties, from the date on which the remittance first became delinquent until paid. 
E.  Penalties Merge with Tax. Every penalty imposed and such interest as accrues under the provisions of this section shall become a part of the tax herein required to be paid. 
(Prior code § 22-17.) 
3.20.100 - Operator's failure to collect tax-Assessment by tax administrator. 
    If any operator fails or refuses to collect such tax and to make, within the time provided in this chapter, any report and remittance of such tax or any portion thereof required by this chapter, the tax administrator shall proceed in such manner as he may deem best to obtain facts and information on which to base his estimate of the tax due. As soon as the tax administrator shall procure such facts and information as he is able to obtain upon which to base the assessment of any tax imposed by this chapter and payable by an operator who has failed or refused to collect the same and to make such report and remittance, he shall proceed to determine and assess against such operator the tax, interest and penalties provided for by this chapter. In case such determination is made, the tax administrator shall give a notice of the amount so assessed by serving it personally or by depositing it in the United States mail, postage prepaid, addressed to the operator so assessed at the last known place of address. Such operator may within ten days after the serving or mailing of such notice make application in writing to the tax administrator for a hearing on the amount assessed. If application by the operator for a hearing is not made within the time prescribed, the tax, interest and penalties, if any, determined by the tax administrator shall become final and conclusive and immediately due and payable. If such application is made, the tax administrator shall give not less than five days' written notice in the manner prescribed herein to the operator to show cause at a time and place fixed in the notice why the amount specified therein should not be fixed for such tax, interest and penalties. At such hearing the operator may appear and offer evidence why such specified tax, interest and penalties should not be so fixed. After such hearing, the tax administrator shall determine the proper tax to be remitted and shall thereafter give written notice to the person in the manner prescribed herein of such determination and the amount of such tax, interest and penalties. The amount determined to be due shall be payable after fifteen days unless an appeal is taken as provided in Section 3.20.100. 
(Prior code § 22-18.) 
3.20.110 - Determination of tax administrator-Appeal. 
    Any operator aggrieved by any decision of the tax administrator with respect to the amount of such tax, interest and penalties, if any, may appeal to the council by filing a notice of appeal with the city clerk within fifteen days of the serving or mailing of the determination of tax due. The council shall fix a time and place for hearing such appeal and the city clerk shall give notice in writing to such operator at his last known place of address. The findings of the council shall be final and conclusive and shall be served upon the appellant in the manner prescribed above for service of notice of hearing. Any amount found to be due shall be immediately due and payable upon the service of notice. 
(Prior code § 22-19.) 
3.20.120 - Refunds. 
A.  Whenever the amount of any tax, interest, or penalty has been overpaid or paid more than once or has been erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city under this chapter, it may be refunded as provided in subsections B and C of this section; provided, a claim in writing therefor, stating under penalty of perjury, the specific grounds upon which the claim is founded is filed with the tax administrator within three years of the date of payment. The claim shall be on forms furnished by the tax administrator. 
B.  An operator may claim a refund or take as credit against taxes collected and remitted the amount overpaid, paid more than once, or erroneously or illegally collected or received when it is established in a manner prescribed by the tax administrator that the person from whom the tax has been collected was not a transient; provided, however, that neither a refund nor a credit shall be allowed unless the amount of the tax so collected has either been refunded to the transient or credited to rent subsequently payable by the transient to the operator. 
C.  A transient may obtain a refund of taxes overpaid, paid more than once, or erroneously or illegally collected or received by the city by filing a claim in the manner provided in subsection A of this section, but only when the tax was paid by the transient directly to the tax administrator, or when the transient, having paid the tax to the operator, establishes to the satisfaction of the tax administrator that the transient has been unable to obtain a refund from the operator who collected the tax. 
D.  No refund shall be paid under the provisions of this section unless the claimant establishes his right thereto by written records showing entitlement thereto. 
(Prior code § 22-21.) 
3.20.130 - Action by city to collect tax. 
    Any tax required to be paid by a transient under the provisions of this chapter shall be deemed a debt owed by the transient to the city. Any such tax collected by an operator which has not been paid to the city shall be deemed a debt owed by the operator to the city. Any person owing money to the city under the provisions of this chapter shall be liable to an action brought in the name of the city for the recovery of such amount. 
(Prior code § 22-22.) 
3.20.140 - Violation-Penalty. 
A.  Any person violating any of the provisions of this chapter shall be guilty of a misdemeanor and shall be punishable therefor by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars, or by imprisonment in the city jail for a period of not more than six months, or by both such fine and imprisonment. 
B.  Any operator or other person who fails or refuses to register as required herein, or to furnish any return required to be made, or who fails or refuses to furnish a supplemental return or other data required by the tax administrator, or who renders a false or fraudulent return or claim is guilty of a misdemeanor and is punishable as aforesaid. Any person required to make, render, sign, or verify any report or claim who makes any false or fraudulent report or claim with intent to defeat or evade the determination of any amount due required by this chapter to be made is guilty of a misdemeanor and is punishable as aforesaid.

2.  If the service user is certain that the maximum payment as defined in this section will be paid, the service user may approach the city at any time during the year to arrange for a single payment or monthly payments. Credit shall be applied for any utility users taxes paid within the year as demonstrated by the service user. The tax administrator will then notify the appropriate service supplier to extinguish the utility users tax charge on all billings for the service user for the remainder of the year; 
3.  If upon the completion of a calendar year a service user has paid utility users taxes in excess of the amounts provided in this section, the service user may bring in proof of utility payments and receive a refund from the city for any utility users tax payments that are over the maximum as defined herein.

C.  The service supplier shall provide the city with amounts refused and/or unpaid along with the names and addresses of the service users neglecting to pay the tax imposed under provisions of this chapter.

In the event this chapter is repealed, the amounts of any refundable taxes will be borne by the city.

In establishing these development impact fees, the city council finds that they are consistent with the city's general plan and applicable specific plans and master plans, and declares that it has considered the effects of such fees with respect to the city's housing needs defined in the housing element of the city general plan, and the standards and criteria for public facilities applied in comparable developments within the city, in accordance with California Government Code Section 65913.2.

3.40.100 - Developer construction of public facilities. 
A.  Whenever a developer is required, as a condition of approval of a development permit, to construct a public facility described herein which public facility is determined by the city to have supplemental size, length or capacity over that needed for the impacts of that development, and when such construction is necessary to ensure efficient and timely construction of the public facilities network and the development itself, a reimbursement shall be offered. The reimbursement amount shall not include the portion of the public facility needed to provide services or mitigate the need for the public facility or the burdens created by the development. The specific procedures for reimbursements and credits shall be as set out in this section. 
B.  1.  The amount of the reimbursement agreement provided for in subsection A of this section shall be based on the construction costs of the public facilities constructed by the developer based on a table of equivalent costs for similar construction which table of equivalent costs shall be developed by the city engineer and revised annually. 
2.  The actual amount of the reimbursement shall be determined and certified by the city engineer based on the final completion of all public facilities and based on final accepted and approved "as-built" plans and specifications. 
3.  The reimbursement agreement shall specify the amount of reimbursement to the developer from the development impact fee fund. All such reimbursements shall be paid only from the appropriate account within the development impact fee fund such that reimbursements for any public facility shall be made from the account within the fund containing moneys collected for financing of specific projects of a similar nature to those constructed by the developer who is the holder of the reimbursement agreement. 
4.  No reimbursement agreement shall be for a period of more than ten years. 
C.  Nothing in this section shall relieve any development project from paying the fees set out in Section 3.40.030 of this chapter. 
D.  At the option of the city, after acceptance of the public facilities by the city engineer, the developer may be offered one of the following, in lieu of a reimbursement agreement as set out in subsections A and B of this section: 
1.  Payment in cash; or 
2.  A ten-year non-interest-bearing note for the amount of the excess public facilities, with the note to be payable only from the appropriate development impact fee fund account, as, if, and when moneys are available within the ten-year period. If no moneys are available, then the note shall expire as unpaid at the end of the ten-year period. 
E.  In the event that the required public facilities are constructed by the developer, then the following procedure shall be utilized to calculate the developer's development impact fees: 
1.  The cost of the public facilities constructed by the developer shall be determined as set out in subsection B of this section. 
2.  All applicable development impact fees payable by the development project pursuant to Section 3.40.030 of this chapter shall be computed. 
3.  If the development impact fees, or any individual development impact fee required to be computed and paid under the provisions of Section 3.40.030 of this chapter exceeds the amounts under the provisions of subsection (B)(1) of this section, then the development project shall pay the difference into the appropriate account within the development impact fee fund. 
4.  If the required development impact fee for any category of fee is less than the cost of public facilities constructed by the developer under the provisions of subsection (B)(1) of this section, then the developer shall be given a credit against said fee in an amount not to exceed the fees which are otherwise payable. 
5.  If the required development impact fee for any category of fee is less than the cost of the public facilities constructed the developer under the provisions of subsection (B)(1) of this section, then a reimbursement agreement as set out herein shall be offered for the difference between the construction cost and the fee within each category of fee. 
6.  All reimbursement agreements shall be paid only from the appropriate account within the development impact fee fund. 
F.  Voluntary Construction of Public Facilities. The city acknowledges that a public facility described in the reports may be constructed by an owner or developer who is not required to install it. In the event such an owner or developer desires to construct a public facility described in the reports, the owner or developer may request an agreement with the city through which the owner or developer agrees to construct the public facility and receives reimbursement for the actual costs to construct the public facility from the appropriate development impact fee account when funds are available. In such event, the city council may agree to enter into such agreement provided the agreement complies with the provisions of this Chapter 3.40 except that such a reimbursement agreement may exceed ten years in duration; the agreement is approved by the director of public works and city attorney; the public facility is constructed according to city-approved plans and city standards; and the costs to construct the public facility are confirmed by the director of public works.

(Ord. 2015-006, § 1, 2015.) 
3.40.110 - Fee adjustments. 
A.  A developer of any development project subject to the fees described in this chapter may apply to the city council for a reduction or adjustment to that fee, or a waiver of that fee, based upon the absence of any reasonable relationship or nexus between the impacts of that development and either the amount of the fee charged or the type of facilities to be financed. The application shall be made in writing and filed with the city clerk not later than (1) ten days prior to the public hearing on the development permit application for the project, or (2) if no development permit is required, at the time of the filing of the request for the building permit. The application shall state in detail the factual basis for the claim of waiver, reduction or adjustment. The city council shall consider the application at the public hearing on the permit application or at a separate hearing held within sixty days after the filing of the fee adjustment application, whichever is later. The decision of the city council shall be final. If a reduction, adjustment or waiver is granted, any change in use within the project shall invalidate the waiver, adjustment or reduction of the fee. 
B.  Additional reductions, adjustments, waivers, and deferrals of any development impact fee as set out in Section 3.40.030 shall be permitted as set forth in this section. 
C.  If any development impact fee or connection charge is paid to another city or utility district other than the City of Chino, which other city or utility district serves a portion of the City of Chino, for property not served by utilities by the City of Chino, then in that event no development impact fee for that classification of development impact fee shall be due and payable to the City of Chino pursuant to Section 3.40.030 hereof. If no development impact fee or connection charge is paid to the other city or utility district, then all applicable development impact fees shall be paid to the City of Chino in full pursuant to the fee schedules established under Section 3.40.030 of this chapter. 
D.  The then-existing general overhead rate shall be applied to the computation of any fee due to another city or utility district, which is collected by the City of Chino, and such overhead amount shall be retained by the city, with the fee only being transmitted to the other city or utility district. 
E.  A deannexation petition for the parcel of property not served by Chino utilities but served within the City of Chino by another city or utility district, may be entertained by the City of Chino and the payment of development impact fees under Section 3.40.030 hereof deferred until the deannexation petition is disposed of and final jurisdiction determined. No such deferral shall be made for more than one hundred eighty days. 
F.  The city council may adjust, reduce, or waive any development impact fee as permitted by Chapter 20.14.

Chapter 3.45 - THE PRESERVE DEVELOPMENT IMPACT FEES 
Sections: 

3.45.010 - Legislative findings. 
A.  Basis for calculation of development impact fees. The city approves, adopts, and incorporates the Development Impact Fee Calculation and Nexus Report and the Master Facilities Plan, dated December 28, 2017, and prepared by Revenue and Cost Specialists, LLC, (the "Reports") which establish the: 
1.  Need for and nexus to required public facilities in The Preserve; 
2.  Total cost of such public facilities, including design, engineering, construction, installation and management of such construction and installation; 
3.  Allocation of such cost among the residential, commercial, and industrial types of development; 
4.  Formulas based on the density of residential unit development and the square footage of commercial and industrial building development, to determine the amount of fees payable for each such type of development; 
5.  Specific fees payable for each residential unit and square footage of commercial and industrial buildings in each development project; 
6.  Relationship between the use of the fees and the type of uses within development projects on which the fees are imposed; 
7.  Relationship between the need for such public facilities and the type of uses within development projects on which the fees are imposed; and 
8.  Reasonable cost of constructing and installing such public facilities. 
B.  Need for Public Facilities. In order to implement the goals and objectives of the city's general plan and applicable specific plans and master plans by accommodating the public facilities' needs, and mitigating the financial and physical impacts for all development projects within The Preserve identified in the reports, certain public facilities consisting of law enforcement facilities, vehicles and equipment; fire facilities, vehicles and equipment; streets, signals, and bridges; storm drainage collection facilities; water source, storage, and distributions systems; sewage collections systems; general facilities, vehicles and equipment; public use facilities; and miscellaneous residential amenities must be constructed and installed, and paid for or financed. 
C.  Need for Development Impact Fees. Therefore, the city council has determined, based on the reports, the city's general plan, and applicable specific plans and master plans, as well as substantial evidence submitted in public hearings by the planning commission and city council, that development impact fees are needed for The Preserve in order to finance these public facilities and to allocate the responsibility to pay each development project's fair share of the costs of constructing and installing such public facilities. 
D.  Consistency with City General, Specific and Master Plans. In establishing these development impact fees, the city council finds that they are consistent with the city's general plan and applicable specific plans and master plans, and declares that it has considered the effects of such fees with respect to the city's housing needs defined in the housing element of the city general plan, and the standards and criteria for public facilities applied in comparable developments within the city, in accordance with California Government Code Section 65913.2. 
E.  Use of Development Impact Fees. Development impact fees are established for each development project located within The Preserve, predicated on the following findings regarding their use: 
1.  Law Enforcement Facilities, Vehicles, and Equipment. A fee for law enforcement facilities, vehicles, and equipment is established to finance the equipping, transportation, and housing of new police officers required to provide police protection. 
2.  Fire Suppression Facilities, Vehicles, and Equipment.

These fees will be used to install fire facilities consistent with the Chino Valley Independent Fire District's master plan. 
3.  Circulation (Streets, Signals, and Bridges) System. A fee for streets, signals, and bridges is established to finance the construction of streets, signals, and bridges within the development area and in areas outside the development area but impacted by the development. The fee will be used to construct streets, signals, and bridges consistent with the circulation element of the city's general plan, and shall include any fee established by the County of San Bernardino to satisfy regional circulation requirements. Additionally, a congestion management program (part of the circulation (streets, signals, and bridges) system category) fee is established for regional transportation improvements. 
4.  Storm Drainage Collection Facilities. A fee for storm drainage collection facilities is established to finance the installation of water drainage channels, natural treatment systems and pipelines. The fee will be used to install water drainage facilities in accordance with the city master plan of drainage for The Preserve. 
5.  Water Source, Storage, and Distribution Facilities. A fee for water source, storage, and distribution facilities is established to finance the installation of reservoirs, wells, major transmission lines and recycled water facilities. The fee will be used to construct reservoirs, wells, major transmission lines and recycled water facilities, in accordance with the city water master plan for The Preserve. 
6.  Sewage Collection Facilities. A fee for sewage collection facilities is established to finance the installation of sewage collection and transmission mains. The fee will be used to install sewage collection and transmission mains in accordance with the city's sewer master plan for The Preserve. 
7.  General Facilities, Vehicles, and Equipment. A fee for general facilities, vehicles, and equipment is established to finance the general office and work facilities and equipment used by city staff when undertaking daily duties. 
8.  Public Use (Community Center) Facilities. A fee for public use facilities is established to finance meeting and recreational facilities used by the general public.

(Ord. 2004-13 § 4 (part), 2004) 
(Ord. 2017-015, § 11, 2018.) 
3.45.050 - Regional transportation fee adjustments. 
A.  The city is working with other jurisdictions to fund and/or construct regional transportation improvements, including portions of the DIF public facilities, which may serve The Preserve and/or reduce traffic impacts within or around the area of a development project within The Preserve. 
B.  In the event the city, or other governmental agency, receives federal, state or regional public agency or entity grant funds for all or any part of the engineering design, construction or over-sizing of any regionally significant transportation DIF project, the city shall delete the amount of such project funds from The Preserve DIF calculation of costs at the next DIF adjustment and to adjust the DIF accordingly, if such project initially was included within those financed by such DIF. 
C.  Any fees previously paid for engineering design, construction or other costs of over-sizing of projects that are subsequently granted such funding shall be fully reimbursable. 
D.  The amount of such reimbursement shall be as described herein and determined by the city engineer, whose decision may be appealed to the city council under Section 3.45.130. 
(Ord. 2004-13 § 4 (part), 2004.) 
3.45.060 - Method of fee adjustment. 
    The adjustment of fees pursuant to Sections 3.45.040, 3.45.050, 3.45.120 or 3.45.130, will be made by resolution of the city council subject to the requirement for a public hearing, with this chapter being considered as enabling and directive, and as setting only the initial fees. 
(Ord. 2004-13 § 4 (part), 2004.) 
3.45.070 - Creation of special fund and accounts. 
A.  There is created a development impact fee fund for The Preserve, within the city's fund structure and accounting system, which shall contain all fees collected pursuant to this chapter and all interest accruing from the investment of such fees contained within the fund. 
B.  Each fee collected pursuant to this chapter shall be deposited in a special account within The Preserve development impact fee fund created by the city to hold the revenue and interest generated by such fees.

(Ord. 2004-13 § 4 (part), 2004.) 
3.45.080 - Density and use basis of fees. 
A.  Except as provided herein, the final planning commission or city council approved density for residential dwelling units or square footage for commercial and industrial buildings in development projects located within The Preserve shall be used as the basis for computation of the required development impact fees. If a legal parcel contains more than one allowable residential dwelling unit density, then the applicable fees shall be prorated by the acreage of such parcel attributable to each allowed density. Public properties also shall be classified into the category of residential, commercial, or industrial use, and pay the DIF imposed for that classification of use. 
B.  Fees for churches, public or private schools, day care centers, congregate care facilities and any other such group or noncommercial use permitted in residential zones shall be computed based on the commercial zone rates contained in this chapter. 
(Ord. 2004-13 § 4 (part), 2004.) 
3.45.090 - Imposition and payment of fees. 
A.  The applicability of each fee established by this chapter shall be determined for each developing property on which a development project is proposed at the time of the development approval of the development project. Immediately following a development approval, the city shall provide a written notice to the owner and the developer of each development project that describes each fee that has been imposed on the development project, as well as other dedications, reservations or exactions, and the amounts. In addition, such written notice shall advise the owner and the developer of their right to protest any such imposition within ninety days of such written notice pursuant to Government Code Section 66020. 
B.  The city reserves the right to impose fees on any developing property pursuant to the provisions of Chapter 5 (commencing with Section 66000) of Division 1 of Title 7 of the Government Code relating to development projects, except as otherwise provided in any development agreement approved by the city pursuant to Section 20.23.070 of this Code. In such cases, the city shall require the owner or developer to advance to the city any amounts necessary to provide for special studies which may be required to determine the incremental impacts generated by such development project. The results of such special studies shall form the basis for the amount of fee required, to be paid by such developer. However, a credit shall be offered against such fees to the extent that any fees previously were paid for the same property within any fee category in this chapter. 
C.  The owners or developer of each development project shall pay each and every fee imposed hereunder as required by the development approval, applicable regulations of the city, the general laws and any written city notice requiring payment provided that such fees, or portions thereof, may be offset by a project credit when a developer or owner has constructed a public facility described in the reports and as provided in this chapter.

(Ord. 2004-13 § 4 (part), 2004.) 
(Ord. 2017-015, § 12, 2018.) 
3.45.110 - Project credit. 
A.  Entitlement to project credit. Whenever an owner or a developer is required to construct or install a public facility described in the reports, as a condition of a development approval of a development project, the owner or developer shall be entitled to receive a project credit pursuant to this chapter. 
B.  Project credit. The basis and procedure for earning and receiving a project credit are as follows: 
1.  The owner or developer of any development project within The Preserve shall have constructed a public facility described in the reports and required to be constructed by the development approval of the development project. 
2.  In the event that an owner or developer constructs such a public facility, the owner or developer may apply the project credit to offset an obligation of the owner or developer to pay a fee imposed pursuant to this chapter, provided that the project credit shall be limited to reduce an obligation for a fee in the same fee category as the category of the public facility so constructed. After deducting a project credit against the applicable fee due hereunder, the owner or developer shall pay the obligation remaining in the fee category against which the project credit was applied. 
3.  The city engineer shall determine the amount of the project credit for the construction of a public facility described in the reports requested by an owner or developer. Each project credit shall be certified by the city engineer after final completion and acceptance of each such public facility, based on final accepted and approved "as-built plans" and specifications and review of actual cost documentation, subject to appeal to the city council pursuant to Section 3.45.130. 
4.  A project credit may be earned for each phase by an owner or developer, provided the owner or developer deposits performance and payment bonds for the applicable public facilities or otherwise guarantees their completion, as required by the city engineer, subject to appeal to the city council pursuant to the procedures prescribed in Section 3.45.130. 
5.  Notwithstanding any provision to the contrary, a project credit shall not be provided for the construction of either of the two storm drains providing drainage to property north of The Preserve whenever any portion of such storm drains are financed by funds from a community facilities district on any property within The Preserve. 
C.  Project reimbursements. The city acknowledges that a public facility described in the reports may cost the owner or developer more to construct it than the fee otherwise payable hereunder as the owner's or developer's fair share for such a public facility. In the event that an owner or developer constructs a public facility described in the reports and the actual cost to construct it exceeds the fee otherwise payable hereunder as the owner's or developer's fair share for such a public facility, such an owner or developer shall be entitled to a project reimbursement in an amount equal to the difference between the actual construction cost and the fee payable hereunder for the fair share of such public facility. The amount of the reimbursement shall include the cost to acquire any land or right-of-way needed for the public facility in addition to the actual cost to construct the public facility. Reimbursement for such land acquisition shall be limited to that necessary for storm drain and water facilities as identified in the reports and right-of-way required for areas noncontiguous to the developing property. 
1.  Project reimbursements, other than those for storm drains and sewers, will be administered and calculated pursuant to the provisions of Section 3.40.110 of this Code. A project reimbursement of The Preserve DIF's for storm drains and sewers shall be administered and calculated as a priority reimbursement under the provisions of Subsections C.2. and C.3. of this section. However, the provisions of this chapter shall prevail over any conflicting provisions of Chapter 3.40. 
2.  No reimbursement agreement authorized by this chapter shall be for a term of more than ten years from execution, unless otherwise provided in a development agreement approved by the city pursuant to Section 20.23.070 of this Code. The form and substance of any such reimbursement agreement shall be determined by the director of public works and the city attorney. 
3.  Storm drain and sewer project reimbursements. 
a.  The city will require the payment of storm drain and sewer preserve DIF's by any property not within the development project but benefiting from the construction of such required public facilities required by the development approvals. 
b.  Such fees shall become a priority reimbursement to the owner or developer of the development project. 
4.  Priority reimbursements will be based on the storm drain and sewer drainage areas identified in Exhibits B and C, each of which will be treated individually, with priority reimbursement only calculated and payable from fees collected within the specific drainage area or areas within which the development project is located. 
5.  Exhibit B and Exhibit C identify all currently known storm drain and sewer projects needed to serve The Preserve, the estimated construction costs as adopted in this chapter, and the estimated cost allocations. 
6.  The city will condition its approval of any subdivision or parcel map within The Preserve on the requirement to construct those storm drain and sewer projects within the specified drainage areas, as described and depicted in Exhibits B and C. 
7.  The owner or developer of property within a project development in The Preserve may request city approval to construct such storm drains and sewer projects with configurations or construction and installation schedules other than those shown in Exhibits B and C. However, such request must be made in writing, and approved in advance of construction by the city engineer. Upon the tentative approval of such request, the city engineer shall determine the benefited properties and allocation of costs subject to appeal to the city council under the provisions of Section 3.45.130. 
8.  The owner or developer of a development project within The Preserve will be given a storm drain and sewer DIF project credit in the amount of such DIF's otherwise payable within the drainage area(s) at the time of issuance of building permits for such development project, as determined by the city engineer, subject to appeal to the city council under the provisions of Section 3.45.120. However, the owner or developer thereafter will be required to construct the storm drain and/or sewer project(s). 
9.  Upon completion of such storm drain and/or sewer project(s), the city engineer will review all cost documentation and determine the actual project cost(s), subject to appeal to the city council under the provisions of Section 3.45.120. 
10.  If actual project cost(s) exceed(s) the storm drain and/or sewer DIF required for a development project, the owner or developer shall be entitled to a priority project reimbursement. Within each specific storm drain and/or sewer drainage area, when the owner or developer of any property within The Preserve area, but not subject to any development agreement approved by the city, pays the storm drain and/or sewer fees required by this chapter as a condition of subdivision or parcel map approval by the city, these fees shall be subject to a priority reimbursement to such owner or developer to the extent of such excess. However, any such priority reimbursement shall not exceed the difference between the actual construction costs and the DIF required for the development project. 
11.  All priority reimbursements either are payable within ninety days after the city is in receipt of the DIF payment for a DIF public facility subject to a priority reimbursement, or are useable as credit against storm drain or sewer DIF's otherwise payable for the next phase, at the option of the owner or developer. 
12.  Additionally, a major portion of the costs of constructing the storm drain required by the development approvals may be those included in the city of Ontario development impact fee program. If so, when the City of Ontario collects its storm drain DIF, and transfers such DIF funds to the City of Chino, these funds will be used to provide the applicable priority reimbursement, with reimbursement based on the chronological order of development, i.e., first developer in receives the Ontario DIF reimbursement funds until its priority reimbursement is paid in full, then the second developer, etc. 
13.  Special conditions. 
a.  All reimbursements shall be paid only from the appropriate account within The Preserve DIF fund. 
b.  Nothing in this section shall relieve any development project from paying the fees set out in Section 3.45.030 of this chapter. 
c.  Notwithstanding any contrary provision of this chapter, the city reserves the right to increase the applicable fees hereunder or impose requirements on development approvals or enter into agreements with other owners and developers in order to fund a project reimbursement. 
14.  Storm drains serving property north of The Preserve. Reimbursement for the construction of the storm drains that provide drainage to property north of The Preserve shall be payable only from funds received from the City of Ontario for the portion of such storm drains attributable to drainage capacity calculated to serve land north of The Preserve. Further, the term of such reimbursements shall be of sufficient term to assure receipt of funds from the City of Ontario provided that the terms of such reimbursements shall be extended as necessary to accomplish receipt of such funds. 
D.  Voluntary Construction of Public Facilities. The city acknowledges that a public facility described in the reports may be constructed by an owner or developer who is not required to install it. In the event such an owner or developer desires to construct a public facility described in the reports, the owner or developer may request an agreement with the city through which the owner or developer agrees to construct the public facility and receives reimbursement for the actual costs to construct the public facility from the appropriate development impact fee account when funds are available. In such event, the city council may agree to enter into such agreement provided the agreement complies with the provisions of this Chapter 3.45 and Chapter 3.40 except that such a reimbursement agreement may exceed ten years in duration; the agreement is approved by the director of public works and city attorney; the public facility is constructed according to city-approved plans and city standards; and the costs to construct the public facility are confirmed by the director of public works.

A.  An owner or developer of any development project subject to payment of the fees required by this chapter may apply to the city council for a reduction, adjustment, or waiver of fees, pursuant to the procedure and criteria provided by Section 3.40.110. However, if such a reduction, adjustment, or waiver of fees is approved by the city council, any change in use within the development project shall invalidate such reduction, adjustment, or waiver of fees. 
B.  Any such reduction, adjustment or waiver also will require an immediate corresponding revision of the remaining fees imposed under Section 3.45.030. 
(Ord. 2004-13 § 4 (part), 2004.) 
3.45.130 - Appeal of city engineer decision. 
    An owner or developer of any development project also may appeal any determination of the city engineer hereunder, including but not limited to those regarding a project credit, actual project cost, project reimbursement, priority reimbursement, different configurations and construction and installation schedules for storm drains and sewer projects, pursuant to the procedures prescribed by Subsection A of Section 3.45.120. However, the criteria for decision by the city council shall be the criteria otherwise prescribed herein, i.e., the existence of any reasonable relationship between the impacts and fees, rather than the criteria provided in Section 3.40.110. 
(Ord. 2004-13 § 4 (part), 2004.) 
3.45.140 - Payment of fees to other public agencies. 
    If any development impact fee is paid to another city or utility district other than the city, which other city or utility district serves a portion of the area of The Preserve within the city not then served or capable of being served within a reasonable period of time by a category of public facilities of the city described in Section 3.45.030, then no development impact fee for that category of public facilities shall be payable to the city. 
(Ord. 2004-13 § 4 (part), 2004.) 
3.45.150 - Addition of city overhead rate to other fees. 
    The then-existing general overhead rate of the city shall be added to any such development impact fee payable to another city or utility district, which shall be collected and retained by the city, with only the amount of such fee being transmitted to the other city or utility district. 
(Ord. 2004-13 § 4 (part), 2004.) 
3.45.160 - De-annexation. 
    A de-annexation petition for a parcel of property within the city which is not then served by any city utilities or capable of being so served within a reasonable time thereafter, but instead then is or can be served within a reasonable time thereafter by the utilities of another city or utility district, may be entertained by the city. If so, the payment of development impact fees under Section 3.45.030 shall be deferred until a petition for de-annexation from the city is filed with the SBLAFCO, and final jurisdiction to provide such service is determined. However, no such deferral shall be made for more than one hundred eighty days. 
(Ord. 2004-13 § 4 (part), 2004.) 
3.45.170 - Relationship to existing fees. 
    The fees established by this chapter shall supersede any other city fees previously established for the construction, installation or financing of the same development impact fee categories of public facilities. 
(Ord. 2004-13 § 4 (part), 2004.) 
3.45.180 - Severability. 
    If any portion of this chapter is found to be invalid, the city council declares that it would have enacted the remainder of this chapter regardless of the absence of any such invalid portion.

C.  Air quality goals for the region established by state law cannot be without reducing air pollution from mobile sources. 
D.  The South Coast Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP) calls upon cities and counties to reduce emissions from motor vehicles consistent with the requirements of the California Clean Air Act of 1988 by developing and implementing mobile source air pollution reduction programs. 
E.  Such programs place demands upon the city's funds. Those programs should be financed by shifting the responsibility for financing from the general fund to the motor vehicles creating the demand, to the greatest extent possible. 
F.  Section 44223, added to the Health and Safety Code by action of the California Legislature on September 30, 1990 (Chapter 90-1705), authorizes the South Coast Air Quality Management District to impose an additional motor vehicle registration fee of two dollars, commencing on April 1, 1991, increasing to four dollars, commencing on April 1, 1992, to finance the implementation of transportation measures embodied in the AQMP and provisions of the California Clean Air Act. 
G.  Forty cents of every dollar collected under Section 44223 of the Health and Safety Code shall be distributed to cities and counties located in the South Coast Air Quality Management District that comply with Section 44243 of the code, based on the jurisdictions' prorated share of population as defined by the State Department of Finance. 
H.  The city is located within the South Coast Air Quality Management District and is eligible to receive a portion of the revenues from the additional motor vehicle registration fees contingent upon adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter. 
I.  The prorated share of the fee revenues for cities that fail to adopt an ordinance pursuant to Section 44243 (b) (3) of the Health and Safety Code shall be distributed instead to the jurisdictions within the district that have adopted an ordinance.

D.  Expenditure of Air Quality Trust Fund Revenues. All revenues received from the SCAQMD and deposited in the trust fund account shall be exclusively expended on mobile source emission reduction programs as defined in Section 3.60.030 (B). Such revenues shall be expended within one year of the completion of the programs. 
E.  Audits. The city consents to an audit of all programs and projects funded by vehicle registration fee revenues received from the SCAQMD pursuant to Section 44223 of the Health and Safety Code. The audit shall be conducted by an independent auditor selected by the SCAQMD as provided in Section 44244 of the Health and Safety Code.

5.04.190 - Fees-Licenses based on gross receipts. 
A.  The annual license fee for any business license that is based on gross receipts shall be calculated on the business' gross receipts arising out of transactions or business conducted within the city, provided that in no case shall it be less than the minimum fee. 
B.  The annual license fee for any new business license that is based on gross receipts shall be calculated on the business' estimate of the first year's gross receipts arising out of transactions or business conducted within the city, provided that in no case shall it be less than the minimum fee; however, the amount of the license fee so determined shall be tentative only, and the applicant shall, within thirty days after expiration of the period for which such license was issued, furnish the director of finance with a copy of such documents as required under Section 5.04.175 of this chapter, showing the gross receipts arising out of transactions or business conducted within the city during the period of such license, and the license fee amount for such period shall be finally ascertained after deducting from the payment found to be due, the amount paid at the time such first license was issued. The director of finance shall not issue to any such applicant another license for the same or any other business, until such person shall have furnished the required verification and paid the license fee as herein required. 
C.  Where a business conducts operations within the city and at other locations outside the city, gross receipts that are subject to fees under this chapter shall be collected only on the gross receipts attributable to business conducted within the city. When gross receipts cannot be plainly and reasonably apportioned by job, project, or facility situs, the following formula may be used to apportion gross receipts attributable to business within the city: 
1.  The total gross receipts of the business shall be multiplied by a fraction, the numerator of which is the property factor plus the payroll factor and the denominator of which is two. 
2.  The property factor is a faction, the numerator of which is the average value of the business' real and tangible personal property owned or rented and used in this city during the business' fiscal year and the denominator of which is the average value of all the taxpayer's real and tangible personal property owned or rented and used during the fiscal year. 
3.  Property owned by the business is valued at its original cost. Property rented by the business is valued at eight times the net annual rental rate. Net annual rental rate is the annual rental rate paid by the business less any annual rental rate received by the business from sub-rentals. 
4.  The average value of property shall be determined by averaging the values at the beginning and ending of the fiscal year, but the city may require the averaging of monthly values during the fiscal year if reasonably required to reflect properly the average value of the business' property. 
5.  The payroll factor is a fraction, the numerator of which is the total amount paid in this city during the fiscal year by the taxpayer for compensation and the denominator of which is the total compensation paid by the business during the fiscal year. 
6.  Compensation is paid in this city if: 
a.  The individual's service is performed entirely within the city; 
b.  The individual's service is performed both within and without the city, but the service performed without the city is incidental to the individual's service within the city; or 
c.  Some of the service is performed in the city and: 
1.  The base of operations or if there is no base of operations the place from which the service is directed or controlled is in the city; or 
2.  The base of operations or the place from which the service is directed or controlled is not in any city in which some part of the service is performed, but the individual's residence is in this city.

On the first day of each month thereafter that such fee remains unpaid, an additional penalty of ten percent of such unpaid fee shall be added; provided, that the maximum penalty amount shall not exceed an amount equal to the amount of the original license fee. 
B.  The city shall collect, in addition to the penalty due, any costs incurred by the necessity to file suit for collection in the courts. 
C.  In order to promote the licensing of all businesses within the city, the city council may, by resolution, establish amnesty periods during which persons or entities conducting business within the city may apply for a current business license, and be absolved from the obligation of paying business license fees which are delinquent in excess of one year and any penalties.

The city council of the city of Chino finds that the disclosure of personal information required of applicants pursuant to this chapter would constitute an unwarranted invasion of personal privacy.

Any unauthorized disclosure or use of such personal information by any officer or employee of the city shall constitute a misdemeanor and such officer or employee shall be subject to the penalty provided for the violation of this chapter, in addition to any other penalties provided by law.

    A. Assessment. 
1.  Whenever the director of finance determines that any tax is due or may be due to the city under the provisions of this chapter, the director of finance may make and give notice of an assessment of such tax. 
2.  The notice of assessment shall separately set forth the amount of any tax known by the director of finance to be due or estimated by the director of finance, after full consideration of all information within his or her knowledge concerning the business and activities of the person assessed, to be due under each applicable section of this chapter and shall include the amount of any penalties accrued on each amount to the date of the notice of assessment. 
B.  Service of Assessment-Right to Hearing. The notice of assessment shall be served upon the person either by handing it to him or her personally, or by a deposit of the notice to the person at the address of the location of the business appearing on the face of the business license certificate issued to the business or to such other address as he or she shall register with the director of finance for the purpose of receiving notices provided under this chapter; should the person have no such certificate issued to him or her and should he or she have no address registered with the director of finance for such purpose, then to such person's last known address. For the purpose of this section, a service by mail is complete at the time of deposit in the United States mail. Within fifteen days after the date of service, the person addressed may either apply in writing to the director of finance for a hearing on the assessment or may file a written request that such hearing be waived. If the person neither requests a hearing upon the assessment nor requests a waiver of hearing within the prescribed time, the amount of the assessment shall be final, and the amount thereof shall immediately be due and owing to the city, but penalties and interest as provided by this chapter shall continue to accrue until paid. 
C.  Waiver of Hearing. If the person requests that the hearing be waived, the director of finance may either grant such request and notify the person thereof in writing or may, at the discretion of the director of finance, deny the request and set the assessment for hearing at the time and in the manner prescribed by subsection B of this section. 
    If the director of finance grants the request for waiver of hearing, the administrative proceedings prescribed by this section shall be deemed exhausted and the city shall have the right to bring an action in any court of competent jurisdiction to collect the amount of the assessment, plus such penalties and interest as may have been accrued thereon as provided by this chapter. 
D.  Time of Hearing-Notice. If the person requests a hearing upon the assessment or if the director of finance denies the request for waiver of hearing, the director of finance shall cause the matter to be set for hearing before a board of review not later than ninety days after the date of the application, or as the case may be, the date of the director of finance's denial of the request for waiver of hearing. Notice of the time and place of the hearing shall be mailed to the person assessed not later than fifteen days before the date set for hearing and, if the director of finance desires said person to produce specific records at such hearing, such notice may designate the records required to be produced. 
E.  Administrative Hearing. The hearing prescribed by this section shall be before a board of review. The board of review shall be composed of the city manager, city clerk, and the city attorney, or the duly appointed representative of each. At the hearing the persons assessed and the director of finance may submit such evidence as they believe to be relevant in their respective positions. The board of review may require the presentation of additional evidence from either the person assessed or from the director of finance, or from both, and may continue the hearing from time to time for the purpose of allowing the presentation of additional evidence. 
F.  Decision of the Board of Review. Upon completion of the hearing, the board of review may (1) affirm the assessment, (2) increase the assessment, or (3) decrease the assessment, as the evidence may require, but the amount of the assessment shall not be increased unless the claim for the increase is asserted on behalf of the city either before or during the hearing. Written notice of the decision of the board of review shall be given to the person assessed in the same form and in the same manner as the notice of assessment. 
G.  Exception. Within fifteen days from the date of service of the notice of decision of the board of review, the person assessed may file written exceptions to the decision of the board of review, but shall not be required to do so. If the person does not do so, the person shall nevertheless be deemed to have exhausted the administrative proceedings provided by this section. Upon filing of written exceptions, the board of review may either deny the exceptions or modify its decision, as it deems appropriate.

5.36.010 - Legislative purpose. 
    The city council finds that the residents of the city of Chino and members of the public who own or operate motor vehicles are in need of reliable and responsive tow services and storage in the event that they are unable to operate their motor vehicles or their motor vehicles become inoperable. The city council further finds in partial reliance on the findings in California Vehicle Code Section 14607.4 that the public health, safety and welfare will be served making the streets safer though enforcement of the requirements of the California Vehicle Code and Department of Motor Vehicles that drivers be licensed and insured, that vehicles be registered and others requirements which may be applicable. The public health, safety and welfare will also be served by the removal of motor vehicles from the public right of way, or private property, that are inoperable, illegally parked, constitute a nuisance or safety hazard, or are required for statutory or evidentiary purposes. Therefore, the purpose of this chapter is to establish a system to regulate privately owned and operated tow services that will remove, transport and store motor vehicles in a safe, reliable and responsive manner.

This section is intended to prohibit tow service operators from soliciting business at the scene of any accident or emergency involving any motor vehicle. This section shall not be construed to prohibit tow service operators from contracting with any person for providing tow services within the city of Chino that are not related to an accident or emergency provided that the chief of police shall resolve any conflict on what situation constitutes an accident or an emergency for which only a permitted tow service operator is allowed to respond or contract services. 
(Ord. 99-13 § 2, 1999.) 
5.36.150 - Administrative action and termination. 
A.  The issuance of a tow service permit is a privilege, not a right, and it creates no property interest thereto in any tow service operator. After issuance of a tow service permit to a tow service operator, the chief of police shall have the discretion to take administrative action including the imposition of additional conditions on any permit, placing a permit on probation, suspending a permit or revoking a permit whenever the chief determines:

Such request for review shall state all of the grounds upon which review is sought as the city council may not consider grounds not stated in the request for review. The city clerk shall transmit the request to the city council at the next regular meeting and the city council shall determine whether it will consider the request. Upon review of the request, the city council may either deny the request or schedule it for further consideration at a subsequent meeting. If it chooses to consider the request, the city council may request information thereon from the chief of police and provide notice thereof to the tow service operator. At such subsequent meeting, the city council may consider the information provided by the chief of police and any further information that may be provided by the tow service operator.

The grantor and the grantee agree that the amount of such assessment shall be deemed, without proof, to represent liquidation of damages actually sustained by the grantor by reason of the grantee's failure to perform.

Since January 1, 2007, the state of California has had the sole authority to grant state video franchises pursuant to the Digital Infrastructure and Video Competition Act of 2006 ("Act"). Pursuant to the Act, the city of Chino shall receive a franchise fee and may receive a fee for public, educational and government ("PEG") purposes from all state video franchise holders operating within the city. The city also has the responsibility to establish and enforce penalties, consistent with state law, against all state video franchise holders operating within the city for violations of customer service standards, but the Act grants all authority to adopt customer service standards to the state. The Act leaves unchanged the city's authority to regulate the city's current cable franchise in accordance with Chapter 5.44 of the Chino Municipal Code and the cable franchise currently in effect, until such time as the cable franchisee no longer holds a city franchise or is no longer operating under a current or expired city franchise.

Chapter 8.60 - FLOODPLAIN MANAGEMENT[2] 

Footnotes: 
--- (2) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. 2008-12, § 1, adopted August 5, 2008, repealed the former Ch. 8.60, §§ 8.60.010-8.60-270. Section 2 of said ordinance enacted a new Ch. 8.60 as set out herein. The former Ch. 8.60 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. 97-01 § 1 (part), adopted 1997; Ord. 2004-23 §§ 53, 54, adopted 2004. 

8.60.010 - Statutory authorization. 
    The Legislature of the State of California has in Government Code Sections 65302, 65560 and 65800 conferred upon local government the authority to adopt regulations designed to promote the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. Therefore, the City Council of the City of Chino, County of San Bernardino, does hereby adopt the following floodplain management regulations. 
(Ord. 2008-12 § 2, 2008.) 
8.60.020 - Findings of fact. 
A.  The flood hazard areas of the City of Chino, County of San Bernardino are subject to periodic inundation which results in loss of life and property, health and safety hazards, disruption of commerce and governmental services, extraordinary public expenditures for flood protection and relief, and impairment of the tax base, all of which adversely affect the public health, safety, and general welfare. 
B.  These flood losses are caused by uses that are inadequately elevated, floodproofed, or protected from flood damage. The cumulative affect of obstructions in areas of special flood hazards which increase flood heights and velocities also contribute to the flood loss. 
(Ord. 2008-12 § 2, 2008.) 
8.60.030 - Legislative purpose. 
    It is the purpose of this chapter to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to minimize public and private losses due to flood conditions in specific areas by legally enforceable regulations applied uniformly throughout the community to all publicly and privately owned land within flood prone, mudslide [i.e. mudflow] or flood related erosion areas. These regulations are designed to: 
A.  Protect human life and health; 
B.  Minimize expenditure of public money for costly flood control projects; 
C.  Minimize the need for rescue and relief efforts associated with flooding and generally undertaken at the expense of the general public; 
D.  Minimize prolonged business interruptions; 
E.  Minimize damage to public facilities and utilities such as water and gas mains; electric, telephone and sewer lines; and streets and bridges located in areas of special flood hazard; 
F.  Help maintain a stable tax base by providing for the sound use and development of areas of special flood hazard so as to minimize future blighted areas caused by flood damage; 
G.  Ensure that potential buyers are notified that property is in an area of special flood hazard; and 
H.  Ensure that those who occupy the areas of special flood hazard assume responsibility for their actions. 
(Ord. 2008-12 § 2, 2008.) 
8.60.040 - Methods of reducing flood losses. 
    In order to accomplish its purposes, this chapter includes regulations to: 
A.  Restrict or prohibit uses which are dangerous to health, safety, and property due to water or erosion hazards, or which result in damaging increases in erosion or flood heights or velocities; 
B.  Require that uses vulnerable to floods, including facilities which serve such uses, be protected against flood damage at the time of initial construction; 
C.  Control the alteration of natural floodplains, stream channels, and natural protective barriers, which help accommodate or channel flood waters; 
D.  Control filling, grading, dredging and other development which may increase flood damage; and 
E.  Prevent or regulate the construction of flood barriers which will unnaturally divert flood waters or which may increase flood hazards in other areas. 
(Ord. 2008-12 § 2, 2008.) 
8.60.050 - Definitions. 
    Unless specifically defined below, words or phrases used in this chapter shall be interpreted so as to give them the meaning they have in common usage and to give this chapter its most reasonable application.

    "Existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including, at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed before the effective date of the floodplain management regulations adopted by the city. 
    "Expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision" means the preparation of additional sites by the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads). 
    "FEMA" means the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
    "Flood, flooding, or flood water" means:

    "Floodplain management" means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans. 
    "Floodplain management regulations" means this chapter and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other application of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state or local regulations in any combination thereof which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. 
    "Floodproofing" means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents. For guildelines on dry and wet floodproofing, see FEMA Technical Bulletins TB 1-93, TB 3-93, and TB 7-93.

    "Fraud and victimization," as related to Sections 8.60.270 through 8.60.290 of this chapter means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the city council will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the community for fifty to one hundred years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the community as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates. 
    "Functionally dependent use" means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity of water.

    "Hardship" as related to Sections 8.60.270 through 8.60.290 of this chapter relating to variances, means the exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The planning commission shall require that the variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. 
    "Highest adjacent grade" means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
    "Historic structure" means any structure that is: 
1.  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
2.  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
3.  Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of Interior; or 
4.  Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either by an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states with approved programs. 
    "Levee" means a man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
    "Levee system" means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accord with sound engineering practices. 
    "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement. See "Basement." 
1.  An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure below the lowest floor that is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor provided it conforms to applicable non-elevation design requirements, including, but not limited to: 
a.  The wet floodproofing standard in Section 8.60.190(C)(3); 
b.  The anchoring standards in Section 8.60.190(A);

8.60.160 - Duties of the floodplain administrator. 
    The duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator, or designee, shall include, but not be limited, to the following: 
A.  Permit review. Review the development permits to determine: 
1.  Permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied; including determination of substantial improvement and substantial damage of existing structures; 
2.  All other required state and federal permits have been obtained; 
3.  The site is reasonably safe from flooding; 
4.  The proposed construction, development or encroachment does not adversely affect the carrying capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a floodway has not been designated. This means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development will increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the city; and 
5.  All letters of map revision (LOMR) for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on condition letters of map revision (CLOMR). Approved CLOMR's allow constructions of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the "start of construction" definition. 
B.  Development of substantial improvement and substantial damage procedures. 
1.  Using FEMA publication FEMA 213, "Answers to Questions About Substantially Damaged Buildings", develop detailed procedures for identifying and administering requirements for substantial improvement and substantial damage, to include defining "market value". 
2.  Assure procedures are coordinated with other departments/divisions and implemented by community staff. 
C.  Review and use of any other base flood data. When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with Section 8.60.070, the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or state agency, or other source, in order to administer Sections 8.60.190 through 8.60.260. 
    NOTE. A base flood elevation may be obtained using one of two methods from the FEMA publication, FEMA 265, "Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A Areas - A Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base (100 years) Flood Elevations", dated July 1995. 
D.  Notification of other agencies. 
1.  Alteration or relocation of a watercourse: 
a.  Notify adjacent communities and the California Department of Water Resources prior to alteration or relocation; 
b.  Submit evidence of such notification to the Federal Emergency Management Agency; and 
c.  Assure that the flood-carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of said watercourse is maintained. 
2.  Base flood elevation changes due to physical alternations: 
a.  Within six months of information becoming available or project completion, whichever comes first, the floodplain administrator shall submit or assure that the permit applicant submits technical or scientific date to FEMA for a letter of map revision (LOMR). 
b.  All LOMR's for flood control projects are approved prior to the issuance of building permits. Building permits must not be issued based on conditional letters of map revision (CLOMR). Approved CLOMR's allows construction of the proposed flood control project and land preparation as specified in the "start of construction" definition. 
    Such submissions are necessary so that upon confirmation of those physical changes affecting flooding conditions, risk premium rates and floodplain management requirements are based on current data. 
3.  Changes in corporate boundaries: Notify FEMA in writing whenever the corporate boundaries have been modified by annexation or other means and include a copy of a map of the community clearly delineating the new corporate limits. 
E.  Documentation of floodplain development. Obtain and maintain for public inspection and make available as needed the following: 
1.  Certification required by Subsection 8.60.190C.1. (lowest floor elevations); 
2.  Certification required by Subsection 8.60.190C.2. (elevation or floodproofing of nonresidential structures); 
3.  Certification required by Subsection 8.60.1900.3. (wet floodproofing standard); 
4.  Certification of elevation required by Subsection 8.60.210B. (subdivisions and other proposed development standards); 
5.  Certification required by Subsection 8.60.240A. (floodway encroachments); and 
6.  Maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
F.  Map determinations. Make interpretations where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard, for example, where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in Sections 8.60.270 through 8.60.290. 
G.  Remedial action. Take action to remedy violations of this chapter subject to concurrence by the city attorney. 
H.  Biennial report. Complete and submit biennial report to FEMA.

Until a regulatory floodway is adopted, no new construction, substantial development, or other development (including fill) shall be permitted within Zones A1-30 and AE, unless it is demonstrated that the cumulative effect of the proposed development, when combined with all other development, will not increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point within the city. 
B.  Within an adopted regulatory floodway, the City of Chino shall prohibit encroachments, including fill, new constriction, substantial improvements, and other development, unless certification by a registered civil engineer is provided demonstrating that the proposed encroachment shall not result in any increase in flood levels during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
C.  If Sections 8.60.240 A and B are satisfied, all new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of Sections 8.60.190 through 8.60.260. 
(Ord. 2008-12 § 2, 2008.) 
8.60.250 - Mudslide (mudflow) prone areas. 
A.  The floodplain administrator shall review permits for proposed construction of other development to determine if it is proposed within a mudslide area. 
B.  Permits shall be reviewed to determine that the proposed site and improvement will be reasonably safe from mudslide hazards. Factors to be considered in making this determination include but are not limited to the following: 
1.  Type and quality of soils; 
2.  Evidence of ground water or surface water problems; 
3.  Depth and quality of any fill; 
4.  Overall slope of the site; and 
5.  Weight that any proposed development will impose on the slope. 
C.  Within areas which may have mudslide hazards, the floodplain administration shall require that: 
1.  A site investigation and further review be made by persons qualified in geology and soils engineering; 
2.  The proposed grading, excavation, new construction and substantial improvement be adequately designed and protected against mudslide damages; 
3.  The proposed grading, excavations, new construction and substantial improvement not aggravate the existing hazard by creating either on-site or off-site disturbances; and 
4.  Drainage, planting, watering and maintenance not endanger slope stability. 
(Ord. 2008-12 § 2, 2008.) 
8.60.260 - Flood-related erosion-prone areas. 
A.  Planning commission site approval shall be required for proposed construction and other development within all flood-related erosion-prone areas as known to the community. 
B.  The planning commission shall review site approval applications to determine whether the proposed site alterations and improvements will be reasonably safe from flood-related erosion and will not cause flood-related erosion hazards or otherwise aggravate the existing hazard. 
C.  If a proposed improvement is found to be in the path of flood-related erosion or would increase the erosion hazard, the planning commission shall require the relocation of the improvement or require adequate protective measures to avoid aggravating the existing erosion hazard. 
D.  Within Zone E on the flood insurance rate map, a setback is required for all new development from a lake, river front or other body of water to create a safety buffer consisting of a natural vegetative or contour strip. This buffer shall be designated according to the flood-related erosion hazard and erosion rate, in relation to the anticipated "useful life" of structures, and depending upon the geologic, hydrologic, topographic, and climatic characteristics of the land. The buffer may be used for suitable open space purposes, such as for agricultural, forestry, outdoor recreation and wildlife habitat areas, and for other activities using temporary and portable structures only. 
(Ord. 2008-12 § 2, 2008.) 
8.60.270 - Nature of variances. 
    The issuance of variance is for floodplain management purposes only. Insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actual risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance. 
    The variance criteria set forth in this section of this chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of his chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners. 
    It is the duty of the governing body to help protect the residents and their property from flooding. This duty is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements of this chapter should be quite rare. The long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can only be met if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance can be properly granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. 
(Ord. 2008-12 § 2, 2008.) 
8.60.280 - Conditions for variances. 
A.  Generally, variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvements, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the procedures of Section 8.60.130 and Section 8.60.260 of this chapter have been fully considered. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
B.  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "historic structures" (as defined in Section 8.60.050 of this chapter) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic character and design of the structure. 
C.  Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
D.  Variances shall only be issued upon a determination that the variance is the "minimum necessary" considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the planning commission need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to the elevation which the planning commission believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of this chapter. 
E.  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a community official that: 
1.  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage, and 
2.  Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. It is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the Office of the County of San Bernardino Recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land. 
F.  The floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
(Ord. 2008-12 § 2, 2008.) 
8.60.290 - Appeal board. 
A.  In passing upon requests for variances, the planning commission shall hold a public hearing and consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors and standards specified in this chapter, and the: 
1.  Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
2.  Danger of life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
3.  Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property; 
4.  Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the community; 
5.  Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
6.  Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
7.  Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
8.  Relationship of the proposed use to the specific plan, general plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
9.  Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
10.  Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and 
11.  Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water system, and streets and bridges. 
B.  Variances shall only be issued upon: 
1.  Showing of good and sufficient cause; 
2.  Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional "hardship" to the applicant; and 
3.  Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance (see "Public safety and nuisance"), cause "fraud and victimization" of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
C.  Variance may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of Sections 8.60.290(A) through 8.60.290(D) are satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance. 
D.  Upon consideration of the factors of Section 8.60.280 and the purposes of this chapter, the planning commission may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

Footnotes: 
--- (1) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. 2019-005, § 3, adopted June 4, 2019, repealed the former Ch. 9.36, §§ 9.36.010-9.36.070, and enacted a new Ch. 9.36 as set out herein. The former Ch. 9.36 pertained to loud or disorderly gatherings-police services and derived from Ord. 90-11 § 2, adopted 1990. 

9.36.010 - Findings and purpose. 
A.  Some gatherings in the city become loud or unruly to the point that they constitute a threat to the peace, health, safety, or general welfare of the public through excessive consumption of alcohol, and increased incidents of fighting, litter, noise and other conditions detrimental to the community. 
B.  The city may be required to make multiple responses to such loud or unruly gatherings, or more than one such gathering at a particular premises, in order to restore and maintain the peace and protect public health, safety, or general welfare. Such gatherings diminish the quality of life in the city, create a burden on scarce city resources, and can result in police responses to regular and emergency calls being delayed and police protection to the rest of the city being reduced. 
C.  In order to discourage the occurrence of loud and unruly gatherings, the city seeks to penalize those responsible for such gatherings and to set forth penalties for repeat officer responses to such gatherings.

Chapter 12.12 - REGULATION OF SOLICITATION IN THE PUBLIC RIGHT-OF-WAY 
Sections: 

12.12.010 - Legislative purpose. 
    The city council finds and declares that the provisions of this chapter are enacted for the following reasons: 
A.  Persons congregate in areas within the city on a daily basis and solicit, or attempt to solicit, employment, business or contributions from the occupants of vehicles on certain city streets; and 
B.  The activity of soliciting employment, business or contributions from occupants of vehicles, distracts drivers from their primary duty to watch traffic and potential hazards in the road, observe all traffic control signals or warnings and prepare to move through the city streets and intersections; 
C.  The practice of soliciting employment, business or contributions from occupants of vehicles as discussed above impedes the flow of traffic on the streets within the city, results in the delay and obstruction of the public's free flow of travel, and results in congestion and blockage of the streets, driveways, parking areas and sidewalks when such persons approach the vehicles to negotiate with the occupant; 
D.  Distracted drivers are more prone to automobile accidents and accidents in the public streets constitute a substantial traffic safety problem, which problem further impedes and prevents the orderly flow of traffic, and is unsafe for the person engaging in the solicitation, pedestrian traffic and the traffic generally; 
E.  The cumulative impact of this type of activity on the city streets, highways and sidewalks on a daily basis without regulation has created a potential safety hazard, which poses a significant and substantial risk to the interest of the public in the free flow of travel in the city; 
F.  Commercial parking areas within the city are for the purpose of parking, placing or stationing of a vehicle for the benefit of the public, clients, customers, members and occupants of the adjoining commercial premises; 
G.  The use of commercial parking areas for the solicitation of employment, business or contributions interferes with the intended use of the parking area because of the vehicle congestion in such area caused by vehicles whose occupants bargain and temporarily stop to negotiate with persons who are engaged in the solicitation; 
H.  Commercial parking areas have limited accessibility to inbound and outbound traffic through their driveways. The solicitation of employment, business and contributions further limits such driveway access because of the blockage and congestion of such driveways by vehicles whose occupants stop to bargain or negotiate with persons engaged in the solicitation; 
I.  The public has a substantial interest in promoting the health, safety and welfare of persons using commercial parking areas by prohibiting the solicitation within such parking areas when appropriately posted by the property owner(s).

    The purpose and intent of this chapter is to provide a uniform and comprehensive set of regulations and standards for the permitting, development, siting, installation, design, operation and maintenance of wireless telecommunications facilities in the city's public right-of-way. These regulations are intended to prescribe clear and reasonable criteria to assess and process applications in a consistent and expeditious manner, while reducing the impacts associated with wireless telecommunications facilities. This chapter provides standards necessary (1) for the preservation of the public right-of-way ("PROW") in the city for the maximum benefit and use of the public, (2) to promote and protect public health and safety, community welfare, visual resources and the aesthetic quality of the city consistent with the goals, objectives and policies of the general plan, and (3) to provide for the orderly, managed and efficient development of wireless telecommunications facilities in accordance with the state and federal laws, rules and regulations, including those regulations of the Federal Communications Commission ("FCC") and California Public Utilities Commission ("CPUC"), and (4) to ensure that the use and enjoyment of the PROW is not inconvenienced by the use of the PROW for the placement of wireless facilities. The city recognizes the importance of wireless facilities to provide high-quality communications service to the residents and businesses within the city, and the city also recognizes its obligation to comply with applicable Federal and State laws. This chapter shall be constructed and applied in consistency with the provisions of state and federal laws, and the rules and regulations of FCC and CPUC. In the event of any inconsistency between any such laws, rules and regulations and this chapter, the laws, rules and regulations shall control.

    "Antenna" means that specific device for transmitting and/or receiving radio frequency or other signals for purposes of wireless telecommunications services. "Antenna" is specific to the antenna portion of a wireless telecommunications facility. 
    "Antenna array" shall mean two or more antennas having active elements extending in one or more directions, and directional antennas mounted upon and rotated through a vertical mast or tower interconnecting the beam and antenna support, all of which elements are deemed to be part of the antenna. 
    "Base station" shall have the meaning as set forth in Title 47 Code of Federal Regulations (C.F.R.) Section 1.40001(b)(1), or any successor provision. This means a structure or equipment at a fixed location that enables FCC-licensed or authorized wireless communications between user equipment and a communications network (regardless of the technological configuration, and encompassing DAS and small cells). "Base station" does not encompass a tower or any equipment associated with a tower. Base station includes, without limitation: 
1.  Equipment associated with wireless communications services such as private, broadcast, and public safety services, as well as unlicensed wireless services and fixed wireless services such as microwave backhaul. 
2.  Radio transceivers, antennas, coaxial or fiber-optic cable, regular and backup power supplies, and comparable equipment, regardless of technological configuration (including distributed antenna systems and small cells). 
3.  Any structure other than a tower that, at the time the relevant application is filed with the city under this chapter, supports or houses equipment described in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this definition that has been reviewed and approved under the applicable zoning or siting process, or under another state or local regulatory review process, even if the structure was not built for the sole or primary purpose of providing that support. 
4.  "Base station" does not include any structure that, at the time the relevant application is filed under this chapter, does not support or house equipment described in paragraphs 1 and 2 of this definition.

1.  Collocation of new transmission equipment; 
2.  Removal of transmission equipment; 
3.  Replacement of transmission equipment (replacement does not include completely replacing the underlying support structure); or 
4.  Hardening through structural enhancement where such hardening is necessary to accomplish the eligible facilities request, but does not include replacement of the underlying support structure. 
    "Eligible facilities request" does not include modifications or replacements when an eligible support structure was constructed or deployed without proper local review, was not required to undergo local review, or involves equipment that was not properly approved. "Eligible facilities request" does include collocation facilities satisfying all the requirements for a non-discretionary collocation facility pursuant to Government Code Section 65850.6. 
    "Eligible support structure" means any support structure located in the PROW that is existing at the time the relevant application is filed with the city under this chapter. 
    "Existing" means a support structure, wireless telecommunications facility, or accessory equipment that has been reviewed and approved under the city's applicable zoning or siting process, or under another applicable state or local regulatory review process, and lawfully constructed prior to the time the relevant application is filed under this chapter. However, a support structure, wireless telecommunications facility, or accessory equipment that has not been reviewed and approved because it was not in a zoned area when it was built, but was lawfully constructed, is "existing" for purposes of this chapter. "Existing" does not apply to any structure that (1) was illegally constructed without all proper local agency approvals, or (2) was constructed in noncompliance with such approvals. "Existing" does not apply where an existing support structure is proposed to be replaced in furtherance of the proposed wireless telecommunications facility. 
    "Facility(ies)" means wireless telecommunications facility(ies). 
    "FCC" means the Federal Communications Commission. 
    "Ground-mounted" means mounted to a pole, tower or other freestanding structure which is specifically constructed for the purpose of supporting an antenna or wireless telecommunications facility and placed directly on the ground at grade level.

The PROW includes, but is not necessarily limited to, streets, curbs, gutters, sidewalks, roadway and medians. The PROW does not include lands owned, controlled or operated by the city for uses unrelated to streets or the passage of people and goods, such as, without limitation, parks, city hall and community center lands, city yards, and lands supporting reservoirs, water towers, police or fire facilities. 
    "Replacement" refers only to replacement of transmission equipment, wireless telecommunications facilities or eligible support structures where the replacement structure will be of like-for-like kind to resemble the appearance and dimensions of the structure or equipment replaced, including size, height, color, landscaping, materials and style. 
1.  In the context of determining whether an application qualifies as an eligible facilities request, the term "replacement" relates only to the replacement of transmission equipment and does not include replacing the support structure on which the equipment is located. 
2.  In the context of determining whether a SWF application qualifies as being placed upon a new eligible support structure or qualifies as a collocation, an application proposing the "replacement" of the underlying support structure qualifies as a new pole proposal. 
    "RF" means radio frequency. 
    "Small cell" means a low-powered antenna (node) that has a range of ten meters to two kilometers. The nodes of a "small cell" may or may not be connected by fiber. "Small," for purposes of "small cell," refers to the area covered, not the size of the facility. "Small cell" includes, but is not limited to, devices generally known as microcells, picocells and femtocells. 
    "Small cell network" means a network of small cells. 
    "Spectrum Act" means Section 6409(a) of the Middle Class Tax Relief Act and Job Creation Act of 2012, 47 U.S.C. §1455(a). 
    "Substantial change" has the same meaning as "substantial change" as defined by the FCC at 47 C.F.R. 1.40001(b)(7). Notwithstanding the definition above, if an existing pole-mounted cabinet is proposed to be replaced with an underground cabinet at a facility where there are no pre-existing ground cabinets associated with the structure, such modification may be deemed a non-substantial change, in the discretion of the development services director and based upon his/her reasonable consideration of the cabinet's proximity to residential view sheds, interference to public views and/or degradation of concealment elements. If undergrounding the cabinet is technologically infeasible such that it is materially inhibitive to the project, the development services director may allow for a ground mounted cabinet. A modification or collocation results is a "substantial change" to the physical dimensions of an eligible support structure if it does any of the following: 
1.  It increases the height of the structure by more than ten percent or more than ten feet, whichever is greater; 
2.  It involves adding an appurtenance to the body of the structure that would protrude from the edge of the structure by more than six feet; 
3.  It involves installation of more than the standard number of new equipment cabinets for the technology involved, but not to exceed four cabinets. However, for towers and base stations located in the public rights-of-way, it involves installation of any new equipment cabinets on the ground if there are no pre-existing ground cabinets associated with the structure, or else involves installation of ground cabinets that are more than ten percent larger in height or overall volume than any other ground cabinets associated with the structure; 
4.  It entails any excavation or deployment outside the current site. For purposes of this Subsection, excavation outside the current site occurs where excavation more than twelve feet from the eligible support structure is proposed;

In the event any city director or city engineer determines that the condition or placement of a wireless telecommunications facility located in the public right-of-way constitutes a dangerous condition, obstruction of the public right-of-way, or an imminent threat to public safety, or determines other exigent circumstances require immediate corrective action (collectively, "exigent circumstances"), such director or city engineer may cause the facility to be removed summarily and immediately without advance notice or a hearing. Written notice of the removal shall include the basis for the removal and shall be served upon the permittee and person who owns the facility within five business days of removal and all property removed shall be preserved for the owner's pick-up as feasible. If the owner cannot be identified following reasonable effort or if the owner fails to pick-up the property within sixty days, the facility shall be treated as abandoned property. 
D.  Removal of Facilities by City. In the event the city removes a wireless telecommunications facility in accordance with nuisance abatement procedures or summary removal, any such removal shall be without any liability to the city for any damage to such facility that may result from reasonable efforts of removal. In addition to the procedures for recovering costs of nuisance abatement, the city may collect such costs from the performance bond posted and to the extent such costs exceed the amount of the performance bond, collect those excess costs in accordance with this code. Unless otherwise provided herein, the city has no obligation to store such facility. Neither the permittee, owner nor operator shall have any claim if the city destroys any such facility not timely removed by the permittee, owner or operator after notice, or removal by the city due to exigent circumstances. 
E.  All rights shall be personal to the applicant. The applicant may transfer and or assign its rights upon sale of its company to the new owner with a written document approved in form and acknowledged by the city.

A.  Approved backflow prevention devices, on the city's potable water services to the property, as required in these provisions, shall be provided, installed, tested and maintained by the user at user expense, unless otherwise determined by the city engineer. These devices shall be located on the property served immediately downstream of the meter. All devices shall be readily accessible for testing and maintenance and no device shall be submerged at any time. 
B.  When a request for recycled water service is initiated, the applicant must provide sufficient information, including plumbing and building plans, to enable the city engineer and other regulatory agencies to determine the level of backflow protection required. The proper backflow protection, as determined by the city engineer and other regulatory agencies, shall then be installed, inspected and tested before recycled water service is provided. 
C.  Each time there is a change of customer (either owner or tenant) on any commercial or industrial premise, the owner or customer shall notify the city engineer immediately. The city engineer will then reassess the level of protection required. In addition, any alterations to existing on-site facilities that may affect required protection level must be reported immediately to the city engineer. 
D.  At their discretion, representatives of any health agency having jurisdiction, and the city engineer, may conduct surveys of any property where recycled water service is provided by the city. These surveys shall serve to determine if any actual or potential cross-connections exist. The applicant, owner, or customer shall provide full cooperation in facilitating these surveys. 
E.  Where Protection is Required. Approved backflow protection for potable water supplies shall be provided as follows: 
1.  Each city water service connection that supplies potable water to a premises having an auxiliary water supply (including recycled water) that is not accepted as a potable source by the city engineer, and/or is not approved for potable use by the DOHS, shall be protected against backflow from the premises into the city potable water system. 
2.  Each city water service connection supplying potable or recycled water to a premises on which any substance is handled in such a fashion as to permit entry into the city water systems (potable or recycled) from the premises shall be protected against backflow. This shall include, but not be limited to, the handling of fertilizers, process waters, waters originating from any of the city water systems that have been subject to deterioration in quality, and agricultural use. 
3.  Approved backflow devices shall be installed where premises have intricate plumbing and piping arrangements or where not all portions of the premises are readily accessible for inspection. 
4.  Appropriate backflow protection may be required at premises where there has been a history of cross-connections being re-established. 
F.  Other Measures. 
1.  Whenever possible, the city will operate the recycled water system at a slightly lower pressure than the potable water system. This will cause potable water to flow in the recycled water system in the event of a cross-connection. 
2.  Water meters used for recycled water service shall be tagged or color-coded purple, color pantone 512 or 522, or otherwise distinguished as such per AWWA standards. These meters shall not be interchanged or used for potable water service after repairs and/or meter testing have been performed. 
3.  Periodic inspection, by the city, of the recycled water facilities will determine if all identifying items are still clearly discernable. If not, they shall be replaced, repaired or refurbished as needed, by the user. These items include:

5.  In the event of contamination or pollution of a city potable water system due to a cross-connection or other failure, the DOHS, the city engineer and the IEUA shall be promptly notified, so that appropriate and immediate measures may be taken to correct the problem. 
6.  The state and county health departments, the city engineer and the IEUA shall be kept informed by written document of the identity of the person responsible for the user's recycled water system on all premises concerned with these rules and regulations. At each authorized use area, an on-site recycled water supervisor shall be designated. This supervisor shall be responsible for: 
a.  The installation and use of all components of the on-site recycled water system(s); 
b.  Prevention of cross-connections; 
c.  Change in use of recycled water. 
G.  Recycled Water Service Termination Due to Health and Safety Concerns. When the city engineer determines that recycled water uses or conditions encountered by the city engineer represent a clear and immediate hazard to the city potable and/or recycled water supply that cannot be immediately removed or corrected, the city engineer shall begin the procedure for terminating recycled water use. Conditions or uses that create a basis for termination include, but are not limited to: 
1.  Refusal to install a required backflow prevention device;

    The level of protection required shall be related to the degree of potential hazard that exists on the premises served, and will be determined by the city engineer. 
(Ord. 98-12 § 1 (part), 1998.) 
13.06.240 - Inspection and maintenance of protective devices. 
    The user is responsible for inspection and testing of all backflow prevention devices at least once a year, or more often in those instances where successive inspections indicate repeated failure. All inspections and tests shall be performed at the user's expense by a city-approved testing firm. These devices shall be repaired, overhauled and/or replaced at the expense of the user whenever they are found to be defective. These devices shall also be tested immediately after they are installed, relocated or repaired. The user shall maintain records of all such tests, repairs and overhauls. These records shall be made available to the DOHS, on request, and submitted to the city engineer, annually. 
(Ord. 98-12 § 1 (part), 1998.) 
13.06.250 - Facilities design. 
    The design of off-site facilities, including the preparation of plans and construction specifications shall be under the responsibility of an engineer registered in the state of California. The design of customer (on-site) facilities that will use recycled water, and preparations of plans and construction specifications, shall be stamped and signed by a state of California Registered Landscape Architect or Civil Engineer, unless otherwise approved by the city engineer. Before the city engineer grants final acceptance of any system using recycled water, as-built drawings of the system shall be provided.

2.  Plans and specifications for all recycled water distribution facilities shall be submitted to and approved by the city engineer, and other regulatory agencies, in advance of construction. 
3.  The city will assume responsibility for providing recycled water service to the point of connection of such development on transfer, to the city, title to all off-site recycled water systems and any necessary easements. All easements shall be in a form acceptable to the city engineer, and not subject to outstanding obligations to relocate such facilities or any deeds of trust, except in instances where such is determined by the city engineer to be in the best interest of the city. 
4.  The property owner, proponent or developer may request that the city enter into a reimbursement agreement for the portions of a recycled water system that are required to be oversized (considering standard sizes of materials and city standards) with capacity to supply more recycled water than the property owner, proponent or developer requires. Or for certain items that would not be required if potable water were to be used in place of recycled water. The determination to enter into a reimbursement agreement, and the specific items that are the subject of reimbursement, will be made by the city. 
C.  On-site Facilities. 
1.  Any on-site recycled water facility shall be provided by the applicant, owner or customer at his expense. The applicant, owner or customer shall retain title to all on-site facilities. 
2.  When this chapter and/or standard specifications require a higher quality material, equipment, design or construction method than that required by other governing codes, rules and regulations, the city specifications shall take precedence. 
D.  Interim Service. In areas where recycled water is not immediately available when the use area is ready for construction, and if the city has determined that recycled water will be supplied in the future, on-site facilities shall be designed to use recycled water. Provisions shall be made, and this chapter followed, to allow for connection to the city off-site recycled water facilities, when available. In the interim, potable or other suitable water may be supplied to the on-site facilities through an "interim service connection." 
1.  Conditions of interim service are: 
a.  The city anticipates recycled water will be available to the site within five years of the time interim service is initiated; 
b.  The applicant must obtain a permit for recycled water service; 
c.  The applicant must agree to perform or pay for all work necessary to remove the interim connection and make connections to the permanent recycled water system at the time the recycled water system is installed. 
2.  An approved backflow prevention device is required on the interim service. The backflow prevention device shall be at the point of connection with the interim supply system and a part of the on-site recycled water facilities. 
3.  Future recycled water customers will pay for the following: 
a.  Cost of constructing and abandoning the interim service, and cost of constructing the recycled water service; 
b.  Applicable recycled water fees at the time service becomes available; 
c.  Applicable interim water rates for the type of water delivered through the interim service. 
4.  When recycled water is available to the site, an inspection of the on-site facilities will be conducted by the city engineer to verify that the facilities have been adequately maintained and are still in compliance with the recycled water use permit. Recycled water service shall be provided on verification of compliance. If the facilities are not in compliance, the city engineer shall notify the user to correct the situation.

Chapter 13.13 - SEWAGE FACILITIES DEVELOPMENT FEE 
Sections: 

13.13.010 - Findings. 
    The city council finds and determines as follows: 
A.  The imposition and collection of a sewage facilities development fee (SFDF) upon connection of any residential dwelling unit, and each commercial and industrial use building to the city's sewer system, and the regional sewage system operated and maintained by Chino Basin Municipal Water District (CBMWD), is the most practical and equitable method of providing revenues for the expansion, construction, reconstruction, acquisition and improvement of the sewage transmission and reclamation facilities to meet the continuing (new) development needs of the city. 
B.  The SFDF imposed upon the connection of any residential dwelling unit, and each commercial and industrial use buildings to the city's sewer system is for the purpose of funding sewage transmission and reclamation facilities available to such buildings and the amount of the fee hereby imposed is reasonable and directly related to such benefit. 
C.  Pursuant to the Chino Basin Regional Sewage Service Contract, with amendments, and in accordance with Sections 9 and 10 thereof, the latest approved ten-year forecast and accompanying financing plan establishes the cost basis upon which the amount and any adjustment to the SFDF is to be made. 
(Ord. 96-02 § 1, 1996; Ord. 89-20 (part), 1989: Ord. 79-20 (part), 1979).

    For the purpose of this chapter, the words defined in this section shall have the following meanings: 
A.  "City" refers to the city of Chino. 
B.  "Domestic wastewater" means the wastewater from or equivalent to that which normally results from domestic residency. 
C.  "Existing facility" means any facility for which a building permit was issued prior to May 1, 1979. 
D.  "Industrial wastewater" means a discharge of nondomestic wastewater as found by the local sewage agency. 
E.  "Local sewage agency" means city, county, CBMWD, and other local governmental subdivision which provides sewage service, and is empowered to regulate discharges to the public sewers. 
F.  "Nondomestic wastewater" means all wastewater of a community excluding domestic wastewater, and includes all such wastewater from any producing, manufacturing, processing, institutional, and commercial or other operation which contains characteristics unlike that of domestic wastewater. 
G.  The equivalent dwelling unit (EDU) means a numerical value designation whereby one EDU is equivalent to a single-family residential unit producing a domestic wastewater of an average daily flow rate of two hundred seventy gallons. The numerical value is derived from a mathematical formula in which total flow (Q), biochemical oxygen demand (BOD), and suspended solids (SS) are proportionally adjusted for these variables as follows: 
    EDU = Q / 270 (0.37 + 0.31 BOD / 230 + 0.32 SS / 200 ) 
    BOD = Biochemical oxygen demand (mg/l) 
    SS = Suspended Solids (mg/l) 
    Q = Sewage flow discharge to the city sewer collection system (GPD) based upon prevailing and applicable statistical information. 
    An equivalent dwelling unit (EDU) for industrial and commercial users will be determined by local sewering agency based upon information supplied by the user/applicant on an industrial waste permit application, or from current and applicable information on file in the office of the city engineer. 
    Equivalent dwelling unit (EDU) factors for various user/discharger categories are as follows:

If an interceptor is not adequate under the conditions of use, it shall be replaced with one which is effective in accomplishing the intended purpose. 
E.  The city's building official shall maintain a file available for public reference of suitable designs of grease and sand and oil interceptors. This shall be for informational purposes. Installation of an interceptor of a design shown in this file or of any design meeting the size requirements set forth in this chapter shall not impute any liability to the city for the adequacy of the interceptor under actual conditions of use. Also, it shall not relieve the owner or proprietor of responsibility for keeping grease, sand and oil out of the city's public sewerage system. 
F.  The city's building official shall not approve the plumbing of a food service establishment, and/or a vehicle service facility if it does not have a grease or sand and oil interceptor meeting the requirements of this section. 
G.  The grease or sand and oil interceptor of any facility shall be properly maintained. It shall be cleaned as often as is necessary by the owner or user to assure that all grease, sediment, floating material, sand and oil do not accumulate to impair the efficiency of the interceptor. When an interceptor is cleaned, the accumulated sediment and floating material shall be removed and disposed of legally. Under no circumstance shall the material removed from a grease or sand and oil interceptor be discharged into a public sewerage system, storm drain system, or ground. An interceptor is not considered to be properly maintained if for any reason it is not in good working condition. An interceptor is not considered to be properly maintained if grease, sediment, floating material, sand and oil accumulations total more than twenty-five percent of the operating fluid capacity. The owner of any facility, the lessee and sublessee, if there be such, and any proprietor, operator, or superintendent of such facility are individually and severally liable for any failure or improper maintenance of such interceptor. In addition, the grease, sand and oil interceptor shall be maintained so that the discharge will comply with all limits contained in the resolution titled "Wastewater Effluent Limitations." 
H.  Any and all enforcement of this section will be carried out by the city's building official.

Editor's note- Ord. 2010-10, § 1, adopted Oct. 19, 2010, amended Ch. 15.01 in its entirety to read as herein set out. Former Ch. 15.01, § 15.01.010, pertained to similar subject matter and derived from: Ord. 99-03 § 2, 1999; Ord. 2002-14 § 1 (part), 2002; Ord. 2003-18 § 1, 2003; Ord. 2005-17 § 1, 2005; and Ord. 2007-14 § 1, 2007. 

15.01.010 - Findings. 
    The city council finds that the requirements set forth in this title are reasonable and necessary modifications because of climatic, geological, and topographical conditions within the city of Chino. 
    The "findings of need" contained herein address each of these conditions and present the local situations which cause the established amendments to be adopted. 
A.  The community experiences frequent low humidity, summer temperatures exceeding one hundred degrees Fahrenheit, and severe Santa Ana winds reaching gusts of ninety miles per hour. Adverse climatic conditions increase the likelihood of fire. Minor fires can rapidly spread because of the climate and vegetation. 
B.  The community periodically experiences drought and a resultant limited water supply. The limited rainfall and storage capacities, and continued consumption demands require sound management of water resources and conservation where possible. There is a need for changes and modifications in the California Building and California Plumbing Code, which will contribute to water conservation and water for suppression of large fires. 
C.  The community is located in an area of continuing seismic activity. Existing and planned development is at risk from damage and fire because of this activity. 
D.  The configuration and type of existing development require additional review. Wood construction, including wood shingle and wood shake roofing, presents extreme adverse fire conditions as does the close proximity of some buildings. 
E.  There are a number of significant barriers and obstructions to quick emergency response. These include: increased vehicular traffic on surface streets; additional traffic signals; freeway, expressways, and storm drain channels which bisect the city; and the California Institution for Men. Existing older streets were in some cases designed as storm drains and become impassable during heavy rainfall. 
F.  The community is located in an air quality nonattainment region. Research conducted by the South Coast Air Quality Management District and reflected in the 2003 Clean Air Plan describes emissions and pollutants caused by incomplete combustion of wood burning devices, such as fireplaces. Emissions and pollutants may be greatly reduced with the use of gas-fired type fireplaces. Clean air vehicles, such as CNG (compressed natural gas) automobiles, also reduce emissions and pollutants. Installation of a gas line within a private garage to provide for future CNG vehicles will allow for these types of reductions. 
G.  According to government statistics, drowning is the number one cause of accidental death for children under the age of five in California, Arizona, and Florida. Nationally, drowning is the second leading cause of accidental deaths to children under five years of age. Between 1990 and 1998, there were five thousand eight hundred three children five years of age or under that were drowning victims in the United States. A well designed pool fence can change those facts for the better.

(Ord. 2016-015, § 13, 2016.) 
15.32.350 - Findings. 
    The city council hereby finds that the proposed amendments to the fire code are reasonable and necessary because of local climactic, geologic and topographical conditions within the Chino Valley Independent Fire District ("district"). This finding is supported and based upon the following express findings which address each of these conditions and present the local situation which make the proposed amendments necessary: 
1.  The climate weather patterns within the district include frequent periods of drought and low humidity adding to the fire danger. Fire season can be year-round in this region. 
2.  During the summer months the dry winds and existing vegetation mix to create a hazardous fuel condition which has resulted in large loss vegetation and structure fires. Summer temperatures exceeding one hundred degrees (100°), and severe "Santa Ana" winds frequently occur and can move a fire quickly throughout areas of the district. Multiple shifting wind patterns throughout the canyon areas add to the difficulty in suppressing fires. 
3.  Because of weather patterns, the district has experienced a need for water conservation. Due to the storage capacities and consumption, and a limited amount of rainfall (drought conditions), future water allocation is not fully dependable. While sound management of the water resources is possible, demands and possible critical depletions on an already stressed water supply can most assuredly be predicted. 
4.  Features located throughout the district are major roadways, highways, freeways and flood control channels which create barriers and slow response times. Other unique factors which create barriers and slow response times are the multiple canyons located within the district and the large California Institute for Men property. 
5.  The topography is also very steep in large areas of the district affecting the rate of fire spread and response times. 
6.  Due to the sloping in the regional valley where the district is located, as well as the present street and storm drain design, heavy rainfall causes roadway flooding and landslides which at times may make an access route impassable. 
7.  The district has within its boundaries active seismic hazards. Seismic activity within the district occurs yearly and a fire potential exists with these active faults. Existing structures and planned new development are at serious risk from an earthquake. This risk includes fire, collapse and the disruption of water supply for firefighting purposes. Areas can also become isolated as a result of bridge, overpass and road damage and debris. 
8.  Structures in close proximity to each other pose an exposure problem which may cause a fire to spread from one structure to another as well as to the wildland area. 
9.  For practical and cost reasons, many new structures are built of wood construction. Many existing structures also have wood shake roofs. The potential for a conflagration exists due to the design and density of current structures. 
10.  Electrical supply and telephone communication failures occur due to high winds as well as others reasons. Water supply pumps and early notification cannot always be counted on. 
11.  Narrow and winding streets with little circulation and streets designed as storm drains impede emergency vehicle access and evacuation routes.

B.  It shall be the policy of the city that a sign should serve primarily to identify the general nature of an establishment, or to direct attention to a product, activity, place, person, organization or enterprise. As identification devices, signs must not subject the citizenry to excessive competition for their visual attention. As appropriate identification devices, signs must harmonize with the building or activity they serve, the neighborhood in which they are located, and other signs in the area. 
C.  Furthermore, the installation of signs that improve the appearance of a building and neighborhood is encouraged. To this end, the use of artistry and innovation in the design of signs is encouraged.

3.  All remedies concerning this title shall be cumulative and not exclusive. The conviction and punishment of any person(s) hereunder shall not relieve such person(s) from the responsibility of correcting prohibited conditions or removing prohibited signs, and shall not prevent the enforced correction or removal thereof.

16.01.060 - Interpretation. 
A.  When there is any question regarding the interpretation of a provision of this title, or its application to any specific case or situation, the planning commission shall have the authority to interpret the intent of this title. The planning commission shall make such interpretations by written decision, which shall be in the form of a resolution adopted by a majority of the planning commission's voting membership.

Chapter 16.04 - NONCONFORMING SIGNS 
Sections: 

16.04.010 - Purpose and intent. 
A.  The purpose of these provisions is to provide for the orderly termination of nonconforming signs to promote the public health, safety and general welfare, and to bring such signs into conformity with the goals and policies of the city's adopted general plan. 
B.  It is declared that nonconforming signs within the city are detrimental to both the general welfare of the citizens and their property, and to the orderly and creative development of the city. It is further declared that nonconforming signs shall be eliminated as rapidly as possible without infringing upon the constitutional rights of property owners. Recognizing such, it is the intent of this chapter to: (1) prevent the expansion of nonconforming signs to the maximum extent feasible; (2) establish criteria under which nonconforming signs may be continued or expanded; and (3) provide for the correction or removal of nonconforming signs in an equitable, reasonable and timely manner. 
(Ord. 97-12 § 2 (part), 1997.) 
16.04.020 - Applicability. 
    Nonconforming signs may be maintained, expanded upon, and/or abated only in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
(Ord. 97-12 § 2 (part), 1997.) 
16.04.030 - Signs previously approved. 
    Any sign erected pursuant to a permit lawfully issued by the city prior to the enactment date of the sign code (December 2, 1997) shall be treated as a conforming sign, except as provided in Section 16.04.050, Amortization, of this chapter. All such signs may be continued, maintained and repaired so long as the sign is not structurally altered or expanded. A permit may be issued for any such sign destroyed by earthquake, fire, or other similar misadventure, if any application for a permit to re-erect the sign is made within six months of its destruction. 
(Ord. 97-12 § 2 (part), 1997.) 
16.04.040 - Illegal signs. 
A.  Nuisances. The following signs shall be considered illegal and deemed to be a nuisance: 
1.  Unsafe signs. An unsafe sign is a sign determined by the director of community development to be any of the following: (a) a sign which poses a danger to the public or which could create a potential hazard; (b) a sign erected without required permits; or (c) a sign erected in the public right-of-way or on public property without specific written authorization from the city. 
2.  Abandoned signs. An abandoned sign is a sign remaining in place for a period of sixty days, which no longer advertises or identifies an ongoing business, product or service available on the premise where the sign is located. 
3.  Unmaintained signs. An unmaintained sign is a sign which has not been kept in a proper state of preservation, free of damaged or broken components, and kept neatly painted and maintained. 
4.  Illegally erected signs. A sign is illegally erected if: (a) it violates any provision of this title, except as provided by Section 16.04.030, Signs Previously Approved, of this chapter; (b) it does not have required permits; or (c) it has been erected without first complying with all ordinances and regulations in effect at its time of construction, erection or use. No sign that has been erected in violation of any previously existing sign ordinances or regulations shall, by virtue of the adoption of the sign code, become conforming. 
B.  Existing illegal signs. Any business located on the same property where a sign has been determined by the director of community development to be illegal, shall not be granted a permit for additional signs until all illegal signs have been removed, except as follows: 
1.  The sign determined to be illegal is associated with a different business from that for which the permit for additional signage is sought, even though they may be located in the same center or complex; or 
2.  The sign determined to be illegal is not owned or controlled by the permit applicant, and the permit applicant is not the agent of the person who owns or controls the illegal sign. 
C.  Inventory of illegal signs. Within six months following the enactment date of the sign code, the city shall commence identification and inventory of illegal signs within the city. Within ninety days following the six-month period, the city shall commence abatement of all identified illegal signs. 
D.  Removal of illegal signs. 
1.  Unsafe signs.

c.  The notice shall contain the following information: 
(i)  The exact nature of the violation; 
(ii)  The necessary corrective action; 
(iii)  An opportunity to meet informally with the director of community development for the purpose of discussing the violation and necessary corrective action; and

(Ord. No. 2011-08, § 15, 2011.) 
16.04.050 - Amortization. 
    A sign lawfully placed, erected or constructed at the time an ordinance codified in this title became effective, and which does not conform with the applicable newly enacted regulations, is deemed a "legal nonconforming sign." Legal nonconforming signs shall be removed or made to meet current sign code requirements within the following time periods, following enactment of the sign code, except that time periods for signs nonconforming by reason of annexation to the city, shall begin on the date of completion of the annexation: 
Temporary and moveable signs 90 days Painted signs 3 years Pole signs 10 years  
(Ord. 97-12 § 2 (part), 1997.) 
16.04.060 - Abatement. 
A.  Abatement of nonconforming signs shall be accomplished in the following manner: 
1.  Painted signs. Signs painted on buildings, walls and fences may be painted over in such a manner that the sign will not thereafter become visible. Such painting shall cause the sign area to blend with, and be compatible with, the color scheme of the building. 
2.  All other signs. All other signs not otherwise specified by this section shall be removed or altered to cause it to conform with the provisions of this title. 
B.  Nothing in this section shall prohibit the normal upkeep or repair of any sign, nor the painting or repainting of the face thereof, during its lawful existence. 
(Ord. 97-12 § 2 (part), 1997.) 
Chapter 16.05 - SIGN REGULATIONS 
Sections: 

16.05.010 - Purpose and intent. 
    The purpose of these provisions is to regulate the design, character, size, location, type, materials, color and illumination of signs to: 
A.  Protect the public health, safety and welfare of the community; 
B.  Implement community design standards consistent with the goals and policies of the city's adopted general plan; 
C.  Promote an aesthetically pleasing appearance within the community through the prohibition of sign clutter; 
D.  Promote signs that identify uses and premises without confusion; and 
E.  Reduce possible traffic and safety hazards through good signage. 
(Ord. 97-12 § 2 (part), 1997.) 
16.05.020 - Applicability. 
    No sign shall be erected or maintained in any zoning district established by the city's zoning ordinance (Title 20, CMC), except those signs specifically enumerated in this title. The number, area and height of signs as outlined in this chapter, are maximum standards. In addition to the enumerated standards, consideration shall be given to a sign's relationship to the overall appearance of the property upon which it is placed, and the surrounding community. Compatible design, simplicity and sign effectiveness are to be used in establishing guidelines for sign approval. 
(Ord. 97-12 § 2 (part), 1997.) 
16.05.030 - Construction and maintenance. 
A.  Construction. The construction of signs shall be enforced and administered by the building official. All signs and advertising structures shall be designed and constructed to withstand wind loads, dead loads, and lateral forces as required by the Uniform Sign Code and the provisions of this chapter. 
B.  Identification. Every sign or other advertising structure hereafter erected in the city, shall have an identifying number, name of erector, installation year and, if illuminated, the voltage plainly placed on the exterior surface of the sign body, in a location where such information is readily visible after erection and installation. 
C.  Illumination. 
1.  Internally illuminated signs. The illumination level of a sign shall be reduced if it is determined to be excessive as a result of city evaluation. Illumination shall be considered excessive if it is substantially greater than the illumination level of other nearby signs, if it interferes with the visibility of other signs or with the perception of objects or buildings in the vicinity of the sign, if it directs glare toward streets or motorists, if it adversely impacts nearby residents or neighborhoods, or if the illumination reduces the nighttime readability of the sign. 
2.  Externally illuminated signs. The light source for externally illuminated signs shall be arranged and shielded to substantially confine all direct light rays to the sign face and away from streets and adjacent properties. 
D.  Maintenance. All signs, together with their supports and appurtenances shall be kept neatly painted and posted. The director of community development may order the removal of any sign that is not maintained in accordance with the provisions of this title, pursuant to the provisions of Subsection 16.04.040.D of this title. 
(Ord. 97-12 § 2 (part), 1997.) 
16.05.040 - Design guidelines. 
    The following design guidelines are intended as a reference to assist the designer in understanding the city's goals and objectives for high quality sign design, construction and placement throughout the city. The guidelines complement the mandatory sign regulations contained in Table 16.05.1 (Sign Regulation Matrix) of this chapter by providing good examples of potential design solutions and by providing design interpretations of the various mandatory regulations. 
    The design guidelines are general and may be interpreted with some flexibility in their application to specific projects. The guidelines will be utilized during the city's review of a sign program or sign plan to encourage the highest level of design quality, while at the same time providing the flexibility necessary to encourage creativity on the part of the designer. However, unless there is a compelling reason, these design guidelines shall be observed. 
A.  General guidelines. 
1.  Use a brief message. The fewer words used, the more effective the sign. A sign with a brief message is quicker and easier to read, looks cleaner and is more attractive. A sign should only include the name and/or nature of the business, and in addition to the name, may contain a maximum of three words describing the business or service provided. 
2.  Avoid overly intricate fonts. Signs utilizing very intricate font styles are generally difficult to read and reduce a sign's ability to communicate effectively. 
3.  Avoid faddish and peculiar fonts. Signs utilizing faddish or peculiar fonts may look good today, but soon go out of style. The image conveyed may quickly become that of a dated and unfashionable business. 
4.  Sign colors and materials. The colors and materials of a sign should be selected so that they contribute to sign legibility and design integrity. Even the most carefully thought out sign may be unattractive and a poor communicator because of poor color selection. Day-glo, fluorescent and overly bright or loud colors should not be used. 
5.  Provide contrast between background and letters/symbols. Use significant contrast between the sign's letter/symbol color and its background color. If there is little contrast in the hue (shade or tint) and intensity (brightness) between the background and letter/symbol colors, it will be difficult to read. 
6.  Avoid too many different colors. The use of too many different colors will overwhelm the basic function of communication. The colors compete with sign content for the viewer's attention. The limited use of accent colors can increase legibility, while large areas of competing colors tend to confuse and annoy. 
7.  Sign placement. Signs should be placed at or near the entrance of a site or building to show the most direct access to the business. 
8.  Proportion, scale and rhythm of sign placement. Signs should be placed consistent with the proportions and scale of building elements within a building's facade: 
a.  A particular sign may fit well on a large, plain wall area, but would overpower the finer scale and proportion of the lower storefront. 
b.  Signs can be used to establish facade rhythm, scale and proportion where such elements are weak in the building design. On buildings having a monolithic or plain facade, signs can be used to establish or continue appropriate design rhythm, proportion and scale. 
c.  The proportion of letter area to sign background area should be carefully considered. If the letters take up too much of the background area, they may be harder to read-large letters are not necessarily more legible than smaller ones. Generally, letters should not appear to occupy more than seventy percent of the sign's background area. 
9.  Pedestrian signs. Signs oriented to pedestrians should be smaller in scale. The pedestrian-oriented sign is usually read from a distance of fifteen to twenty feet, whereas the vehicle-oriented sign is designed to be viewed from a much greater distance. The closer the sign's viewing distance, the smaller the sign needs to be. 
10.  Freestanding signs. Freestanding signs should incorporate the materials and architectural features used in the building(s) they serve. 
B.  Wall or fascia signs. 
1.  Wall and fascia signs should be compatible with the predominant visual elements of the building. Commercial centers and offices, industrial parks, business parks and other similar facilities, are required to be part of a sign program in accordance with the provisions of Section 16.03.040 (Sign program) of this sign code. 
2.  Where there is more than one sign for a business (e.g., single tenant buildings) or group of businesses (e.g., multiple tenant buildings, commercial centers, or business or industrial parks), all signs should be complementary to one another in the following ways: 
a.  Type of construction materials (cabinet, sign copy, supports, etc.); 
b.  Letter size and style of copy; 
c.  Method and design of sign support (wall mounting or monument base); 
d.  Configuration of sign area; and 
e.  Proportion of sign copy area to background. 
3.  Lighted signs, whether internally or externally illuminated, are permitted, provided that they are not harsh or overly bright. The use of can-type box signs with translucent backlit panels is strongly discouraged. Panels should be opaque if a can-type sign is used, with only the lettering appearing to be lighted. 
4.  Signs with backlit or internally illuminated individual channel letters are strongly encouraged. 
C.  Freestanding signs. 
1.  Freestanding signs are intended to provide identification for single tenant buildings, multiple tenant buildings, commercial offices and centers, and business and industrial parks. Signs for single tenant buildings should include the street address of the business. Signs for multiple tenant buildings, commercial offices and centers, and business and industrial parks should display the range of business addresses for that development. The business address shall not be included in the sign area calculation. 
2.  Lighted signs, whether internally or externally illuminated, are permitted, provided that they are not harsh or overly bright. Signs should consist of individual affixed to an opaque, matte finished, background. The use of backlit (halo lighting) letters is strongly encouraged. 
3.  Freestanding signs should be placed perpendicular to approaching vehicular traffic. 
4.  Freestanding signs should be placed in raised planters of sufficient area, shape and design that will provide a compatible setting and ground definition to the signs. Generally, the following ratio of fully landscaped and irrigated planter area to sign area should be provided: 
a.  Monument signs-Two SF of planter area for each SF of sign area (total of all sides); 
b.  Directory signs-Two SF of planter area for each SF of sign area (one side only); and 
c.  Pylon signs-As determined appropriate by the director of community development.

B.  Only the payment of fees may be required in subdivisions containing fifty parcels or less, except that when a condominium project, stock cooperative, or community apartment project, as those terms are defined in Section 1351 of the California Civil Code, exceeds fifty dwelling units, dedication of land may be required notwithstanding that the number of parcels maybe less than fifty.

18.01.040 - Major land development projects. 
A.  For purposes of this chapter, a "major land development project" shall be a land development project exceeding forty acres in size. 
B.  When a proposed subdivision or development is a part of a major land development project, and the owner of such land proposes to permit development by several subdividers or developers, provisions for dedication of the land and/or payment of in-lieu fees and development fees required by this chapter shall be made by the major landowner through adoption of a comprehensive plan approved by the planning commission, and not by the individual subdividers or developers. 
C.  Where land has been dedicated and/or in-lieu fees or development fees paid in excess of the requirements of this chapter for any subdivision or development, the major landowner, at the discretion of the city, may be given one hundred percent credit for such excess dedication on subsequent subdivisions or projects within such comprehensive plan. 
D.  Where a subdivision or other residential development is proposed for construction in increments, a schedule for the dedication of all land and payment of all fees required by this chapter providing the park and recreational facilities shall be submitted for approval by the planning commission, and a bond equal to one hundred percent of the value of all such land and all fees shall be provided to the city, guaranteeing completion of such dedication and payment of fees in accordance with the approved comprehensive plan.

B.  When the developer's master plan of development allocates space for a golf course, lake or the like, hereinafter called "special facilities," designed to serve both the residents of a subdivision and the general public, the developer may, at the city's discretion pursuant to this chapter, be credited for supplying a portion of the requirements of this chapter up to an amount not to exceed fifty percent credit on only the subdivision that abuts such special facility. However, such special facility shall not eliminate the requirement for other designated park and recreation facilities needed to serve the subdivision. The special facility shall be restricted to its initial purpose and permanently devoted or dedicated to use by the general public, unless a satisfactory substitute is approved by the planning commission. 
C.  Common interest developments, as defined in Section 1351 of the California Civil Code, shall be eligible to receive a credit, as determined by the director of community services pursuant to Section 18.01.120 against the amount of land required to be dedicated, or the amount of the fee in lieu of such dedication imposed by this chapter, for the value of private space within the development which is usable for active recreational uses. 
(Ord. 2002-17 § 1 (part), 2002.) 
18.01.060 - Standards. 
A.  It hereby is found and determined that the public interest, convenience, health, welfare and safety require that three acres of land for each one thousand persons residing within the city be devoted to park and recreational purposes, unless the amount of existing neighborhood and community park areas, as calculated pursuant to this subdivision, exceeds that limit, in which case the legislative body may adopt the calculated amount as a higher standard not to exceed five acres per one thousand persons residing within a subdivision subject to this section. 
B.  It hereby is found and determined that the public interest, convenience, health, welfare and safety require development of land for park or recreational purposes at a cost determined on an acreage basis for development of the average neighborhood park site of approximately five acres, with playgrounds, play equipment and facilities, parking lots, street improvements, landscaping and other appropriate and common amenities. Historically, such cost has been and now is 1.12 times the value of land devoted to park and recreational purposes, as determined from time to time by the city council pursuant to the provisions of the mitigation fee act contained in Chapters 5 through 9 of Division 1 of Title 7 of the California Government Code. 
C.  It also hereby is found and determined that the amount and location of land to be dedicated for park and recreational purposes and the fees in lieu of such dedication and additional development fees required to be paid by this chapter bear a reasonable relationship to the use of the park and recreational facilities created thereby by the future inhabitants of the residential development or subdivision, and such fees do not exceed the estimated reasonable cost of providing such facilities.

B.  The number and definition of single family residential units, multiple family residential units, and mobile home units shall be determined pursuant to the most recent available decennial U.S. Census or California department of finance census. 
C.  The density factor for a type of residential unit shall be determined by dividing the number of persons residing in such units by the number of such units. This shall be computed by taking an appropriate sampling from the most recent available decennial U.S. Census or California department of finance census. 
D.  When a proposed development or subdivision contains dwelling units with different density factors, the formula shall be used for each such density factor and the results shall be totaled. 
E.  The number of dwelling units in a development or subdivision shall be the number proposed for construction. When the actual number of units to be constructed is unknown, it shall be assumed for the purposes of this chapter that the maximum number permissible by law will be constructed. 
F.  For purposes of this chapter, a dwelling unit shall include each single family dwelling and each habitable unit of an apartment, duplex, condominium, multiple dwelling structure, planned residential development, stock cooperatives and community apartment projects as defined in Sections 11003, 11003.1, 11003.2, 11003.4 and 11004 respectively of the Business and Professions Code and condominiums as defined in Section 783 of the Civil Code stock cooperative, mobile home park or the like, designed as a separate place for habitation of a family in the applicable laws or regulations of the city.

Special facilities, however, shall be permanently devoted or dedicated to use by the general public by such a covenant or other legal equivalent, unless a satisfactory substitute is approved by the planning commission; 
4.  The facilities and amenities proposed for the open space are in substantial accordance with the provisions of conservation and open space element of the general plan and master plan of parks of the city;

2.  Whether the ultimate population of such subdivision or development for which a credit is sought exceeds the density permitted for a normal residential development of four and one half (4.5) units per acre; 
3.  Whether the private open space within such subdivision or development is, in fact, usable for active recreational uses; 
4.  What portion, if any, of the total recreational uses for the residents of such subdivision or development is satisfied by the private open space within the private development;

6.  Regardless of who files the appeal, the burden of demonstrating that a project satisfies all applicable standards and criteria as required by this Subdivision Ordinance (Title 19 of this Code) shall lie with the project applicant. 
(Ord. 2010-07, § 1(exh. A), 2010; Ord. 2014-020, § 1, 2015.) 
19.01.120 - Waiver of requirements. 
    Any requirement imposed by this title may be waived by the planning commission or the city council upon an affirmative finding that the subdivision is such that compliance with the requirements is unnecessary, that imposition of the requirements would constitute an undue burden on the subdivider, and that waiver of the requirements would not be detrimental to surrounding properties and to the public interest and would not violate any regulations in the Subdivision Map Act. 
(Ord. 2010-07, § 1(exh. A), 2010.) 
19.01.130 - Prohibitions, remedies and penalties. 
A.  Prohibited transactions. 
1.  No person shall offer to sell or lease, to contract to sell or lease, or to finance any parcel or parcels of real property or to commence construction of any building for sale, lease or financing thereon, except for model homes, or to allow occupancy thereof, for which a final map is required by this title, until such map thereof in full compliance with the provisions of this title has been filed for record by the county recorder. 
2.  No person shall sell, lease, or finance any parcel or parcels of real property or commence construction of any building for sale, lease or financing thereon, except for model homes, or allow occupancy thereof, for which a parcel map is required by this title, until such map thereof in full compliance with the provisions of this title has been filed for record by the county recorder. 
3.  Conveyances of any part of a division of real property for which a final or parcel map is required by this title shall not be made by parcel or block number, initial or other designation, unless and until such map has been filed for record by the county recorder. 
B.  Voidability of deeds. Any deed of conveyance, sale, or contract to sell real property which has been divided, or which has resulted from a division, in violation of the provisions of this title, is voidable at the sole option of the grantee, buyer or person contracting to purchase, his heirs, personal representative, or trustee in insolvency or bankruptcy within one year after the date of discovery of the violation of the provisions of this title. 
C.  Injunctive relief. This title does not bar any legal, equitable, or summary remedy to which the city or any person, firm, or corporation may otherwise be entitled, and the city or such person, firm or corporation, may file a suit in the superior court of the county to restrain or enjoin any attempted or proposed division for sale, lease, or financing in violation of this title. 
D.  Penalties. Each violation of this title by a person who is the subdivider or an owner of record, at the time of the violation, of property involved in the violation shall be punishable by imprisonment in the county jail not exceeding one year or in the state prison, by a fine not exceeding ten thousand dollars, or by both that fine and imprisonment. Every other violation of this title is a misdemeanor. 
E.  Development contrary to public health or safety. The city shall not issue any permit or grant any approval necessary to develop any real property which has been divided, or which has resulted in a division, in violation of the provisions of this title, if it finds that development of such real property is contrary to public health or public safety. If the city issues a permit or grants approval for the development of any such real property, it may impose such additional conditions as would have been applicable to the division of the property at the time the current owner of record acquired the property. 
(Ord. 2010-07, § 1(exh. A), 2010.) 
19.01.140 - Certificate of compliance. 
A.  Any person owning real property may request, and the city shall determine, whether the division of such real property complies with the provisions of this title. Upon making such a determination, the city shall cause a certificate of compliance to be filed for record with the county recorder. The certificate of compliance shall identify the real property and shall state that the division thereof complies with applicable provisions of this title and the Subdivision Map Act. The city may impose a reasonable fee to cover the cost of issuing and recording the certificate of compliance. 
B.  If the city determines that the division of such real property does not comply with the provisions of this title, it may, as a condition to granting a certificate of compliance, impose any of the conditions permitted under this chapter. 
C.  A recorded final subdivision map or parcel map shall constitute a certificate of compliance with respect to the parcels of real property described therein. 
(Ord. 2010-07, § 1(exh. A), 2010.) 
19.01.150 - Severability. 
    If any provision of this title or the application of this title to any person or circumstance is held invalid, the remainder of this title or the application of a provision to other persons or circumstances shall not be affected. 
(Ord. 2010-07, § 1(exh. A), 2010.) 
19.01.160 - Remainder parcels.

In the latter case, the subdivider shall be required to furnish security in connection with the performance of such agreement as provided in Chapter 19.09 of this title. 
C.  Notwithstanding Subsection B of this section, the city council hereby finds that it is necessary for reasons of public health and safety that all required off-site improvements be constructed within a period of twelve months following the recordation of a parcel map or final map for each parcel or unit of land designated on such map as the remainder upon which there exists a building or other usable structure at the time of such recordation. 
(Ord. 2010-07, § 1(exh. A), 2010.) 
Chapter 19.02 - TENTATIVE MAP

19.02.010 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of the tentative map is to provide thorough investigation of a proposed subdivision by the director of community development, other agencies both within the city and outside the city, the planning commission, and the city council. Approval or conditional approval of a tentative map enables a subdivider creating four or fewer parcels to apply for a parcel map and a subdivider creating five or more parcels to apply for a final map. A tentative map shall be filed by subdividers who intend to create any number of parcels, but who do not intend to request the rights to proceed with development associated with a vesting tentative map. 
(Ord. 2010-07, § 1(exh. A), 2010.)

    A tentative map and a final map shall be required for all subdivisions creating five or more parcels, five or more condominiums as defined in Section 783 of the California Civil Code, a community apartment project containing five or more parcels, or for the conversion of a dwelling to a stock cooperative containing five or more dwelling units. However, where a subdivider is creating four or fewer parcels or where any one of the following occurs, a tentative map and a parcel map shall be required instead: 
A.  Situation. The land before division contains fewer than five acres, each parcel created by the division abuts upon a maintained public street or highway, and no dedications or improvements are required by the legislative body. 
B.  Acreage-Twenty acres. Each parcel created by the division has a gross area of twenty acres or more and has approved access to a maintained public street or highway. 
C.  Acreage-Forty acres. Each parcel created by the division has a gross area of not fewer than forty acres or not less than a quarter of a quarter section. 
D.  Industrial or commercial. The land consists of a parcel or parcels of land having approved access to a public street or highway, which comprises part of a tract of land zoned for industrial or commercial development, and which has the approval of the governing body as to street alignments and widths. 
E.  Environmental subdivision. The land being subdivided is solely for the creation of an environmental subdivision pursuant to Section 66418.2 of the Subdivision Map Act.

19.02.040 - Acceptance or rejection of filing. 
    The director of community development shall, within thirty calendar days from the time the tentative map and all required accompanying data have been received, examine the map and accompanying data and, if they are in full compliance with the provisions of all laws and this chapter, shall deem the application as complete and accept the map for filing. If it is incomplete and not accepted, it shall be returned to the subdivider with a written statement of the reason it was not accepted for filing. The date when the map is accepted for filing shall be considered its official filing date. After filing is complete, review of the tentative map begins, as described in Section 19.02.050 of this title. 
(Ord. 2010-07, § 1(exh. A), 2010.) 
19.02.050 - Review by director of community development. 
A.  Copies of filing to interested public agencies. The director of community development shall forward copies of the filed tentative map and other pertinent accompanying data to interested public agencies within five days of filing. The agencies may, in turn, forward to the director of community development their findings and recommendations thereon within fifteen days of receipt. 
B.  City engineer report. The city engineer shall prepare a written report to the director of community development on a tentative map. This report shall verify that the tentative map and its supporting documents are in an acceptable form and that the improvements they show conform to the provisions of this title and Title 20 of the Chino Municipal Code. 
C.  Development review. Within thirty days from the official filing date of a tentative map, the director of community development shall schedule a development review meeting to be held prior to the date on which the map is scheduled for planning commission action. Written notice of such meeting shall be given to the subdivider and all interested agencies. At such meeting, all recommendations made by various agencies and departments shall be discussed. The results of the meeting shall be incorporated into the director of community development's written report, as specified in Subsection D, below. 
D.  Written report. The director of community development shall prepare a written report to the planning commission on a tentative map. This report shall consider the relationship of the map to the Subdivision Map Act, to this title, Title 20 of the Chino Municipal Code, other city ordinances, the general plan and applicable specific plans, and comments of any other city department or public agency, made either in writing or at the development review meeting. The report shall also recommend conditions to be placed on the map, and it shall incorporate the report of the city engineer. A copy of the director of community development's report on a tentative map shall be provided to the subdivider and to those persons specified in Section 66452.3 of the Subdivision Map Act at least three days prior to any hearing or action on such map by the planning commission. 
E.  Exceptions. Any requests for exceptions to the conditions recommended in the written report shall be filed, in writing, with the director of community development not later than the second working day following the publication of the written report. 
(Ord. 2010-07, § 1(exh. A), 2010.) 
19.02.060 - Environmental review and review by planning commission. 
A.  Environmental review. The director of community development, upon receipt of a tentative map for filing conforming to all requirements of this chapter, together with the appropriate filing fees, shall make a preliminary determination regarding the level of environmental review for the project required under the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA). The environmental review shall be prepared as required by CEQA, including compliance with CEQA's timelines for completion. The subdivider shall be responsible for reimbursing the city for costs associated with CEQA compliance. 
B.  Planning commission review. After the city council or planning commission certifies an EIR or negative declaration for a tentative map, or the community development director makes a preliminary determination that a temporary map is exempt from environmental review under CEQA, the community development director shall schedule said map for review by the planning commission. Within fifty days from the date of the certification of the EIR or negative declaration or preliminary finding of exemption, unless such time is extended by mutual consent of the subdivider and the planning commission, the planning commission shall approve, conditionally approve, or deny the tentative map subject to the considerations listed in Section 19.02.070 of this title and shall report its decision in writing to the subdivider, including any conditions of approval or reasons for denial, if applicable. The planning commission shall deny the tentative map if it is unable to make all of the findings listed in Section 19.02.080 of this title. 
(Ord. 2010-07, § 1(exh. A), 2010.) 
19.02.070 - Conditions for approval or disapproval by planning commission. 
    The reviews of tentative maps by the planning commission shall be subject to the following considerations: 
A.  Environmental review. In considering the approval or conditional approval of a tentative map, the planning commission shall first find that the proposed subdivision, together with the provisions for its design and improvements is consistent with the applicable general and/or specific plans of the city, and shall then examine the environmental documentation and certify its adequacy and conformity with the provisions of CEQA. 
B.  Conditions imposed. In approving tentative maps, the planning commission may impose such reasonable conditions as it deems necessary and in the interest of public health, safety, environment, or community welfare in accord with the purpose and intent of this chapter. These conditions may include, but are not limited to a requirement that the subdivider shall join an existing assessment district, if there is one adjacent to the parcel, or form a new one, as directed by the planning commission. 
C.  Disapproval. In the event of disapproval, the subdivider shall be furnished with a statement of the reason and authority for such disapproval. In the event of conditional approval, the subdivider shall be furnished with a statement of conditions and changes necessary for incorporation in the final map. 
D.  Approval by inaction. If no action is taken upon a tentative map by the planning commission within the time limits specified in this chapter and the Subdivision Map Act to approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove the tentative map, the tentative map shall be deemed to be approved insofar as it complies with other applicable requirements of this title, and it shall be the duty of the city clerk to certify or state his or her approval. Once a tentative map is deemed approved under this provision, the subdivider shall be entitled to receive a written certification of approval. 
(Ord. 2010-07, § 1(exh. A), 2010.) 
19.02.080 - Findings. 
    The planning commission shall approve the tentative map if all of the following findings can be made. If a finding cannot be made, the planning commission may condition approval upon mitigation that will allow the finding to be made: 
A.  Consistency with plans. The proposed subdivision, together with the provisions for its design and improvements, is consistent with applicable general or specific plans of the city. 
B.  Consistency with zoning. The proposed subdivision is consistent with the provisions of the Chino Zoning Ordinance and other related ordinances, or a variance has been granted. 
C.  Suitability. The site is physically suitable for the type or density of development. 
D.  Environmental damage. The design of the subdivision or the proposed improvements will not cause substantial environmental damage or substantially and avoidably injure fish or wildlife or their habitat. 
E.  Wastewater. The discharge of waste from the proposed subdivision into a community sewer system will not result in violation of existing requirements prescribed by a California Regional Water Quality Control Board pursuant to Division 7 (commencing with Section 13000 of the Water Code). 
F.  Water service. The review of the city engineer or water service agency indicates that there is sufficient water to provide for the residents of the subdivision. 
G.  Soils and geology. There are no adverse soil or geological conditions, according to a preliminary soils report or geological hazard report, or the subdivider has demonstrated to the satisfaction of the director of community development, city engineer and planning commission that any adverse conditions can be corrected. 
H.  Public health. The design of the subdivision or the type of improvement will not cause serious public health problems. 
I.  Easements. The design of the subdivision or the type of improvements will not conflict with easements, acquired by the public at large, for access through or use of property within the proposed subdivision. However, the planning commission may approve an application if it finds that alternate easements for access or for use will be provided and that these will be substantially equivalent to ones previously acquired by the public. This subsection shall apply only to easements of record or to easements established by judgment of a court of competent jurisdiction. 
J.  Environmental documentation. The environmental documentation is adequate and conforms with the provisions of the California Environmental Quality Act. 
K.  Agricultural suitability. The proposed subdivision will not result in the subdivision of agricultural parcels to a size too small to sustain agricultural use under the conditions for denial listed in Section 66474.4 of the Subdivision Map Act. 
(Ord. 2010-07, § 1(exh. A), 2010.) 
19.02.090 - Appeals process. 
    The appeals process for the decision of the planning commission shall be as described in Section 19.01.110 of this title. 
(Ord. 2010-07, § 1(exh. A), 2010.) 
19.02.100 - Filing process. 
A.  Twenty-four months. An approved or conditionally approved tentative map shall expire twenty-four months from the date of its approval or conditional approval if a final map or parcel map is not approved prior to that time. 
B.  Expenditure on public improvements. If a subdivider is required to spend more than the amount specified in Section 66452.6(a)(1) of the Subdivision Map Act to construct, improve, or finance the construction or improvement of public improvements outside the property boundaries of the approved or conditionally approved tentative map, excluding improvements of public rights-of-way that abut the boundary of the property to be subdivided and that are reasonably related to the development of that property, each filing of a final map shall extend the expiration of the tentative map by thirty-six months, subject to the provisions of Section 66452.6 of the Subdivision Map Act. 
C.  Termination. The expiration of the approved or conditionally approved tentative map shall terminate all proceedings, and no final map or parcel map shall be filed for any portion of the real property included within such tentative map without first processing a new tentative map. 
D.  No extension due to modification. Modification of a tentative map after approval or conditional approval shall not extend beyond the time limits imposed. 
(Ord. 2010-07, § 1(exh. A), 2010.) 
19.02.110 - Extension of maps. 
A.  Request by subdivider. The subdivider, or his representative, may request an extension of the expiration date of the approved, or conditionally approved, tentative subdivision map by written application to the director of community development. The application shall be filed not less than thirty days before the map is to expire and shall state the reasons for requesting the extension. 
B.  Planning commission action. The community development director shall review the request and submit the application for the extension, together with his report, to the planning commission for approval, conditional approval or denial. The action adopted by the planning commission approving, or conditionally approving, an extension shall specify the new expiration date of the tentative subdivision map. 
C.  Time limit of extension. The approved extension shall not exceed an additional thirty-six months. The approved new expiration date shall not extend more than five years beyond the date of the action adopted by the planning commission in approving, or conditionally approving, the tentative subdivision map. 
D.  Conditions of approval. As a condition of the extension of a tentative subdivision map, the planning commission may impose new conditions, or revise existing conditions, on the approved tentative map as recommended by the community development director in his report, or as it may find necessary. The planning commission shall follow the public hearing notice requirements set forth in Title 20 (Zoning) of this Code. 
E.  Appeal of conditions on extension. The subdivider may appeal any action of the planning commission on the extension to the city council within ten days of such action, in conformance with Section 19.01.110 of this chapter. 
F.  Fees. The fee for processing an extension shall be as established by resolution of the city council. 
(Ord. 2010-07, § 1(exh. A), 2010.) 
19.02.120 - Amendments to approved tentative maps. 
    Minor changes in the tentative map may be approved by the director of community development upon application by the subdivider, provided that:

(Ord. 2010-07, § 1(exh. A), 2010.) 
Chapter 19.03 - VESTING TENTATIVE MAP 
  
Sections: 

19.03.010 - Purpose. 
A.  Investigation of subdivision. The purpose of the vesting tentative map is to provide thorough investigation of a proposed subdivision by the director of community development, other agencies both within the city and outside the city, the planning commission and the city council. Approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map enables a subdivider creating four or fewer parcels to apply for a parcel map and a subdivider creating five or more parcels to apply for a final map. 
B.  Development entitlement. Vesting tentative maps differ from tentative maps in that their approval confers upon the subdivider a vested right to proceed with development as approved. Development is subject to the requirements of the vesting tentative map, prior to receiving a parcel or final map from the city council. Whenever a provision of the Subdivision Map Act, as implemented and supplemented by this title, requires the filing of a tentative map for a residential development, a vesting tentative map may instead be filed, in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
C.  Rights under the Subdivision Map Act. If a subdivider does not seek the rights conferred by Chapter 4.5 of the Subdivision Map Act (commencing with Section 66498.1 of the Subdivision Map Act), the filing of a vesting tentative map shall not be a prerequisite to any approval for any proposed subdivision, permit for construction, or work preparatory to construction. 
D.  Exclusion. Condominium projects are excluded from this section. 
(Ord. 2010-07, § 1(exh. A), 2010.) 
19.03.020 - Application requirements. 
A.  Consistency. No land shall be subdivided, nor developed pursuant to a vesting tentative map for any purpose that is inconsistent with the general plan or applicable specific plan or that is not permitted by the zoning ordinance or other applicable provisions of any ordinances or of this Code. 
B.  Same form and contents as tentative map application. A vesting tentative map shall be filed in the same form and have the same contents, accompanying data, and reports and shall be processed in the same manner as set forth in this title for a tentative map application listed in Section 19.02.030 of this title, except as provided in this chapter. 
C.  Differentiation from tentative map. At the time a vesting tentative map is filed, it shall have printed conspicuously on its face the words "Vesting Tentative Map". 
D.  Building plans. At the time a vesting tentative map is filed, a subdivider shall also supply information related to buildings and interior streets, including utility systems if applicable shown on such vesting tentative map as required by the director of community development and the city engineer. 
E.  Consistency with zoning. The subdivider shall clearly indicate on maps submitted any inconsistencies with zoning that may exist. 
F.  Fee. At the time of filing of the vesting tentative map, the subdivider shall pay the vesting tentative map fee as set forth in the current city fee schedule. 
(Ord. 2010-07, § 1(exh. A), 2010.) 
19.03.030 - Application review process. 
    The review process for vesting tentative maps is the same as the review process for a tentative map as described beginning with Section 19.02.040 of this title, except for the differences in planning commission approval or disapproval described in Section 19.03.060 of this title. Detailed information on each step is provided in the subsequent sections of this chapter. 
(Ord. 2010-07, § 1(exh. A), 2010.) 
19.03.040 - Acceptance or rejection of filing. 
    The director of community development shall determine whether the vesting tentative map has been accepted for filing through the process described in Section 19.02.040 of this title. 
(Ord. 2010-07, § 1(exh. A), 2010.) 
19.03.050 - Review by director of community development. 
    The director of community development review shall follow the same process described in Section 19.02.050 of this title. 
(Ord. 2010-07, § 1(exh. A), 2010.) 
19.03.060 - Approval or disapproval by planning commission. 
    The planning commission shall approve, conditionally approve, or disapprove the map through the process described in Section 19.02.110 of this title, except for the following: 
A.  Vesting. The approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall confer a vested right to proceed with development in substantial compliance with the ordinances, policies, and standards described in Section 66474.2 of the Subdivision Map Act. If Section 66474.2 of the Subdivision Map Act is repealed, the approval or conditional approval of a vesting tentative map shall confer a vested right to proceed with development in substantial compliance with the ordinances, policies and standards in effect at the time the vesting tentative map is approved or conditionally approved. 
B.  Conditions or denial. Notwithstanding Subsection A. of this section, approval of a vesting tentative map shall be made conditional or denied if any of the following are determined: 
1.  A failure to do so would place the residents of the subdivision or the immediate community, or both, in a condition dangerous to their health or safety, or both; 
2.  The condition or denial is required, in order to comply with the state or federal law; or 
3.  The vesting tentative map is inconsistent with zoning. The city council may approve it conditioned on the subdivider, or his or her designee, obtaining the necessary change in the zoning ordinance to eliminate the inconsistency. If the change in the zoning ordinance is obtained, the approved or conditionally approved vesting tentative map shall, notwithstanding Subsection A. of this section, confer the vested right to proceed with the development in substantial compliance with the change in the zoning ordinance and the map, as approved. 
C.  Expiration. The rights referred to in this section shall expire if a final map or parcel map is not approved prior to the end of the same time period, subject to the same extensions established by this title for the expiration of the approval or conditional approval of a tentative map as provided in Section 19.02.070 of this title. If the final map or parcel map is approved, these rights shall last for the following periods of time: 
1.  An initial time period of one year. Where several final maps are recorded on various phases of a project covered by a single vesting tentative map, this initial time period shall begin for each phase when the final map or parcel map for that phase is recorded. 
2.  The initial time period set forth in Subsection C.1. of this section shall be automatically extended by any time used for processing a complete application for a grading permit or for design or architectural review, if such processing exceeds thirty days, from the date a complete application is filed. 
3.  A subdivider may apply to the director of community development for a one-year extension at any time before the initial time period set forth in Subsection C.1. of this section expires.

The subdivider may appeal the city engineer's determination to the city council, as provided in Section 19.01.110 of this title. Subsequent building permits shall be conditioned upon the incorporation of the recommended corrective action in the construction of each building. 
B.  Geological hazard reports. 
1.  Prior to the submission of a tentative or vesting tentative map, the subdivider shall provide a geological hazard report if the subdivision includes land within a geologic hazard area, as identified in the general plan or if the city engineer determines that other geological conditions warrant the preparation of such a report. The report shall be prepared by a civil engineer who is registered by the State of California and shall be based upon appropriate field observations. 
2.  If the geological hazard report indicates the presence of a potential geological hazard to life, health or property, a qualified civil or geotechnical engineer who is registered by the State of California shall prepare a geological mitigation plan that identifies corrective action for the potential hazard. The geological mitigation plan shall be filed with the city engineer. 
3.  The city engineer shall approve the mitigation plan if he or she determines that the recommended corrective action is likely to mitigate the potential hazard. The subdivider may appeal the city engineer's determination to the city council, as provided in Section 19.01.110 of this title. Subsequent building permits shall be conditioned upon the incorporation of the recommended corrective action in the construction of each building.

Chapter 19.09 - IMPROVEMENT PLANS AND SECURITY 
  
Sections: 

19.09.010 - Improvement plans. 
    Following approval of a tentative or vesting tentative map, and prior to the submission of any final map or parcel map thereof, the subdivider/developer shall have prepared and submitted complete sets of improvement plans and cost estimates for any improvement(s) required. The approval of said plans by the city engineer shall be a prerequisite to the approval of the final map or parcel map by the city council, and in the case of a site development only, shall be prerequisite to issuance of any building permit. All public or private improvement plans, profiles, descriptions, studies, calculations, notes, surveys and drawings required under the provisions of this chapter shall be provided at no expense to the city and shall be prepared in accordance with this section and as required by the city engineer. Construction plans for street, alley, drainage, sewer and water improvements, traffic signals and street lights, and for any other required improvements, shall be drawn on standard city tracing cloth or Mylar film, in indelible ink, and shall be filed with the city engineer for his checking and review prior to approval. All maps, sketches, descriptions, estimates, plans and other drawings and items required to fulfill the requirements of this chapter shall also be provided in the form, content, number and details as specified by the city engineer. The plans and profiles of all required and proposed public and private improvements in a subdivision shall be furnished to the city engineer and shall be ready for his approval before a final map of the subdivision is presented to the city council for approval. No construction work shall commence on any of the improvements shown on any construction or improvement plans required herein until said plans have been reviewed, approved and signed by the city engineer. After approval and signature by the city engineer, all original drawings shall become the property of the city and may be released thereafter for reproduction or other purposes, only to bonded blueprinting or reproduction agencies, firms or individuals. 
A.  Application requirements. The improvement plans shall be prepared by or under the direction of a civil engineer licensed by the state and shall show the complete plans, profiles, and details for all streets and appurtenances, storm drainage, water systems and fire hydrants, sewers, utilities, grading and all other improvements proposed or necessary, on-site and off-site. They shall meet all the requirements deemed necessary by the city engineer. 
B.  Application review process. 
1.  Upon receipt of a complete set of improvement plans, the city engineer shall expeditiously review the plans and return one set to the subdivider/developer's engineer with the required revisions, if any, marked thereon. 
2.  When the plans are found to be complete and satisfactory to the city engineer, the subdivider/developer shall submit copies in the number and term deemed necessary by the city engineer. The prints shall at the time be accompanied by any additional number of complete sets of prints the subdivider/developer, his or her engineer and contractors may require, to be noted as approved by the city engineer. 
C.  Approval by city engineer. Upon finding that all required revisions have been made; that all required fees have been paid; and that the plans conform to all applicable city ordinances, design review requirements, and conditions of approval of the tentative map, the city engineer shall approve the improvement plans: 
1.  The city engineer shall act within sixty days of receiving the preliminary improvement plans and calculations, except that at least fifteen days shall be provided for processing any resubmitted improvement plan. The period of sixty days shall not include any days during which the improvement plan has been returned to the subdivider for corrections or has been subject to review by any party other than the city or a private entity contracted by the city. 
2.  The city engineer's approval of improvement plans shall not relieve the subdivider of responsibility for the design of the improvements and for any deficiencies in the improvements. 
D.  Permit required. The subdivider/developer shall not commence work on any portion of improvements prior to the issuance of an encroachment permit and payment of inspection fees, and the city public works department shall be notified in advance of commencement of any portion of the work. 
E.  Construction of improvements. 
1.  All construction methods and materials for improvements shall conform to the approved improvement plans, the requirements of the applicable construction permit, and any other applicable city requirements. 
2.  All construction of improvements is subject to inspection by the city engineer. The subdivider shall notify the city engineer before beginning the construction of any improvements. The city personnel shall have full access to the improvement work at all times during its construction. 
F.  Completion of improvements. 
1.  If a subdivider files a final subdivision map before all improvements are complete, the city council and the subdivider shall enter into a subdivision improvement agreement as a condition precedent to approval of the final map. The subdivision improvement agreement shall be prepared by the city engineer and in a form approved by the city attorney, and it shall include all of the following: 
a.  A list of the improvements that have not been completed; 
b.  A schedule for completing the improvements; and 
c.  A requirement that the improvements be completed at the subdivider's expense. 
2.  If the subdivider fails to complete the improvements within the period of time required by the subdivision improvement agreement, the city council may, by resolution, cause all required improvements to be completed, and the parties executing the security for improvements shall be firmly bound for all costs of completing the improvements. 
G.  Improvement agreement extensions. 
1.  The subdivision improvements shall be completed by the developer within twenty-four months or as otherwise provided in this ordinance, from the recording of the final map or parcel map, unless an extension is granted by the city council. 
2.  The completion date of subdivision improvements may be extended by the city council upon recommendation by the city engineer, upon written request by the developer and the submittal of adequate evidence to justify the extension. The request shall be made not less than sixty days prior to expiration of the subdivision improvement agreement. 
3.  If approved by the city council, the subdivider shall enter into a revised subdivision improvement agreement with the city. The agreement shall be prepared by the city engineer, approved as to form by the city attorney, executed by the subdivider and the city manager shall execute the agreement on behalf of the city. 
4.  In consideration of a revised subdivision improvement agreement, the following may be required: 
a.  Revision of improvement plans to provide for current design and construction standards when required by the city engineer; 
b.  Revision of improvement construction estimates to reflect current improvement costs as approved by the city engineer; 
c.  Change of improvement securities in accordance with revised construction estimates; and 
d.  Increase of inspection fees to reflect current construction costs. 
5.  The city council may impose additional requirements as recommended by the city engineer or as it may deem necessary as a condition to approving any time extension for the completion of improvements. 
6.  The costs incurred by the city in processing the revised subdivision improvement agreement shall be borne by the developer at actual cost. The city clerk shall notify the developer and surety of the city council's or city engineer's actions. 
H.  Inspection of improvements. 
1.  All construction of improvements under this chapter shall be subject to inspection and testing by the city engineer, or his authorized representatives, to insure compliance with the standards and specifications specified and required by this chapter. All work and improvements must be found to conform to said standards and specifications as a condition of the city's acceptance of them and the release of any improvement securities held therefor. No construction shall commence or continue without arrangements first having been made with the city engineer for inspection. The city engineer and his authorized representatives shall have the right to stop any work or refuse to inspect any work or reject any or all work and construction if it is found that the work is unauthorized, is unsafe in any way to the workers or the public, is inferior in materials or workmanship, was performed without inspection, or does not meet or comply with city standards, specifications, or city-approved construction plans. Reasonable access to the construction and work shall be provided at all times so that full knowledge of the progress, workmanship, and character of the materials used in the work can be gained. 
2.  Upon completion of the subdivision improvements, the subdivider shall apply in writing to the city engineer for preliminary final inspection. The city engineer shall conduct a preliminary final inspection and prepare a deficiency list, noting all additional work to be performed and deficiencies in existing work to be corrected. The city engineer shall provide a copy of the deficiency list to the subdivider. If there are an excessive number of deficiencies or missing improvements, the city engineer may choose to postpone the inspection. 
3.  After the subdivider has corrected all of the items on the deficiency list, the subdivider shall apply to the city engineer for final inspection. The city engineer shall conduct a final inspection and verify that the items on the deficiency list have been corrected. Upon so verifying, and after receiving as-built improvement plans, the city engineer shall accept the improvements and issue a notice of completion to the subdivider. 
4.  The city engineer's acceptance of improvements shall not relieve the subdivider of responsibility for correcting any deficiency that subsequently is discovered. 
I.  Security for improvements. 
1.  A security shall be furnished for all improvements shown in the improvement plan, in accordance with the requirements of Sections 66499 through 66499.10 of the Subdivision Map Act and as provided in this section. 
2.  The security shall be in a form approved by the city attorney and shall be provided as specified in Sections 66499 through 66499.2 of the Subdivision Map Act. The security shall be one of the following at the option of the city council and subject to the approval of the city attorney: 
a.  Bond or bonds by one or more duly authorized corporate sureties; 
b.  A cash deposit, either with the local agency or a responsible escrow agent or trust company, at the option of the local agency, or money or negotiable bonds of the kind approved for securing deposit of public monies; 
c.  An instrument of credit from one or more financial institutions subject to regulation by the state or federal government and pledging that the funds necessary to carry out the act or agreement are on deposit and guaranteed for payment. 
3.  As provided in Section 66499.5 of the Subdivision Map Act, if the required subdivision improvements are financed and installed pursuant to special assessment proceedings, the local agency at its option may provide by local ordinance that, upon the furnishing by the contractor of the faithful performance and labor and materials bonds required by the special assessment act being used, the improvement security of the subdivider may be reduced by an amount corresponding to the amount of such bonds so furnished by the contractor. 
4.  The amount of the security shall be: 
a.  One hundred percent of the total estimated cost of the improvements as a performance security to guarantee the construction or installation of all improvements; 
b.  Fifty percent of the total estimated cost of the improvements as a material and labor security to guarantee payment to the subdivider's contractors, and to persons furnishing labor, materials, or equipment for the construction or installation of improvements; and 
c.  Ten percent of the total estimated cost of the improvements as a warranty security to guarantee the improvements against any defective work or labor done, or defective materials used, in the performance of the improvements, for the warranty period of one year following completion and acceptance of the improvements. 
5.  The estimate of improvement costs shall be prepared under the direction of and signed by a registered civil engineer licensed by the State of California, and shall be approved by the city engineer. The estimate shall provide for the following: 
a.  Total construction costs, with labor costs calculated using the prevailing wage in the city; 
b.  Ten percent of the total construction cost for contingencies; 
c.  Increases for projected inflation based on total cost, computed to the estimated end of construction; 
d.  All utility installation costs, or a certification acceptable to the city engineer, from the utility company that adequate security has been deposited to ensure installation; and 
e.  Costs and reasonable expenses and fees, including attorney's fees, incurred in enforcing the obligation secured. 
6.  The security shall be released in accordance with the requirements of Sections 66499.7 of the Government Code and as described below: 
a.  At such time that the subdivider believes that the obligation to perform the work for which security was required is complete, the subdivider may notify the city engineer in writing of the completed work, including a list of work completed. Upon receipt of the written notice, the city engineer shall have forty-five days to review and comment or approve the completion of the required work. If the city engineer does not agree that all work has been completed in accordance with the plans and specifications for the improvements, he or she shall supply a list of all remaining work to be completed. 
b.  Within forty-five days of receipt of the list of remaining work from the city engineer, the subdivider may then provide cost estimates for all remaining work for review and approval by the city engineer. Upon receipt of the cost estimates, the city engineer shall then have forty-five days to review, comment, and approve, modify, or disapprove those cost estimates. The city engineer is not required to process a partial release more than once between the start of work and completion and acceptance of all work. 
c.  If the city engineer approves the cost estimate for the remaining work and finds that the cost of the remaining work does not exceed twenty percent of the total original performance security, the public entity shall release all performance security except for security in an amount up to two hundred percent of the cost estimate of the remaining work and any retention to secure guarantee and warranty of the work as set forth in Subsection 6.i of this section, below. 
d.  Substitute bonds or other security may be used as a replacement for the performance security, subject to the approval of the city engineer. If substitute bonds or other security is used as a replacement for the performance security released, the release shall not be effective unless and until the city engineer receives and approves that form of replacement security. 
e.  A reduction in the performance security, authorized under this section, is not, and shall not be deemed to be, an acceptance by the city council of the completed improvements. 
f.  The subdivider shall complete the works of improvement until all remaining items are accepted by the city council. 
g.  Upon the completion of the improvements, the city engineer shall issue a written statement of completion within forty-five days. 
h.  Any remaining performance security shall be released within sixty days of the issuance of the written statement of completion. 
i.  Security given to secure payment to the contractor, his subcontractors and to the persons furnishing labor, materials or equipment may, six months after the completion and acceptance of the improvements by the city council, be reduced to an amount equal to the amount of all claims therefor filed and of which notice has been given to the city council. The balance of the security shall be released upon the settlement of all such claims and obligations for which the security was given. 
j.  The warranty security shall be released to the subdivider one year after completion of the work, or a final inspection indicating that the work is acceptable to the city engineer, or city council resolution accepting the improvements, whichever is later. 
J.  Reimbursement for improvements in excess of those required for subdivision. 
1.  As a condition of approval of any tentative map, the planning commission or city council may require the improvements installed by the subdivider for the benefit of the subdivision contain supplemental size, capacity, number, or length for the benefit of property not within the subdivision, and that those improvements be dedicated to the public. This reimbursement shall be subject to the regulations of the Subdivision Map Act Sections 66485 et. seq., and the following process: 
a.  In the event of the installation of supplemental improvements required by this section, the city shall enter into an agreement with the subdivider to reimburse the subdivider for that portion of the cost of such improvements equal to the difference between the amount it would have cost the subdivider to install such improvements to serve the subdivision only and the actual cost of such improvements. In no case shall a reimbursement agreement exceed ten years. 
b.  In order to pay costs as required by the reimbursement agreement, the city may: 
i.  Collect a reasonable charge from other persons, including public agencies, using the supplemental improvements. 
ii.  Contribute to the subdivider that part of the cost of the improvements that is attributable to the benefit of real property outside the subdivision, and levy a charge upon the real property benefited to reimburse itself for that cost, together with any interest paid to the subdivider. 
iii.  Establish and maintain local benefit districts for the levy and collection of charges or costs from the property benefited. 
c.  Reimbursements to the subdivider may be provided pursuant to Section 3.40.100 of the Municipal Code. 
2.  The city shall in no event be liable for reimbursement to the original subdivider unless and until such reimbursement is collected from the other subdivider(s). In no event shall the city be liable for failure to make such collection. 
K.  Acceptance of improvements. 
1.  When all improvement deficiencies have been corrected and "record drawings" of the improvement plans have been filed, the subdivision improvements shall be considered by the city for acceptance. Improvements may be accepted by the city council upon recommendation of the city engineer. Acceptance of the improvements shall imply only that the improvements have been completed satisfactorily and that public improvements have been accepted for public use. 
2.  When requested by the subdivider in writing, the city council may consider acceptance of a portion of the improvements as recommended by the city engineer. The improvements will be accepted by the city only if it finds that it is in the public interest and such improvements are for the use of the general public. Acceptance of a portion of the improvements shall not relieve the subdivider of any other requirements imposed by this chapter.

19.09.020 - Monuments. 
A.  Placement. At the time of making the survey for the final map or parcel map, the subdivider's engineer or surveyor shall set sufficient durable monuments to conform with the standards described in Section 8771 of the California Business and Professions Code so that another engineer or surveyor may readily retrace the survey, unless the survey is not required pursuant to Section 66448 of the Subdivision Map Act. 
B.  Reference. All monuments necessary to establish the exterior boundaries of the subdivision shall be set or referenced prior to recordation of the final map or parcel map. 
(Ord. 2010-07, § 1(exh. A), 2010.) 
19.09.030 - Grading, erosion and dust control. 
A.  Requirement. A dust control plan shall be required by the project proponent prior to issuance of a stockpile, grading or demolition permit; or approval of any other instrument entailing any site clearing/grubbing disturbance to the soil, grading, dirt import/export or excavation work in excess of fifty cubic yards; or, as deemed appropriate by the city engineer. The dust control plan shall impose mitigation measures that are consistent with the city's general plan air quality element and which substantially reduce dust/particulate emissions resulting from the aforementioned activities. 
B.  The following control measures shall be utilized to control particulate emissions as deemed necessary by the city engineer. The effectiveness and feasibility of the control measures shall be the primary factor in the selection of the specific dust control plan: 
1.  Water all active project sites with multiple daily applications to ensure proper particulate emission control; 
2.  Require all equipment/trucks hauling import/export dirt, sand soil or other loose substances and building materials on public streets to be covered; 
3.  Utilize standard erosion control activities as specified in the latest edition of the "Standard Specifications for Public Works Construction", (Green Book), published by BNI, Inc.; 
4.  Schedule grading activities to minimize the amount of exposed, excavated soil during phased work periods; 
5.  Require vegetative, chemical, or other stabilization of exposed surface areas and installation of curb and gutter facilities as required following phased grading and construction activities; 
6.  Suspend grading activities during first stage smog alerts and as may be required by the city engineer during second stage smog alerts; 
7.  Suspend grading activities which generate particulate emissions during high winds (i.e., greater than twenty-five miles per hour) or as required by the city engineer. 
8.  Clean up roadway debris caused by construction activity immediately after a storm or similar event; 
9.  Develop on-site stormwater runoff control facilities/measures; and 
10.  Prohibit employee parking on untreated construction areas within the project site and curtail vehicular speed to limit dust creation. 
C.  Dust control plan implementation. The grading/construction plan general notes shall include a dust control section that lists a schedule of activities which have the potential to create particulate emissions, their corresponding mitigation/control measures and the person/contractor responsible for carrying out the dust control measure and the equipment/product necessary to complete the designated dust control activity. The city engineer or his/her representative shall review and approve the dust control plan/general grading notes prior to issuance of a grading permit or as specified above. 
D.  Enforcement. Failure to comply with any part of the dust control plan approved by the city engineer shall result in fines and penalties subject to the enforcement provision contained within Title 20 (Zoning) of this Code. 
(Ord. 2010-07, § 1(exh. A), 2010.) 
19.09.040 - Assessment districts. 
    When applicable, the subdivider shall either join an existing assessment district, if there is one adjacent to the parcel, or form a new one, as directed by the city engineer if none exists. 
(Ord. 2010-07, § 1(exh. A), 2010.)

(Ord. 2010-05, § 1(exh. A), 2010.) 
20.01.060. - Marijuana Regulations. 
A.  Legislative findings and statement of purpose. 
1.  The city council finds that the prohibitions on marijuana cultivation, marijuana processing, marijuana delivery, and marijuana dispensaries are necessary for the preservation and protection of the public health, safety, and welfare for the city and its community. The cultivation, dispensing, delivery, manufacture, and other use of marijuana negatively impacts, or has the potential to negatively impact, the health, safety, and welfare of the community and public within the city. These negative impacts include, but are not limited to, damage to buildings in which cultivation, manufacturing, and dispensing occurs, including improper and dangerous electrical alterations and use, inadequate ventilation, increased occurrences of robberies and similar crimes, and nuisance impacts to neighboring properties from the strong and potentially noxious odors from the plants and increased crime. The city council's prohibition of such activities is within the authority conferred upon the city council by state law. 
2.  The city council finds that the public health, safety, and general welfare of the city and its residents necessitates and requires the adoption of this zoning ordinance, prohibiting the establishment, maintenance and operation of marijuana cultivation, marijuana deliveries, marijuana dispensaries, cooperatives, and collectives, and other uses involving distribution of marijuana and marijuana related products, in order to: (a) protect and safeguard against the detrimental secondary negative effects and adverse impacts of facilities dispensing marijuana; (b) preserve and safeguard the minors, children, and students in the community from the deleterious impacts of marijuana related facilities; and (c) preserve the city's law enforcement services, in that monitoring and addressing the negative secondary effects and adverse impacts will likely burden the city's law enforcement resources. The city council further finds that due to negative secondary effects and adverse impacts of facilities and other locations cultivating, delivering and/or dispensing marijuana, the establishment and operation of these facilities and land uses will negatively impact the city. 
3.  On October 9, 2015, the governor signed the "Medical Marijuana Regulation and Safety Act" ("Act") into law. The Act becomes effective January 1, 2016 and contains new statutory provisions that: 
a.  Allow local governments to enact ordinances expressing their intent to prohibit the cultivation of marijuana and their intent not to administer a conditional permit program pursuant to Health & Safety Code section 11362.777 for the cultivation of marijuana (Health & Safety Code §11362.777(c)(4)); 
b.  Expressly provide that the Act does not supersede or limit local authority for local law enforcement activity, enforcement of local ordinances, or enforcement of local permit or licensing requirements regarding marijuana (Business & Professions Code §19315(a)); 
c.  Expressly provide that the Act does not limit the authority or remedies of a local government under any provision of law regarding marijuana, including but not limited to a local government's right to make and enforce within its limits all police regulations not in conflict with general laws (Business & Professions Code §19316(c)); and 
d.  Require a local government that wishes to prevent marijuana delivery activity, as defined in Business & Professions Code section 19300.5(m) of the Act, from operating within the local government's boundaries to enact an ordinance affirmatively banning such delivery activity (Business & Professions Code §19340(a)). 
4.  The city council finds that this section: (1) expresses its intent to prohibit the cultivation of marijuana in the city and to not administer a conditional permit program or any other permitting program pursuant to Health & Safety Code section 11362.777 for the cultivation of marijuana in the city; (2) exercises its local authority to enact and enforce local regulations and ordinances, including those regarding the permitting, licensing, or other entitlement of the activities prohibited by this chapter; (3) exercises its police power to enact and enforce regulations for the public benefit, safety, and welfare of the city and its community; and (4) expressly prohibits the delivery of marijuana in the city. 
B.  Applicability. 
1.  This chapter is intended prohibit all cultivation, and commercial manufacturing, dispensing, and delivery of marijuana and marijuana-related products within the city to the greatest extent permissible by law and within the confines of state law. 
2.  Nothing in this chapter is intended, nor shall it be construed, to exempt any activity related to marijuana from any applicable electrical, plumbing, land use or other building or land use standards or permitting requirements. 
3.  All cultivation, manufacturing, dispensing, delivery, and sale of marijuana within the city shall be subject to the provisions of this chapter. 
C.  Prohibited activities. 
1.  Marijuana processing, marijuana delivery, and marijuana dispensaries shall be prohibited activities in all zones and specific plan areas in the city, except where the city is preempted by federal or state law from enacting a prohibition on any such activity. 
2.  Cultivation of marijuana for any commercial or non-commercial purpose, including cultivation by a qualified patient or a primary caregiver, is expressly prohibited in all areas, zones and specific plan areas in the city. No person or entity, including a qualified patient or primary caregiver, shall cultivate any marijuana in the city, even for medical purposes. 
3.  No use permit, variance, building permit, or any other entitlement, license, or permit, whether administrative or discretionary, shall be approved or issued for the activities of marijuana cultivation, marijuana processing, marijuana delivery, or the establishment or operation of a marijuana dispensary in the city. 
4.  No person or entity shall conduct, cause, allow, permit or maintain a marijuana dispensary, marijuana cultivation, marijuana processing or marijuana delivery within the city, except where the city is preempted by federal or state law from enacting a prohibition on any such activity for which the use permit, variance, building permit, or any other entitlement, license, or permit is sought. 
5.  Nothing in this chapter shall be deemed to permit or authorize any use or activity which is otherwise prohibited by any state or federal law. 
D.  Public nuisance. 
    Any violation of this section is hereby declared a public nuisance that may be abated by the city by any means available at law, including but not limited to, through injunctive relief. 
E.  Violations. 
    Any person owning, possessing or in control of any property within the city shall have the duty to prevent and abate nuisances on such property. Any violation of this section shall constitute a misdemeanor punishable as provided in chapter 1.12.

This designation also provides a buffer between Chino and other communities and between urban areas and permanent intensive agricultural areas. The RD 1 district allows up to one dwelling unit per adjusted gross acre and up to 1.25 dwelling units per adjusted gross acre with the provision for affordable housing. 
B.  Residential/agricultural (RD 2). The purpose of this district is to provide large lot residential development in a nonurbanized environment. This designation is typified by large lot development that includes horse-keeping and other semi-rural uses. The RD 2 designation allows one to two dwelling units per adjusted gross acre and up to 2.5 dwelling units per adjusted gross acre with the provision for affordable housing. 
C.  Residential (RD 4.5). The purpose of this district is to encourage a predominately single-family suburban residential development similar to that found in many of the city's existing residential tracts. The RD 4.5 designation allows three to 4.5 dwelling units per adjusted gross and up to six dwelling units per adjusted gross acre with the provision of affordable housing. 
D.  Residential (RD 8). The purpose of this district is intended as a transition zone from low density single-family areas to higher intensity commercial, industrial and multiple-family residential areas. Attached and detached dwellings are permitted in this district. The RD 8 district allows 4.5 to eight dwelling units per adjusted gross acre and up to ten dwelling units per adjusted gross acre with the provision of affordable housing.

C.  Second stories for single-family homes. 
1.  New residential subdivisions. The following regulations apply to new residential subdivisions: 
a.  Where a proposed infill project consists of five or more homes, a minimum of twenty percent of the total number of homes shall be single-story. Homes with any amount of second floor area will not be considered a single-story home. The percentage requirement shall be interpreted to mean twenty percent of the total number of homes proposed or any fraction thereof. 
Example: For 4 or less homes: No requirement For 5 homes: 1 single-story home required For 6 to 10 homes: 2 single-story homes required For 11 to 15 homes: 3 single-story homes required  
b.  All corner and reverse corner lots shall have single-story homes or two-story homes with single-story features on each street facing elevation. At a minimum, single-story features shall consist of a single-story portion of the home where the roof has a plate no higher than ten feet above finish grade. In addition, the single-story feature shall have a minimum depth of five feet for a minimum of sixty percent of the length of each street facing elevation. 
c.  New homes and additions to existing homes shall be single-story on lots that directly abut lots with existing single-story homes. The director of community development or the planning commission, as applicable, may approve exceptions to this requirement on a case-by-case basis when any of the conditions listed below exist: 
 The difference in the finish grade elevation between the lots is substantial enough to reduce views of the second-story portion of the proposed home; 
 The distance between the adjacent homes will reduce views into the homes or yard areas; 
 The orientation of the homes is such that the exterior walls do not directly face each other; 
 The shape or configuration of the lots is such that a substantial portion of the lot lines do not directly abut each other; 
 Existing accessory structures in the rear yard areas provide a barrier to mitigate privacy impacts between the primary residential units; or 
 Any other unique site circumstances that may effectively reduce privacy impacts to the existing adjacent single-story home. 
2.  The director of community development or the planning commission, as applicable, shall consider public input in addition to information provided by the applicant to evaluate privacy impacts to adjacent property owners. This information shall include, but not be limited to, line-of-sight studies, site photographs, dimensioned site and building cross sections, three-dimensional or photo simulation models, or any other information deemed necessary by the director of community development or the planning commission, as applicable, to consider the request. In reviewing the request, the director of community development or the planning commission, as applicable, shall consider and establish the following findings: 
a.  The granting of the exception is consistent with the intent of the zoning ordinance to eliminate or minimize privacy impacts between existing residential homes and proposed homes on adjacent lots; 
b.  That the adjacent property owners have been duly noticed, and that public input has been considered to ensure that the privacy of adjacent property owners is not adversely impacted; 
c.  That there are specific circumstances applicable to the subject property and adjacent property that effectively eliminate or minimize privacy impacts between the homes; 
d.  That the proposed home incorporates design features that serve to eliminate or minimize privacy impacts between the homes. 
3.  Two-story homes that back up to a public street shall require thirty-six-inch box street trees to be located in the right-of-way along rear of the homes at a spacing of thirty feet apart to soften building mass and buffer the homes from the street. 
4.  A fifteen-foot minimum clearance shall be provided between the second floors of homes that have a full two-story height building mass at interior side elevations. 
5.  The rear building elevations of two-story homes shall have a combination of vertical and horizontal articulation such that an unbroken horizontal wall surface does not exceed a length of thirty feet and so that at least one feature is utilized that provides a break in the massing between the first and second story. A minimum one-foot variation in offset between wall planes shall be provided to satisfy this requirement. Examples that may satisfy this requirement include stepping back the second floor, providing pop-outs, insets, one-story roof elements, and changes in second story roof planes. 
D.  Existing single-family homes. The intent of this provision is to encourage second-story additions that are designed to be compatible with the character of the neighborhoods where they are located while being sensitive to the privacy of adjoining neighbors. Review of two-story additions shall consider the design, placement, and location of a second-story addition so it minimizes privacy impacts to the extent feasible for the individual circumstances. The following regulations apply to second-story additions to existing single-family homes: 
1.  Two-story additions shall be designed with a building mass and scale that is similar to homes in the surrounding neighborhood. 
2.  Two-story additions shall be consistent with the architectural character of the neighborhood. 
3.  The design of two-story additions shall minimize privacy impacts on adjacent single-story homes. In particular, windows should be positioned to minimize direct views into the rear yard of adjacent single-story homes, and in no case be positioned to provide direct views into windows of an adjacent home. The intent of this provision is not to eliminate windows on second-story additions, but rather to ensure that the design and placement of windows enhance the architectural quality of the home without creating privacy impacts on adjacent homes. 
4.  A minimum fifteen-foot clearance shall be provided between a proposed second story addition and the second-story portion of an existing two-story home located on an adjacent lot. 
5.  Second-story frontages shall not exceed sixty percent of the width of the first floor street frontage. 
6.  Second floors shall be set back a minimum of ten feet from the first floor building line.

Due to the high number of small contiguous lots, sporadic existing development, the opportunity to develop the properties behind those fronting onto Central Avenue, the desire to develop the area in an aesthetic and functional manner, and the need to minimize and control traffic flow onto Central Avenue, the city council has found and declared that the property within the Central Avenue specific plan presents unique problems for its development. 
1.  The Central Avenue specific plan is intended to: 
a.  Promote a positive image for the Central Avenue corridor by attracting quality development and by structuring land use, circulation and urban design in a manner that creates a coherent whole; and 
b.  Provide specific urban design guidelines to ensure that, as the plan is implemented, each project will contribute positively to the overall character and ambience of Central Avenue. 
B.  Applicability. 
1.  The Central Avenue specific plan is intended to supplement the provisions of this title. In the event of conflicts between the provisions of the specific plan document and the zoning ordinance of the city, the provisions of the Central Avenue specific plan shall apply, unless otherwise specified by this section. 
2.  In addition to the requirements of the Central Avenue specific plan, the planning commission may impose specific requirements which are reasonably necessary to overcome the problems recognized in Subsection A.1. of this section. Upon request of a project applicant, the planning commission shall prepare findings supporting the relationship (nexus) between the standards set forth by this title and the requirements imposed upon a proposed development. 
C.  Permitted uses. Uses permitted or conditionally permitted on property within the Central Avenue specific plan area shall be in accordance with the zoning district within which such property is located, as shown on the official zoning map and zoning maps distributed for general information to the public, except that, within Central Avenue specific plan district 5A and the downtown/civic center master plan area, those uses listed within the specific plan shall apply. 
D.  Development requirements. The development or alteration of any property, or the erection, installation, alteration or enlargement of any building or structure thereon, shall be subject to the standards and guidelines of the Central Avenue specific plan, and the following development requirements: 
1.  Property shall only be developed in such a manner as to overcome the problems of development recognized in Subsection A.1. of this section. 
2.  The owner(s) of any property upon which a development project is proposed, or the erection, installation, alteration or enlargement of any building or structure thereon, shall convey any and all easements necessary for ingress and egress onto and from contiguous or nearby properties in order to overcome the problems of development recognized in Subsection A.1. of this section. 
3.  Existing residential development which is converted to commercial use shall have a minimum width of ninety-six feet, measured along the front lot line, except as permitted within district 4A, district 5A, and the downtown/civic center master plan area (phases 1 and 2) of the Central Avenue specific plan. Furthermore, the exterior of the structure to be converted may be required to be upgraded to conform to all codes and ordinances in effect at the time of conversion.

20.09.080 - Industrial planned development overlay district. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of the industrial planned development overlay district is to achieve superior development, as compared to that which can be achieved through the strict application of the standards of a specific zoning district, by permitting greater flexibility in the design of industrial development, and promote a more efficient, aesthetically pleasing, and desirable use of land. 
B.  Permitted uses. Uses permitted or conditionally permitted within the industrial planned development overlay district shall be in accordance with the base zoning district. However, in establishing an industrial planned development overlay district or approving a project within an industrial planned development overlay district, the planning commission and/or city council may limit, or for mixed use developments, add certain land uses, finding that such revisions are necessary to enhance the quality and character of the development and to ensure the compatibility between uses located within a planned development project and with existing or potential uses within the general area of the site. For the purpose of this section, a mixed use development shall be considered a development that consists of a variety of complementary uses including, but not limited to: Residential, office, commercial retail and entertainment, that is planned and designed as a unified, comprehensive project area and that is visually integrated through architectural design, and functionally integrated through the use of shared vehicular and pedestrian access and parking areas. 
C.  Special conditional use permit required. An application for a special conditional use permit shall be filed in accordance with the provisions of Section 20.23.080 of this Code for any modifications to an existing industrial planned development overlay district. An application for a zone change shall be filed in accordance with the provisions of Section 20.23.060 of this Code for the establishment of an industrial planned development overlay district, and shall set forth a master plan of development for property located within the industrial planned development overlay district.

The recreational vehicle storage requirements stipulated by this section shall not be applicable to any recreational vehicle dwelling unit as defined by Subsection 20.24.020R. of this Code, that is owned and operated by a disabled person provided the disabled person can present evidence of issuance of a special license plate for the disabled persons issued under Section 5007 of the California Vehicle Code or a distinguishing placard or temporary distinguishing placard as defined by Sections 22511.55 or 22511.59 of the California Vehicle Code for at least one fully operable vehicle owned and operated by the disabled person and registered to the same address or location. 
2.  A person using a distinguishing placard issued under Sections 22511.55 or 22511.59 of the California Vehicle Code, or a special license plate issued under Section 5007 of the California Vehicle Code of the purposes of this exemption, shall, upon request of a peace officer or person authorized to enforce parking laws, ordinances, or regulations, present identification and evidence of the issuance of that placard or plate to that person. Failure to present the requested identification and evidence of the issuance of that placard or plate shall be a rebuttable presumption that the placard or plate is being misused. In addition to any other applicable penalty for the misuse of a distinguishing placard or special license plate, the exemption from the RV storage requirements shall be voided. 
3.  Certain specialized trailers used for the transportation of a wheelchair, electric cart, or similar transportation device used by a disabled person, may also qualify for this exemption as determined by the director of community development.

(b)  Any required parking for an accessory dwelling unit may be provided as tandem parking on an existing driveway or in setback areas, unless the director of community development, or his or her designee, finds that tandem parking and/or parking in setback areas is not feasible based upon specific site or regional topographical or fire and life safety concerns, or that it is not permitted anywhere else in the city. 
10.  When a garage, carport, or covered parking structure is demolished in conjunction with the construction of an accessory dwelling unit resulting in a loss of off-street parking, the city may require replacement of the same and may approve location of the same in any configuration on the same lot as the accessory dwelling unit, including, but not limited to, as covered spaces, uncovered spaces, or tandem spaces, or by the use of mechanical lifts. This clause shall not apply to a unit that is described in subsections 9(a)(1)-(4). Nothing in this section shall prevent the city from enforcing parking requirements for the primary dwelling unit. 
11.  Except as otherwise provided in this chapter, an accessory dwelling unit shall comply with all requirements of this code that are applicable to the main dwelling, including, but not limited to, building setbacks, lot coverage, building height and architectural design.

Chapter 20.14 - RESIDENTIAL DENSITY BONUSES 
  
Sections: 

20.14.010 - Purpose. 
    This chapter implements Government Code §§ 65915, et seq., which requires the city to provide incentives for residential development projects that include units affordable to lower income households. In the event of any conflict between this chapter and Government Code §§ 65915, et seq., the provisions of the Government Code shall prevail and be applied. 
(Ord. 2010-05, § 1(exh. A), 2010; Ord. 2017-009, § 10, 2017.) 
20.14.020 - General provisions. 
A.  Eligibility. The city shall grant a density bonus and a development incentive or incentives to a housing development with five or more dwelling units that provides any of the following: 
1.  At least ten percent of the total units of the housing development as target units affordable to lower-income households. 
2.  At least five percent of the total units of the housing development as target units affordable to very-low-income households. 
3.  Ten percent of the total dwelling units in a common-interest development as target units affordable to moderate-income households provided all units are offered to the public for purchase. 
4.  A donation of land for the purpose of constructing housing for very-low-income households pursuant to Section 20.14.040 (Donations of Land). 
5.  A senior citizen housing development, as defined in Sections 51.3 and 51.12 of the Civil Code, or a mobile home park that limits residency based on age requirements for housing for older persons, pursuant to Sections 798.76 or 799.5 of the Civil Code. 
6.  At least ten percent of the total units of a housing development for transitional foster youth, as defined in Section 66025.9 of the Education Code, disabled veterans, as defined in Section 18541, or homeless persons, as defined in the federal McKinney-Vento Homeless Assistance Act (42 U.S.C. Sec. 11301, et seq.). The units described in this subsection shall be subject to a recorded affordability restriction of fifty-five years and shall be provided at the same affordability level as very low income units. 
B.  Number of target units. To determine the number of target units to be provided, the maximum residential density shall be multiplied by .05 where very-low-income households are targeted, or by .10 where lower-income or moderate-income households are targeted. Any fraction shall be rounded up to the next whole number. 
C.  Number of density bonus units. The number of density bonus units to be granted shall be determined as follows: 
1.  A base factor for calculating the number of density bonus units shall be selected, based on the type of housing development, as follows: 
a.  For a housing development that include donations of land to construct housing for very-low-income households but do not otherwise meet the requirements of this section, the base factor shall be .15. 
b.  For a common-interest development that provides target units for moderate-income households but do not otherwise meet the requirements of this section, the base factor shall be .05. 
c.  For other housing developments that meet the requirements of this section, the base factor shall be .20. 
d.  The base factor shall be adjusted, up to a maximum of .35, for projects that provide any of the following: 
 For a housing development that provides more than five percent of the total units as target units for very-low-income households, each one percent increase shall increase the base factor by .025. 
 For a housing development that provides more than ten percent of the total units as target units for low-income households, each one percent increase shall increase the base factor by .015. 
 For a common-interest development that provides more than ten percent of the total units as target units for moderate-income households, each one percent increase shall increase the base factor by .01. 
 For donations of land to construct housing for very-low-income households, if the area of land donated is larger than the minimum required area, each one percent increase in the size of the land donation shall increase the base factor by .01. 
2.  The minimum number of density bonus units to be granted shall be the maximum residential density for the site, multiplied by the adjusted base factor. Any fraction shall be rounded up to the next whole number. 
3.  The density bonus units shall not be included when determining the number of target units required to qualify for a density bonus. 
D.  Reduction of target units prohibited. No reduction shall be allowed in the number of target units required, even if the applicant proposes to build fewer density bonus units than are permitted by this section. 
E.  Child day care facilities. If a housing development is otherwise eligible for a density bonus under the provisions of this section; the development includes a child day care facility other than a family day care home, including but not limited to, an infant center, preschool, extended day care facility or school-age child care center, that will be located on the premises of, as part of or adjacent to the development; and the city does not find, based upon substantial evidence, that the community has adequate child care facilities, the city shall grant one of the following: 
1.  An additional density bonus that is a number of square feet of residential space equal to or greater than the number of square feet in the child care facility; or 
2.  An additional incentive that contributes significantly to the economic feasibility of the construction of the child care facility. 
(Ord. 2010-05, § 1(exh. A), 2010; Ord. 2017-009, § 11, 2017.) 
20.14.030 - Standards for target units. 
    All target units built under the provisions of this chapter shall meet the following requirements: 
A.  Concurrency. Target units shall be built concurrently with nonrestricted units unless the city and the applicant agree within the density bonus housing agreement to an alternative schedule for development. 
B.  Location. Target units shall be built on-site wherever possible and, where practical, shall be dispersed within the housing development. 
C.  Unit size. Where feasible, the number of bedrooms of the target units shall be equivalent to the bedroom mix of the housing development's other units, except that the developer may include a higher proportion of target units with more bedrooms. 
D.  Design. The design and appearance of the target units shall be compatible with the design of the housing development as a whole. 
E.  Development standards. Housing developments shall comply with all applicable development standards, except those that may be modified as provided by this chapter. 
F.  Linked sites. Circumstances may arise in which the public interest would be served by allowing some or all of the target units associated with one housing development to be produced and operated at an alternative development site. If the developer and the city agree to allow the production and operation of target units at an alternative site, the resulting linked developments shall be considered a single housing development for the purposes of this section. 
(Ord. 2010-05, § 1(exh. A), 2010.) 
20.14.040 - Donations of land. 
    All land donated for the purpose of constructing housing for very-low-income households, in order to receive a density bonus under the provisions of this section, shall meet the following requirements: 
A.  Date of transfer. The applicant shall donate and transfer the land no later than the date of approval of the final subdivision map, parcel map or residential development application. 
B.  Developable acreage. The developable acreage of the land being transferred shall be sufficient to permit construction of units affordable to very-low-income households in an amount not less than ten percent of the number of residential units in the proposed development. 
C.  Minimum size. The transferred land shall have an area sufficient to permit development of at least forty units. 
D.  Appropriate regulations and infrastructure. The transferred land shall have the appropriate general plan land use designation, zoning and development standards to make the development of affordable units feasible, and it shall have existing or planned public facilities and infrastructure that are adequate to support the development. 
E.  Entitlements. No later than the date of approval of the final subdivision map, parcel map or residential development application, the transferred land shall have all of the permits and approvals, other than building permits, necessary for the development of the very-low-income housing units on the transferred land, except that the city may subject the proposed development to design review to the extent authorized by subdivision (i) of Section 66583.2 of the Government Code, if the design is not reviewed by the city prior to the time of transfer. 
F.  Deed restriction. The transferred land and the affordable units shall be subject to a deed restriction ensuring continued affordability of the units consistent with the requirements of this section. The restriction shall be recorded on the property at the time of dedication. 
G.  Recipient. The land shall be transferred to the city or to a housing developer approved by the city. The city may require the applicant to identify and transfer the land to the developer. 
H.  Location. The transferred land shall be within the boundary of the proposed development or, if the city agrees, within one-quarter mile of the boundary of the proposed development. 
I.  Funding. A proposed source of funding for the very low-income units shall be identified not later than the date of approval of the final subdivision map, parcel map, or residential development application. 
(Ord. 2010-05, § 1(exh. A), 2010; Ord. 2017-009, § 12, 2017.) 
20.14.050 - Affordability requirements. 
A.  Continued affordability. Target units, and units built on donated land, shall remain restricted and affordable to the designated group for a period of fifty-five years, or a longer period of time if required by the construction or mortgage financing assistance program, mortgage insurance program or rental subsidy program. 
B.  Affordability requirements. Affordability of the target units, and units built on donated land, shall be required as follows: 
1.  For units for lower-income households, the rent shall not exceed eighteen percent of area median income. 
2.  For units for very-low-income households, the rent shall not exceed fifteen percent of area median income. 
3.  For target units for moderate-income households in a common-interest development, each initial occupant shall be a person or family of moderate-income, as defined in Section 50093 of the Health and Safety Code. 
C.  Occupancy assumptions. The following assumptions shall be used to determine the maximum affordable rent or affordable sales price of target units, and units built on donated land, unless the housing development is subject to different assumptions imposed by other governmental regulations: 
1.  A residential hotel or single-room occupancy (SRO) unit shall be assumed to be occupied by 0.75 persons. 
2.  A zero-bedroom (studio) unit shall be assumed to be occupied by one person. 
3.  A one-bedroom unit shall be assumed to be occupied by two persons. 
4.  A two-bedroom unit shall be assumed to be occupied by three persons. 
5.  A three-bedroom unit shall be assumed to be occupied by four persons.

(Ord. 2010-05, § 1(exh. A), 2010; Ord. 2017-009, § 13, 2017.) 
20.14.060 - Development incentives. 
A.  Number of incentives. The applicant shall receive, at a minimum, the number of development incentives provided below: 
1.  A minimum of one incentive for projects that include at least ten percent of the total units for lower-income households, at least five percent for very-low-income households, or at least ten percent for persons and families of moderate-income in a common-interest development. 
2.  A minimum of two incentives for projects that include at least twenty percent of the total units for lower-income households, at least ten percent for very-low-income households, or at least twenty percent for persons and families of moderate-income in a common-interest development. 
3.  A minimum of three incentives for projects that include at least thirty percent of the total units for lower-income households, at least fifteen percent for very-low-income households, or at least thirty percent for persons and families of moderate-income in a common-interest development. 
B.  Additional incentives. The city may, at its discretion, grant additional incentives to increase the number of target units provided or to increase the affordability of the target units. 
C.  Incentive for day care facility. If the applicant proposes to include a child day care facility in the project, in accordance with the requirements of this section, the applicant may choose to request an additional incentive instead of a density bonus. The additional incentive shall be required to contribute significantly to the economic feasibility of the construction of the child care facility. 
D.  Available incentives. Development incentives may include, but are not limited to the following: 
1.  A reduction of site development standards, or a modification of zoning or architectural design requirements. 
2.  Reduced minimum lot sizes or dimensions. 
3.  Reduced minimum setbacks.

12.  Direct financial aid, such as a redevelopment set-aside or community development block grant funding, in the form of a loan or grant to subsidize or provide low-interesting financing for on-site or off-site improvements, land or construction costs. 
13.  Other regulatory incentives or concessions that result in identifiable, financially sufficient and actual cost reductions. 
E.  Supporting analysis. An applicant seeking a density bonus, or incentive may provide supporting analysis, using one of the following methodologies, that the incentive makes the target units economically feasible: 
1.  A development pro forma with the capital costs, operating expenses, return on investment, loan-to-value ratio and the debt coverage ratio, including the contributions provided by any applicable subsidy programs, and the economic effect created by the minimum fifty-five-year use and income restrictions on the affordable housing units. 
2.  An appraisal report indicating the value of the density bonus and of the incentives/concessions. 
3.  A use of funds statement identifying the projected financing gap for the project with the affordable housing units. The analysis shall show how much of the funding gap is covered by the density bonus and how much by the incentives/concessions. 
F.  Provision of incentives. The city shall provide the specific incentive or incentives requested by an applicant, unless the city makes a written finding, based upon substantial evidence, of any of the following: 
1.  The incentive does not result in identifiable and actual cost reductions to provide for affordable housing costs, as defined in Section 50052.5 of the Health and Safety Code, or for rents for the targeted units to be set as specified in this section. 
2.  The incentive would have a specific adverse impact, as defined in paragraph (2) of subsection (d) of Section 65589.5 of the Government Code, upon public health and safety or the physical environment, or on any real property that is listed in the California Register of Historical Resources, and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact without rendering the development unaffordable to low-income and moderate-income households. 
3.  The incentive would be contrary to state or federal law. 
G.  Burden of proof. The city shall bear the burden of proof for the denial of a requested incentive. 
(Ord. 2010-05, § 1(exh. A), 2010; Ord. No. 2017-009, §§ 13-16, 2017.)

(Ord. 2010-05, § 1(exh. A), 2010; Ord. No. 2017-009, § 17, 2017.) 
20.14.080 - Waivers and modifications of development standards. 
A.  Consistent with Government Code § 65915(e), applicants granted a density bonus pursuant to this chapter may, by written proposal, seek a waiver, modification or reduction of development standards that would otherwise have the effect of physically precluding the construction of the housing development at the densities or with the concessions or incentives permitted pursuant to this chapter. The applicant may also request a meeting with the city to discuss such request for waivers and modifications. 
B.  To obtain a waiver or modification of development standards, the applicant shall show that the development standards will have the effect of physically precluding the construction of a housing development eligible for a density bonus pursuant to this chapter at the densities or with the concessions or incentives permitted by this chapter. 
C.  A proposal for the waiver or reduction of development standards pursuant to this section shall neither reduce nor increase the number of incentives or concessions to which the applicant is entitled. 
D.  Nothing in this subdivision shall be interpreted to require a local government to waive or reduce development standards if the waiver or reduction would have a specific, adverse impact upon health, safety, or the physical environment, and for which there is no feasible method to satisfactorily mitigate or avoid the specific adverse impact. 
(Ord. No. 2017-009, § 18, 2017.)

1.  If the development is located within one-half mile of a major transit stop, as defined in Public Resources Code § 21155(b), and there is unobstructed access to the major transit stop from the development, the ratio shall not exceed 0.5 spaces per unit.

A.  An applicant shall be ineligible for a density bonus or any other incentives under this chapter if the housing development is proposed on any property that includes a parcel or parcels on which rental dwelling units are, or if the dwelling units have been vacated or demolished in the five-year period preceding the application have been, subject to a recorded covenant, ordinance, or law that restricts rents to affordable rent levels; subject to any other form of rent or price control through a public entity's valid exercise of its police power; or occupied by low or very low income households, unless the proposed housing development replaces those units, and either of the following applies:

If any dwelling units described in subsection (A) are occupied on the date of application, the proposed housing development shall provide at least the same number of units of equivalent size to be made available at affordable rent or affordable housing cost to, and occupied by, persons and families in the same or lower income category as those households in occupancy. If the income category of the household in occupancy is not known, it shall be rebuttably presumed that lower income renter households occupied these units in the same proportion of lower income renter households to all renter households within the jurisdiction, as determined by the most recently available data from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development's Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy database. For unoccupied dwelling units described in subsection (A) in a development with occupied units, the proposed housing development shall provide units of equivalent size to be made available at affordable rent or affordable housing cost to, and occupied by, persons and families in the same or lower income category as the last household in occupancy. If the income category of the last household in occupancy is not known, it shall be rebuttably presumed that lower income renter households occupied these units in the same proportion of lower income renter households to all renter households within the jurisdiction, as determined by the most recently available data from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development's Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy database. All replacement calculations resulting in fractional units shall be rounded up to the next whole number. 
2.  If all dwelling units described in subsection (A) have been vacated or demolished within the five-year period preceding the application, the proposed housing development shall provide at least the same number of units of equivalent size as existed at the highpoint of those units in the five-year period preceding the application to be made available at affordable rent or affordable housing cost to, and occupied by, persons and families in the same or lower income category as those persons and families in occupancy at that time, if known. If the incomes of the persons and families in occupancy at the highpoint is not known, it shall be rebuttably presumed that low-income and very low income renter households occupied these units in the same proportion of low-income and very low income renter households to all renter households within the jurisdiction, as determined by the most recently available data from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development's Comprehensive Housing Affordability Strategy database. All replacement calculations resulting in fractional units shall be rounded up to the next whole number.

1.

Qualified applicants may choose to implement a lower density bonus. 
2.  Incentives of equivalent financial value in the form of a reduction or waiver of requirements or fees which the city might otherwise apply as conditions of conversion approval. "Other incentives of equivalent financial value" shall not be construed to require the city to provide cash transfer payments or other monetary compensation to the condominium conversion project or its applicant. 
C.  Consistent with the provisions of state law, the city reserves the right to place such reasonable conditions on the granting of a density bonus or other incentives of equivalent financial value pursuant to this section as it finds appropriate, including, but not limited to, conditions which assure continued affordability of units to subsequent purchasers who are persons and families of low and moderate income or lower income households. 
D.  Condominium conversions are eligible only for the granting of a density bonus or incentive of equivalent value pursuant to this section, which bonus or incentive may not be granted in addition to, or combined with, any other incentives, concessions, density bonuses or waivers and reductions of development standards pursuant other sections of this chapter. Nothing in this section shall be construed to require the city to approve a proposal to convert rental apartments into condominiums. 
E.  An applicant for approval to convert apartments to a condominium project may submit to the city a preliminary proposal pursuant to this section prior to the submittal of any formal requests for subdivision map approvals. The city shall, within ninety days of receipt of a written proposal, notify the applicant in writing of the manner in which it will comply with this section. 
F.  An applicant shall be ineligible for a density bonus or any other incentives or concessions under this section if the condominium project is proposed on any property that includes a parcel or parcels on which rental dwelling units are or, if the dwelling units have been vacated or demolished in the five-year period preceding the application, have been subject to a recorded covenant, ordinance, or law that restricts rents to levels affordable to persons and families of lower or very low income; subject to any other form of rent or price control through a public entity's valid exercise of its police power; or occupied by lower or very low income households, unless the proposed condominium project replaces those units, and either of the following applies: 
1.  The proposed condominium project, inclusive of the units replaced, contains affordable units at the percentages set forth in subsection (A), above.

(Ord. 2014-018, § 1, 2015.) 
Chapter 20.16 - RIGHT TO FARM 
  

20.16.010 - Purpose. 
    As urban development occurs within the city, residential, commercial and industrial land uses will locate adjacent to pre-existing agricultural activities. As a result, agricultural operations may become the subject of nuisance complaints or litigation, and could be pressured to cease or curtail operations, or may be discouraged from making farm improvements. 
    To conserve and protect the continued viability of agricultural operations, it is the intention of the city to limit the circumstances under which agricultural operations may be deemed to constitute a nuisance. The intent is to balance the rights of farmers to produce dairy products, food and other agricultural commodities, with the rights of nonfarmers who own, occupy or use land adjacent to agricultural property. 
(Ord. 2010-05, § 1(exh. A), 2010.) 
20.16.020 - Applicability. 
    The right-to-farm policy contained herein shall apply to all legal agricultural operations within the agricultural overlay district, and all other legally established agricultural operations existing at the time the property was annexed to the City of Chino. For the purposes of this right-to-farm provision, agricultural operations shall include those uses permitted in the AG zoning district. 
(Ord. 2010-05, § 1(exh. A), 2010.) 
20.16.030 - General requirements. 
A.  No agricultural operations conducted or maintained in a manner consistent with proper and accepted customs and standards, as established and followed by similar agricultural operations in the same locality, shall be or become a nuisance, private or public, due to any changed condition in or about the locality if the agricultural operation was existing at the time of annexation or thereafter legally expanded, and if it was not a nuisance at the time it began. 
B.  Purchasers of lots near or adjacent to agricultural uses shall be notified of all surrounding agricultural activities including the types of agricultural activities and potential conflicts such as odors, noise, dust, pesticide abatement, etc. If the developer is the purchaser of the property, this notice shall be extended to subsequent owners. 
C.  Any dispute or controversy that arises regarding any inconveniences or discomforts occasioned by agricultural or agricultural processing operations or facilities should be settled by direct negotiation of the parties involved. Any such dispute or controversy that cannot be settled by direct negotiation of the parties involved should be submitted to a private mediator, a community mediation service, or another agency which provides dispute resolution services prior to the filing of any court action. Any costs associated with negotiation, mediation or dispute resolution pursuant to this section shall be borne by the parties. 
D.  This section shall not invalidate any provision contained in the Health and Safety Code, Fish and Game Code, Food and Agricultural Code, or Division 7 (commencing with Section 13000) of the Water Code of the State of California, if the agricultural operation constitutes a nuisance, public or private, as specifically defined or described in any such provision. 
E.  This section is not to be construed so as to modify or abridge the state law set out in the California Civil Code relative to nuisances, but rather it is only to be utilized in the interpretation and enforcement of the provisions of city ordinances and regulations. 
(Ord. 2010-05, § 1(exh. A), 2010.) 
Chapter 20.17 - DESIGN STANDARDS 
  

20.17.010 - Purpose.

A.  Siting and orientation. Building entrances shall be oriented towards the street. 
B.  Building massing. Entries shall be visually and functionally distinct, pedestrian-oriented and visible from the adjacent street system. This may be achieved by recessing the entry, creating an arcade, by the use of bollards and accent materials, provision of seating areas, by providing lush landscaping in combination with enhanced hardscape materials, or by the addition of a compatible entry structure. 
C.  Building facade. Long, flat building facades along streets shall be avoided to the extent possible. The planes along an exterior wall elevation shall be staggered to create pockets of light and shadow, and to provide relief from monotonous, uninterrupted expanses of wall. 
D.  Architectural details. 
1.  All windows within a building and across a facade shall be related in design, operating type, proportions and trim. 
2.  All building elevations adjacent to a street or highway shall provide architectural detail and relief intended to break up building mass and roof lines, and provide architectural interest.

4.  Roof materials shall relate to the design and architectural style of the building. 
E.  Lighting. 
1.  The location of light fixtures should correspond to anticipated use. Lighting of pedestrian movement paths should illuminate changes in grade, path intersections, seating areas and any other uses along the movement path that, if left unlighted, would create an unsafe situation. 
2.  All lighting fixtures shall be shielded to confine light spread on-site. 
F.  Equipment and systems. 
1.  All building drainage gutters, down spouts, vents, etc., located on the exterior walls shall be architecturally compatible with the exterior building design and color, or shall be completely concealed from view. 
2.  All mechanical equipment and appurtenances of any type (including, but not limited to, skylights, stack vents or fans), whether located on rooftops, ground level or anywhere on the building structure, shall be completely screened so as not to be visible from any public street and/or adjacent property. The parapet wall should serve as the primary method of screening, or the facilities shall be enclosed. Such enclosure of facilities shall be of compatible design related to building structure for which such facilities are intended to serve. 
3.  Ladders for roof access shall be mounted on the inside of the building, or shall be completely concealed from view.

An arborist report shall be provided at the property owner's expense for any tree(s) proposed to be removed that are ten inches or larger in diameter to document the health and viability of the tree(s) and to make a recommendation as to the feasibility of maintaining or removing the tree(s). The arborist shall be certified by the ISA (International Society of Arboriculture). 
5.  If the tree(s) to be removed are dead, severely damaged, diseased, or causing a public hazard such as uprooting sidewalks, destroying underground infrastructure or displacing building foundations, the tree shall be replaced by the property owner(s) at a one-to-one (1:1) ratio. The size of the replacement tree(s) shall be based on the trunk diameter of the tree(s) to be removed as shown in Table 20.19-4.1. 
6.  In the event that the number of replacement trees shown in Table 20.19.4-1 cannot be planted on-site, the director of community development may consider an off-site location to plant the replacement trees or accept an in-lieu fee based on International Society of Arboriculture (ISA) guidelines or other method approved by the director of community development. In-lieu fees collected shall be deposited into a tree replacement fund to be used for tree planting at alternate locations in the city. 
7.  All pruning should be accomplished according to good horticultural standards. Trees shall only be pruned as necessary to promote healthy growth. 
8.  All watering of planted areas shall be managed so as to maintain healthy flora, make plant material more drought tolerant, avoid excessive turf growth, minimize fungus growth, stimulate deep root growth, and minimize the leaching of soil nutrients.

4.  Residential zones. 
C.  Setbacks. 
1.  Distances related to residential setback requirements for major communication facilities shall be measured from the nearest point of the proposed facility to the nearest dwelling or other habitable structure for developed properties. For vacant or partially developed properties that can be further subdivided or developed for dwelling purposes, measurement shall be to the nearest property line. The applicant shall be responsible for supplying and verifying information regarding distances to dwellings and other habitable structures, and shall be responsible for the accuracy of the information provided. 
2.  Major communications facilities shall be located a minimum of five hundred feet from any residentially zoned property or residences. However, where the strict application of this minimum locational requirement would result in a service provider not being able to provide adequate coverage to a service area, the planning commission may approve a reduction in the minimum setback, subject to all of the following: 
a.  The setback from residentially zoned property shall not be reduced to less than two hundred feet, and shall be measured as specified under Subsection C.1. of this section; 
b.  The proposed facility must be stealth in design and all practical measures have been incorporated into the project to screen the facility from adjacent areas; 
c.  The facility shall be the minimum height necessary to service the area; 
d.  It must be clearly demonstrated that no other feasible location is available that would meet the five hundred-foot setback requirement. This shall be accomplished by an alternative siting analysis, described in Subsection B.6., above; 
e.  The city may, at the discretion of the director, contract with a radio frequency engineering consultant or, as deemed appropriate, other qualified professional with knowledge and expertise regarding wireless communication systems, to verify technical assertions made by an applicant's alternative siting analysis. Such verification may include, but is not limited to, issues related to; evaluation of the use of minor communications facilities; technical information regarding transmission coverage requirements and limitations for the candidate site and the three alternative sites including evaluation of the height of facilities; technical limitations related to locating facilities on or within buildings or other structures; and evaluation of new technologies that are available. All costs associated with such verification shall be borne by the applicant. 
D.  Communications facilities shall not be located on residentially zoned property except under the following conditions: 
1.  When such a facility modifies or replaces an existing, legally established, major communications facility; 
2.  When such a facility is collocated on an existing legally established, major communications facility; 
3.  When such a facility is located on a site not developed with single- or multifamily dwellings or other types of residences, and is substantially developed as a public or institutional use (e.g., schools, places of worship, parks, fire stations, etc.), is not freestanding, and is integrated into existing features of buildings or other features of the site such as light poles, other antenna arrays, and church steeples, and the facility is at least two hundred feet from residentially zoned properties on adjacent sites. Such facilities shall be subject to the requirements for an alternative siting analysis contained in Subsection B.6., above. 
E.  Facilities shall, where practical, be located where the existing topography, vegetation, buildings or other structures provide the greatest amount of screening. Where insufficient screening exists, additional screening shall be provided, such as enhanced landscape treatments, architectural treatments or enhancements to disguise the facility. If determined necessary by the director, relocation of a facility so that the massing of existing buildings will provide screening may be required. 
F.  Major communications facilities shall be located in close proximity to existing buildings, structures, above ground utilities (such as electrical towers or utility poles), light poles or trees of comparable heights, and in areas where they will be unobtrusive. 
G.  No communication facility shall be installed at a location where special painting or lighting will be required by FAA regulations, unless technical evidence acceptable to the director of community development is submitted showing that this is the only technically feasible location for the facility. 
H.  Major communications facilities shall be located a minimum of five hundred feet from any existing or approved major communications facility (measured from the nearest point of the proposed facility to the nearest point of another major communications facility), except when the facility is collocated with, or replaces or modifies a legally established pre-existing facility.

The post-application meeting shall be held following the completion and availability of an initial study or notice of preparation for an environmental impact report (EIR) for public review and comment. 
c.  It shall be the responsibility of OPA to work with the lead and responsible agencies, and the LAC to find a mutually acceptable place and time for the post application meeting. OPA shall then notify the lead and responsible agencies, the project proponent, and the LAC, by letter, of the date, time and place of the post-application meeting.

Building Valuation Data-AUGUST 2017 
The International Code Council is pleased to provide the following Building Valuation Data (BVD) for its members. The BVD will be updated at six-month intervals, with the next update in February 2018. ICC strongly recommends that all jurisdictions and other interested parties actively evaluate and assess the impact of this BVD table before utilizing it in their current code enforcement related activities. 
  
The BVD table provides the "average" construction costs per square foot, which can be used in determining permit fees for a jurisdiction. Permit fee schedules are addressed in Section 109.2 of the 2015 International Building Code (IBC) whereas Section 109.3 addresses building permit valuations. The permit fees can be established by using the BVD table and a Permit Fee Multiplier, which is based on the total construction value within the jurisdiction for the past year. The Square Foot Construction Cost table presents factors that reflect relative value of one construction classification/occupancy group to another so that more expensive construction is assessed greater permit fees than less expensive construction. 
  
ICC has developed this data to aid jurisdictions in determining permit fees. It is important to note that while this BVD table does determine an estimated value of a building (i.e., Gross Area x Square Foot Construction Cost), this data is only intended to assist jurisdictions in determining their permit fees. This data table is not intended to be used as an estimating guide because the data only reflects average, costs and is not representative of specific construction. 
  
This degree of precision is sufficient for the intended purpose, which is to help establish permit fees so as to fund code compliance activities. This BVD table provides jurisdictions with a simplified way to determine the estimated value of a building that does not rely on the permit applicant to determine the cost of construction. Therefore, the bidding process for a particular job and other associated factors do not affect the value of a building for determining the permit fee. Whether a specific project is bid at a cost above or below the computed value of construction does not affect the permit fee because the cost of related code enforcement activities is not directly affected by the bid process and results. 
  
Building Valuation 
  
The following building valuation data represents average valuations for most buildings. In conjunction with IBC Section 109.3, this data is offered as an aid for the building official to determine if the permit valuation is underestimated. Again it should be noted that, when using this data, these are "average" costs based on typical construction methods for each occupancy group and type of construction. The average costs include foundation work, structural and nonstructural building components, electrical, plumbing, mechanical and interior finish material. The data is a national average and does not take into account any regional cost differences. As such, the use of Regional Cost Modifiers is subject to the authority having jurisdiction. 
  
Permit Fee Multiplier 
  
Determine the Permit Fee Multiplier: 
1. Based on historical records, determine the total annual construction value which has occurred within the jurisdiction for the past year. 
2. Determine the percentage (%) of the building department budget expected to be provided by building permit revenue. 
3.  

  
Example 
  ;b0;The building department operates on a $300,000 budget, and it expects to cover 75 percent of that from building permit fees. The total annual construction value which occurred within the jurisdiction in the previous year is $30,000,000. 

  
Permit Fee 
  
The permit fee is determined using the building gross area, the Square Foot Construction Cost and the Permit Fee Multiplier. 
  
Permit Fee = Gross Area x Square Foot Construction Cost X Permit Fee Multiplier 
  
Example 
  
Type of Construction: IIB 
Area  1st story = 8,000 sq. ft. 
2nd story = 8,000 sq. ft. 
Height: 2 stories 
Permit Fee Multiplier = 0.0075 
Use Group: B 
1.  Gross area: 
Business = 2 stories x 8,000 sq. ft. = 16,000 sq. ft. 
2.  Square Foot Construction Cost: 
B/IIB = $165.19/sq. ft. 
3.  Permit Fee: 
Business = 16,000 sq. ft. x $165.19/sq. ft x 0.0075 = $19,823.00 
Important Points 
  
 The BVD is not intended to apply to alterations or repairs to existing buildings. Because the scope of alterations or repairs to an existing building varies so greatly, the Square Foot Construction Costs table does not reflect accurate values for that purpose. However, the Square Foot Construction Costs table can be used to determine the cost of an addition that is basically a stand-alone building which happens to be attached to an existing building. In the case of such additions, the only alterations to the existing building would involve the attachment of the addition to the existing building and the openings between the addition and the existing building. 
  
 For purposes of establishing the Permit Fee Multiplier, the estimated total annual construction value for a given time period (1 year) is the sum of each building's value (Gross Area x Square Foot Construction Cost) for that time period (e.g., 1 year). 
  
 The Square Foot Construction Cost does not include the price of the land on which the building is built. The Square Foot Construction Cost takes into account everything from foundation work to the roof structure and coverings but does not include the price of the land. The cost of the land does not affect the cost of related code enforcement activities and is not included in the Square Foot Construction Cost.
