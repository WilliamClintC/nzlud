PREFACE 
    The City of Banning, California Municipal Code has been kept current by regular supplementation by Matthew Bender & Company, Inc. 
    Beginning with Supplement 16, 6-09, Municipal Code Corporation will be keeping this Code current by regular supplementation. 
    The Code is organized by subject matter under an expandable three-factor decimal numbering system which is designed to facilitate supplementation without disturbing the numbering of existing provisions. Each section number designates, in sequence, the numbers of the Title, chapter, and section. Thus, Section 2.12.040 is Section .040, located in Chapter 2.12 of Title 2. In most instances, sections are numbered by tens (.010, .020, .030, etc.), leaving nine vacant positions between original sections to accommodate future provisions. Similarly, chapters and titles are numbered to provide for internal expansion. 
    In parentheses following each section is a legislative history identifying the specific sources for the provisions of that section. This legislative history is complemented by an ordinance disposition table, following the text of the code, listing by number all ordinances, their subjects, and where they appear in the codification; and beginning with Supplement No. 16, 6-09, legislation can be tracked using the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
    A subject-matter index, with complete cross-referencing, locates specific code provisions by individual section numbers. 
    This supplement brings the Code up to date through Ordinance 1540, passed January 8, 2019.

HOW TO USE YOUR CODE 
    This Code is organized to make the laws of the city as accessible as possible to city officials, city employees and private citizens. Please take a moment to familiarize yourself with some of the important elements of this Code. 
Numbering System. 
    The numbering system is the backbone of a Code of Ordinances; Municipal Code Corporation uses a unique and versatile numbering structure that allows for easy expansion and amendment of this Code. It is based on three tiers, beginning with title, then chapter, and ending with section. Each part is represented in the code section number. For example, Section 2.04.010 is Section .010, in Chapter 2.04 of Title 2. 
Title. 
    A title is a broad category under which ordinances on a related subject are compiled. This Code contains about 15 to 20 titles. For example, the first title is Title 1, General Provisions, which may contain ordinances about the general penalty, code adoption and definitions. The titles in this code are separated by tabbed divider pages for quick reference. Some titles are Reserved for later use. 
Chapter. 
    Chapters deal with more specific subjects, and are often derived from one ordinance. All of the chapters on a related subject are grouped in one title. The chapters are numbered so that new chapters which should logically be placed near certain existing chapters can be added at a later time without renumbering existing material. For example, Chapter 2.06, City Manager, can be added between 2.04, City Council, and Chapter 2.08, City Attorney. 
Section. 
    Each section of the code contains substantive ordinance material. The sections are numbered by "tens" to allow for expansion of the code without renumbering. 
Tables of Contents. 
    There are many tables of contents in this Code to assist in locating specific information. At the beginning of the code is the main table of contents listing each title. In addition, each title and chapter has its own table of contents listing the chapters and sections, respectively. 
Ordinance History Note. 
    At the end of each code section, you will find an "ordinance history note," which lists the underlying ordinances for that section. The ordinances are listed by number, section (if applicable) and year. (Example: (Ord. 272 § 1, 1992).) 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 16, 6-09, a secondary ordinance history note will be appended to affected sections. Ordinance history notes will be amended with the most recent ordinance added to the end. These history notes can be cross referenced to the code comparative table and disposition list appearing at the back of the volume preceding the index. 
Statutory References. 
    The statutory references direct the code user to those portions of the state statutes that are applicable to the laws of the municipality. As the statutes are revised, these references will be updated. 
Cross-Reference Table. 
    When a code is based on an earlier codification, the cross-reference table will help users find older or "prior" code references in the new code. The cross-reference table is located near the end of the code, under the tabbed divider "Tables." This table lists the prior code section in the column labeled "Prior Code Section" and the new code section in the column labeled "Herein." 
    As of Supplement No. 16, 6-09, this table will no longer be updated. 
Ordinance List and Disposition Table. 
    To find a specific ordinance in the Code, turn to the section called "Tables" for the Ordinance List and Disposition Table. This very useful table tells you the status of every ordinance reviewed for inclusion in the Code. The table is organized by ordinance number and provides a brief description and the disposition of the ordinance. If the ordinance is codified, the chapter (or chapters) will be indicated. (Example: (2.04, 6.12, 9.04).) If the ordinance is of a temporary nature or deals with subjects not normally codified, such as budgets, taxes, annexations or rezones, the disposition will be "(Special)." If the ordinance is for some reason omitted from the code, usually at the direction of the municipality, the disposition will be "(Not codified)." Other dispositions sometimes used are "(Tabled)," "(Pending)," "(Number Not Used)" or "(Missing)." 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 16, 6-09, this table will be replaced with the "Code Comparative Table and Disposition List." 
Code Comparative Table and Disposition List. 
    Beginning with Supplement No. 16, 6-09, a Code Comparative Table and Disposition List has been added for use in tracking legislative history. Located in the back of this volume, this table is a chronological listing of each ordinance considered for codification. The Code Comparative Table and Disposition List specifies the ordinance number, adoption date, description of the ordinance and the disposition within the code of each ordinance. By use of the Code Comparative Table and Disposition List, the reader can locate any section of the code as supplemented, and any subsequent ordinance included herein. 
Index. 
    If you are not certain where to look for a particular subject in this code, start with the index. This is an alphabetical multi-tier subject index which uses section numbers as the reference, and cross-references where necessary. Look for the main heading of the subject you need, then the appropriate subheadings: 
BUSINESS LICENSE 
See also BUSINESS TAX 
Fee 5.04.030 
Required when 5.04.010 
    The index will be updated as necessary when the code text is amended. 
Insertion Guide. 
    Each supplement to the new code will be accompanied by an Insertion Guide. This guide will tell the code user the date of the most recent supplement and the last ordinance contained in that supplement. It will then list the pages that must be pulled from the code and the new pages that must be inserted. Following these instructions carefully will assure that the code is kept accurate and current. Removed pages should be kept for future reference. 
Page Numbers. 
    When originally published, this code was numbered with consecutive page numbers. As it is amended, new material may require the insertion of new pages that are numbered with decimals. (Example: 31, 32, 32.1.) Backs of pages that are blank (in codes that are printed double-sided) are left unnumbered but the number is "reserved" for later use. 
Electronic Submission. 
    In the interests of accuracy and speed, we encourage you to submit your ordinances electronically if at all possible. We can accept most any file format, including Word, WordPerfect or text files. If you have a choice, we prefer Word, any version. You can send files to us as an e-mail attachment, by FTP, on a diskette or CD-ROM. Electronic files enable us not only to get you your code more quickly but also ensure that it is error-free. Our e-mail address is: ords@municode.com .

Chapter 1.12 - ELECTIONS 

1.12.010 - Authority. 
    The ordinance codified in this chapter is adopted under the authority granted to the city to call general municipal elections for the same day as the statewide general election pursuant to Section 36503.5 of the Government Code. 
(Code 1965, § 6C-1.) 
1.12.020 - Intent. 
    The intent of this chapter is to reduce the costs of conducting general municipal elections in the City of Banning by permitting the consolidation of the general municipal election with the statewide general election conducted by the clerk of the county of Riverside. 
    In addition, it is anticipated that there will be an increase in voter participation in the general municipal election under this chapter because of the traditionally greater voter participation in statewide general elections. 
    This chapter will govern the calling of general municipal elections in the city until repealed by the city council. 
(Code 1965, § 6C-2.) 
1.12.030 - Calling of the election. 
    The general municipal election shall be held in the City of Banning in the same day as the statewide general election as prescribed in Section 2550 of the Elections Code, on the first Tuesday following the first Monday in November during even-numbered years. At that election, a general municipal election will be held for the offices of city council, city clerk or city treasurer whose four-year terms are due to expire during the year in which the election is held. 
    Those elected officials whose four-year terms of office would have, prior to the ordinance codified in this chapter, expired on the Tuesday succeeding the second Tuesday in April shall, instead, continue in their offices until not later than the fourth Tuesday after the day of the general municipal election. 
(Code 1965, § 6C-3.) 
1.12.040 - Request for consolidation. 
A.  At the same time the resolution calling the general municipal election is adopted, the Riverside County board of supervisors may be requested, by resolution, to order that the general municipal election for the City of Banning be consolidated with the statewide general election to be held on the first Tuesday following the first Monday in November. Such resolution shall set forth the exact form of any question, proposition, or office to be voted upon at such election, as the same is to appear on the ballot. 
B.  Pursuant to Section 23314 of the Elections Code, each such consolidated election will be held and conducted, election officers appointed, voting precincts designated, ballots printed, polls opened and closed, ballots counted and returned, returns canvassed, results declared, certificates of election issued and all other proceedings incidental to and connected with the election shall be regulated and done, in accordance with the provisions of law regulating the statewide election with which the Banning general municipal election is consolidated.

Chapter 3.16 - TRANSIENT OCCUPANCY TAX 

3.16.010 - Short title. 
    This chapter shall be known as the uniform transient occupancy tax regulations of the city. 
(Code 1965, § 23-13.) 
3.16.020 - Definitions. 
    Except where the context otherwise requires, the definitions given in this section govern the construction of this chapter: 
    Hotel. Any structure or any portion of any structure, which is occupied or intended or designed for occupancy by transients for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes, and includes any hotel, inn, tourist home or tourist house, motel, studio hotel, bachelor hotel, lodginghouse, roominghouse, apartment house, dormitory, public or private club, mobilehome or house trailer at a fixed location or other similar structure or portion thereof. 
    Occupancy. The use or possession, or the right to the use or possession, of any room or rooms or portion thereof, in any hotel for dwelling, lodging or sleeping purposes. 
    Operator. The person who is proprietor of the hotel, whether in the capacity of owner, lessee, sublessee, mortgagee in possession, licensee, or any capacity. Whether the operator performs his functions through a managed agent of any type or character other than an employee, the managing agent shall also be deemed an operator for the purpose of this chapter and shall have the same duties and liabilities as his principal. Compliance with the provisions of this chapter by either the principal or the managing agent shall, however, be considered to be compliance by both. 
    Person. Any individual, firm, partnership, joint venture, association, social club, fraternal organization, joint stock company, corporation, estate, trust, business trust, receiver, trustee, syndicate or any other group or combination acting as a unit. 
    Rent. The consideration charged, whether or not received, for the occupancy of space in a hotel valued in money, whether to be received in money, goods, labor or otherwise, including all receipts, cash, credits and property and services of any kind or nature, without any deduction therefrom whatsoever. 
    Tax administrator. The city manager or his designated agent. 
    Transient. Any person who exercises occupancy or is entitled to occupancy by reason of concession, permit, right of access, license or other agreement for a period of less than thirty consecutive calendar days, counting portions of calendar days as full days. Any such person occupying space in a hotel shall be deemed to be a transient until the period of thirty days has expired, unless there is an agreement in writing between the operator and the occupant providing for a larger period of occupancy. In determining whether a person is a transient, uninterrupted periods of time extending both prior and subsequent to the effective date of this chapter may be considered. 
(Code 1965, § 23-14.) 
3.16.030 - Imposed-Amount-When payable. 
A.  For the privilege of occupancy in any hotel or motel, each transient is subject to and shall pay a tax in the amount set forth in subsection (B) hereof, but such rate shall not exceed twelve percent of the rent charged by the operator, which shall be referred to herein as the "cap rate." Such tax constitutes a debt owed by the transient to the city which is extinguished only by payment to the operator or to the city. The transient shall pay the tax to the operator of the hotel or motel at the time the rent is paid. If the rent is paid in installments, a proportionate share of the tax shall be paid in each installment. The unpaid tax shall be due upon the transient's ceasing to occupy space in the hotel or motel.

Chapter 3.18 - MINING TAX AND MINING IMPACT FUND 

3.18.010 - Purpose and intent. 
A.  Mining is important statewide industry and regulated by state law under the 1976 Surface Mining and Reclamation Act, Public Resources Code §§ 2710 et seq. ("SMARA"). State law encourages local regulation permitting local agencies to act as lead agencies. Mining areas are an important state-wide resource with benefits enjoyed regionally and statewide, as provided in SMARA. 
B.  Mining is a significant use in the city with at least one hundred eighty-six acres in mined areas that have been dedicated to the extraction and processing of rock materials since 1925. Mining is a unique use within the community in terms of the long-term nature of the use and the extent and significance of its impact on surrounding properties. 
C.  Mining impacts include, but are not limited to, deterioration of streets and other public infrastructure facilities; degradation of air quality; public health and safety hazards; increased noise; slope stability and slope erosion problems; security and safety concerns; visual blight; water quality impacts; impacts on the San Gorgonio River; problems with sand and particulate matter; and loss of developable land for other uses. The negative impacts of mining are significant, felt on properties beyond the operational boundaries of the pit, and are experienced locally. 
D.  The purpose of this chapter is to establish a comprehensive taxing scheme for mining operations, both to support the city's general governmental operations and to raise revenue to study, analyze, monitor, regulate, administer, correct, remediate and mitigate mining impacts and to facilitate reclamation of mining pits. 
E.  Ultimately, it is the city's goal that mining operations are so conducted as to be a good neighbor to persons residing or working in the city and that at such time as a mining use is discontinued, the property be restored to a usable condition which is readily adaptable to alternate land uses and will create no danger to public health or safety. It is the purpose of this chapter to facilitate these goals and ensure the following: 
1.  Adverse environmental effects are prevented or minimized and that mined lands are reclaimed to a usable condition which is readily adaptable for alternative land uses; 
2.  The production and conservation of minerals are encouraged, while giving consideration to values relating to recreation, watershed, wildlife, range and forage, and aesthetic enjoyment; 
3.  Residual hazards to the public health and safety are eliminated.

3.18.030 - Mining tax on excavation and processing. 
A.  Tax for Rock Material Excavation/Processing/Transportation. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this code relating to taxes and special taxes, there is imposed upon each person or entity engaged in the business of excavating, processing and transporting rock materials from any real property located within the city, for the purpose of commercial use thereof other than on the property where so excavated, a tax of eighty cents per ton of rock materials so excavated, processed and transported. The excavation, processing, transportation components of these operations are not taxed separately and the tax applies singly to the whole operation, and even if the processing itself occurs offsite. For purposes of calculating the tax, tonnage is measured at the transport weigh station and applied to the weight of rock materials exiting a mining operation for purposes of sale. 
B.  Tax for Rock Material Processing. Notwithstanding any other provisions of this code relating to taxes or special taxes, there is imposed upon each person or entity engaged in the business of importing and processing rock materials to be used as fill for a mining pit at any location within the city a tax of one-third of the tax for excavation per ton of rock materials so imported, provided that such tax is subject to modification through a development agreement per section 3.18.050. The reduced rate is established to encourage reclamation activities. 
C.  General Tax. The purposes of the taxes in this section are to raise revenue and are not regulatory. The revenue shall be placed in the city's general fund to finance the general operations of the city. Such operations may include, but are not limited to: paying for basic or enhanced law enforcement or public safety services, park, recreational, and senior services, neighborhood preservation, community services, infrastructure improvement and maintenance, and other such general services. Additionally, the revenue could be set aside with the purpose of mitigating mining impacts in accordance with section 3.18.040. 
D.  Cost of Living Adjustment. The taxes imposed in subsections A and B above shall be paid quarterly on the twentieth day in the months of July, October, January and April of each year, and shall be annually adjusted based upon the percentage change equal to the percentage change in the Los Angeles-Anaheim-Riverside Consumer Price Index (C.P.I.) from July of the current year compared with July of the prior year. The C.P.I. change shall take place on October 1 of each year. 
E.  Effective July 1, 2016, the eighty-cent per-ton tax rate in subsection A of this section is hereby suspended and reduced to twenty-five cents per ton of rock materials excavated, processed and transported. 
    The suspension of the eighty-cent per-ton tax rate in subsection A, and the reduced tax rate of twenty-five cents per ton of rock materials excavated, processed and transported established herein, shall remain in full force and effect unless and until the city council adopts an ordinance lifting the suspension or modifying the tax rate, which adoption shall be consistent with the findings and purpose of Ordinance No. 1502.

A receipt of each ticket shall be kept and maintained by the operator of the business pursuant to subsection (A) above. Each weight ticket shall contain the following information: 
(i)  The size, empty weight and load capacity of the vehicle; and 
(ii)  The loaded weight of the vehicle carrying rock, sand or gravel to or from the facility; and 
(iii)  The cargo weight. 
C.  The city shall have the right at any time during regular business hours to inspect such records upon seventy-two hours' notice for purposes of allowing the city, or its duly authorized representative, to conduct a financial review or audit to verify the accuracy of taxes paid pursuant to section 3.18.030. Should a city audit find that the mine operator has underpaid taxes paid pursuant to section 3.18.030 by a shortfall of or exceeding one percent of the taxes actually due in any one-year period, the operator shall bear all costs of the city's audit. 
D.  No injunction or writ of mandate or other legal or equitable process shall issue in any suit, action or proceeding in any court against the city or an officer thereof to prevent or enjoin the collection of taxes, fees or fines sought to be collected pursuant to any provision or resolution ordinance of the city for the payment of all taxes, fees or fines.

Chapter 3.29 - ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT[3] 

Footnotes: 
--- (3) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 1453, adopted June 26, 2012, enacted provisions to be designated as Chapter 3.28. Inasmuch as there already exists a Chapter 3.28, said new provisions have been redesignated as Chapter 3.29. Original section numbering has been maintained in the history notes following each section. 

3.29.010 - Purpose. 
A.  Constraints to Development. The City of Banning has found that its redevelopment program has been essential to revitalizing Banning which was for historically the center of economic activity in the San Gorgonio Pass area. Banning has had to overcome many obstacles including: 
(i)  Having its downtown areas bypassed by the Interstate Highway System; 
(ii)  Aged and undeveloped infrastructure inadequate to service redeveloping and growth areas; 
(iii)  Economic competition with other cities which used economic incentives to attract revenue generating businesses and development; 
(iv)  High commercial vacancies and a lack of commercial facilities to create a vibrant downtown; 
(v)  Dilapidated, unattractive, obsolete, and deteriorated buildings and stagnant property values; and 
(vi)  Community demographics with low income levels, high unemployment and lack of adequate housing. 
    These factors continue to discourage development in the community. 
B.  Accomplishments of Redevelopment Program. Since the formation of the Redevelopment Agency, the RDA has spent over three million, two hundred thousand dollars in developing a downtown façade improvement program on some twenty-three properties; has spent over twenty million dollars in building various public buildings and improvements; has redeveloped historic downtown properties such as the Oddfellows Building, the Fox Theater, the Hendon Building, the Nickles Building, the Willens Building, and the Coplin House at a cost of approximately three and one-half million dollars; has brought the sixty-eight million dollars Justice Center to downtown which will bring six courtrooms, some three hundred jobs, some five hundred to one thousand people in daily court business, and will serve as a center of activity in downtown, which project is also leading to the twenty-three million dollars Village at Paseo San Gorgonio Project; has created over two thousand jobs in businesses developed on RDA projects; has brought or retained sales tax generators to the community, who collectively pay over one million dollars in annual sales taxes and restored hope in the future of Banning. 
C.  Remaining Property Needs Continued Redevelopment. If most of the property in Banning which needed redevelopment had been redeveloped, or if the remaining blighted property did not face the same constraints as the property the RDA has redeveloped over the last thirty-four years, then the elimination of the redevelopment agency by the State of California by ABx126 would not be contrary to the general welfare of the citizens of Banning. But in many cases, some of the most constrained parcels in the City are still the ones most in need of redevelopment assistance. The Legislature in acting quickly in a statewide manner could not appreciate the impact of ABx126 in a small community impacted by blight such as Banning. 
D.  Need for Local Economic Development Program. In the face of the State's decision to eliminate redevelopment, the City of Banning must design and implement a local program within the authority of its powers under the State law to accomplish the purposes previously served by the City's redevelopment program. It is therefore the purpose of this Chapter to implement a program within the authority of the City under the powers granted to the City by law. 
(Ord. No. 1453, § 1(3.28.010), 6-26-12) 
3.29.020 - Assistance available. 
    To accomplish the purposes provided herein, the City of Banning and its associated and subordinated entities shall have the power to carry out policies, plans and programs, to enact measures, to enter into agreements, and to loan, grant, fund, or finance projects which will provide public benefit and protect the public health, safety and welfare of the community. These programs may be carried out singly or in combination in a manner to promote the objectives of this Chapter, and may include the following general types of measures: 
A.  Public-Private Partnerships. Agreements with private persons or entities where by the sharing of public resources by the public agency, the reduction of regulatory burdens, asset monetization, fee producing infrastructure, alternative procurement, concession agreements, leasing arrangements, securitization of obligations, or other measures, the development entity and investors can earn a commercially reasonable return on investment and will accordingly proceed with the project; 
B.  Emerging Statutory Opportunities. Special legislative programs exist, and are likely to be enhanced as a result of the elimination of redevelopment, the State's most important and best funded economic development strategy. Under this Chapter, such programs should be exploited to the fullest extent of the law. Such programs may include Design Build Contracts; Tax Credits; Infrastructure Finance Districts; Environmental Sustainability Programs; Development Zones; and similar legislation. Any legal structure existing currently, or enacted hereafter which permits the City legally to carry out these purposes is permitted hereunder; 
C.  Public Financing. All public financing mechanisms which offer the opportunity of lower financing costs, if permitted by law, may be utilized including lease-revenue bonds, revenue bonds relating to the EB-5 Program, industrial development bonds, private activity bonds, certificates of participation, letter of credit enhancement and similar measures; 
D.  Special Districts. The financing of both the development of infrastructure and services through community service districts, landscape and lighting districts, assessment districts, school facility improvement bonds, and similar special district financing mechanisms permitted by law; 
E.  Public Property. The use of ground leases or sale of publicly owned land, including at less than fair market value as provided herein, contractual development agreements in accordance with law, lease-lease back financing, design-build contracts, and the use of eminent domain to acquire property for the foregoing purposes; 
F.  Tax Rebate Agreements. The use of tax rebate or similar agreements permitted by law including for sales taxes, transient occupancy taxes, utility taxes or other taxes shared with the generator, and rebates or waivers of franchise fees, business license fees, development impact fees, or other revenue sources permitted by law; 
G.  Regulatory Relief. The modification or suspension of zoning and other land use restrictions affecting the feasibility of development, density bonuses, expedited processing of entitlements, the establishment of clear and consistent regulatory regimes, creating procedures to quickly resolve disputes, clear definition of scope of environmental review and use of scoping processes; 
H.  Other Agencies. Use of financial assistance provided by other local public agencies and by State and Federal programs to assist projects, consistent with the requirements of such programs; and 
I.  Other Programs. In addition to the foregoing, the City may utilize any other program and provide any other form of direct or indirect assistance as the same may currently or in the future exist which would further permit the accomplishment of the purposes provided herein, to the full extent permitted by the law. The enumeration of certain programs herein does not preclude the use of any other program which might accomplish the purposes of this Chapter. 
(Ord. No. 1453, § 1(3.28.020), 6-26-12) 
3.29.030 - Economic development assistance programs. 
    The city may plan and carry out an economic development assistance program for the improvement, rehabilitation, and economic development of property through public-private partnerships, or utilizing any other method provided in section 3.29.020.

(Ord. No. 1453, § 1(3.28.040), 6-26-12) 
3.29.050 - Conditions to qualify for assistance. 
    An economic development assistance program may only be approved for projects which, due to the nature of the project or scale of the project, the project will provide significant long-term benefits to the public generally. Accordingly, any person seeking approval of an economic development assistance program must meet one or more of the following conditions: 
A.  Alleviation of Blighting Conditions. The development of the project will alleviate a persistent condition of blight which has previously discouraged the development of the property, such as demolition and removal of dilapidated substandard buildings and structures, geotechnical or other conditions of topography or soils which inhibit development of the property, or the removal or remediation of hazardous substances or environmental contamination of soils, where the cost of such blighting conditions (not including the building construction costs) will exceed the land value of the property. 
B.  Need for Area-Wide Infrastructure. The development of the project will require the construction of major infrastructure requiring capacity which significantly exceed the needs of the project, and where the cost of the infrastructure, in aggregate, may make the Project economically unfeasible. 
C.  Production of Jobs. The development of the project will result in: 
(i)  The establishment of a new business or businesses on the property producing in excess of one hundred long-term jobs, or 
(ii)  Cause the expansion of an existing business adding at least one hundred new long-term jobs, or 
(iii)  Preserve an existing business which will retain at least one hundred long-term jobs (all excluding multipliers). 
D.  Fiscal Impact on City. The development of the project will create new on-going revenues to the city, considering all revenue sources, of at least one hundred thousand dollars annually, or preserve existing revenues of at least one hundred thousand dollars annually due to the threat of relocation outside of the city. 
E.  Special Amenities. The development of the project will produce unique community amenities either due to the construction of needed public facilities, or due to the fact that the project itself provides special private facilities available to the public which do not otherwise exist in the community and which would be significant to the community character and quality of life of those who work or live in the community. 
    In addition to the above conditions, the development of the project must not have a substantially adverse impact on traffic, or on surrounding properties or on the community generally. The project must meet one or more of the above conditions and the city council must find that the project taken as a whole is uniquely beneficial to the community.

3.36.070 - Fees for qualifying projects. 
A.  Repeal of Development Impact Fees.

The registrant shall, by written statement and supporting testimony, show the method of business, the type of business, the number of employees and such other information as the license collector may deem necessary in order to determine the extent, if any, of any undue burden or violation. The license collector shall then conduct an investigation, and, after having first obtained the written approval of the city attorney, shall fix as the business tax for the registrant an amount that is reasonable and nondiscriminatory, or if the business tax has already been paid, shall order a refund of the amount over and above the business tax so fixed. In fixing the business tax to be charged, the license collector shall have the power to base the business tax upon the number of employees, the method of business, the type of business or any other measure which will assure that the business tax assessed shall be uniform with that assessed on businesses of like nature, so long as the amount assessed does not exceed the business tax as prescribed by this chapter. Should the license collector determine the number of employee method as the basis for determining the business tax, he or she may require the registrant to submit, either at the time of termination of registrant's business in the city, or at the end of each three-month period, a written statement substantiating the number of employees or any other information he or she may deem as pertinent and pay the amount of business tax therefor, provided that no additional business tax during any one calendar year shall be required after the registrant shall have paid an amount equal to the annual business tax as prescribed in this chapter.

5.16.090 - Multiple franchises. 
A.  The city may grant any number of franchises subject to applicable state or federal law. The city may limit the number of franchises granted, based upon, but not necessarily limited to, the requirements of applicable law and specific local considerations, such as: 
1.  The capacity of the public rights-of-way to accommodate multiple cables and lines in addition to the cables, lines, conduits and pipes of the utility systems. 
2.  The benefits that may accrue to subscribers as a result of cable system competition, such as lower rates and improved service. 
3.  The disadvantages that may result from cable system competition, such as the requirement for multiple pedestals on residents' property, and the disruptions arising from numerous excavations of the public rights-of-way. 
B.  The city may require that any new entrant, non-incumbent grantee be responsible for its own underground trenching and the costs associated therewith if, in the city's opinion, the public rights-of-way in any particular area cannot feasibly and reasonably accommodate additional facilities. 
(Code 1965, § 6B-2.8; Ord. No. 1350, § 1 (part).) 
5.16.100 - Franchise non-transferable. 
A.  A grantee may not sell, transfer, lease, assign or dispose of, in whole or in part, either by forced or involuntary sale, or by ordinary sale, contract, consolidation or otherwise (collectively "transfer"), the franchise or any of the rights or privileges therein granted, without the prior consent of the city; provided, however, that the prior written consent of the city will not be required for an intracorporate or intracompany transfer from one subsidiary of the grantee's ultimate parent to another subsidiary in which the grantee's ultimate parent retains at least a seventy-five percent interest. The granting of a security interest in any of the grantee assets, or any mortgage or other hypothecation or by assignment of any right, title or interest in the cable system, or use of the cable system as collateral in order to secure indebtedness, will not be considered a transfer for the purposes of this section. 
B.  The requirements of subsection A will apply to any change in control of a grantee. The word "control" as used herein includes majority ownership, and actual working control in whatever manner exercised. If a grantee is a corporation, prior consent of the city will be required where ownership or control of more than twenty-five percent of the voting stock of the grantee is acquired by a person or group of persons acting in concert, none of whom own or control the voting stock of the grantee as of the effective date of the franchise, singularly or collectively. 
C.  A grantee shall notify city in writing of any foreclosure or any other judicial sale of all or a substantial part of the franchise property of the grantee or upon the termination of any lease or interest covering all or a substantial part of the franchise property. Such notification will be considered by city as notice that a change in control or ownership of the franchise has taken place and the provisions under this section governing the consent of the city to such change in control or ownership will apply. 
D.  For the purpose of determining whether it will consent to such change, transfer, or acquisition of control, city may inquire into the qualifications of the prospective transferee or controlling party, in accordance with this section, and the grantee shall assist the city in such inquiry. In seeking the city's consent to any change of ownership or control, the grantee has the responsibility of insuring that the grantee or the proposed transferee completes an application in accordance with Federal Communications Commission Form 394 or equivalent. An application must be submitted to the city not less than one hundred twenty days prior to the proposed date of transfer. The transferee will be required to establish that it possesses the legal, technical and financial qualifications to operate and maintain the cable system and comply with all franchise requirements for the remainder of the term of the franchise. If the franchisee is then in compliance with the requirements of the franchise, and the legal, financial and technical qualifications of the applicant are satisfactory, the city will consent to the transfer of the franchise in accordance with federal regulations. 
E.  Any financial institution having a pledge of a grantee or its assets for the advancement of money for the construction or operation of the franchise has the right to notify the city that it or its designee satisfactory to the city will take control of and operate the cable system, in the event of a grantee default of its financial obligations. Further, the financial institution must also agree in writing to continue cable service and comply with all franchise requirements during the term the financial institution exercises control over the cable system. 
F.  Any submission of an application for transfer or change of control of a franchise must be accompanied by a deposit in the amount of four thousand dollars. Immediately upon transfer or change of control, the grantee shall reimburse the city for the city's reasonable processing and review expenses over four thousand dollars in connection with the transfer or change of control of the franchise including without limitation, costs of administrative review, financial, legal and technical evaluation of the proposed transferee, consultants (including technical and legal experts and all costs incurred by such experts), notice and publication costs and document preparation expenses, as specified in any franchise agreement. Any such reimbursement may not be charged against any franchise fee due to the city during the term of the franchise or identified as a pass through charge on subscribers' bills. If the city's processing expenses are less than four thousand dollars, any unused funds on deposit will be refunded to the applicant. 
G.  Approval by the city of a transfer or change of control application does not constitute a waiver or release of any rights of the city under this title or a franchise agreement, whether arising before or after the date of the transfer. 
(Code 1965, § 6B-2.9; Ord. No. 1350, § 1 (part).) 
5.16.110 - Franchise modification. 
A.  If a grantee desires to modify the franchise, the grantee must submit the request in writing to the city. The city will then provide to the grantee a summary of all costs that the city anticipates it will incur in processing the grantee's request. Such costs may include, but are not limited to, the administrative review, financial, legal and technical evaluation of the proposal, consultants (including technical and legal experts and all costs incurred by such experts), notice and publication requirements with respect to the consideration of the application and document preparation expenses. 
B.  If the grantee agrees to pay and does pay all of these costs in advance, then the city will process the proposed modification. The fact that the city agrees to process the requested modification does not mean that the city has any obligation or intent to accept the proposed modification. 
C.  If the grantee does not agree to pay these costs in advance, or fails to make such payment within thirty days of receipt of the city's summary of costs, and city does not later expressly waive the provisions of this subsection C, then the grantee's request for franchise modification will be deemed withdrawn. 
D.  No modification of the franchise will take affect or be binding on the city unless and until such modification is approved by the city council. 
(Code 1965, § 6B-2.10; Ord. No. 1350, § 1 (part).) 
5.16.120 - Franchise renewal. 
    Franchise renewals will be in accordance with applicable law. The city and a grantee, by mutual consent, may enter into renewal negotiations at any time during the term of the franchise. A franchise will not be subject to renewal once it has expired or otherwise been terminated. A deposit of ten thousand dollars must be paid at the time the renewal is requested. Immediately upon renewal, the grantee shall reimburse the city for reasonable processing and review expenses in excess of ten thousand dollars in connection with the renewal including without limitation, costs of administrative review, financial, legal and technical evaluation of the proposed renewal, consultants (including technical and legal experts and all costs incurred by such experts), notice and publication costs and document preparation expenses. Any such reimbursement may not be charged against any franchise fee due to the city during the term of the franchise or identified as a pass through charge on subscribers' bills. If the city's expenses are less than ten thousand dollars, any unused funds on deposit will be refunded to the grantee. 
(Code 1965, § 6B-2.11; Ord. No. 1350, § 1 (part).) 
Article III. - Franchise Agreement 

5.16.130 - Franchise agreement. 
    In addition to the terms and conditions required by this title, all other terms, conditions, procedures, rights and obligations of the city and any person or entity which constructs, installs or operates a cable system will be specified in a franchise agreement between the city and the grantee. All franchise agreements must be consistent with this title and, to the extent possible, non-discriminatory as to other franchise agreements granted pursuant to this title. The obligations of this title apply to all persons or entities that construct, install or operate cable systems regardless of whether such person or entity has a franchise agreement in effect.

"Standard installations" are those that are located up to two hundred fifty feet from the existing distribution system unless otherwise defined in the franchise agreement. However, should such an installation require trenching, the installation must be completed within thirty calendar days after receipt of a request, provided that the grantee is able to obtain all necessary easements and permits. 
6.  When scheduling service calls, appointments with subscribers for installation of service, and other activities at the subscriber location, the grantee shall specify a two hour time period sometime between 8:00 A.M. and 6:00 P.M. for the appointment. The grantee may schedule installation and service calls outside of this time period for the express convenience of the customer. The grantee may not cancel an appointment with a customer after the close of business on the business day prior to the scheduled appointment. If a grantee representative does not keep the appointment within the specified two hour time period, (a) the customer must be contacted and the appointment rescheduled for a time which is mutually agreeable to the grantee and the customer; and (b) the grantee may not charge the customer for completing any of the work which was the subject of the original appointment.

5.16.150 - Service standards. 
    Except as otherwise provided in a franchise agreement, 
A.  The grantee shall render efficient service, make repairs promptly, and interrupt service only for good cause and for the shortest time possible.

D.  Credits or refunds must automatically be provided by the grantee on a pro rata basis to any subscriber affected by an interruption of service for more than three hours due to events within the control of the grantee, exclusive of scheduled repairs, maintenance or franchise-required construction that the grantee has provided advance written notice of to subscribers.

5.16.180 - Subscriber complaints, continuity of service, and resolution of disputes. 
A.  The grantee must establish written procedures for receiving, acting upon and resolving subscriber complaints without intervention by the city. The written procedures must prescribe the manner in which a subscriber may submit a complaint either orally or in writing specifying the subscriber's grounds for dissatisfaction. Grantee shall file a copy of these procedures with the city. These procedures must meet the approval of the city, which approval may not be unreasonably withheld. 
B.  Upon prior written request, the city has the right to review the grantee's response to any subscriber complaint in order to determine the grantee's compliance with the franchise requirements, subject to the subscriber's right to privacy. 
C.  Subject to applicable law including, but not limited to, the terms of the franchise agreement, all subscribers have the right to continue receiving cable service insofar as their financial and other obligations to the grantee are honored. In the event that the grantee elects to rebuild, modify, or sell the system, or the city gives notice of intent to terminate or not to renew the franchise, the grantee must ensure that all subscribers receive cable service as long as the franchise remains in force. 
D.  In the event of a change of control of the grantee, or in the event a new operator acquires the system, the original grantee shall cooperate with the city, new grantee or operator in maintaining continuity of service to all subscribers. During such period, the grantee will be entitled to the revenues for any period during which it operates the system. 
E.  The grantee's response to subscriber complaints, as well as complaints made by subscribers to the city and provided by the city to the grantee, must be initiated within one business day of receipt by the grantee. The grantee shall resolve a subscriber's complaint not later than five business days after receipt of the complaint, or a longer period if such complaint cannot reasonably be resolved within five business days. Should a grantee supervisor not be available when requested by a subscriber, a supervisor must respond to the subscriber's complaint at the earliest possible time, and in no event later than the end of the next business day. The grantee shall promptly notify the city of the grantee's progress in responding to, and resolving, any complaints forwarded by the city to the grantee. 
(Code 1965, § 6B-4.5; Ord. No. 1350, § 1 (part).) 
5.16.190 - Other requirements. 
A.  In the event the grantee fails to operate the system for seven consecutive calendar days other than for reasons beyond the control of the grantee, without prior approval or subsequent excuse of the city, the city may, at its sole option, operate the system or designate an operator until such time as the grantee restores service under conditions acceptable to the city or a permanent operator is selected. If the city should fulfill this obligation for the grantee, then during such period as the city fulfills this obligation, the city will be entitled to collect all revenues from the system, and the grantee shall reimburse the city for all reasonable costs or damages in excess of the revenues collected by the city that are the result of the grantee's failure to perform. 
B.  All officers, agents or employees of the grantee or its contractors or subcontractors who, in the normal course of work come into contact with members of the public or who require entry onto the premises of any subscriber must carry a photo-identification card in a form approved by the city. The grantee must account for all identification cards at all times. Every vehicle of the grantee or its major subcontractors must be clearly and prominently identified as affiliated with or operated by the grantee. 
C.  Additional service standards and standards governing consumer protection and response by grantee to subscriber complaints not otherwise provided for in this title may be established in the franchise agreement or by separate ordinance as permitted by federal law. If the city establishes such additional service standards which exceed any standards established by the federal communications commission, the grantee may be permitted by federal law or regulation to recover the incremental cost associated with meeting the more stringent standard (i.e., the incremental cost differential between meeting the existing standard and that of the newly established standard). A verified and continuing pattern of repeated and substantial noncompliance may be deemed a material breach of the franchise, provided that the grantee must receive due process, including prior written notification and a reasonable opportunity to cure, prior to any sanction being imposed." 
D.  The city may conduct an audit or other inquiry in relation to payments made by a grantee no more than once every three years. As a part of the audit process, the city or its designee may inspect the grantee's books of accounts relative to the franchise at any time during regular business hours and after thirty calendar days prior written notice. All records deemed by the city or its designee to be reasonably necessary for such audit shall be made available by the grantee in a mutually agreeable format and location. If the results of any audit indicate that grantee (1) paid the correct franchise fee, (2) overpaid the franchise fee and is entitled to a refund or credit, or (3) underpaid the franchise fee by five percent or less, then the city shall pay the costs of the audit. If the results of the audit indicate grantee underpaid the franchise fee by more than five percent, then grantee shall pay the reasonable, documented, third-party costs of the audit, which costs shall be limited to five thousand dollars. 
E.  Each cable systems operator shall be required to provide cable access to each fire station, public school, police station, public library, and other such buildings used for public purposes to the extent that such access is being provided by other cable service providers within the service area. 
F.  Each cable systems operator shall be required to provide at least one public, education, and government ("PEG") channel. 
G.  Each cable systems operator shall make a PEG support grant to the city in the sum of sixty cents per subscriber per month payable quarterly no later than thirty days following the close of each quarter. Alternatively, and pursuant to a franchise agreement, an equivalent level of support may be made by provision of in-kind services or equipment.

Chapter 5.18 - STATE VIDEO FRANCHISES 

5.18.010 - Purpose and application. 
    This chapter is designed to regulate video service providers holding state video franchises and operating within the city pursuant to that franchise. On January 1, 2007, the State of California became the sole authority with power to grant state video franchises pursuant to the Digital Infrastructure and Video Competition Act of 2006 ("DIVCA"). Pursuant to DIVCA, the City of Banning shall receive a franchise fee and a fee for public, educational and/or government (PEG) purposes from all state video franchise holders operating within the city. Additionally, the city acquired the responsibility to establish and enforce penalties, consistent with state law, against all state video franchise holders operating within the city for violations of customer service standards. DIVCA precludes the city from adopting its own standards and grants all authority to adopt customer service standards to the state. DIVCA leaves unchanged the city's authority to regulate the city's existing cable franchises until the expiration of any such franchises. 
(Ord. No. 1379, § 2 (part).) 
5.18.020 - State video franchise and PEG fees.

If however, a local franchisee is providing video service pursuant to locally issued franchise and is authorized to pay at a rate lower than five percent of gross revenue, then the state franchisee shall pay a fee to the city equal to that lower amount. 
B.  Any state video franchise holder operating within the boundaries of the city shall also pay the city a fee equal to one percent of the gross revenue of that state video franchise holder, which fee shall be used by the city for any public, educational, and/or governmental (PEG) purposes consistent with state and federal law. 
C.  In addition, any state franchisee that has held a locally issued franchise agreement shall, consistent with Public Utilities Code Section 5870, continue to fully provide and support PEG channel facilities and institutional networks and to provide cable services to community buildings to the maximum extent permitted by law. 
D.  Gross revenue, for the purposes of subsections A and B above, shall have the definition set forth in California Public Utilities Code Section 5860. 
(Ord. No. 1379, § 2 (part).) 
5.18.030 - Audit authority. 
    Not more than once annually, the city manager or the manager's designee may examine and perform an audit of the business records of a holder of a state video franchise to ensure compliance with Section 5.18.020. 
(Ord. No. 1379, § 2 (part).) 
5.18.040 - Customer service penalties under state video franchises. 
A.  The holder of a state video franchise shall comply with all applicable state and federal customer service and protection standards pertaining to the provision of video service. 
B.  The city manager or the manager's designee shall monitor the compliance of state video franchise holders with respect to state and federal customer service and protection standards. The city manager or the manager's designee will provide the state video franchise holder written notice of any material breaches of applicable customer service standards, and will allow the state video franchise holder thirty days from the receipt of the notice to remedy the specified material breach. Material breaches not remedied within the thirty-day time period will be subject to the following penalties to be imposed by the city: 
1.  For the first occurrence of a violation, a fine of up to five hundred dollars may be imposed for each day the violation remains in effect, not to exceed one thousand five hundred dollars for each violation. 
2.  For a second violation of the same nature within twelve months, a fine of up to one thousand dollars may be imposed for each day the violation remains in effect, not to exceed three thousand dollars for each violation. 
3.  For a third or further violation of the same nature within twelve months, a fine of up to two thousand five hundred dollars may be imposed for each day the violation remains in effect, not to exceed seven thousand five hundred dollars for each violation. 
C.  A state video franchise holder may appeal a penalty assessed by the city manager to the city council within sixty days of the initial assessment. The city council shall hear all evidence and relevant testimony and may uphold, modify or vacate the penalty. The city council's decision on the imposition of a penalty shall be final. 
(Ord. No. 1379, § 2 (part).) 
5.18.050 - City response to state video franchise applications. 
A.  Applicants for state video franchises within the boundaries of the city must concurrently provide complete copies to the city of any application or amendments to applications filed with the California Public Utilities Commission (PUC). One complete copy must be provided to the city manager. 
B.  Within thirty days of receipt, the city manager will provide any appropriate comments to the PUC regarding an application or an amendment to an application for a state video franchise.

The payment of a late fee shall not be grounds for a defense against prosecution or enforcement of this Code on the basis that the permittee operated a cannabis business without a valid or unexpired permit nor shall it be considered as a setoff to any assessment, fine, penalty or recoupment of costs of enforcement attributable to said violation. 
E.  The city manager, in consultation with the chief of police, shall evaluate the renewal application and determine whether to renew the permit based on the criteria set forth in section 5.33.050. In addition, the city manager, in consultation with the chief of police, shall evaluate whether the premises is substantially different from the diagram submitted by the applicant, in that the size, layout, location of common entryways, doorways or passage ways, means of public entry or exit, or limited access areas within the premises is not the same. If the premises is substantially different, the city manager may deny the renewal application. Review of any decision by the city manager to deny a request to renew a permit shall be pursuant to section 5.33.130.

(d)  Evaluation Report. If a prevention plan was in place the previous year, a report shall be submitted to the city evaluating the measures that were used and approved in the prior calendar year. The report shall include, but not be limited to, the inventory of carts owned/used by the business establishment and the number of carts that had to be replaced due to loss, theft or abandonment. 
G.  Prevention Plan/Evaluation Report Timelines and Approval Process. 
(a)  Existing Owners. The proposed prevention plan for preventing cart removal shall be submitted for approval to the city manager or his/her designee within thirty days of receiving notice from the city that such a plan is required pursuant to this chapter.

Chapter 5.60 - SURFACE MINING AND RECLAMATION* 

5.60.010 - Purpose and intent. 
    The city recognizes that the extraction of minerals is essential to the continued economic well-being of the city and to the needs of society and that the reclamation of mined lands is necessary to prevent or minimize adverse effects on the environment and to protect the public health and safety. The city also recognizes that surface mining takes place in diverse areas where the geologic, topographic, climatic, biological and social conditions are significantly different and that reclamation operations and the specifications therefor may vary accordingly. 
    The purpose and intent of this chapter is to ensure the continued availability of important mineral resources, while regulating surface mining operations as required by California's Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975 (Public Resources Code Sections 2710 et seq.), as amended, hereinafter referred to as "SMARA," Public Resources Code (PRC) Section 2207 (relating to annual reporting requirements), and State Mining and Geology Board regulations (hereinafter referred to as "state regulations") for surface mining and reclamation practice (California Code of Regulations (CCR), Title 14, Division 2, Chapter 8, Subchapter 1, Sections 3500 et seq.), to ensure that: 
A.  Adverse environmental effects are prevented or minimized and that mined lands are reclaimed to a usable condition which is readily adaptable for alternative land uses; 
B.  The production and conservation of minerals are encouraged, while giving consideration to values relating to recreation, watershed, wildlife, range and forage, and aesthetic enjoyment; 
C.  Residual hazards to the public health and safety are eliminated. 
(Code 1965, § 22B-1.) 
5.60.020 - Definitions. 
    The definitions set forth in this section shall govern the construction of this chapter. 
    "Area of regional significance" means an area designated by the State Mining and Geology Board which is known to contain a deposit of minerals, the extraction of which is judged to be of prime importance in meeting future needs for minerals in a particular region of the state within which the minerals are located and which, if prematurely developed for alternate incompatible land uses, could result in the premature loss of minerals that are of more than local significance. 
    "Area of statewide significance" means an area designated by the board which is known to contain a deposit of minerals, the extraction of which is judged to be of prime importance in meeting future needs for minerals in the state and which, if prematurely developed for alternate incompatible land uses, could result in the permanent loss of minerals that are of more than local or regional significance. 
    "Borrow pits" means excavations created by the surface mining of rock, unconsolidated geologic deposits or soil to provide material (borrow) for fill elsewhere. 
    "Compatible land uses" means land uses inherently compatible with mining and/or that require a minimum public or private investment in structures, land improvements, and which may allow mining because of the relative economic value of the land and its improvements. Examples of such uses may include, but shall not be limited to, very low density residential, geographically extensive but low impact industrial, recreational, agricultural, silvicultural, grazing, and open space. 
    "Haul road" means a road along which material is transported from the area of excavation to the processing plant or stockpile area of the surface mining operation. 
    "Idle" means surface mining operations curtailed for a period of one year or more, by more than ninety percent of the operation's previous maximum annual mineral production, with the intent to resume those surface mining operations at a future date. 
    "Incompatible land uses" means land uses inherently incompatible with mining and/or that require public or private investment in structures, land improvements and landscaping and that may prevent mining because of the greater economic value of the land and its improvements. Examples of such uses may include, but shall not be limited to, high density residential, low density residential with high unit value, public facilities, geographically limited but impact intensive industrial, and commercial. 
    "Mined lands" means the surface, subsurface and groundwater of an area in which surface mining operations will be, are being, or have been conducted, including private ways and roads appurtenant to any such area, land excavations, workings, mining waste, and areas in which structures, facilities, equipment, machines, tools or other materials or property which result from, or are used in, surface mining operations are located. 
    "Minerals" means any naturally occurring chemical element or compound, or groups of elements and compounds, formed from inorganic processes and organic substances, including, but not limited to, coal, peat and bituminous rock, but excluding geothermal resources, natural gas and petroleum. 
    "Operator" means any person who is engaged in surface mining operations, or who contracts with others to conduct operations on his or her behalf, except a person who is engaged in surface mining operations as an employee with wages as his or her sole compensation. 
    "Reclamation" means the combined process of land treatment that minimizes water degradation, air pollution, damage to aquatic or wildlife habitat, flooding, erosion, and other adverse effects from surface mining operations, including adverse surface effects incidental to underground mines, so that mined lands are reclaimed to a usable condition which is readily adaptable for alternate land uses and create no danger to public health or safety. The process may extend to affected lands surrounding mined lands, and may require backfilling, grading, resoiling, revegetation, soil compaction, stabilization or other measures. 
    "Stream bed skimming" means excavation of sand and gravel from streambed deposits above the mean summer water level or stream bottom, whichever is higher. 
    "Surface mining operations" means all, or any part of, the process involved in the mining of minerals on mined lands by removing overburden and mining directly from the mineral deposits, open-pit mining of minerals naturally exposed, mining by the auger method, dredging and quarrying, or surface work incident to an underground mine. Surface mining operations include, but are not limited to, inplace distillation or retorting or leaching, the production and disposal of mining waste, prospecting and exploratory activities, borrow pitting, streambed skimming, and segregation and stockpiling of mined materials (and recovery of same). 
(Code 1965, § 22B-2.) 
5.60.030 - Incorporation by reference. 
    The provisions of SMARA (PRC Section 2710 et seq.), PRC Section 2207, and state regulations CCR Section 3500 et seq., as those provisions and regulations may be amended from time to time, are made a part of this chapter by reference with the same force and effect as if the provisions therein were specifically and fully set out in this chapter, excepting that when the provisions of this chapter are more restrictive than correlative state provisions, this chapter shall prevail. 
(Code 1965, § 22B-3.) 
5.60.040 - Scope. 
    Except as provided in this chapter, no person shall conduct surface mining operations unless a permit, reclamation plan, and financial assurances for reclamation have first been approved by the city. Any applicable exemption from this requirement does not automatically exempt a project or activity from the application of other regulations, ordinances or policies of the city, including but not limited to, the application of CEQA, the requirement of site approvals or other permits, the payment of development impact fees, or the imposition of other dedications and exactions as may be permitted under the law. The provisions of this chapter shall apply to all lands within the city, public and private. 
    This chapter shall not apply to the following activities, subject to the above-referenced exceptions: 
A.  Excavations or grading conducted for farming or on-site construction or for the purpose of restoring land following a flood or natural disaster; 
B.  On-site excavation and on-site earthmoving activities which are an integral and necessary part of a construction project that are undertaken to prepare a site for construction of structures, landscaping or other land improvements, including the related excavation, grading, compaction, or the creation of fills, road cuts, and embankments, whether or not surplus materials are exported from the site, subject to all of the following conditions: 
1.  All required permits for the construction, landscaping or related land improvements have been approved by a public agency in accordance with applicable provisions of state law and locally adopted plans and ordinances, including, but not limited to, the California Environmental Quality Act (CEQA, Public Resources Code, Division 13, Section 21000 et seq.), 
2.  The city's approval of the construction project included consideration of the on-site excavation and on-site earthmoving activities pursuant to CEQA, 
3.  The approved construction project is consistent with the general plan or zoning of the site, 
4.  Surplus materials shall not be exported from the site unless and until actual construction work has commenced and shall cease if it is determined that construction activities have terminated, have been indefinitely suspended, or are no longer being actively pursued; 
C.  Operation of a plant site used for mineral processing, including associated on-site structures, equipment, machines, tools or other materials, including the on-site stockpiling and on-site recovery of mined materials, subject to all of the following conditions: 
1.  The plant site is located on lands designated for industrial or commercial uses in the city's general plan, 
2.  The plant site is located on lands zoned industrial or commercial, or is contained within a zoning category intended exclusively for industrial activities by the city, 
3.  None of the minerals being processed are being extracted on-site, 
4.  All reclamation work has been completed pursuant to the approved reclamation plan for any mineral extraction activities that occurred on-site after January 1, 1976; 
D.  Prospecting for, or the extraction of, minerals for commercial purposes and the removal of overburden in total amounts of less than one thousand cubic yards in any one location of one acre or less. 
E.  Surface mining operations that are required by federal law in order to protect a mining claim, if those operations are conducted solely for that purpose; 
F.  Any other surface mining operations that the State Mining and Geology Board determines to be of an infrequent nature and which involve only minor surface disturbances; 
G.  The solar evaporation of seawater or bay water for the production of salt and related minerals; 
H.  Emergency excavations or grading conducted by the department of water resources or the reclamation board for the purpose of averting, alleviating, repairing or restoring damage to property due to imminent or recent floods, disasters or other emergencies; 
I.  Road construction and maintenance for timber or forest operations if the land is owned by the same person or entity, and if the excavation is conducted adjacent to timber or forest operation roads. This exemption is only available if slope stability and erosion are controlled in accordance with board regulations and, upon closure of the site, the person closing the site implements, where necessary, revegetation measures and postclosure uses in consultation with the department of forestry and fire protection. This exemption does not apply to on-site excavation or grading that occurs within one hundred feet of a Class One watercourse or seventy-five feet of a Class Two watercourse, or to excavations for materials that are, or have been, sold for commercial purposes. 
(Code 1965, § 22B-4.) 
5.60.050 - Vested rights. 
    No person who obtained a vested right to conduct surface mining operations prior to January 1, 1976, shall be required to secure a permit to mine, so long as the vested right continues and as long as no substantial changes have been made in the operation except in accordance with SMARA, state regulations, and this chapter. Where a person with vested rights has continued surface mining in the same area subsequent to January 1, 1976, he shall obtain city approval of a reclamation plan covering the mined lands disturbed by such subsequent surface mining. In those cases where an overlap exists (in the horizontal and/or vertical sense) between pre- and post-Act mining, the reclamation plan shall call for reclamation proportional to that disturbance caused by the mining after the effective date of the Act (January 1, 1976). 
    All other requirements of State law and this chapter shall apply to vested mining operations. 
(Code 1965, § 22B-5.) 
5.60.060 - Process. 
A.  Applications for a site approval or reclamation plan for surface mining or land reclamation projects shall be made on forms provided by the planning department. Such application shall be filed in accord with this chapter and procedures to be established by the community development director. The forms for reclamation plan applications shall require, at a minimum, each of the elements required by SMARA (Sections 2772 through 2773) and state regulations, and any other requirements deemed necessary to facilitate an expeditious and fair evaluation of the proposed reclamation plan, to be established at the discretion of the community development director. As many copies of the site approval application as may be required by the community development director shall be submitted to the planning department. 
B.  As many copies of a reclamation plan application as may be required shall be submitted in conjunction with all applications for site approvals for surface mining operations. For surface mining operations that are exempt from a site approval pursuant to this chapter, the reclamation plan application shall include information concerning the mining operation that is required for processing the reclamation plan. All documentation for the reclamation plan shall be submitted to the city at one time. 
C.  Applications shall include all required environmental review forms and information prescribed by the community development director or his or her designee. 
D.  Upon completion of the environmental review procedure and filing of all documents required by the community development director, consideration of the site approval or reclamation plan for the proposed or existing surface mine shall be completed pursuant to this section at a public hearing before the planning commission, and pursuant to Section 2774 of the Public Resources Code. 
E.  Within thirty days of acceptance of an application for a site approval for surface mining operations and/or a reclamation plan as complete, the planning department shall notify the State Department of Conservation of the filing of the application(s). Whenever mining operations are proposed in the one-hundred-year flood plain of any stream, as shown in Zone A of the Flood Insurance Rate Maps issued by the Federal Emergency Management Agency, and within one mile, upstream or downstream, of any state highway bridge, the planning department shall also notify the State Department of Transportation that the application has been received. 
F.  The planning department shall process the application(s) through environmental review pursuant to the California Environmental Quality Act (Public Resources Code Sections 21000 et seq.) and the city's environmental review guidelines. 
G.  Subsequent to the appropriate environmental review, the planning department shall prepare a staff report with recommendations for consideration by the planning commission. 
H.  The planning commission shall hold at least one noticed public hearing on the site approval and/or reclamation plan. 
I.  Prior to final approval of a reclamation plan, financial assurances (as provided in this chapter), or any amendments to the reclamation plan or existing financial assurances, the planning commission shall certify to the State Department of Conservation that the reclamation plan and/or financial assurance complies with the applicable requirements of state law, and submit the plan, assurance or amendments to the state department of conservation for review. The planning commission may conceptually approve the reclamation plan and financial assurance before submittal to the State Department of Conservation. If a site approval is being processed concurrently with the reclamation plan, the planning commission may simultaneously also conceptually approve the site approval. However, the planning commission may defer action on the site approval until taking final action on the reclamation plan and financial assurances. If necessary to comply with permit processing deadlines, the planning commission may conditionally approve the site approval with the condition that the planning department shall not issue the site approval for the mining operations until cost estimates for financial assurances have been reviewed by the State Department of Conservation and final action has been taken on the reclamation plan and financial assurances. 
    Pursuant to PRC Section 2774(d), the State Department of Conservation shall be given thirty days to review and comment on the reclamation plan and forty-five days to review and comment on the financial assurance. The planning commission shall evaluate written comments received, if any, from the State Department of Conservation during the comment periods. Staff shall prepare a written response describing the disposition of the major issues raised by the state for the planning commission's approval. In particular, when the planning commission's position is at variance with the recommendations and objections raised in the state's comments, the written response shall address, in detail, why specific comments and suggestions were not accepted. Copies of any written comments received and responses prepared by the planning commission shall be promptly forwarded to the operator/applicant. 
J.  The planning commission shall then take action to approve, conditionally approve, or deny the site approval and/or reclamation plan, and to approve the financial assurances pursuant to PRC Section 2770(d). 
K.  The planning department shall forward a copy of each approved site approval for mining operations and/or approved reclamation plan, and a copy of the approved financial assurances to the State Department of Conservation. By July 1st of each year, the planning department shall submit to the State Department of Conservation for each active or idle mining operation a copy of the site approval or reclamation plan amendments, as applicable, or a statement that there have been no changes during the previous year. 
(Code 1965, § 22B-6.) 
5.60.070 - Standards for reclamation. 
A.  All reclamation plans shall comply with the provisions of SMARA (Sections 2772 and 2773) and state regulations (CCR Sections 3500 through 3505). Reclamation plans approved after January 15, 1993, reclamation plans for proposed new mining operations, and any substantial amendments to previously approved reclamation plans, shall also comply with the requirements for reclamation performance standards (CCR Sections 3700 through 3713). 
B.  The city may impose additional performance standards as developed either in review of individual projects, as warranted, or through the formulation and adoption of citywide performance standards. 
C.  Reclamation activities shall be initiated at the earliest possible time on those portions of the mined lands that will not be subject to further disturbance. Interim reclamation may also be required for mined lands that have been disturbed and that may be disturbed again in future operations. Reclamation may be done on an annual basis, in stages compatible with continuing operations, or on completion of all excavation, removal, or fill, as approved by the city. Each phase of reclamation shall be specifically described in the reclamation plan and shall include: (1) the beginning and expected ending dates for each phase; (2) all reclamation activities required; (3) criteria for measuring completion of specific reclamation activities; and (4) estimated costs for completion of each phase of reclamation. 
(Code 1965, § 22B-7.) 
5.60.080 - Statement of responsibility. 
    The person submitting the reclamation plan shall sign a statement accepting responsibility for reclaiming the mined lands in accordance with the reclamation plan. Such statement shall be kept by the planning department in the mining operation's permanent record. Upon sale or transfer of the operation, the new operator shall submit a signed statement of responsibility to the planning department for placement in the permanent record. 
(Code 1965, § 22B-8.) 
5.60.090 - Findings for approval. 
A.  Site Approvals. In addition to any findings required by this Code, site approvals for surface mining operations shall include a finding that the project complies with the provisions of SMARA and state regulations. 
B.  Reclamation Plans. For reclamation plans, the following findings shall be required: 
1.  That the reclamation plan complies with SMARA Sections 2772 and 2773, and any other applicable provisions; 
2.  That the reclamation plan complies with applicable requirements of state regulations (CCR Sections 3500 through 3505, and Sections 3700 through 3713); 
3.  That the reclamation plan and potential use of reclaimed land pursuant to the plan are consistent with this chapter and the city's general plan and any applicable resource plan or element; 
4.  That the reclamation plan has been reviewed pursuant to CEQA and the city's environmental review guidelines, and all significant adverse impacts from reclamation of the surface mining operations are mitigated to the maximum extent feasible; 
5.  That the land and/or resources such as water bodies to be reclaimed will be restored to a condition that is compatible with, and blends in with, the surrounding natural environment, topography and other resources, or that suitable off-site development will compensate for related disturbance to resource values; 
6.  That the reclamation plan will restore the mined lands to a usable condition which is readily adaptable for alternative land uses consistent with the general plan and applicable resource plan; 
7.  That a written response to the State Department of Conservation has been prepared, describing the disposition of major issues raised by that department. Where the city's position is at variance with the recommendations and objections raised by the State Department of Conservation, such response shall address, in detail, why specific comments and suggestions were not accepted. 
(Code 1965, § 22B-9.) 
5.60.100 - Financial assurances. 
A.  To ensure that reclamation will proceed in accordance with the approved reclamation plan, the city shall require as a condition of approval security which will be released upon satisfactory performance. The applicant may pose security in the form of a surety bond, trust fund, irrevocable letter of credit from an accredited financial institution, or other method acceptable to the city and the State Mining and Geology Board as specified in state regulations, and which the city reasonably determines are adequate to perform reclamation in accordance with the surface mining operation's approved reclamation plan. Financial assurances shall be made payable to the City of Banning and the State Department of Conservation. 
B.  Financial assurances will be required to ensure compliance with elements of the reclamation plan, including but not limited to, revegetation and landscaping requirements, restoration of aquatic or wildlife habitat, restoration of water bodies and water quality, slope stability and erosion and drainage control, disposal of hazardous materials, and other measures, if necessary. 
C.  Cost estimates for the financial assurance shall be submitted to the planning department for review and approval prior to the operator securing financial assurances. The community development director shall forward a copy of the cost estimates, together with any documentation received supporting the amount of the cost estimates, to the State Department of Conservation for review. If the State Department of Conservation does not comment within forty-five days of receipt of these estimates, it shall be assumed that the cost estimates are adequate, unless the city has reason to determine that additional costs may be incurred. The community development director shall have the discretion to approve the financial assurance if it meets the requirements of this chapter, SMARA, and state regulations. 
D.  The amount of the financial assurance shall be based upon the estimated costs of reclamation for the years or phases stipulated in the approved reclamation plan, including any maintenance of reclaimed areas as may be required, subject to adjustment for the actual amount required to reclaim lands disturbed by surface mining activities since January 1, 1976, and new lands to be disturbed by surface mining activities in the upcoming year. Cost estimates should be prepared by a California registered professional engineer and/or other similarly licensed and qualified professionals retained by the operator and approved by the community development director. The estimated amount of the financial assurance shall be based on an analysis of physical activities necessary to implement the approved reclamation plan, the unit costs for each of these activities, the number of units of each of these activities, and the actual administrative costs. Financial assurances to ensure compliance with revegetation, restoration of water bodies, restoration of aquatic or wildlife habitat, and any other applicable element of the approved reclamation plan shall be based upon cost estimates that include but may not be limited to labor, equipment, materials, mobilization of equipment, administration and reasonable profit by a commercial operator other than the permittee. A contingency factor of ten percent shall be added to the cost of financial assurances. 
E.  In projecting the costs of financial assurances, it shall be assumed without prejudice or insinuation that the surface mining operation could be abandoned by the operator and, consequently, the city or State Department of Conservation may need to contract with a third party commercial company for reclamation of the site. 
F.  The financial assurances shall remain in effect for the duration of the surface mining operation and any additional period until reclamation is completed (including any maintenance required). 
G.  The amount of financial assurances required of a surface mining operation for any one year shall be adjusted annually to account for new lands disturbed by surface mining operations, inflation and reclamation of lands accomplished in accordance with the approved reclamation plan. The financial assurances shall include estimates to cover reclamation for existing conditions and anticipated activities during the upcoming year, excepting that the permittee may not claim credit for reclamation scheduled for completion during the coming year. 
H.  Revisions to financial assurances shall be submitted to the community development director each year prior to the anniversary date for approval of the financial assurances. The financial assurance shall cover the cost of existing disturbance and anticipated activities for the next calendar year, including any required interim reclamation. If revisions to the financial assurances are not required, the operator shall explain, in writing, why revisions are not required. 
(Code 1965, § 22B-10.) 
5.60.110 - Interim management plans. 
A.  Within ninety days of a surface mining operation becoming idle, the operator shall submit to the planning department a proposed interim management plan (IMP).

    In accordance with PRC Section 2762, the city's general plan and resource maps will be updated to reflect mineral information (classification and/or designation reports) within twelve months of receipt from the State Mining and Geology Board of such information. Land use decisions within the city will be guided by information provided on the location of identified mineral resources of regional significance. Conservation and potential development of identified mineral resource areas will be considered and encouraged.

Chapter 5.72 - TOBACCO SALES 

5.72.010 - Preamble. 
    Prior to the adoption of the ordinance codified in this chapter, the city council reviewed the following statistics: 
A.  Minors obtain cigarettes and other tobacco products at alarming rates. Each year, an estimated nine hundred twenty-four million packs of cigarettes are consumed by minors twelve to seventeen years of age, yielding the tobacco industry four hundred eighty million dollars in profits from underage smokers nationwide. In Riverside County, ten thousand teens light up for the first time and purchase five million packs of cigarettes a year. 
B.  In a 2004 California youth-buying survey, twelve percent of retailers surveyed unlawfully sold tobacco product to minors. 
C.  The rate of tobacco sales to minors in Riverside County is one of the highest in the state at forty-four percent. 
D.  Eighty-eight percent of adults who have ever smoked tried their first cigarette by the age of eighteen, and the average age at which smokers try their first cigarette is fourteen and one-half. 
E.  A requirement for a tobacco retailer license will not unduly burden legitimate business activities of retailers who sell or distribute cigarettes or other tobacco products to adults. It will, however, allow the city to regulate the operation of lawful businesses to discourage violations of federal, state, and local tobacco-related laws. 
F.  Sixty-five percent of California's key opinion leaders surveyed support implementation of tobacco-licensing requirements. 
(Code 1965, § 12-280; Ord. No. 1349, § 1 (part).) 
5.72.020 - Purpose and intent. 
    The City of Banning has a substantial interest in promoting compliance with federal, state, and local laws intended to regulate tobacco sales and use in discouraging the illegal purchase of tobacco products by minors; in promoting compliance with laws prohibiting sales of cigarettes and tobacco products to minors, and finally, and most importantly, in protecting children from being lured into illegal activity through the misconduct of adults. It is the intent of this chapter to encourage responsible tobacco retailing and to discourage violations of tobacco-related laws, especially those that prohibit or discourage the sale of distribution of tobacco products to minors, but not to expand or reduce the degree to which the acts regulated by federal and state law are criminally proscribed or to alter the penalty provided therefor. 
(Code 1965, § 12-281; Ord. No. 1349, § 1 (part).)

    "Arm's length transaction" shall mean: a sale in good faith and for valuable consideration that reflects the fair market value in the open market between two informed and willing parties, neither under any compulsion to participate in the transaction. A sale between relatives, related companies or partners, or a sale for the primary purpose of avoiding the effect of the violations of this chapter is presumed not be an arm's length transaction. 
    "Department" shall mean: city manager or his or her designee. 
    "Person" shall mean: any natural person, partnership, cooperative association, corporation, personal representative, receiver, trustee, assignee, or any other legal entity.

A managerial interest shall be deemed to exist when a person can or does have, or can or does share, ultimate control over the day-to-day operations of a business. 
    "Self-service display" shall mean: the open display of tobacco products or tobacco paraphernalia in a manner that is accessible to the general public without the assistance of the retailer or employee of the retailer. A vending machine is a form of self-service display. 
    "Smoking" shall mean: possessing a lighted tobacco product, tobacco paraphernalia, or any other weed or plant (including a lighted pipe, lighted cigar, or lighted cigarette of any kind), the lighting of a tobacco product, tobacco paraphernalia, or any other weed or plant (including a pipe, cigar, or cigarette of any kind). 
    "Tobacco paraphernalia" shall mean: cigarette papers or wrappers, pipes, holders of smoking materials of all types, cigarette rolling machines, and any other item designed for the smoking, preparation, storing, or consumption of tobacco products. 
    "Tobacco product" shall mean: (1) any substance containing tobacco leaf, including but not limited to cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, snuff, chewing tobacco, dipping tobacco, bid is, or any other preparation of tobacco; and (2) any product or formulation of matter containing biologically active amounts of nicotine that is manufactured, sold, offered for sale, or otherwise distributed with the expectation that the product of matter will be introduced into the human body but does not include any product specifically approved by the Federal Food and Drug Administration for use in treating nicotine or tobacco product dependence. 
    "Tobacco retailer" shall mean: any person who sells, offers for sale, or does or offers to exchange for any form of consideration, tobacco, tobacco products, or tobacco paraphernalia: "tobacco retailing" shall mean the doing of any of these things. This definition is without regard to the quantity of tobacco, tobacco products, or tobacco paraphernalia sold, offered for sale, exchanged, or offered for exchange.

C.  Nothing in this chapter shall be construed to grant any person obtaining and maintaining a tobacco retailer's license any status or right other then the right to act as a tobacco retailer at the location in the city identified on the face of the license. For example, nothing in this chapter shall be construed to render inapplicable, supercede, or apply in lieu of any other provision of applicable law, including, without limitation, any condition or limitation on smoking in enclosed places of employment made applicable to business establishments by California Labor Code section 6404.5. 
D.  Application for a tobacco retailer's license shall be submitted in the name of each proprietor proposing to conduct retail tobacco sales and shall be signed by each proprietor or an authorized agent thereof.

A license that is issued in error or on the basis of false or misleading information supplied by a proprietor shall be revoked pursuant to Section 5.72.100 of this chapter. 
E.  In addition to any other penalty under this chapter a person found to have engaged in tobacco retailing without a valid tobacco retailers license shall be ineligible to apply for or be issued a tobacco retailing license according to the following:

Chapter 5.76 - ADULT-ORIENTED BUSINESS LICENSES 

5.76.010 - Purpose and intent. 
    It is the purpose and intent of this chapter to license the owners of adult-oriented businesses to promote the health, safety and general welfare of the citizens of the city. The provisions of this chapter have neither the purpose nor effect of imposing a limitation or restriction on the content of any communicative materials or expressive conduct that is protected by the First Amendment of the United States Constitution or the relevant provisions of the California State Constitution. 
A.  The public health, safety and welfare of the City of Banning and its residents require the enactment of the ordinance codified in this chapter and such operating standards for adult businesses in order to: (1) mitigate and reduce the judicially recognized potential adverse secondary effects of adult businesses, including but not limited to crime, the prevention of blight in neighborhoods and the increased threat of the spread of sexually transmitted diseases; (2) protect the quality of life and neighborhoods in the city, the city's retail and commercial trade, and local property values, and minimize the potential for nuisances related to the operation of adult businesses; and (3) protect the peace, welfare and privacy of persons who own, operate and/or patronize adult businesses. 
B.  The city council, in adopting the ordinance codified in this chapter, takes legislative notice of the existence and content of the following studies concerning the adverse secondary effects of adult businesses in other cities: Garden Grove, California (1991); Tucson, Arizona (1990); Seattle, Washington, Department of Construction and Land Use (1989); Austin, Texas, Office of Land Development Services (1986); Oklahoma City, Oklahoma (1986); Indianapolis, Indiana, Department of Metropolitan Development (1984); Houston, Texas, City Council Report (1997); Beaumont, Texas (1982); Minnesota Crime Prevention Center, Inc., Minneapolis (1980); Phoenix, Arizona (1979); Los Angeles, California, Department of City Planning (1977); Amarillo, Texas, Planning Department (1977); and Cleveland, Ohio (1977); New York, New York (1994); Newport News, Virginia (1996); Times Square, New York City (1994); and Whittier, California (1978). The city council finds that these studies are relevant to the problems addressed by the city in enacting the ordinance codified in this chapter to regulate the adverse secondary effects of adult businesses and more specifically finds that these studies provide convincing evidence that: 
1.  There is substantial evidence that an increase in crime tends to accompany, concentrate around, and be aggravated by adult businesses, including but not limited to an increase in the crimes of narcotics distribution and use, prostitution, pandering, and violence against persons and property. The studies from other cities establish by convincing evidence that adult businesses that are not regulated as to operating standards often have a deleterious effect on nearby businesses and residential areas, causing, among other adverse secondary effects, an increase in crime and a decrease in property values; 
2.  Regulations for adult businesses should be developed to prevent deterioration and/or degradation of the vitality of the community before the problem exists, rather that waiting for problems to be created. 
    In developing the ordinance codified in this chapter, the city council is mindful of legal principles relating to regulation of adult businesses, and the city council does not intend to suppress or infringe upon any expressive activities protected by the First Amendment of the United States and California Constitutions but instead desires to enact reasonable time, place, and manner regulations that address the adverse secondary effects of adult businesses. The city council has considered decisions of the United States Supreme Court regarding local regulation of adult businesses, including but not limited to: City of Los Angeles v. Alameda Books, 535 U.S. 425, 122 S.Ct. 1728 (2002); City of Erie v. Pap's A.M. ("Kandyland"), 529 U.S. 277, 120 S.Ct. 1382, 146 L.Ed.2d 265 (2000); Barnes v.

Title 8 - HEALTH AND SAFETY 
Chapter 8.04 - ABANDONED GAS STATIONS 

8.04.010 - Purpose. 
    The city council declares that its purpose in adopting this chapter is to eliminate public nuisances that are created when service stations are unused for long periods of time. 
(Code 1965, § 11C-70.) 
8.04.020 - Definitions. 
    For the purposes of enforcement of this chapter the following definitions shall apply and shall supersede all other definitions in this Code inconsistent herewith. 
    "Automotive service station" is defined as: 
1.  A retail place of business engaged primarily in the sale of motor fuels and lubricants, but also in supplying goods and service generally required in the operating and maintenance of automotive vehicles and the fulfilling of motorist's needs, all as described in Title 17 of this Code; 
2.  Any site where the buildings are designed and built for dispensing and selling fuels for internal combustion engines of any automotive vehicles; 
3.  Any "building" which has been lawfully or unlawfully converted to use for a purpose not related to use as an automotive service station. 
    "Building" shall mean any physical improvement or structure, finished or unfinished, on or in real property, which building is designed, built, or adapted for use as or in connection with an automotive service station, regardless of its size, shape, height, location, age or state of repair. "Building" shall include all main buildings, out buildings, pumps, pump islands, underground storage tanks, mechanical equipment, wells, cesspools, septic tanks, foundations, paving, signs and any other materials placed in connection therewith on or at any depth beneath the surface of the real property. 
    "Nonuse" shall mean: 
1.  All of the subsurface tanks have been filled or removed, or are required to be filled or removed under law; 
2.  If the tanks have been filled or removed as required and the remaining buildings have been lawfully converted to a permitted use within the zone prior to such filling or removal, "nonuse" shall commence sixty days following date of abandonment of such converted use. 
    "Abandonment" shall be deemed to have occurred upon: 
a.  The cessation in the building(s) of activity permitted by the zoning, 
b.  By the last person or persons conducting a lawful business in the building(s), 
c.  For which a business license has been issued by the city, 
d.  Use of the paved surfaces shall not be considered activity for purposes of this subsection. 
    Type II Construction. Noncombustible metal building. 
    Type V Construction. Combustible, frame and covering type building. 
    Vacant. As of the effective date of this chapter and/or thereafter, the structures designed and intended for use as an automotive services station on the premises has been vacant for six months or longer. 
    Occupied. As of effective date of this chapter and/or thereafter, the structures designed and intended for use as an automotive service station contain the primary use on the premises in which business is being conducted. 
    Immediate Removal. Defined as ninety days from the effective date of this chapter. 
(Code 1965, § 11C-73.) 
8.04.030 - Findings. 
    The city council finds and declares that: 
A.  The existence of closed, vacant and inoperative service stations, in a condition of "nonuse" as defined herein, has a direct, substantial and significant impact upon the aesthetic appearance of our city. There is, therefore, a need for further control over the lack of utilization, the condition and appearance of such facilities. 
B.  California law requires that underground storage tanks which are out of service for ninety days shall be safeguarded and those out of service for one year shall be removed from the ground in the manner required by law. When such actions are taken, or required to be taken, the associated service station is rendered unusable and is a "nonuse". 
C.  Absent an express showing to the contrary, it is hereby declared that closed, vacant and inoperative automobile service stations constituting a nonuse cannot be utilized for the purposes originally established because the condition of the tanks prevents or substantially hinders the economically viable use or capacity of the property in that the cost of restoring the tanks is inconsistent with any investment backed expectation of a reasonable return on investment from service station operations. 
D.  It is hereby declared that the existence of any closed, vacant and inoperative automobile service station site in a nonuse condition, is injurious and dangerous to the health, safety and welfare of this community in that such condition contributes to depreciated or stagnant property values, constitutes an abandoned building and a fire hazard and may be a parcel which is substandard with respect to current requirements for establishment of a service station within the city. Such properties are, therefore, an aesthetic and economic blight, and a contributing cause of decreasing value to the surrounding properties. Such nonuse service station also invites vandalism and illegal dumping and limits opportunity for proper development of the subject site and surrounding properties. 
E.  A service station may be a nonuse as defined herein, however, because of its conversion to a nonservice station use, and because of its present occupancy for such post-conversion use, the property may as of the effective date of this chapter provide an economic return to the current owner. Unless and until any such property is brought into compliance with the provisions of this chapter, such service stations are deemed to be a nuisance as set forth in subsection D of this section and subject to abatement under this chapter. 
(Code 1965, § 11C-71.) 
8.04.040 - Declaration of public nuisance. 
A.  The conditions heretofore described are encompassed within the meaning of nuisance under the law of the state of California and of this chapter. Such "nonuse" services stations are hereby declared to be a nuisance. All structures remaining on the site of a nonuse service station as defined herein are hereby declared to be a nuisance and are subject to abatement and penalty under the provisions of this chapter. 
B.  Anything contained in this chapter to the contrary notwithstanding, nonuse automobile service stations shall be subject to abatement pursuant to the following schedule: 
1.  Category I: (Type II construction, attached canopy): 
a.  Vacant. Immediate removal of canopy and all structures, 
b.  Occupied. One year to repair and bring up to code, subject to design review, or to remove structure and canopy. All structures shall be removed upon vacancy; 
2.  Category II: (Type II construction; detached canopy): 
a.  Vacant. Immediate removal of canopy and all structures, 
b.  Occupied. Immediate removal of canopy, and one year to repair and bring remaining structures up to code subject to design review or to remove structures. All structures shall be removed upon vacancy; 
3.  Category III: (Type V construction, attached canopy): 
a.  Vacant. Shall be immediately brought up to code subject to design review. Otherwise subject to abatement as for nonservice station structures, 
b.  Occupied. One year to repair and bring structures up to code subject to design review, property shall otherwise be subject to abatement as for nonservice station structures; 
4.  Category IV: (Type V construction, detached canopy): 
a.  Vacant. Immediate removal of canopy, and remaining structure shall be immediately brought up to code subject to design review, property shall otherwise be subject to abatement as for nonservice station structures. 
b.  Occupied. One year to repair and bring structures up to code subject to design review, property shall otherwise be subject to abatement as for nonservice station structures.

Chapter 8.12 - VACANT AND DISTRESSED BUILDINGS* 

8.12.010 - Purpose. 
    Vacant buildings are a major cause and source of blight in both residential and nonresidential neighborhoods, especially when the owner of the building fails to actively maintain and manage the building.

The purpose of this chapter is to establish uniform and reasonable regulations to prevent the immediate risks and detrimental effects associated with vacant and distressed residential properties. 
(Ord. No. 1394, § 1 (Exh. A) (part).)

    "Default" means the failure to fulfill a contractual obligation, monetary or conditional.

(Ord. No. 1394, § 1 (Exh. A) (part).) 
8.12.060 - Enforcement, violations and penalties.

In addition to any other remedies provided by law, any property owner or beneficiary/trustee who violates this chapter shall be liable for an administrative penalty in an amount not to exceed one thousand dollars ($1,000.00) for each calendar month, or portion thereof, the violation exists. The administrative penalty shall be waived if the building official or hearing officer finds that imposition of the penalty would cause a substantial economic hardship on the owner or would hinder the rehabilitation of the building. 
B.  Procedure. The administrative penalty shall be imposed by a hearing officer upon the recommendation of the building official and after the owner or trustee/beneficiary shall have been afforded a hearing before the hearing officer. The hearing shall be conducted in accordance with the provisions of Section 8.48.470 of this title. In setting the penalty, the hearing officer shall consider the severity of the blighting conditions of the property and the owner's efforts, or lack thereof, to remedy the problem. The decision of the hearing officer shall be final. 
1.  The administrative penalty shall be due and payable within thirty (30) days after the decision of the hearing officer. If the penalty is not paid within forty-five (45) days after the decision of the hearing officer, the city council may thereupon order that the penalty be a personal obligation of the property owner, the beneficiary/trustee or that it be specially assessed against the property involved. If the city council orders that the penalty be specially assessed against the property, it shall confirm the assessment and thereafter said assessment may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary real property taxes are collected and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary real property taxes. All laws applicable to the levy, collection, and enforcement of real property taxes are applicable to the special assessment. 
2.  The city council may also cause a notice of lien to be recorded. The notice shall, at a minimum, identify the record owner or possessor of the property and set forth the last known address of the record owner or possessor, the date on which the penalty was imposed, a description of the real property subject to the lien, and the amount of the penalty. 
C.  Nothing in either this chapter or any other provision of this Code shall prevent the City of Banning code enforcement division from engaging in efforts to obtain voluntary compliance by means of warnings, notices, educational programs, administrative citations or any other administrative remedy. 
D.  Payment of a penalty for violation of this chapter shall not excuse the failure to correct the violation nor shall it bar further enforcement action. 
E.  This section provides a civil penalty remedy that is in addition to all other legal remedies, criminal or civil, which may be pursued by the city to address any violation of this chapter. The administrative penalty imposed pursuant to the provisions of this section may be imposed concurrently with any administrative citation penalties imposed pursuant to Section 1.20.030 of this Code. 
(Ord. No. 1394, § 1 (Exh. A) (part).) 
8.12.070 - Additional authority.

(Ord. No. 1503, § 2, 12-12-16) 
Chapter 8.20 - FIREWORKS 

8.20.010 - Urgency findings-Purpose and intent. 
A.  Pursuant to the provisions of Government Code §§ 36934 and 36937, the city council of the City of Banning has determined that the provisions contained herein are necessary for the immediate preservation of the public peace, health or safety within the incorporated areas of the city. This determination is based on the following facts and circumstances: 
1.  While the city has always prohibited the personal use and sale of any fireworks within the city, persistent violations of this regulation continue, and the city has experienced a number of fireworks-related fires in the recent past, which have caused damage to personal property and threatened the lives and property of City residents. Historically, the sale, purchase, use, storage and disposal of fireworks have reached serious proportions in the city, endangering the public safety of its citizens such that stronger penalties are needed. The personal use and sale of illegal fireworks in the city are an immediate threat to the public peace, health and safety. 
2.  Illegal fireworks are a serious concern in the city for several reasons. First, fireworks are frequently sold to children. According to the U.S. Fire Administration, children under the age of fifteen suffered forty-five percent of all injuries from fireworks in 2003. Second, fireworks are often stored without precautions in residential neighborhoods. In March 2006, in Los Angeles County, a cache of illegally stored fireworks destroyed a Lakewood Home when the fireworks erupted in a massive explosion that knocked the house off its foundation and damage several houses and cars nearby. Third, fireworks can be disassembled for the explosive powder they contain, to make bombs and other explosive devices. Fourth and finally, many fireworks come from Mexico where safety regulations for making fireworks are not as stringent as for those fireworks manufactured in the United States, or those approved by the Office of the California State Fire Marshal. 
3.  It is well evident that illegal fireworks lead to hazardous situations, injuries, personal property loss and fires, which jeopardize the safety of the public and increase the cost of fire protection and law enforcement. Moreover, in light of the city's geographical location, the city is subject to extreme fire hazards due to topography, chaparral type vegetation and hot, dry and windy summer conditions as well as hot, dry Santa Ana wind conditions, making illegal fireworks activities extremely dangerous to all citizens of the city, and not just to those possessing and using illegal fireworks. 
4.  In the past two years, the Banning police department has responded to two hundred sixty-five fireworks related calls for service. This number does not reflect the number of calls handled by the fire department or the contacts made for fireworks violations where incident numbers were not generated. 
5.  The number of fires caused by fireworks in Riverside County has steadily increased in recent years. In 2003, sixty-three fires in the County were caused by fireworks. The number rose to seventy fires in 2004 and seventy-nine fires in 2005. 
6.  Even with enforcement and prosecution, the personal sale and use of fireworks is extremely difficult for local authorities to deter since the current penalties and fines for these illegal activities are minimal. There is a very lucrative "black market" for fireworks, often making the sale and manufacturing of illegal fireworks profitable despite the current penalties allowed for under city ordinances. The seizure of illegal fireworks is further complicated as public safety agencies are not currently funded to cover the full cost of the transport, storage and disposal of illegal fireworks after they are confiscated. 
7.  Immediate action is needed to increase the penalties for the use, sale, transportation, and manufacturing of fireworks in the city, to deter the continued illegal activities and preserve the public peace, health, safety and welfare. The provisions of this chapter shall apply in all of the incorporated areas of the city. 
(Ord. No. 1348, § 1.) 
8.20.020 - Definitions.

Such provisions, as amended by the State of California from time to time, are hereby incorporated by reference. Subject to the provisions under state law, and additional criteria established in this section and chapter 17.72, home occupation permits, homemade food operators may apply for approval from the City of Banning Home Occupation Permit as provided for in chapter 17.72 of the zoning ordinance. 
B.  Purpose. The purpose of this section is to establish and regulate homemade food operators and to set local requirements in addition to those required under the California Homemade Food Act for businesses to be conducted in a home kitchen. Such homemade food operations shall be accessory to a residential land use where such a use will clearly not be disruptive or alter the character or the appearance of the neighborhood. 
C.  Definitions. 
1.  "Cottage food operation" and/or "homemade food operation (HFO)" shall mean an enterprise with annual gross sales limits set forth under California Health and Safety Code Section 113758(a), operated by a homemade food operator having no more than one full-time equivalent employee, conducted within a private home kitchen where the homemade food operator resides, and where homemade food products are prepared or packaged for direct, indirect, or direct and indirect sales pursuant to Section 113758 of the California Health and Safety Code. A homemade food operation may engage in the following sales activity subject to approval from the health department: 
a.  Class A homemade food operations may engage only in direct sales of homemade food products from the homemade food operation or other direct sale venues such as temporary events. Door-to-door sales shall be prohibited. 
b.  Class B homemade food operators may engage in both direct and indirect sales of homemade food products such as a permitted third-party retail food facility. 
2.  "Cottage food operator" or "homemade food operator" shall mean an individual who owns or operates a homemade food operation in his or her private home kitchen. 
3.  "Cottage food product" or homemade food product" shall mean non-potentially hazardous foods and food products that do not require refrigeration to prevent bacteria growth and as otherwise defined in Section 113871 of the California Health and Safety Code. Pursuant to Section 114365.5(a) of the California Health and Safety Code, the health department shall adopt and post on its internet website a list of non-potentially hazardous foods that are approved for sale by a homemade food operation. 
4.  "Health department" shall mean the Riverside County Department of Environmental Health.

6.  "Private home kitchen" shall mean the kitchen described and authorized in the permit or registration for the homemade food operation and will be used for the preparation, packaging, storing, or handling of homemade food products and related ingredients, equipment, and attached rooms within the house that are used exclusively for storage. 
D.  Permit and business license required. Dwelling units may be used for business purposes when a business license, in conformance with chapter 17.72, and a home occupation permit have been issued. A home occupation permit shall be required for each business. If a business license for a homemade food operator is not renewed, the home occupation permit shall automatically expire with the business license. A fee for the processing of a home occupation permit may be established from time to time by resolution of the city council. 
E.  Issuance of permit. The community development director may, upon application, and payment of the required fee, issue a homemade food operator permit, with the conditions required in this section and the zoning ordinance and any time limitations that are deemed necessary. The permit shall not be issued unless the community development director is satisfied that the applicant will meet all the conditions listed in this section and chapter 17.72 of the zoning ordinance; and, the applicant has agreed in writing to comply with such conditions. The community development director may require a hearing for homemade food operators which the director determines potentially may not meet the purposes of this section. If a hearing is required it shall be in accordance with the requirements of section [chapter] 17.68 of the zoning ordinance. 
F.  Annual renewal fee required. An annual fee for the renewal of a home occupation permit may be established by resolution of the city council. The purpose of the renewal fee is to recover the cost of staff time to notify the health department regarding the continued use of the homemade food operation, and to determine whether or not the operator remains in compliance with city regulations and standards. 
G.  Limitations on homemade food operation permit. A maximum of one homemade food operation permit shall be deemed active and approved at any time for each private home. If more than one permit has been issued for the same private home, only the most recently approved application shall be deemed to be active. All other prior applications shall be deemed void. Such limitation shall not preclude a resident from also obtaining a home occupation permit pursuant to chapter 17.72, for a non-food related home-based business.

8.48.560 - Nuisance abatement. 
A.  The abatement of any public nuisance by the city as prescribed in this Code shall be at the sole expense of the persons creating, causing, committing or maintaining such nuisance.

B.  The prevailing party in any action, administrative proceeding or special procedure to abate a public nuisance pursuant to this section may recover its reasonable attorneys' fees in those individual actions or proceedings wherein the city elects, at the initiation of that individual action or proceeding, to seek recovery of its own attorneys' fees. In no action, administrative proceeding, or special proceeding shall an award of attorneys' fees to any prevailing party exceed the amount of reasonable attorneys' fees incurred by the city in the action or proceeding. 
C.  The city may collect the cost of abatement of any nuisance and related administrative costs, including but not limited to, inspection costs, investigation costs, attorneys' fees and costs, and costs to repair and eliminate all substandard conditions by either: (i) obtaining a court order stating that this reimbursement requirement is a personal obligation of any person held responsible for creating, causing, committing or maintaining a public nuisance, recoverable by the city in the same manner as any civil judgment; (ii) recording a nuisance abatement lien pursuant to this Code against the parcel of land on which the nuisance is maintained; or (iii) imposing a special assessment pursuant to this Code against the parcel of land on which the nuisance is maintained. 
(Code 1965, § 11C-48.) 
8.48.570 - Nuisance abatement lien. 
A.  Prior to the recordation of the lien against the parcel of land on which the nuisance is maintained, the owner of record of the parcel of land shall receive notice. The notice of the recordation of the lien against the parcel of land on which the nuisance is maintained shall be served on the owner of record of the parcel of land on which the nuisance is maintained, based on the last equalized assessment roll, or the supplemental roll, whichever is more current. Such notice shall be served in the same manner as a summons in a civil action in accordance with Sections 415.10 et seq., of the Code of Civil Procedure. The date upon which service is made shall be entered on or affixed to the face of the copy of the notice at the time of service. However, service of such notice without such date shall be valid and effective. 
B.  A nuisance abatement lien shall be recorded in the Riverside County recorder's office and from the date of recording shall have the force, effect, and priority of a judgment lien.

B.  Notice shall be given by certified mail, to the property owner, if the property owner's identity can be determined from the county assessor's or county recorder's records. Notice pursuant to this section shall be given at the time of imposing the assessment and shall specify that the property may be sold after three years by the tax collector for unpaid delinquent assessments. The tax collector's power of sale shall not be affected by the failure of the property owner to receive notice pursuant to this section. 
C.  The assessment may be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes are collected, and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for with ordinary municipal taxes. All laws applicable to the levy, collection and enforcement of municipal taxes shall be applicable to the special assessment. However, if any real property to which the cost of abatement relates has been transferred or conveyed to a bona fide purchaser for value, or if a lien of a bona fide encumbrancer for value has been created and attached thereon, prior to the date on which the first installment of the taxes would become delinquent, then the cost of abatement shall not result in a lien against the real property but instead shall be transferred to the unsecured roll for collection. 
D.  The city shall duly execute a report detailing the amount of the special assessment and shall send same to the tax division of the county auditor-controller's office, whereupon it shall be the duty of the auditor-controller to add the amounts of the respective assessments to the next regular tax bills levied against the respective lots and parcels of land for municipal purposes; and, thereafter, the amounts shall be collected at the same time and in the same manner as ordinary municipal taxes are collected, and shall be subject to the same penalties and the same procedure under foreclosure and sale in case of delinquency as provided for ordinary municipal taxes. 
E.  City may conduct a sale of vacant residential developed property for which the payment of that assessment is delinquent, subject to the requirements applicable to the sale of property pursuant to Section 3691 of the Revenue and Taxation Code.

A.  The abatement of any nuisance resulting from the defacement of the property of another by graffiti or any other inscribed material as prescribed in this Code shall be at the sole expense of the person, minor or other person creating, causing or committing the nuisance. 
B.  If the person creating, causing or committing the nuisance is a minor, the parent or guardian having custody and control of the minor shall be jointly and severally liable with the minor. The city shall make the expense of abatement of any nuisance, resulting from the defacement by a minor of the property of another by graffiti or any other inscribed material, a lien against the property of a parent or guardian having custody and control of the minor and/or a personal obligation against the parent or guardian having custody and control of the minor. 
C.  The prevailing party in any action, administrative proceeding or special procedure to abate a nuisance pursuant to this section may recover its reasonable attorneys' fees in those individual actions or proceedings wherein the city elects, at the initiation of that individual action or proceeding, to seek recovery of its own attorneys' fees.

D.  The city may collect the cost of abatement of any nuisance, resulting from the defacement of the property of another by graffiti or any other inscribed material, and related administrative costs by either: (1) obtaining a court order stating that this reimbursement requirement is a personal obligation of the minor or other person or parent or guardian having custody and control over the minor who committed the defacement, recoverable by the city in the same manner as any civil judgment; (2) recording a nuisance abatement lien against a parcel of land owned by the minor or other person or parent or guardian having custody and control over the minor who committed the defacement; or (3) making the cost of abatement of a nuisance resulting from the defacement of the property of another, a special assessment against a parcel of land owned by the minor or other person or parent or guardian having custody and control over the minor who committed the defacement. 
E.  Alternatively, the property owner of the property maintaining the graffiti nuisance may be liable for the expense of abatement. In such case, the expense of abatement of the graffiti nuisance may be a lien against the property on which it is maintained and a personal obligation against the property owner. 
F.  If the property owner maintaining the graffiti nuisance is liable for the expense of abatement, the property owner may request the city for a release from any lien and/or personal obligation for such expense upon showing proof that another person has been convicted of causing the graffiti nuisance on the property. For the purposes of this section, diversion of the offending violator to a community service program or a plea bargain to a lesser offense shall constitute a conviction. 
G.  The city manager or his designee shall keep an accounting of the cost, including incidental expenses, of abatement of such nuisance for each separate lot, or parcel of land where the work has been done and shall render an itemized report in writing to the city council showing the cost of abatement, including salvage value, if applicable, for each separate lot or parcel of land; provided, that before the report is submitted to the city council for approval, a copy of the same shall be posted for at least five days upon the premises or property upon which such building(s) or structure(s) were situated, together with a notice of the time when the report shall be submitted to the city council for confirmation; a copy of the report and notice shall be served upon minor or other person or parent or guardian having custody and control over the minor who committed the defacement, and the owner of the property, in accordance with Section 415.10 et seq. of the Code of Civil Procedure, at least five days prior to submitting the same to the council; proof of the posting and service shall be made by affidavit and filed with the city clerk of the city. The term "incidental expenses" includes, but is not limited to, the actual expenses and costs of the city in the preparation of notices, specifications and contracts, and in inspecting the work, and the costs of printing and mailings required under this chapter. 
H.  At the time and place fixed for receiving and considering the report, the city council shall hear and pass upon the report of the city manager or his designee, together with any objections or protests, which must be in writing, raised by any of the persons liable to be assessed for the cost of abating such nuisance. Thereupon the city council may make such revision, correction or modification to the report as it may deem just, after which, by resolution, the report as submitted, or as revised, corrected or modified, shall be confirmed; provided, that the hearing or consideration may be continued from time to time. The decision of the city council on all protests and objections which may be made shall be final and conclusive.

A graffiti nuisance abatement lien and the release of the lien shall be indexed in the grantor-grantee index. 
E.  A graffiti nuisance abatement lien may be satisfied through foreclosure in an action brought by the city. The city may recover from the property owner any costs incurred regarding the processing and recording of the lien and providing notice to the property owner as part of its foreclosure action to enforce the lien or as a condition of releasing the lien upon payment. 
(Code 1965, § 11C-49.3; Ord. No. 1436, § 2, 3-8-11) 
8.48.610 - Graffiti-Special assessment. 
A.  As an alternative to the recordation of a graffiti nuisance abatement lien, the city may make the cost of the abatement of any nuisance resulting from the defacement by a minor or other person of property of another by graffiti or other inscribed material, and related administrative costs, a special assessment against a parcel of land owned by the minor or other person or by the parent or guardian having custody and control of the minor, or the owner of the abated property on which the graffiti was maintained. 
B.

D.  Upon entry of a second or subsequent civil or criminal judgment within a two-year period finding a minor or other person or parent or guardian having custody and control of a minor responsible for a condition that may be abated as a nuisance pursuant to subsection A of this section, the court may order such minor or other person or parent or guardian having custody and control of such minor to pay treble the costs of the abatement.

Chapter 8.52 - RECYCLING 

8.52.010 - Purpose and intent. 
A.  Purpose. The purpose of this chapter is to: 
1.  Regulate the allocation of adequate space requirements for convenient space for collection, storage and loading of recycled material at "development projects" defined in Section 8.52.020; 
2.  Provide educational material to each development user about the importance of recycling and how to recycle; 
3.  Assist in providing the city with the means to divert fifty percent of solid waste disposed by January 1, 2000, partially through increased recycling of reusable materials, with the participation of the residential, commercial, industrial and public sectors; and 
4.  Provide that space in certain development projects be set aside to make future on-site composting projects possible. 
B.  Intent. The intent of this chapter is to eliminate barriers to recycling in the city in order to enable the city to reach waste reduction goals mandated by Assembly Bill 939 and space allocation requirements mandated by the California Solid Waste Reuse and Recycling Access Act of 1991 (AB1327), and to: 
1.  Lengthen the lifespan of the landfills and decrease the costs of hauling to landfills; 
2.  Encourage the reuse of recyclable material in order to reduce our reliance on and use of virgin materials; 
3.  Encourage each citizen's choice to dispose of solid waste responsibly; and 
4.  Decrease the impact of the citizens' consumption of renewable and nonrenewable materials on the environment. 
(Code 1965, § 11-51.) 
8.52.020 - Definitions. 
    As used in this chapter:

    "Development project" means any of the following: 
1.  A project for which a building permit is required for commercial, industrial, institutional buildings, or residential buildings having five or more living units, where solid waste is collected and loaded, and any residential project where solid waste is collected and loaded in a location serving five or more units; 
2.  Any new public facility where solid waste is collected and loaded and any improvements of a public facility used for collecting and loading solid waste; 
3.  Multi-Unit Residential Development. For the purposes of this chapter, the definition of a "multi-unit residential development" is limited to those multiple-unit residential developments with five or more units, (including mobile home parks) which will use communal bins (rather than individual curbside pickup) for collection of rubbish and recyclables from five or more units 
    Recyclable Material ("Recyclables"). For purposes of this chapter, "recyclable material" means the material including but not limited to metals, glass, plastic and paper, which are intended for reuse, remanufacture or reconstitution for the purpose of using the altered form. Recyclable material does not include refuse or hazardous waste. 
    Recycling. For purposes of this chapter, "recycling" is the series of activities by which discarded materials that would otherwise remain wastes are collected, separated or processed and used to make new products. 
    "Source separated curbside collection program" means a regularly scheduled collection of recyclables separated by the generator from a bin or bins set out at the curb separate from waste.

Chapter 9.24 - CURFEW 

9.24.010 - Curfew-Generally. 
A.  Recitals. 
    Whereas, there has recently been a significant increase in the incidence of graffiti and other forms of vandalism occurring in certain areas of the city and involving certain types of real property; and 
    Whereas, it has been determined that a significant portion of such increase is due to the activities of persons under the age of eighteen years between the hours of 10:00 P.M. and sunrise of the following day; and 
    Whereas, it is recognized that such activity is engaged in by only a small number of the persons in such age group and that the vast majority of such persons routinely go about their business in a lawful manner; and 
    Whereas, it is the determination of the city council that it is nevertheless necessary to restrict the activities of such persons in a limited manner in order to minimize the opportunities for the minority engaged in such violations to commit further action of graffiti and vandalism. 
    Now, therefore, the city council of the City of Banning adopts the restrictions and exceptions set forth in this section. 
B.  Restrictions. Except as otherwise set forth in this section, between the hours of 10:00 P.M. and sunrise, no person under the age of eighteen years shall loiter, idle, wander, stroll or play in or about: 
1.  The public streets, avenues, alleys, parks or public places of the city in the downtown commercial zone, limited commercial zone, general commercial zone, commercial manufacturing zone or manufacturing zone; 
2.  The public streets, avenues, alleys, parks or public places adjacent to any school building, adjacent to any unoccupied structure or adjacent to any location where graffiti appears. 
C.  Exceptions. The above-listed restrictions shall not apply to persons engaged in the following listed activities: 
1.  Any person under the age of eighteen years accompanied by a legal guardian, parent or other person at least five years older than such minor charged with the care and custody of the minor; 
2.  Any person under the age of eighteen who is traveling between his home or place of residence and the place where any approved place of employment, church, municipal or school function is being held. 
D.  Penalties. Any person found to be in violation of this section shall be subject to the maximum penalties permitted under California Welfare and Institutions Code Section 601. 
(Code 1965, § 14-7.) 
9.24.020 - Children-Truancy. 
A.  The Banning city council finds, determines and declares that this section has been enacted based upon the following findings: 
1.  School absenteeism is a problem that plagues our schools and creates a burden for all communities throughout the city. 
2.  Students who are absent from school without valid excuses are deprived of a formal education. 
3.  The unexcused absences of students from school result in loss of state and federal funding to the detriment of all students. 
4.  Truants involve themselves in risky activities by congregating in residences from which the supervising adults are absent, and loitering in residential neighborhoods, business districts, shopping centers and malls. 
5.  Truants are a significant portion of the persons who engage in residential burglaries, auto thefts, bicycle thefts, vandalism and other visible signs of disorder. 
6.  Truants become a burden on public safety resources because the police must return them to school, contact their parents or guardians and wait for them to take custody of them, and investigate any and all violations of law related to a student's truancy. 
7.  The City of Banning has a compelling interest in protecting the public from juveniles who fail to prepare themselves for a proper role in society by regularly attending school, whether public or other, and who commit crimes. Towards this end, the City of Banning has a compelling interest in increasing parental control of and responsibility for the city's children.

f.  In possession of valid proof that the minor is being schooled in a program at a location other than the public school campus pursuant to the approval of the proper school authorities and that the minor is not in violation of the attendance requirements of such program. 
D.  Enforcement. 
1.  Before taking any enforcement action under this section, a law enforcement officer shall ask the apparent offender's age and a reason for being in the public place or on the premises of the establishment during truancy hours. The officer shall not issue a citation or make an arrest under this section unless the officer reasonably believes that an offense has occurred and that no defense under subsection (C)(3) is present or applicable. 
2.  Each violation of this section shall constitute a separate offense. Any person who violates any of the provisions of subsection C of this section shall be guilty of a misdemeanor, and upon conviction thereof shall be punished by a fine of not more than five hundred dollars or by imprisonment in the county jail for a period of not more than six months, or by both such fine and imprisonment.

The accumulation and storage of abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicles or parts thereof on private or public property not including highways is found to create a condition tending to reduce the value of private property, to promote blight and deterioration, to invite plundering, to create fire hazards, to constitute an attractive nuisance creating a hazard to the health and safety of minors, to create a harborage for rodents and insects and to be injurious to the health, safety and general welfare. Therefore the presence of an abandoned, wrecked, dismantled or inoperative vehicle or part thereof, on private or public property not including highways, except as expressly hereinafter permitted, is declared to constitute a public nuisance which may be abated as such in accordance with the provisions of this chapter.

(Code 1965, § 22C-2.) 
12.08.030 - Major thoroughfare and bridge fees. 
    A subdivider, as a condition of approval of a final map for property within an area of benefit, or a building permit applicant, as a condition of issuance of a building permit for property within an area of benefit, shall pay a fee as hereinafter established to defray the cost of constructing bridges over waterways, railways, freeways and canyons, and/or constructing major thoroughfares. No property shall be assessed a fee under this section for both a final map and a building permit. 
(Code 1965, § 22C-3.) 
12.08.040 - General plan requirement. 
    The provisions herein for payment of fees shall apply only if the bridge and/or major thoroughfare has been included in an element of the general plan adopted by the city council at least thirty days prior to the filing of a map or application for a building permit on land located within the boundaries of the area of benefit. 
(Code 1965, § 22C-4.) 
12.08.050 - Major thoroughfares. 
    Payment of fees shall not be required unless any major thoroughfare is in addition to, or a reconstruction of, any existing major thoroughfares serving the area at the time of adoption of the boundaries of the area of benefit.

(Code 1965, § 22C-7.) 
12.08.080 - Public hearing and protest. 
A.  At the public hearing, the city council will consider the preliminary report that sets forth the area for inclusion within the area of benefit, designates the major thoroughfares and/or bridge facilities to be constructed, estimates the cost of construction of each improvement and describes the method of fee apportionment within the area of benefit. The council will also consider testimony from interested persons, written protests and other evidence submitted.

If the person or entity filing the protest is not shown on the last equalized assessment roll as the owner of the parcel, the protest must contain or be accompanied by documentary evidence establishing ownership. If written protests are filed by the owners of more than one-half of the area of the property to be benefited by the improvement, and sufficient protests are not withdrawn so as to reduce the area represented by the protests to less than one-half of the area to be benefited, then the proposed proceedings shall be abandoned and the city council shall not, for one year from the filing of said written protests, commence or carry on any proceedings for the same improvement under the provisions of this section. Any protest may be withdrawn in writing by the owner making the same, at any time prior to the close of the public hearing.

If any majority protest is directed against only a portion of the improvement, then all further proceedings under the provisions of this chapter to construct that portion of the improvement so protested against shall be barred for a period of one year, but the city council shall not be barred from commencing new proceedings not including any part of the improvement so protested against. Such proceedings shall be commenced by a new notice and public hearing as set forth in Section 12.08.070. 
E.  Nothing in this section shall prohibit the city council, within such one-year period, from commencing and carrying on new proceedings for the construction of an improvement or portion of the improvement so protested against if it finds, by the affirmative vote of four-fifths of its members, that the owners of more than one-half of the area of the property to be benefited are in favor of going forward with such improvement or portion thereof. 
(Code 1965, § 22C-8.) 
12.08.090 - Amendments. 
    The resolution establishing an area of benefit may be amended from time to time by the city council to reflect modifications in either the bridge and/or major thoroughfare facilities to be constructed or the property to be included within the area of benefit due to alterations in land use and to reflect adjustments in the fee schedule necessitated by any such modifications. Such amendments shall be adopted in the same manner as the original resolution, except that the city council may review the cost of facilities to be constructed from time to time and make such fee adjustments as may be necessary to assure that the approved facilities can be constructed from the remaining fees to be collected from the area of benefit. 
(Code 1965, § 22C-9.) 
12.08.100 - Payment of fees. 
A.  Fees shall be paid either prior to the recordation of a final subdivision or parcel map or as described herein below in subsection B of this section. Fees paid shall be based on the fee schedule in effect on date of payment.

Moneys in such fund shall be expended solely for the construction or reimbursement for construction of the improvement serving the area to be benefited and from the fees comprising the fund where collected, or to reimburse the city for the costs of construction of the improvement.

The amount of annual deposit shall be established by resolution. 
C.  Purpose. Any individual project deposit or annual deposit made hereunder shall serve as security for the repair and performance of work necessary to put the public place in as good a condition as it was prior to the excavation if the permittee fails to make the necessary repairs or to complete the proper refilling of the opening and the excavation work under the excavation permit. Such deposits may also be used to defray the cost of any soil test which fails to meet the minimum compaction requirement. 
D.  Refund of Individual Project Deposits. Upon the permittee's completion of the work covered by such permit in conformity with this chapter as determined by the administrative authority, such individual project deposit shall be refunded by the city to the permittee within thirty days after the request. 
E.  Refund of Annual Deposits. Upon the permittee's request, any annual deposit shall be refunded by the city at the end of the one-year period for which the deposit is made or the satisfactory completion of all excavation work undertaken during such period, whichever is later. 
F.  Use of Deposits. The administrative authority may use any or all of such deposits to defray the cost of any soil testing which fails to meet the minimum criteria for compaction and to pay the cost of any work the administrative authority performs to restore or maintain the public place as herein provided in the event the permittee fails to perform such work, in which event the amount refunded to the permittee shall be reduced by the amount thus expended by the administrative authority. 
G.  Public Utility Companies. Where excavations are made by public utility companies operating under a franchise issued by the city or under the supervision of the public utilities commission of the state of California, a permit may be granted without making such cash deposit. In such cases, the public utility companies shall be liable for the actual cost of any work required by the administrative authority to restore the area covered by each excavation permit to as good condition as the area was in before any work was done. Further provided, however, that the administrative authority may, in the future, require a cash deposit from any such utility if a bill rendered in accordance with this section remains unpaid thirty days after date of billing. 
H.  Public Works Projects. Where excavations are made by city water, sewer, electric or street departments or their contractors in contract with the city for a public works project, a permit will be granted without making such cash deposit. In such case, the city departments or their contractors shall restore the area covered by such excavations to as good condition as the same was in before such work was done. 
(Code 1965, § 20A-6.) 
12.12.070 - Protective measures and routing of traffic. 
A.  It shall be the duty of every person or utility cutting or making an excavation in or upon any public place, to place and maintain barriers and warning devices necessary for the safety of the general public. 
B.  Barriers, warning signs, lights, etc., shall conform to the requirements of the administrative authority. Warning lights shall be electrical flashers used to indicate a hazard to traffic from sunset of each day to sunrise of the next day. 
C.  Electrical flashers shall emit light at sufficient intensity and frequency to be visible at a reasonable distance for safety. Reflectors or reflecting material may be used to supplement, but not to replace light sources. Other types of warning lights may be used upon approval of the administrative authority. 
D.  The permittee shall take appropriate measures to assure that during the performance of the excavation work, traffic conditions as near normal as possible shall be maintained at all times so as to minimize inconvenience to the occupants of the adjoining property and to the general public. 
E.  When traffic conditions permit, the administrative authority may, by written approval, permit the closing of streets and alleys to all traffic for a period of time prescribed by him, if in his opinion it is necessary. The written approval of the administrative authority may require that the permittee give notification to various public agencies and to the general public. A listing of the various agencies will be provided by the administrative authority. In such cases, such written approval shall not be valid until such notice is given. 
F.  Warning signs shall be placed far enough in advance of the construction operation to alert traffic within a public street and cones or other approved devices which conform to the standards of "Work Area Traffic Control Handbook," latest edition, published by the City of Los Angeles shall be placed to channel traffic, in accordance with the instructions of the administrative authority. 
(Code 1965, § 20A-7.) 
12.12.080 - Clearance for vital structures.

If only one lane of vehicle traffic is possible, flagmen with proper traffic control devices shall be provided to direct traffic through the one lane portion of the travel way. If any excavation is made across any public street, alley or sidewalk, adequate crossings shall be maintained for vehicles and for pedestrians. If the street is not wide enough to hold the excavated material without using part of the adjacent sidewalk, a passageway at least one-half of the sidewalk width shall be maintained along such sidewalk line. If any excavation is made at a location where traffic volume is high, and cannot be backfilled and resurfaced by the end of a working day, steel plates shall be used to cover the excavation in accordance with the instructions of the administrative authority. 
(Code 1965, § 20A-9.) 
12.12.100 - Relocation and protection of utilities. 
    The permittee shall not interfere with any existing facility without the written consent of the administrative authority and the owner of the facility. If it becomes necessary to relocate an existing facility this shall be done by its owner at permittee's expense. No facility owned by the city shall be moved to accommodate the permittee unless the cost of such work be borne by the permittee. The cost of moving privately owned facilities shall be similarly borne by the permittee unless it makes other arrangements with the person owning the facility. The permittee shall support and protect by timbers or otherwise all pipes, conduits, poles, wires or other apparatus which may be in any way affected by the excavation work, and do everything necessary to support, sustain and protect them under, over, along or across said work. The permittee shall secure approval of method of support and protection from the owner of the facility. In case any of said pipes, conduits, poles, wires or apparatus should be damaged, and for this purpose pipe coating or other encasement or devices are to be considered as part of a substructure, the permittee shall promptly notify the owner thereof. All damaged facilities shall be repaired by the agency or person owning them and the expense of such repairs shall be charged to the permittee. It is the intent of this section that the permittee shall assume all liability for damage to facilities and any resulting damage or injury to anyone because of such facility damage and such assumption of liability is a contractual obligation of the permittee. The only exception will be such instances where damage is exclusively due to the negligence of the owning utility. The city shall not be made a party to any action because of this section. The permittee shall inform itself as to the existence and location of all underground facilities and protect the same against damage. 
(Code 1965, § 20A-10.) 
12.12.110 - Abandonment of substructures.

12.12.120 - Protection of adjoining property. 
    The permittee shall at all times and at his or its own expense preserve and protect from injury any adjoining property by providing proper foundations and taking other measures suitable for the purpose. Where in the protection of such property it is necessary to enter upon private property for the purpose of taking appropriate protecting measures, the permittee shall obtain permission from the owner of such private property for such purpose and if he cannot obtain permission from such owner, the administrative authority may authorize him to enter the private premises solely for making the property safe. The permittee shall, at its own expense, shore up and protect all buildings, walls, fences or other property likely to be damaged during the progress of the excavation work and shall be responsible for all damage to public or private property or highways resulting from its failure to properly protect and carry out said work. Wherever it may be necessary for the permittee to trench through any lawn area said area shall be reseeded or the sod shall be carefully cut and rolled and replaced after ditches have been backfilled as required in this ordinance. All construction and maintenance work shall be done in a manner calculated to leave the lawn area clean of earth and debris and in a condition as nearly as possible to that which existed before such work began. The permittee shall not remove, even temporarily, any trees or shrubs which exist in parking strip areas without first obtaining the consent of the appropriate city department or city official having control of such property. 
(Code 1965, § 20A-12.)

A.  All material excavated from trenches and piled adjacent to the trench or in any street shall be piled, and maintained in such manner as not to endanger those working in the trench, pedestrians or users of the streets, and so that as little inconvenience as possible is caused to those using streets and adjoining property. Where the confines of the area being excavated are too narrow to permit the piling of excavated material beside the trench, such as might be in the case in a narrow alley, the administrative authority shall have the authority to require that the permittee haul the excavated material to a storage site and then rehaul it to the trench site at the time of backfilling. It shall be the permittee's responsibility to secure the necessary permission and make all necessary arrangements for all required storage and disposal sites. 
B.  All trench and tunnel excavations and construction shall conform with the safety requirements for shoring, bracing and ladders in trenches in accordance with state of California trench and tunnel construction safety orders, as they now or may hereafter exist. 
C.  All material excavated shall be laid compactly along the side of the trench and kept trimmed so as to cause as little inconvenience as reasonably possible to vehicular and pedestrian traffic, or as specified by the administrative authority. Whenever necessary, in order to expedite the flow of traffic or to abate the dirt or dust nuisance, toe boards or bins may be required by the administrative authority to prevent the spreading of dirt into traffic lanes. 
(Code 1965, § 20A-13.) 
12.12.140 - Clean up. 
    As the excavation work progresses, all streets shall be thoroughly cleared of all rubbish, excess earth, rock and other debris resulting from such work. All clean up operations at the location of such excavation shall be accomplished at the expense of the permittee and shall be completed to the satisfaction of the administrative authority. From time to time, as may be ordered by the administrative authority and in any event immediately after completion of said work, the permittee shall, at his or its own expense, clean up and remove all refuse and unused materials of any kind resulting from said work, and upon failure to do so within twenty-four hours after having been notified to do so by the administrative authority, said work may be done by the administrative authority and the cost thereof charged off to the permittee, and the permittee shall also be liable for the cost thereof under the surety bond provided hereunder.

Chapter 12.52 - WESTERN RIVERSIDE COUNTY MULTIPLE SPECIES HABITAT CONSERVATION PLAN* 
Article I. - Title 

12.52.010 - Findings and purpose. 
A.  The city council finds that the ecosystems of the City of Banning ("city") and/or Western Riverside County and the vegetation communities and sensitive species they support are fragile, irreplaceable resources that are vital to the general welfare of all residents; these vegetation communities and natural areas contain habitat value which contributes to the region's environmental resources; and special protections for these vegetation communities and natural areas must be established to prevent future endangerment of the plant and animal species that are dependent upon them. This chapter will protect the city's and the region's biological resources, vegetation communities, and natural areas, and prevent their degradation and loss by guiding development outside of biological resource core areas, and by establishing mitigation standards which will be applied to development projects.

G.  Frontage Fee. The frontage fee shall be twenty-five dollars per foot multiplied by the front footage of the parcel to be served from an existing water main; unless such property abuts where installation costs have already been previously paid by a developer/property owner or a reimbursement agreement with the city exists. In the case of a reimbursement agreement, the parcel will then pay the reimbursement amount in accordance with the reimbursement agreement. 
1.  A "parcel" shall mean: 
a.  A parcel of real property with a separate and distinct number or other designation shown on a plat recorded in the office of the county recorder; or 
b.  A parcel of real property delineated on an approved record of survey, lot split or land division map as filed in the office of the county recorder. 
2.  The total frontage fee shall be defined and computed by the city as follows: 
    If a parcel abuts a street or easement in which a water main is located only on one side, the total frontage fee shall be computed by multiplying the length of the property frontage times said fee. 
    If a parcel abuts a street or easement on two or more sides, the total front footage fee shall be computed multiplying said fee times the length of the longest parcel line abutting said street or easement in which said water main is located. However, in case of large corner lots or developments over five acres receiving benefit from both sides for development, the front footage on both sides shall be used to compute the frontage fee. 
    When a lot is irregular in shape, the public works director is authorized to compute a frontage fee commensurate with the benefits received as similarly affirmed herein. 
(Code 1965, § 31-4.) 
13.08.060 - Sewer system connection fee. 
A.  General. A sewer system connection fee shall be paid for a new connection to the city-owned sewage system as follows: 
1.  The connection fee shall be two thousand seven hundred and eighty-six dollars per equivalent dwelling unit. This amount is necessary to cover the reasonable costs of the sewer service to be rendered. 
2.  The connection fee shall be applied to each new equivalent dwelling unit connected to the sewerage system of the city. 
3.  The number of equivalent dwelling units prescribed in this section shall be used to compute the amount of the connection fee for a particular sewerage system use. 
4.  The use of a sewer connection shall be limited to the type and number of equivalent dwelling units authorized by a duly issued wastewater discharge permit. Before connecting any additional equivalent dwelling units, buildings, modifying existing buildings, or changing occupancy type, the property owner shall make application to the city for such connection and/or change in use and pay such additional connection fees as may be applicable. Periodic inspection of the property may be made by the city and if a change in use is found, an assignment for sewerage may be made by the city. 
5.  Upon city council approval, separate fees in addition to the basic connection fee may be established from time to time for various special areas of benefit within the city, in order to reimburse the city for costs, and applicable only to such special areas. 
a.  Frontage Fee. The frontage fee shall be twenty-seven dollars and fifty cents per foot multiplied by the front footage of the parcel to be served from an existing sewer line, unless such property abuts where installation costs have already been previously paid by a developer/property owner or a reimbursement agreement with the city exists. In the case of the reimbursement agreement, the parcel will then pay the reimbursement amount in accordance with the reimbursement agreement. 
b.  A "parcel" shall mean: 
i.  A parcel of real property with a separate and distinct number or other designation shown on a plat recorded in the office of the county recorder; or 
ii.  A parcel of real property delineated on an approved record of survey, lot split or land division map is filed in the office of the county recorder. 
c.  The total frontage fee shall be defined and computed by the city as follows: 
i.  If a parcel abuts a street or easement in which a sewer main is located only on one side, the total frontage fee shall be computed by multiplying the length of the parcel frontage times said fee. 
ii.  If a parcel abuts a street or easement on two or more sides, the total front footage fee shall be computed multiplying said fee times the length of the longest parcel line abutting said street or easement in which said sewer main is located. However, in case of large corner lots or developments over five acres receiving benefit from both sides for development, the front footage on both sides shall be used to compute the frontage fee. 
iii.  When a lot is irregular in shape, the public works director is authorized to compute a frontage fee commensurate with the benefits received as similarly affirmed herein. 
B.  Determination of Equivalent Dwelling Units. For the purpose of this section, the discharge characteristics of an equivalent dwelling unit shall be composed of a wastewater flow of two hundred twenty-five gallons per day and constituent levels of two hundred parts per million suspended solids and two hundred parts per million biochemical oxygen demand. The number of equivalent dwelling units assigned a particular property shall be used in computing the connection fees and user charges. The assignment of equivalent dwelling units shall be as follows: 
Type of Sewerage Service Equivalent Dwelling Units (a) Residential. (1) Each individual single-family, condominium, apartment, or mobilehome living unit $1.00 (2) Each recreational vehicle space connected to sewer 0.75 (3) Each recreational vehicle space using private sanitary facilities 0.50 (b) Commercial. (1) Hotels and motels Living unit without kitchen 0.50 Living unit with kitchen 1.00 (2) Churches, theaters and auditoriums Per each 100 seats 1.00 (3) Restaurants 2.70* Per each 7 seats 1.00 (4) Automobile service stations 4 gasoline pumps or less 2.00 More than 4 gasoline pumps 3.00 (5) Laundries (self-service) Per washer 0.75 (6) Retail stores and offices First unit in building 1.00 Per additional unit in building 0.60 (c) Institutional. (1) Schools Elementary - for each 60 pupils or fraction thereof 1.00 Junior high - for each 50 pupils or fraction thereof 1.00 High - for each 30 pupils or fraction thereof 1.00  
* Based upon the volume of water consumption and quality of discharge, an additional EDU assessment can be made under subsection C of this section. 
C.  Industrial, Other Commercial and Institutional. For all industrial uses, and for commercial and institutional uses other than those set forth above, the city engineer shall determine the number of equivalent dwelling units based upon the estimated quality and quantity of discharge into the sewerage system and using the equivalent dwelling unit formula set forth in Exhibit "A" attached to the ordinance codified in this section and incorporated herein by this reference. 
D.  Quality Surcharge. If the discharge by a commercial or industrial establishment exceeds the constituent levels of an equivalent dwelling unit, the city engineer may: 
1.  Impose a surcharge to cover costs of processing the additional constituents, and/or 
2.  Require pretreatment before granting a wastewater discharge permit. 
E.  Time of Payment. 
1.  For all new connection to new structures, the sewer system connection fee shall be paid prior to the issuance of any buildings permits, a certificate of compliance, or a mobile home park grading or construction permit, whichever occurs first. 
2.  For a new connection of an existing structure to the city sewerage system, the sewer system connection fee shall be paid prior to the issuance of a plumbing permit. 
F.  Wastewater Discharge Permit. 
1.  A wastewater discharge permit shall be required for any property requesting discharge into the city sewerage system. The permit shall authorize the applicant to physically connect to and discharge wastewater into the city sewerage system. 
2.  A wastewater discharge permit shall expire if the construction work authorized by such permit is not commenced within one hundred twenty days from the date of permit issuance, or if the construction work authorized by said permit is suspended or abandoned for a period of one hundred twenty days at any time after the work is commenced. The permit shall so state on its face. 
3.  Before such work can be recommenced, a new wastewater discharge permit application must be filed with the city. The city may reactivate the previous wastewater discharge permit provided that the wastewater quantity and quality is the same as the wastewater discharge allowed under the original permit, and provided further that such suspension and abandonment has not exceeded one year. 
G.  Review of Connection Fees. The sewer system connection fee and sewer frontage fee may be periodically reviewed and adjusted by the city council to account for changes in capital improvement construction costs as reflected in the first ENR (Engineering News Record) index published in the month of January of that year or other cost-related evidence. 
H.  Use of Revenue from Connection Fees. All revenues derived from sewer connection fees shall be deposited in the city's special fund entitled "sewerage system capital improvement fund." The use of all such revenues shall be for sewerage system capital improvements, including but not limited to sewer main and interceptor extensions, wastewater treatment plan expansions, and wastewater treatment plant upgrading. Such revenues may be used for any costs related to sewerage system capital improvements and connection fee administration, including but not limited to engineering costs, right-of-way acquisition, financing costs and administration directly related to such capital improvements. Use of revenues from the sewerage system capital improvement fund shall require formal action by the city council. 
I.  Exceptions. 
1.  The city council may grant a reduction, waiver, or special credit applicable to the sewer system connection fee upon an express finding from the evidence presented that such action would be in the public interest. Application for a reduction, waiver or special credit shall be made in writing to the city manager and city staff shall review such application and make recommendations thereon to the city council. 
2.  In addition, the following rules apply to the following special cases: 
a.  Any structure completed prior to February 27, 1962 shall be exempt from the sewer system connection fee. 
b.  A parcel of land which was within the city and was subdivided prior to December 31, 1978, and is capable of directly connecting to a sewer which was constructed prior to December 31, 1978, shall be assessed a connection fee in amount up to sixty-five percent of the connection fee provided for in this section, and shall be entitled to one equivalent dwelling unit connection.

All periodic compliance reports must be signed and certified in accordance with subsection A of this section. 
2.  All wastewater samples must be representative of the user's discharge. Wastewater monitoring and flow measurement facilities shall be properly operated, kept clean, and maintained in good working order at all times. The failure of a user to keep its monitoring facility in good working order shall not be grounds for the user to claim that sample results are unrepresentative of its discharge. 
3.  If a user subject to the reporting requirement in this section monitors any pollutant more frequently than required by the director of public works, using the procedures prescribed in subsection J of this section, the results of this monitoring shall be included in the report. 
E.  Reports of changed conditions. Each user must notify the director of public works of any planned significant changes to the user's operations or system which might alter the nature, quality, or volume of its wastewater at least ninety days before the change. 
1.  The director of public works may require the user to submit such information as may be deemed necessary to evaluate the changed condition, including the submission of a wastewater discharge permit application under Section 13.20.090 of this chapter. 
2.  The director of public works may issue a wastewater discharge permit under Section 13.20.080 of this chapter or modify an existing wastewater discharge permit under Section 13.20.120 of this chapter in response to changed conditions or anticipated changed conditions. 
3.  For purposes of this requirement, significant changes include, but are not limited to, flow increases of twenty percent or greater, and the discharge of any previously unreported pollutants. 
F.  Reports of potential problems. 
1.  In the case of any discharge, including, but not limited to, accidental discharges, discharges of a nonroutine, episodic nature, a noncustomary batch discharge, or a slug load, that may cause potential problems for the POTW, the user shall immediately telephone and notify the director of public works of the incident. This notification shall include the location of the discharge, type of waste, concentration and volume, if known, and corrective actions taken by the user. 
2.  Within five days following such discharge, the user shall, unless waived by the director of public works, submit a detailed written report describing the cause(s) of the discharge and the measures to be taken by the user to prevent similar future occurrences. Such notification shall not relieve the user of any expense, loss, damage, or other liability which may be incurred as a result of damage to the POTW, natural resources, or any other damage to person or property; nor shall such notification relieve the user of any fines, penalties, or other liability which may be imposed pursuant to this chapter. 
3.  A notice shall be permanently posted on the user's bulletin board or other prominent place advising employees whom to call in the event of a discharge described in subsection (F)(1) of this section. Employers shall ensure that all employees, who may cause such a discharge to occur, are advised of the emergency notification procedure. 
G.  Reports from unpermitted users. All users not required to obtain a wastewater discharge permit shall provide appropriate reports to the director of public works as the director of public works may require. 
H.  Notice of violation/repeat sampling and reporting. If sampling performed by a user indicates a violation, the user must notify the director of public works within twenty-four hours of becoming aware of the violation. The user shall also repeat the sampling and analysis and submit the results of the repeat analysis to the director of public works within thirty days after becoming aware of the violation. The user is not required to resample if the director of public works monitors at the user's facility at least once a month, or if the director of public works samples between the user's initial sampling and when the user receives the results of this sampling. 
1.  Any user who commences the discharge of hazardous waste shall notify the POTW, the Regional Water Quality Control Board, the EPA Regional Waste Management Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities, in writing, of any discharge into the POTW of a substance which, if otherwise disposed of, would be a hazardous waste under 40 CFR Part 261. Such notification must include the name of the hazardous waste as set forth in 40 CFR Part 261, the EPA hazardous waste number, and the type of discharge (continuous, batch, or other). If the user discharges more than one hundred kilograms of such waste per calendar month to the POTW, the notification also shall contain the following information to the extent such information is known and readily available to the user: an identification of the hazardous constituents contained in the wastes, an estimation of the mass and concentration of such constituents in the wastestream discharged during that calendar month, and an estimation of the mass of constituents in the wastestream expected to be discharged during the following twelve months. All notifications must take place no later than one hundred and eighty days after the discharge commences. Any notification under this paragraph need be submitted only once for each hazardous waste discharged. However, notifications of changed conditions must be submitted under subsection E of this section. The notification requirement in this section does not apply to pollutants already reported by users subject to categorical pretreatment standards under the self-monitoring requirements of subsections A, C, and D of this section. 
2.  Dischargers are exempt from the requirements of subsection (H)(1) of this section during a calendar month in which they discharge no more than fifteen kilograms of hazardous wastes, unless the wastes are acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e). Discharge of more than fifteen kilograms of nonacute hazardous wastes in a calendar month, or of any quantity of acute hazardous wastes as specified in 40 CFR 261.30(d) and 261.33(e), requires a one-time notification. Subsequent months during which the user discharges more than such quantities of any hazardous waste do not require additional notification. 
3.  In the case of any new regulations under Section 3001 of RCRA identifying additional characteristics of hazardous waste or listing any additional substance as a hazardous waste, the user must notify the director of public works, the EPA Regional Waste Management Waste Division Director, and state hazardous waste authorities of the discharge of such substance within ninety days of the effective date of such regulations. 
4.  In the case of any notification made under this section, the user shall certify that it has a program in place to reduce the volume and toxicity of hazardous wastes generated to the degree it has determined to be economically practical. 
5.  This provision does not create a right to discharge any substance not otherwise permitted to be discharged by this chapter, a permit issued thereunder, or any applicable federal or state law. 
I.  Analytical requirements. All pollutant analyses, including sampling techniques, to be submitted as part of a wastewater discharge permit application or report shall be performed in accordance with the techniques prescribed in 40 CFR Part 136, unless otherwise specified in an applicable categorical pretreatment standard. If 40 CFR Part 136 does not contain sampling or analytical techniques for the pollutant in question, sampling and analyses must be performed in accordance with procedures approved by EPA. 
J.  Sample collection. 
1.  Except as indicated by subsection (J)(2) of this section, the user must collect wastewater samples using flow proportional composite collection techniques. In the event flow proportional sampling is infeasible, the director of public works may authorize the use of time proportional sampling or a minimum of four grab samples where the user demonstrates that this will provide a representative sample of the effluent being discharged. In addition, grab samples may be required to show compliance with instantaneous discharge limits. 
2.  Samples for oil and grease, temperature, pH, cyanide, phenols, sulfides, and volatile organic compounds must be obtained using grab collection techniques. 
K.  Timing. Written reports will be deemed to have been submitted on the date postmarked. For reports which are not mailed, postage prepaid, into a mail facility serviced by the United States Postal Service, the date of receipt of the report shall govern. 
L.  Record keeping. Users subject to the reporting requirements of this chapter shall retain, and make available for inspection and copying, all records of information obtained pursuant to any monitoring activities required by this chapter and any additional records of information obtained pursuant to monitoring activities undertaken by the user independent of such requirements. Records shall include the date, exact place, method, and time of sampling, and the name of the person(s) taking the samples; the dates analyses were performed; who performed the analyses; the analytical techniques or methods used; and the results of such analyses. These records shall remain available for a period of at least five years. This period shall be automatically extended for the duration of any litigation concerning the user or the City of Banning, or where the user has been specifically notified of a longer retention period by the director of public works. 
(Code 1965, § 31A-19.) 
13.20.200 - Monitoring and inspection facility. 
A.  The city may require to be provided and operated at the user's own expense, monitoring facilities to allow inspection, sampling, and flow measurement of the building sewer and/or internal drainage systems. The monitoring facility should normally be situated on the user's premises, but the city may, when such a location would be impractical or cause undue hardship on the user, allow the facility to be constructed in the public street or sidewalk area, subject to approval of an encroachment permit, and located so that it will not be obstructed by landscaping or parked vehicles. 
    There shall be ample room in or near such a facility to allow accurate sampling and preparation of samples for analysis. The facility, sampling, and measuring equipment shall be maintained at all times in a safe and proper operation condition at the expense of the user. 
    Whether constructed on public or private property, the sampling and monitoring facilities shall be provided in accordance with the city's requirements and all applicable local construction standards and specifications shall be met. Construction shall be completed within ninety days following written notification by the city. Such notification may be as indicated in the user's wastewater discharge permit. 
B.  The monitoring program may require user to conduct a sampling and analysis program of a frequency and type specified in the user's wastewater discharge permit to demonstrate compliance with prescribed wastewater discharge limits. As specified in the user's wastewater discharge permit, the user shall either: 
1.  Conduct his sampling and analysis program provided he demonstrates to the director of public works that he has the necessary qualifications and facilities to perform the work; and 
2.  Engage a private laboratory, certified by the state of California Department of Public Health. 
(Code 1965, § 31A-20.)

13.20.220 - Sampling. 
A.  The point of determining compliance with the provisions of this chapter (and of the user's wastewater discharge permit, if applicable) at the point of the discharge to the public wastewater system or such other upstream sampling point on the private lateral as mutually agreed upon by the nonresidential user and the director of public works. Where multiple discharge permits to the City of Banning wastewater collection system are regulated by a wastewater discharge permit, sampling must be carried out at an acceptable location for each permitted discharge. Where certain wastes are critical, the director of public works may specify, through the provisions of the user's permit, procedures for obtaining necessary samples and require that any persons discharging industrial wastewater install a measuring device and that samples be analyzed and measurements of flows taken and reported to the city, and such sampling and measuring device shall be made accessible to the director of public works or his authorized representative. 
    Unless otherwise specified in the provisions of the user's wastewater discharge permit, compliance with the requirements of this chapter are based on the mean values obtained from analysis of composite industrial waste samples representative of the quality and quantity of discharge to the sewer. All such samples shall be weighted with the flow at the sampling point to furnish values weighted with time and quantity for each required chemical constituent. The frequency of monitoring shall be as prescribed in the user's wastewater discharge permit. 
B.  Sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with Section 304(g) of the Federal Water Pollution Control Act and contained in 40 CFR, Part 136 and amendments thereto or with any other test procedures approved by the director of public works. Where 40 CFR, Part 136 does not include a sampling of analytical technique for pollutant in question, sampling and analysis shall be performed in accordance with the procedures set forth in the EPA publication, Sampling and Analysis Procedures for Screening of Industrial Effluents for Priority Pollutants, April, 1977, and amendments thereto, or with any other sampling and analytical procedures approved by the director of public works. 
(Code 1965, § 31A-22.) 
13.20.230 - Confidential information. 
    Information and data on a user obtained from reports, surveys, wastewater discharge permit applications, wastewater discharge permits, and monitoring programs, and from the director of public works inspection and sampling activities, shall be available to the public without restriction, unless the user specifically requests, and is able to demonstrate to the satisfaction of the director of public works, that the release of such information would divulge information, processes, or methods of production entitled to protection as trade secrets under applicable state law. Any such request must be asserted at the time of submission of the information or data. When requested and demonstrated by the user furnishing a report that such information should be held confidential, the portions of a report which might disclose trade secrets or secret processes shall not be made available for inspection by the public, but shall be made available immediately upon request to governmental agencies for uses related to the NPDES program or pretreatment program, and in enforcement proceedings involving the person furnishing the report. Wastewater constituents and characteristics and other "effluent data" as defined by 40 CFR 2.302 will not be recognized as confidential information and will be available to the public without restriction.

D.  Permit Application Processing. A permit application that satisfies the information requirements in the city's adopted checklist shall be deemed complete and be promptly processed. Upon confirmation by the building official that the permit application and supporting documents meets the requirements of the city adopted checklist, and is consistent with all applicable laws, the building official shall, consistent with Government Code Section 65850.7, approve the application and issue all necessary permits. Such approval does not authorize an applicant to energize or utilize the electric vehicle charging station until approval is granted by the city. If the building official determines that the permit application is incomplete, he or she shall issue a written correction notice to the applicant, detailing all deficiencies in the application and any additional information required to be eligible for expedited permit issuance. 
E.  Technical Review. It is the intent of this section to encourage the installation of electric vehicle charging stations by removing obstacles to permitting for charging stations so long as the action does not supersede the building official's authority to address higher priority life-safety situations. If the building official makes a finding based on substantial evidence that the electric vehicle charging station could have a specific adverse impact upon the public health or safety, as defined in Government Code 65850.7, the city may require the applicant to apply for a use permit.

B.  The city engineer or his designee shall specify one of the following guarantees: 
1.  Cash bond;

The bond shall be executed by the owner of the lot or parcel as principal, and, if a surety bond, shall also be executed by a corporation authorized to act as a surety under the laws of this state. Whenever the owner elects to deposit a cash bond, the city is authorized in the event of default on his part to use any and all of the deposit money to cause the required work to be done or completed, and for payment of all costs and expenses therefor. Any money remaining shall be refunded to the owner, provided that in no instance shall the city be liable for interest on the moneys it so holds on deposit. 
D.  When a substantial portion of the required improvements have been completed to the satisfaction of the city engineer and the completion of remaining improvements is delayed due to conditions beyond the owner's control, the city engineer may accept the completed portion and consent to the proportionate reduction of the bond in an amount estimated and determined by the city engineer to be adequate to assure the completion of the remaining required improvements. 
E.  Whenever a surety bond has been filed in compliance with this section, the city is authorized, in the event of any default on the part of the principal, to enforce collection under such bond for any and all damages sustained by the city by reason of any failure on the part of the principal to faithfully and properly complete the required work to be done or completed, and the surety upon the bond shall be firmly bound for the payment of all necessary costs thereof. 
F.

The fact of such completion shall be endorsed by a statement thereof signed by the city engineer, and the deposit shall be returned to owner, or the surety bond shall be exonerated at any time thereafter. 
G.  For the purposes of this chapter, improvements shall be considered assured when the city engineer accepts the cash or surety bond or other guarantee provided for herein, or the improvements required to be made have been completed to his satisfaction.

C.  The city manager or his designee determines that the public health, safety and welfare of the inhabitants of the city would not be endangered by the deferment, modification or waiver of the construction of improvements in con-junction with the proposed construction or expansion. 
(Code 1965, § 6-12.04.) 
Chapter 15.48 - GENERAL PLAN LAND USE ELEMENT 

15.48.010 - Purpose. 
    The general plan is the comprehensive long-term plan for the physical development of the city and lays the basic framework for all subsequent planning actions taken by the city. Since the city council is desirous of proper development within the city and wishes to continue to encourage the development of appropriate projects, it becomes necessary to regulate such development so that it is properly integrated into the city's long term planning process and its comprehensive review and revision of the general plan. 
    The city council finds and determines that the most reasonable course of action with respect to these competing policies, i.e., the desire to encourage appropriate development and the need to regulate such development to ensure its integration into the city's evolving long-term planning process is to require that an application for adoption or amendment of a specific plan be submitted and processed in conjunction with all applicable amendments to the land use element of the general plan, and an application for an amendment to the land use element of the general plan not be approved unless a specific plan is approved concurrently whenever required by this chapter. 
(Code 1965, § 11B-1.) 
15.48.020 - Definitions. 
    For the purposes of this chapter the following definitions shall apply.

    Specific Plan. A plan defined in and adopted and amended pursuant to the provision of Sections 65450 et seq. of the California Government Code. 
(Code 1965, § 11B-2.) 
15.48.030 - Applications for amendment to the land use element of the general plan. 
A.  All applications for amendment to the land use element of the general plan shall be accompanied by a completed application for adoption or amendment of a specific plan. Applicant shall submit such applications on forms provided for such purpose by the planning department, shall comply fully with and be governed by the requirements of Sections 65300 et seq. and Sections 65450 et seq. of the California Government Code, the code and this chapter, and shall provide such additional information and materials as the planning department deems necessary and appropriate. The city's standard application fees for amendments to the general plan and for the adoption or amendment of specific plan shall be paid to the city by applicant at the time of application. 
B.  The procedures set forth in Sections 65300 et seq. and 65450 et seq. of the California Government Code for processing, considering and approving amendments to the general plan and the adoption or amendment of a specific plan shall be applicable, except that both applications shall be processed and considered concurrently to the extent possible. 
C.  No such application for an amendment to the general plan shall be recommended by the planning commission to the city council for adoption or adopted by the city council, unless the concurrently processed application for adoption or amendment of a specific plan is concurrently recommended for adoption, in the case of the planning commission, or adopted, in the case of the city council. 
(Code 1965, § 11B-3.) 
15.48.040 - Conformance with state law. 
    Any amendment to the land use element of the general plan shall be required to conform to Sections 65300 et. seq. of the California Government Code, the code, and this chapter. 
(Code 1965, § 11B-4.) 
15.48.050 - Specific plan. 
A.  A determination for requiring a specific plan of development shall be based on several factors; including, but not limited to: parcel size, location, type and/or intensity of use(s), land use designation and/or zoning, topography, presence of hazards or environmental resources, effect(s) on city services and facilities, traffic, or similar factors. 
B.  The following list characterizes typical situations or circumstances indicating when the preparation of a specific plan is desirable, warranted, or appropriate: 
1.  When unique results or treatments are desired, such as in a sensitive hillside area; 
2.  Where unique conditions, problems or opportunities exist, such as topography or major landform features or the presence of substantial environmental resources or hazards such as a (Zone A) one-hundred-year floodplain; 
3.  Where special development standards are needed to accommodate development proposals, such as mixed residential/commercial/industrial uses, age- or use-oriented communities, etc., unless such uses are not permitted; 
4.  Where there is a complicated mixture of development conditions, such as new development, deteriorated structures, underutilized land, mixed uses and vacant parcels; 
5.  When there is a need or desire to incorporate considerable detail in a development plan; 
6.  When it is appropriate and desirable to coordinate private funding or cooperative public/private financing for a plan's implementation; such as for major infrastructure and public facilities improvements; 
7.  When it is essential to establish a clear basis for a development agreement; 
8.  Where it is essential to establish a comprehensive phasing plan; such as typing together the phasing of development with public facilities and capital improvements; 
9.  Where it is desirable or appropriate to accompany a development plan with a Master EIR or program/tiered Environmental Impact Report, so that subsequent development projects would require only focused or supplemental environmental documentation or reports; 
10.  When it is desirable or appropriate to precisely coordinate and correlate a particular area's development policies, land use regulations, supporting infrastructure and capital improvements programming and budgeting, and financing measures into a comprehensive package; 
11.  Where it is desirable to plan the annexation of property; 
12.  When there is a proposed amendment to the city's general plan that would result in increased growth to an area that could change the pattern of development, intensity of land use, and exceed the population and/or housing projections of the city's general plan for any five-year planning period; 
13.  When projects are proposed that are capable of exceeding acceptable standards for noise, traffic generation, air quality, etc., such as cement batch plants, chemical manufacturing, etc. 
(Code 1965, § 11B-5.) 
15.48.060 - Interpretation of general plan map boundaries and symbols. 
A.  Where uncertainty exists as to the location of the boundaries of any land use category, public facility symbol, circulation, alignment, or other symbol or line shown on the official general plan land use or circulation map(s), the following rules shall be used to resolve such uncertainty: 
1.  Boundaries shown as approximately following lot lines shall be construed to follow such lot lines; 
2.  Boundaries shown as approximately following a street or alley, or railroad lines, shall be considered to extend to the centerline of the right-of-way; except where a public street or alley is officially vacated or abandoned, the regulations applicable to the property to which it reverts shall apply to such vacated or abandoned street or alley; 
3.  Boundaries shown as approximately following section lines, half-section lines, or quarter-section lines, shall be construed as following such lines; 
4.  Boundaries shown as approximately following natural features such as streams, rivers, flood control channels, bluffs and terraces, and other topographic features shall be construed as following such features; 
5.  Where a boundary divides unsubdivided property, the location of such boundary shall be determined by use of the scale appearing on the official map; 
6.  Boundaries shown as curved or wavy lines shall be construed to be located at such distances from the nearest public street, alley, property line, or city limit line shown on the official map, by use of the scale appearing on such map; 
7.  Dashed boundaries or other symbols that indicate appropriate locations for proposed public facilities are not property specific and indicate only the general area within which the specific facility should or could be established; 
8.  When interpreting a boundary location by use of the scale appearing on the official map, the location of such boundary may be interpreted to extend beyond the location shown by no more than the actual width of the boundary line as it appears by use of the scale shown on the official map; 
9.  a.  In cases where the public seeks to determine the certainty of a boundary but the planning department is unable to make a determination by utilizing the previous rules, the planning commission shall be responsible for clarification of ambiguity or omission. 
b.  In cases where the public disagrees with staff's determination regarding interpretation of boundaries on the city's land use map of its general plan, the public may appeal staff's determination in accordance with the requirements outlined in Title 17 of this Code. City fees for processing an appeal shall be paid at the time the application is submitted to the city for its consideration. 
(Code 1965, § 11B-6.) 
15.48.070 - Exceptions clause. 
    The requirement to prepare a specific plan in conjunction with a general plan amendment may be waived, if, in the evaluation by the community development director, he/she finds: 
A.  The property being considered for amendment of its residential land use designation is less than thirty acres in size, and one or more of the following conditions are present: 
1.  The general plan designation for which the amendment is being sought exists on adjoining properties and is compatible with and a logical extension of such designation for the subject area. For purposes of this section, properties separated by a street or road shall be deemed "adjoining." 
2.  Property possessing a higher range of the number of allowable dwelling units per acre either adjoins or is within two-hundred feet of the property for which the general plan amendment is being sought. 
3.  The property being considered for amendment of its land use designation will be developed consistent with the development character/pattern on adjoining and/or surrounding properties.

(Code 1965, § 11B-7.) 
15.48.080 - Appeals. 
    The determination of the community development director shall be final unless within fifteen days following the date of the decision of the community development director an aggrieved party files with the city manager a written notice of appeal consistent with the provisions contained in Section 1.28.010 of this Code. 
(Code 1965, § 11B-8.) 
Chapter 15.52 - DEVELOPMENT AGREEMENTS 

15.52.010 - Purpose. 
    Lack of certainty in the approval of development projects can result in a waste of resources, escalate the cost of projects and discourage investment in and commitment to comprehensive planning necessary to the positive growth of this city. 
    Assurance that an applicant may proceed with a project in accordance with existing policies, rules and regulations, while subject to conditions of approval, will strengthen the public planning process, encourage private participation in comprehensive planning, and reduce the economic costs of development. 
    The State Legislature has enabled cities and counties to enter into development agreements to provide these assurances under certain limited circumstances. This chapter is enacted pursuant to California Government Code Section 65865. 
(Code 1965, § 22A-1.) 
15.52.020 - Application and fees. 
A.  Application. The process for the consideration of a development agreement shall be initiated upon the filing of an application by or on behalf of the property owner or other person having a legal or equitable interest in real property located within the municipal boundaries of the city, or real property to be annexed to the city. Application forms shall be provided by the planning department. The application for consideration of a proposed development agreement shall be accompanied by a copy of the proposed development agreement containing all of the provisions required by law, and the applicant shall provide such other information with respect to the proposed project as may be required by the city. 
B.  Fees. The city council shall establish by minute order or resolution a reasonable fee for processing an application for consideration of a development agreement, to be paid by the applicant at the time of filing the development agreement application. 
(Code 1965, § 22A-2.) 
15.52.030 - Contents. 
    A development agreement shall set forth its term, and shall specify the permitted uses of the property, the density or intensity of use, the maximum height and size of proposed buildings, and provisions for reservation or dedication of land for public purposes, if any reservation or dedication is required. The development agreement may include conditions, terms, restrictions, and requirements for subsequent discretionary actions, provided that such conditions, terms, restrictions, and requirements for subsequent discretionary action shall not prevent development of the land for the uses and to the density or intensity of development set forth in the agreement. The development agreement may contain such other provisions as may be considered necessary or proper by the city council to further legitimate city interest or to protect the public health, safety and welfare so long as such terms are not inconsistent with the provisions of state law relating to development agreements, nor inconsistent with other city ordinances, policies, plans or resolutions. 
(Code 1965, § 22A-3.) 
15.52.040 - Public hearing-Notice. 
    Public hearings on an application for a development agreement shall be held by the planning commission and then by the city council. Notice of intention to consider the adoption of a development agreement shall be given as provided in Sections 65854, 65854.5 and 65856 of the California Government Code in addition to such other notices that may be required by law or ordinance for actions considered concurrently with the development agreement. 
(Code 1965, § 22A-4.) 
15.52.050 - Findings-Reservation of rights. 
    The development agreement, the ordinances, rules, plans and policies of the city which govern permitted uses of land, the density of development, and the design, improvement and construction standards and specifications applicable to development of the property subject to the development agreement shall be those ordinances, rules, plans and policies in force at the time of execution of the agreement. 
    A development agreement shall not prevent the city in subsequent actions applicable to the property from applying new rules, regulations, and policies which do not conflict with those rules, regulations, and policies applicable to the property as set forth in the agreement, nor shall a development agreement prevent the city from denying or conditionally approving any subsequent development project application on the basis of such existing or new rules, regulations and policies. 
(Code 1965, § 22A-5.) 
15.52.060 - Amendment-Cancellation. 
    Development agreements should only be used after careful consideration, because they limit the authority of future city councils to react to changed conditions. 
    A development agreement may be amended or cancelled by mutual consent of the parties or their successors in interest. Notice of intention to amend or cancel any portion of the agreement shall be given in the manner provided by Section 65867 of the Government Code. An amendment to a development agreement shall be subject to the provisions of Section 65867.5. In the event that state or federal laws or regulations, enacted after a development agreement has been entered into, prevent or preclude compliance with one or more provisions of the development agreement, such provisions of the agreement shall be modified or suspended as may be necessary to comply with such state or federal laws or regulations. 
(Code 1965, § 22A-6.) 
15.52.070 - Periodic review. 
A.  Each development agreement adopted by the city shall be subjected to a periodic review at least once every twelve months. At the time of such periodic review, the applicant, or the successor in interest thereto, shall be required to submit in writing documentation that demonstrates good faith compliance with the terms of the agreement. Such periodic review shall be conducted at a public hearing before the planning commission of the city. Within thirty days, following the date of such public hearing, or any continuation thereof, the planning commission's recommendation shall be forwarded to the city council for action to be taken with respect to such development agreement. 
B.  The city council shall receive and consider the recommendation of the planning commission. If, as a result of such periodic review, the city council finds and determines on the basis of substantial evidence, that the applicant or successor in interest hereto has not complied in good faith with the terms or conditions of the agreement, the city may terminate or modify the agreement, or set such additional terms as the city council may deem appropriate. 
C.  Each development agreement executed after the effective date of the ordinance codified in this section shall contain a requirement that the applicant or its successor shall annually submit a document which demonstrates good faith compliance with the terms of the agreement to the planning director. The date of such submittal shall be specified in the development agreement. 
D.  The requirement for an annual submittal of a document which demonstrates good faith compliance with the terms of the development agreement shall also apply to any development agreement executed before the date of adoption of the ordinance codified in this section. After said date, the city's planning director shall provide written notice to the applicant whose name appears in said development agreement, or their successor, notifying them of the requirement for submittal of said documentation. The applicant shall be required to provide the document which demonstrates the good faith compliance with the terms of the agreement within ninety days following receipt of the notice. The planning director shall schedule a public hearing before the planning commission for review of the documentation. The hearing shall occur within ninety days following date of receipt of the applicant's documents. 
E.  In the event any applicant fails to timely submit the required documentation as required by this section, the city council may take action to terminate or modify the development agreement. 
(Code 1965, § 22A-7.) 
15.52.080 - Recordation. 
    Within ten days after the effective date of a development agreement or any modification or cancellation thereof, the city clerk shall record the agreement or any modification or cancellation thereof in the office of the county recorder. 
(Code 1965, § 22A-8.) 
15.52.090 - Grant of development incentive. 
A.  A developer shall be entitled to a development incentive as described hereinafter, if the developer enters into either a development agreement pursuant to California Government Code Section 65865 et. seq. or another recorded contractual agreement satisfactory to the city with respect to the housing development in which the developer covenants to do all of the following: 
1.  To construct the housing development with at least one of the following: 
a.  At least twenty-four percent of the total units of the housing development reserved for lower income households, or 
b.  At least fourteen percent of the total units of the housing development reserved for very low income household, or 
c.  At least fifty percent of the total housing units of the housing development reserved for qualifying residents. 
2.  The agreement shall ensure continued affordability of all housing units reserved for lower income households or very low income households for the time period established in subsection (A)(3) of this section. Affordability shall be determined as follows: 
a.  Units targeted for lower income households shall be affordable at a rent, or monthly mortgage payment including principal and interest, that does not exceed thirty percent of sixty percent of the area median income as determined pursuant to Section 50079.5 of the California Health and Safety Code. 
b.  Units targeted for very low income households shall be affordable at a rent, or monthly mortgage payment include principal and interest, that does not exceed thirty percent of fifty percent of the area median income, as determined pursuant to Section 50105 of the California Health and Safety Code. 
3.  The time period for continued affordability of housing constructed pursuant to this section shall be a minimum period of fifteen years. Said time period shall otherwise be at a minimum equivalent to the term required by any construction or mortgage financing assistance program, mortgage insurance program or rental subsidy program for the housing development. 
4.  For the purposes of this section, the normal city fees for a development agreement application may be reimbursed as a concession by the city to further encourage the development of affordable housing hereunder. 
B.  Preliminary Proposal. 
1.  A developer shall submit a written preliminary proposal for development as an application for incentives under this section. The preliminary proposal shall be submitted in writing and provide the following information:

f.  A preliminary proposal may be submitted prior to any formal requests for general plan amendments, zoning amendments, specific plans, subdivision map approvals, or conditional use permits. 
2.  As consideration for granting development incentive hereunder, the project proponent shall prepare a fiscal impact analysis setting forth the general fiscal effects to the city, as well as the potential specific fiscal impacts to the various funds of the city which might be affected by the particular development concessions being requested (i.e., general fund, property taxes, police and fire safety fees, park development fees, etc.); recommendations of waived or reduced fees; and the positive or negative fiscal and/or economic benefits to the city for the granting of one or more incentives. Furthermore, the fiscal impact analysis must include an economic analysis demonstrating that the waiver or modification is necessary to make the housing units economically feasible (i.e., affordable), including the economic return of the development. 
3.  Within sixty-five days of receipt of a completed written preliminary proposal, said proposal shall be submitted for public hearing before the planning commission and city council as set forth at Section 15.52.040. 
C.  Development Incentives.

c.  A waiver or modification of certain development and/or zoning standards applicable to the site, provided the developer demonstrates that the waiver or modification is necessary to make the housing units economically feasible. 
d.  A development agreement must be in conformance with the general plan. The terms of the development agreement shall otherwise supersede the terms of any development standard with which it is in conflict. 
D.  Affordable Housing. 
1.  The type and number of incentives to be granted is at the sole discretion of the city council. The extent of such discretion shall be based upon, but not limited to the following factors: 
a.  The location of the project with respect to, and capacity of, available public facilities; 
b.  The type of housing; 
c.  Affordability needs as established in the general plan housing element; and 
d.  Value and type of incentives which will "contribute significantly to the economic feasibility of lower income housing." 
2.  This subsection shall not require the city to provide direct financial incentives or publicly owned land for the housing development, or to waive fees or dedication requirements. 
E.  Affordable Housing Plan. 
1.  Prior to the recordation of a final tentative or parcel map for a housing development for which a development agreement under this section has been granted, or the issuance of a building permit for a housing development not requiring a tentative or parcel map, the developer shall submit to the planning department for approval, a plan showing the developer's intended use of the incentives within the housing development. The planning department shall review the plan for compliance with the terms of this section and the proposed or approved development agreement. The determination of the planning department of the compliance of the plan with the development agreement may be reviewed by the planning commission upon appeal by the project proponent in writing submitted to the planning director within ten days following date of notice of the determination. 
F.  Incentives. Incentives granted in a development agreement entered into under this section shall not be deemed to be granted for the purposes of compliance with the "density bonus" requirements of state law. Such incentives shall not be automatically transferred should developer determine to request such density bonus after entering into a development agreement under this section.

For the purpose of calculating a density bonus, the residential units shall be on contiguous sites that are the subject of one development application, but do not have to be based upon individual subdivision maps or parcels. For purposes of this chapter, "housing development" does not include projects for less than five dwelling units.

2.  An applicant shall agree to, and the city shall ensure, that the initial occupant of moderate-income units that are directly related to the receipt of the density bonus in a common interest development, are persons and families of moderate income and that the units are offered at an affordable housing cost. The local government shall enforce an equity-sharing agreement, unless it is in conflict with the requirements of another public funding source or law. The following shall apply to the equity-sharing agreement: 
a.  Upon resale, the seller of the unit shall retain the value of any improvements, the down payment, and the seller's proportionate share of appreciation. The city shall recapture any initial subsidy and its proportionate share of appreciation, which shall then be used within three years for any of the purposes that promote homeownership as described in subdivision (e) of Section 33334.2 of the California Health and Safety Code that promote homeownership. 
b.  For purposes of this subdivision, the city's initial subsidy shall be equal to the fair market value of the home at the time of initial sale minus the initial sale price to the moderate-income household, plus the amount of any down payment assistance or mortgage assistance. If upon resale the market value is lower than the initial market value, then the value at the time of the resale shall be used as the initial market value. 
c.  For purposes of this subdivision, the city's proportionate share of appreciation shall be equal to the ratio of the initial subsidy to the fair market value of the home at the time of initial sale. 
3.  The resale price of any owner-occupied affordable unit shall not exceed the affordable ownership costs with the following exceptions: (i) customary closing costs and costs of sale; or (ii) costs of real estate commissions paid by the seller if a licensed real estate salesperson is employed; or (iii) consideration of permanent capital improvements installed by the seller. 
4.  These provisions for continued affordability shall be a provision of the density bonus housing agreement required by section 15.60.130 hereof. 
E.  Specification of Basis for Density Bonus. Each applicant who requests a density bonus pursuant to this section, shall elect whether the bonus will be awarded on the basis of subsection (A)(1), (A)(2), (A)(3) or subsection (B) of this section. Each housing development is entitled to only one density bonus, which may be selected based on the percentage of either very low income affordable housing units, lower-income affordable housing units or moderate-income affordable housing units, or the development's status as a senior citizen housing development. Density bonuses from more than one of these categories may not be combined. 
(Ord. No. 1461, § 1, 3-12-13) 
15.60.040 - Additional density bonus for donations of land. 
A.  Upon written request, when an applicant for a tentative map, subdivision map, parcel map, or other residential development approval qualified for a density bonus pursuant to section 15.60.030 also donates land to the city in accordance with this section, the applicant shall be entitled to an additional density bonus. Applicants donating land to the city shall be eligible for an additional fifteen percent density bonus at the site of the housing development if the donated land is suitable for the construction of very low income units equaling at least ten percent of the market-rate units being constructed for the project. The density bonus provided pursuant to this section shall be in addition to any density bonus granted pursuant to section 15.60.030, up to a maximum combined density bonus of thirty-five percent. 
B.  To qualify for the additional density bonus described in subsection (A) of this section, the donation of land must meet all of the following criteria: 
1.  The tentative map, subdivision map, parcel map, or other residential development must otherwise be subject to a density bonus pursuant to section 15.60.030; and 
2.  The land must be transferred no later than the date of the approval of the final subdivision map, parcel map, or housing development application; and 
3.  The developable acreage and zoning classification of the land being transferred must be sufficient to permit construction of dwelling units affordable to very low income households in an amount not less than ten percent of the total number of market rate dwelling units in the proposed development (i.e., the proposed development before the addition of any density bonus); and 
4.  The donated land is at least one acre in size or is large enough to permit development of at least forty units, has the appropriate general plan land use designation, has the appropriate zoning and development standards for affordable housing and, at the time of project approval is, or at the time of construction will be, served by adequate public facilities and infrastructure; and

15.60.050 - Density bonus and incentives for condominium conversions. 
A.  An applicant for a conversion of existing rental apartments to condominiums is eligible for either a density bonus or other incentives of equivalent financial value, at the option of the city, if the applicant agrees to provide: 
(1)  At least thirty-three percent of the total units of the proposed condominium project to persons and families of low or moderate income as defined in Section 50093 of the Health and Safety Code, or

Qualified applicants may choose to implement a lower density bonus. 
2.  Incentives of equivalent financial value in the form of a reduction or waiver of requirements or fees which the city might otherwise apply as conditions of conversion approval. "Other incentives of equivalent financial value" shall not be construed to require the city to provide cash transfer payments or other monetary compensation to the condominium conversion project or its applicant. 
C.  The city reserves the right to place such reasonable conditions on the granting of a density bonus or other incentives of equivalent financial value pursuant to this section as it finds appropriate, including, but not limited to, conditions which assure continued affordability of units to subsequent purchasers who are persons and families of low and moderate income or lower income households. 
D.  Condominium conversions are eligible only for the granting of a density bonus or incentive of equivalent value pursuant to this section, which bonus or incentive may not be granted in addition to, or combined with, any other incentives, concessions, density bonuses or waivers and reductions of development standards pursuant other sections of this chapter.

C.  For the purpose of calculating a density bonus, the dwelling units shall be on contiguous sites that are the subject of one development application, but do not have to be based upon individual subdivision maps or parcels. The density bonus shall be permitted in geographic areas of the housing development other than the areas where the affordable units are located. 
D.  For the purposes of this chapter, the term "total units" or "total dwelling units" in a housing development does not include those units added by any density bonus. 
E.  Regardless of the number or extent of affordable units, senior housing, land dedication, childcare facilities or other qualifications for a density bonus provided in any single housing development, no housing development may be entitled to a total density bonus of more than thirty-five percent.

15.60.080 - Incentives and concessions. 
A.  Definition of a Qualified Concession or Incentive. An applicant for a density bonus pursuant to section 15.60.030 may also submit to the city a written proposal for specific incentives or concessions as provided in this section. The applicant may also request a meeting with the city's city manager or his/her designee to discuss such proposal. For purposes of this chapter, concessions and incentives include any of the following: 
1.  Reductions in site development standards or modifications of zoning requirements or architectural design requirements that exceed the minimum building standards approved by the California Building Standards Commission as provided in Part 2.5 (commencing with Section 18901) of Division 13 of the California Health & Safety Code. These include, without limitation, a reduction in setback and square footage requirements and in the ratio of vehicular parking spaces that would otherwise be required. In order to qualify as a "concession or incentive," the city must be able to find that the requested reductions in site development standards result in identifiable, financially sufficient, and actual cost reductions; or 
2.  Approval of mixed use zoning in conjunction with the housing development if commercial, office, industrial, or other land uses will reduce the cost of the housing development and if the commercial, office, industrial or other land uses are compatible with the housing development and the existing or planned development in the area where the proposed housing development will be located; or 
3.  Other regulatory incentives or concessions proposed by the applicant or the city, so long as the city can find that such proposals result in identifiable, financially sufficient, and actual cost reductions. 
B.  Findings to Deny Concession or Incentive. The city shall grant the concession or incentive requested by the applicant unless the city makes a written finding, based upon substantial evidence, of any of the following: 
1.  The concession or incentive is not required in order to provide for affordable housing costs or for affordable rents for the targeted units to be set as specified in section 15.60.030(D); or 
2.  The concession or incentive would have a specific adverse impact; or 
3.  The concession or incentive would be contrary to state or federal law. 
C.  Number of Concessions or Incentives. If all other provisions of this section are satisfied, an applicant will be eligible for the following number of incentives and concessions: 
1.  One incentive or concession for housing developments where at least five percent of the total units are for very low income households, at least ten percent of the total units are for lower income households, or at least ten percent of the total units in a common interest development are sold to moderate income households; or 
2.  Two incentives or concessions for housing developments where at least ten percent of the total units are for very low income households, at least twenty percent of the total units are for lower income households, or at least twenty percent of the total units in a common interest development are sold to moderate income households. 
3.  Three incentives or concessions for housing developments where at least fifteen percent of the total units are for very low income households, at least thirty percent of the total units are for lower income households, or at least thirty percent of the total units in a common interest development are sold to moderate income households.

(3) No incentives or concessions are available for land donation.  
D.  This section does not limit or require the provision of direct financial incentives for the housing development, including the provision of publicly-owned land, by the city or the waiver of fees or dedication requirements. Nor does any provision of this section require the city to grant an incentive or concession found to have a specific adverse impact. 
E.  The granting of a concession or incentive shall not be interpreted, in and of itself, to require a General Plan amendment, zoning change, or other discretionary approval. 
(Ord. No. 1461, § 1, 3-12-13) 
15.60.090 - Waivers and modifications of development standards. 
A.  Applicants granted a density bonus pursuant to section 15.60.030 may, by written proposal, seek a waiver, modification or reduction of development standards that would otherwise have the effect of physically precluding the construction of the housing development at the densities or with the concessions or incentives permitted pursuant to this chapter. The applicant may also request a meeting with the city to discuss such request for waivers and modifications. 
B.  To obtain a waiver or modification of development standards, the applicant shall show that the development standards will have the effect of physically precluding the construction of a housing development meeting the criteria of section 15.60.030(A) and (B) at the densities or with the concessions or incentives permitted by this chapter. 
C.  A proposal for the waiver or reduction of development standards pursuant to this section shall neither reduce nor increase the number of incentives or concessions to which the applicant is entitled pursuant to section 15.60.080.

2.  Two to three-bedroom units: Two on-site parking spaces. 
3.  Four and more bedroom units: Two and one-half parking spaces. 
    Guest parking and handicapped parking shall be included within the maximum number of spaces that may be required. If the total number of parking spaces required for a housing development is other than a whole number, the number shall be rounded up to the next whole number. For purposes of this section, a housing development may provide on-site parking through tandem parking or uncovered parking, but not through on-street parking. For purposes of this chapter, the parking ratios set forth in this section shall be deemed a concession or incentive available to the applicant under section 15.60.080. 
(Ord. No. 1461, § 1, 3-12-13) 
15.60.110 - Standards for density bonus housing developments. 
A.  Affordable units qualifying a housing development for a density bonus shall be reasonably dispersed throughout the housing development and compatible with the design of market-rate units in terms of appearance, materials, and finished quality. The applicant may reduce the interior amenities and square footage of inclusionary units, provided all units conform to all other requirements of this code. 
B.  For developments with multiple market-rate units containing differing numbers of bedrooms, affordable units qualifying as a housing development for a density bonus shall be representative of the market-rate unit mix. 
C.  All building permits for affordable units qualifying a housing development for a density bonus shall be issued concurrently with, or prior to, issuance of building permits for the market rate units, and the affordable units shall be constructed concurrently with, or prior to, construction of the market rate units. Occupancy permits and final inspections for affordable units qualifying a housing development for a density bonus shall be approved concurrently with, or prior to, approval of occupancy permits and final inspections for the market rate units. 
(Ord. No. 1461, § 1, 3-12-13) 
15.60.120 - Application requirements. 
A.  A written application for a density bonus, incentive, concession, waiver, or modification pursuant to this chapter shall be submitted with the first application for approval of a housing development and processed concurrently with all other applications required for the housing development. The application shall be submitted on the form prescribed by the city's director of community development pursuant to chapter 17.48 of this code and shall additionally include at least the following information: 
1.  Site plan showing total number of units, number and location of affordable units, and number and location of proposed density bonus units. The site plan shall describe the size, in square footage, of all affordable units and density bonus units. 
2.  A marketing plan that describes how the applicant will inform the public and those within the appropriate income groups of the availability of affordable units. 
3.  The location, structure (attached, semi-attached, or detached), proposed tenure (for sale or rental), and size of the proposed market-rate units, any commercial space, density bonus units, and/or affordable units. 
4.  Level of affordability proposed for each affordable housing unit and proposals for ensuring affordability. 
5.  Description of any requested incentives, concessions, waivers or modifications of development standards, or modified parking standards. The application shall include evidence that the requested incentives and concessions are required for the provision of affordable housing costs and/or affordable rents, as well as, evidence relating to any other factual findings required under section 15.60.050. 
6.  If a density bonus or concession is requested in connection with a land donation, the application shall show the location of the land to be dedicated and provide evidence that each of the findings included in section 15.60.080 can be made. 
7.  If a density bonus or concession/incentive is requested for a childcare facility, the application shall show the location and square footage of the childcare facilities and provide evidence that each of the findings included in section 15.60.090 can be made.

9.  Any other information reasonably requested by the planning commission to assist with evaluation of the application. 
B.  An application for a density bonus, incentive or concession pursuant to this chapter shall be considered by and acted upon by the approval body with authority to approve the housing development (generally the city's planning commission) and subject to the same administrative appeal procedure, if any, as more particularly described in chapter 17.68 of this zoning code. In accordance with state law, neither the granting of a concession, incentive, waiver, or modification nor the granting of a density bonus shall be interpreted, in and of itself, to require a general plan amendment, zoning change, variance, or other discretionary approval. Provisions of this code governing standards of design review and/or special use permits that are more restrictive than, or contrary to, the provisions of this chapter shall be inapplicable to an application for density bonus. 
C.  For housing developments requesting a waiver, modification or reduction of a development standard, an application pursuant to this subsection shall be heard in conjunction with the application for density bonus in accordance with chapter 17.68 of this zoning code.

Pursuant to Government Code Section 65915, the planning commission shall approve the requested waiver/modification or reduction of development standards, unless one of the following conditions applies: 
1.  The development standards subject to the waiver/modification do not have the effect of physically precluding the construction of the housing development at the densities or with the concessions or incentives permitted pursuant to this chapter. 
2.  The waiver/modification will have a specific adverse impact. 
D.  The decision of the city planning commission may be appealed to the city council in accordance with chapter 17.68. Notice of any city determination pursuant to this section shall be provided to the same extent as required for the underlying development approval.

(a)  The affordable units shall be leased to and occupied by eligible households; 
(b)  The affordable units shall be leased at rent levels affordable to eligible households for the full duration of the affordability period; 
(c)  Subleasing of affordable units shall not be permitted without the express written consent of the city; and 
(d)  Title to the subject property shall only be transferred with prior written approval by the city. 
7.  Any additional obligations relevant to the compliance with this chapter.

15.60.140 - Administrative fee. 
    An administrative fee shall be charged to the applicant for city review of all materials submitted in accordance with this chapter and for on-going enforcement of the provisions of this chapter. The fee amount shall be established by city council resolution. Fees will be charged for staff time and materials associated with the following activities: development review process, agreement drafting, project marketing and lease-up, and estimated city-incurred costs of monitoring long-term compliance of the affordable units.

    "Floodplain" or "flood-prone area" means any land area susceptible to being inundated by water from any source; see also "flooding." 
    "Floodplain administrator" is the person appointed by the city to administer and enforce the floodplain management regulations. 
    "Floodplain management" means the operation of an overall program of corrective and preventive measures for reducing flood damage and preserving and enhancing, where possible, natural resources in the floodplain, including but not limited to emergency preparedness plans, flood control works, floodplain management regulations, and open space plans. 
    "Floodplain management regulations" means this chapter and other zoning ordinances, subdivision regulations, building codes, health regulations, special purpose ordinances (such as grading and erosion control) and other application of police power which control development in flood-prone areas. This term describes federal, state or local regulations in any combination which provide standards for preventing and reducing flood loss and damage. 
    "Flood proofing" means any combination of structural and nonstructural additions, changes, or adjustments to structures which reduce or eliminate flood damage to real estate or improved real property, water and sanitary facilities, structures, and their contents. FEMA Technical Bulletins TB 1-93, TB 3-93, and TB 7-93, as they may be amended, provide guidelines on dry and wet flood Proofing. 
    "Floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. Also referred to as "Regulatory floodway." 
    "Floodway fringe" is that area of the floodplain on either side of the "Regulatory floodway" where encroachment may be permitted. 
    "Fraud and victimization" as related to Section 15.64.070, Variances, of this chapter, means that the variance granted must not cause fraud on or victimization of the public. In examining this requirement, the City of Banning will consider the fact that every newly constructed building adds to government responsibilities and remains a part of the city for fifty to one-hundred years. Buildings that are permitted to be constructed below the base flood elevation are subject during all those years to increased risk of damage from floods, while future owners of the property and the city as a whole are subject to all the costs, inconvenience, danger, and suffering that those increased flood damages bring. In addition, future owners may purchase the property, unaware that it is subject to potential flood damage, and can be insured only at very high flood insurance rates. 
    "Functionally dependent use" means a use which cannot perform its intended purpose unless it is located or carried out in close proximity to water. The term includes only docking and related facilities that are necessary for the loading and unloading of cargo or passengers and does not include long-term storage or related manufacturing facilities. 
    "Governing body" is the local governing unit, i.e. county or municipality, that is empowered to adopt and implement regulations to provide for the public health, safety and general welfare of its citizenry. 
    "Hardship" in the context of Section 15.64.070, Variances, of this chapter means exceptional hardship that would result from a failure to grant the requested variance. The City of Banning requires that the variance be exceptional, unusual, and peculiar to the property involved. Mere economic or financial hardship alone is not exceptional. Inconvenience, aesthetic considerations, physical handicaps, personal preferences, or the disapproval of one's neighbors likewise cannot, as a rule, qualify as an exceptional hardship. All of these problems can be resolved through other means without granting a variance, even if the alternative is more expensive, or requires the property owner to build elsewhere or put the parcel to a different use than originally intended. 
    "Highest adjacent grade" means the highest natural elevation of the ground surface prior to construction next to the proposed walls of a structure. 
    "Historic structure" means any structure that is: 
1.  Listed individually in the National Register of Historic Places (a listing maintained by the Department of Interior) or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as meeting the requirements for individual listing on the National Register; 
2.  Certified or preliminarily determined by the Secretary of the Interior as contributing to the historical significance of a registered historic district or a district preliminarily determined by the Secretary to qualify as a registered historic district; 
3.  Individually listed on a state inventory of historic places in states with historic preservation programs which have been approved by the Secretary of the Interior; or 
4.  Individually listed on a local inventory of historic places in communities with historic preservation programs that have been certified either by an approved state program as determined by the Secretary of the Interior or directly by the Secretary of the Interior in states without approved programs. 
    "Levee" means a man-made structure, usually an earthen embankment, designed and constructed in accordance with sound engineering practices to contain, control or divert the flow of water so as to provide protection from temporary flooding. 
    "Levee system" means a flood protection system which consists of a levee, or levees, and associated structures, such as closure and drainage devices, which are constructed and operated in accord with sound engineering practices. 
    "Lowest floor" means the lowest floor of the lowest enclosed area, including basement; (see also "basement" definition, above). 
1.  An unfinished or flood resistant enclosure below the lowest floor that is usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage in an area other than a basement area, is not considered a building's lowest floor provided it conforms to applicable non-elevation design requirements, including, but not limited to: 
a.  The wet flood proofing standard in Section 15.64.060(A)(3); 
b.  The anchoring standards in Section 15.64.060(A); 
c.  The construction materials and methods standards in Section 15.64.060(A)(2); and 
d.  The standards for utilities in Section 15.64.060(B). 
2.  For residential structures, all sub-grade enclosed areas are prohibited as they are considered to be basements (see "basement" definition). This prohibition includes below-grade garages and storage areas. 
    "Manufactured home" means a structure, transportable in one or more sections, which is built on a permanent chassis and is designed for use with or without a permanent foundation when attached to the required utilities. The term "manufactured home" does not include a "Recreational vehicle". 
    "Manufactured home park or subdivision" means a parcel (or contiguous parcels) of land divided into two or more manufactured home lots for rent or sale. 
    "Market value" means a value that shall be determined by estimating the cost to replace the structure in new condition and adjusting that cost figure by the amount of depreciation which has accrued since the structure was constructed. The cost of replacement of the structure shall be based on a square foot cost factor determined by reference to a building cost estimating guide recognized by the building construction industry. The amount of depreciation shall be determined by taking into account the age and physical deterioration of the structure and functional obsolescence as approved by the floodplain administrator, but shall not include economic or other forms of external obsolescence. Use of replacement costs or accrued depreciation factors different from those contained in recognized building cost estimating guides may be considered only if such factors are included in a report prepared by an independent professional appraiser and supported by a written explanation of the differences. 
    "Mean sea level" means, for purposes of the National Flood Insurance Program, the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929 or other datum, to which base flood elevations shown on a city's flood insurance rate map are referenced. 
    "New construction", for floodplain management purposes, means structures for which the "Start of construction" commenced on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by this city, and includes any subsequent improvements to such structures. 
    "New manufactured home park or subdivision" means a manufactured home park or subdivision for which the construction of facilities for servicing the lots on which the manufactured homes are to be affixed (including at a minimum, the installation of utilities, the construction of streets, and either final site grading or the pouring of concrete pads) is completed on or after the effective date of floodplain management regulations adopted by the city. 
    "Obstruction" includes, but is not limited to, any dam, wall, wharf, embankment, levee, dike, pile, abutment, protection, excavation, channelization, bridge, conduit, culvert, building, wire, fence, rock, gravel, refuse, fill, structure, vegetation or other material in, along, across or projecting into any watercourse which may alter, impede, retard or change the direction and/or velocity of the flow of water, or due to its location, its propensity to snare or collect debris carried by the flow of water, or its likelihood of being carried downstream. 
    "One-hundred-year flood" see "base flood." 
    "Public safety and nuisance" as related to Section 15.64.070, Variances, of this chapter means that the granting of a variance must not result in anything which is injurious to safety or health of an entire city or neighborhood, or any considerable number of persons, or unlawfully obstructs the free passage or use, in the customary manner, of any navigable lake, or river, bay, stream, canal, or basin. 
    "Recreational vehicle" means a vehicle which is: 
1.  Built on a single chassis; 
2.  Four hundred square feet or less when measured at the largest horizontal projection; 
3.  Designed to be self-propelled or permanently towable by a light-duty truck; and 
4.  Designed primarily as temporary living quarters for recreational, camping, travel, or seasonal use, and not for use as a permanent dwelling. 
    "Regulatory floodway" means the channel of a river or other watercourse and the adjacent land areas that must be reserved in order to discharge the base flood without cumulatively increasing the water surface elevation more than one foot. 
    "Remedy a violation" means to bring the structure or other development into compliance with state or local floodplain management regulations, or, if this is not possible, to reduce the impacts of its noncompliance. Ways that impacts may be reduced include protecting the structures or other affected development from flood damages, implementing the enforcement provisions of the chapter or otherwise deterring future similar violations, or reducing state or federal financial exposure with regard to structures or other development. 
    "Riverine" means relating to, formed by, or resembling a river (including tributaries), stream, brook, etc. 
    "Special flood hazard area (SFHA)" means an area in the floodplain subject to a one percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. It is shown on an FHBM or FIRM as Zone A, AO, Al-A30, AE, A99 or AH. 
    "Start of construction" includes substantial improvement and other proposed new development and means the date the building permit was issued, provided the actual start of construction, repair, reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, placement, or other improvement was within one hundred eighty days from the date of issuance of the permit. The actual start means either the first placement of permanent construction of a structure on a site, such as the pouring of slab or footings, the installation of piles, the construction of columns, or any work beyond the stage of excavation; or the placement of a manufactured home on a foundation. Permanent construction does not include land preparation, such as clearing, grading, and filling; nor does it include the installation of streets and/or walkways; nor does it include excavation for a basement, footings, piers, or foundations or the erection of temporary forms; nor does it include the installation on the property of accessory buildings, such as garages or sheds not occupied as dwelling units or not part of the main structure. For a substantial improvement, the actual start of construction means the first alteration of any wall, ceiling, flood, or other structural part of a building, whether or not that alteration affects the external dimensions of the building. 
    "Structure" means a walled and roofed building that is principally above ground; including, but not limited to residences, office and commercial buildings, industrial plants, gas or liquid storage tanks and manufactured homes. 
    "Substantial damage" means damage of any origin sustained by a structure whereby the cost of restoring the structure to its before damaged condition would equal or exceed fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the damage occurred. 
    "Substantial improvement" means any reconstruction, rehabilitation, addition, or other proposed new development of a structure, the cost of which equals or exceeds fifty percent of the market value of the structure before the "Start of construction" of the improvement. This term includes structures which have incurred "substantial damage" regardless of the actual repair work performed. The term does not, however, include either: 
1.  Any project for improvement of a structure to correct existing violations or state or local health, sanitary, or safety code specifications which have been identified by the local code enforcement official and which are the minimum necessary to assure safe living conditions; or 
2.  Any alteration of a "historic structure" provided that the alteration will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an "historic structure". 
    "Variance" means a grant of relief from the requirements of this chapter which permits construction in a manner that would otherwise be prohibited by this chapter. 
    "Violation" means the failure of a structure or other development to be fully compliant with this chapter. A structure or other development without the elevation certificate, other certifications, or other evidence of compliance required in this chapter is presumed to be in violation until such time as that documentation is provided. 
    "Water surface elevation" means the height, in relation to the National Geodetic Vertical Datum (NGVD) of 1929, (or other datum, where specified) of floods of various magnitudes and frequencies in the floodplains of coastal or riverine areas. 
    "Watercourse" means a lake, river, creek, stream, wash, arroyo, channel or other topographic feature on or over which waters flow at least periodically. "Watercourse" includes specifically designated areas in which substantial flood damage may occur. 
(Code 1965, § 8A-3.) 
15.64.040 - General provisions. 
A.  Lands to Which this Chapter Applies. This chapter shall apply to all areas of special flood hazards within the jurisdiction of the City of Banning. 
B.  Basis for Establishing the Areas of Special Flood Hazard. The areas of special flood hazard identified by the Federal Insurance Administration (FIA) of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) in the most current Flood Insurance Study (FIS) and accompanying Flood Insurance Rate Maps (FIRMs) and Flood Boundary and Floodway Maps (FBFMs), and all subsequent amendments and/or revisions, are incorporated by this by reference and declared to be a part of this chapter. This FIS and attendant mapping is the minimum area of applicability of this chapter and may be supplemented by studies for other areas which allow implementation of this chapter and which are recommended to the City of Banning by the floodplain administrator. The study, FIRMs and FBFMs are on file at 99 E. Ramsey Street; Banning, CA 92220, Department of Public Works. 
C.  Compliance. Commencing on the effective date of this chapter, no structure or land shall hereafter be constructed, located, extended, converted, or altered without full compliance with the requirements of this chapter and other applicable regulations. Violation of the requirements (including violations of conditions and safeguards established in connection with conditions) shall constitute a misdemeanor. Nothing herein shall prevent the City of Banning from taking such lawful action as is necessary to prevent or remedy any violation. 
D.  Abrogation and Greater Restrictions. This chapter shall not be construed to repeal, abrogate, or impair any existing easements, covenants, or deed restrictions. However, if this chapter and another ordinance, easement, covenant, or deed restriction conflict or overlap, whichever imposes the more stringent restrictions shall prevail. 
E.  Interpretation. In the interpretation and application of this chapter, all provisions shall be: 
1.  Considered as minimum requirements; 
2.  Construed liberally in favor of the governing body; and 
3.  Deemed neither to limit nor repeal any other powers granted under state statutes. 
F.  Warning and Disclaimer of Liability. The degree of flood protection required by this chapter is considered reasonable for regulatory purposes and is based on scientific and engineering considerations. Larger floods can and will occur on rare occasions. Flood heights may be increased by man-made or natural causes. This chapter does not imply that land outside the areas of special flood hazards or uses permitted within such areas will be free from flooding or flood damages. This chapter shall not create liability on the part of City of Banning, any officer or employee thereof, the State of California, or the Federal insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency, for any flood damages that result from reliance on this chapter or any administrative decision lawfully made hereunder. 
(Code 1965, § 8A-4.) 
15.64.050 - Administration. 
A.  Development Permits. A development permit shall be obtained before any construction or other development begins within any area of special flood hazard established in Section 15.64.040(B). Application for a development permit shall be made on forms furnished by the floodplain administrator and may include, but not be limited to: plans in duplicate drawn to scale showing the nature, location, dimensions, and elevation of the area in question; existing or proposed structures, fill, storage of materials, drainage facilities; and the location of the foregoing. Specifically, the following information is required: 
1.  Site plan, including but not limited to: 
a.  For all proposed structures, spot ground elevations at building corners and twenty-foot or smaller intervals along the foundation footprint, or one-foot contour elevations throughout the building site; and 
b.  Proposed locations of water supply, sanitary sewer, and utilities; and 
c.  If available, the base flood elevation from the flood insurance study and/or flood insurance rate map; and 
d.  If applicable, the location of the regulatory floodway; and 
2.  Foundation design detail, including but not limited to: 
a.  Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level, of the lowest flood (including basement) of all structures, 
b.  For a crawl-space foundation, location and total net area of foundation openings as required in Section 15.64.060(A)(3) of this chapter and FEMA Technical Bulletins 1-93 and 7-93, and 
c.  For foundations placed on fill, the location and height of fill, and compaction requirements (compacted to ninety-five percent using the standard proctor test method); 
3.  Proposed elevation in relation to mean sea level to which any nonresidential structure will be flood proofed, required in Section 15.64.060(A)(3) of this chapter and FEMA Technical Bulletin TB 3-93; 
4.  Certifications listed in subsection (C)(4) of this section; and 
5.  Description of the extent to which any watercourse will be altered or relocated as a result of proposed development. 
B.  Designation of the Floodplain Administrator. The city manager is hereby designated as the floodplain administrator, to administer, implement, and enforce this chapter by granting or denying development permits in accord with its provisions, and taking such other actions as the floodplain administrator deems to be necessary to carry out the objectives of this chapter. 
C.  Duties and Responsibilities of the Floodplain Administrator. The duties and responsibilities of the floodplain administrator shall include, but not be limited to the following: 
1.  Permit Review. Review all development permit applications to determine whether: 
a.  Permit requirements of this chapter have been satisfied; 
b.  All other required state and federal permits have been obtained; 
c.  The site is reasonably safe from flooding; and 
d.  The proposed development would not affect adversely the carrying capacity of areas where base flood elevations have been determined but a floodway has not been designated. For purposes of this chapter, "affect adversely " means that the cumulative effect of the proposed development when combined with all other existing and anticipated development would increase the water surface elevation of the base flood more than one foot at any point. 
2.  Review, Use and Development of Other Base Flood Data. 
a.  When base flood elevation data has not been provided in accordance with subsection (A)(3) of this section, the floodplain administrator shall obtain, review, and reasonably utilize any base flood elevation and floodway data available from a federal or state agency, or other source, in order to administer this section. Any such information shall be submitted to the City of Banning for adoption; or 
b.  If no base flood elevation data is available from a federal or state agency or other source, then a base flood elevation shall be obtained using one of two methods from the FEMA publication "Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A Areas A Guide for Obtaining and Developing Base (Hundred-Year) Flood Elevations" dated July 1995, as amended and updated, in order to administer this section: 
i.  Simplified Method. 
(A)  Hundred- year or base flood discharge shall be obtained using the appropriate regression equation found in a U.S. Geological Survey publication, or the discharge-drainage area method; and 
(B)  Base flood elevation shall be obtained using the Quick-2 computer program developed by FEMA; or 
ii.  Detailed Method. The hundred-year or base flood discharge and the base flood elevation shall be obtained using detailed methods identified in FEMA Publication 265, published in July 1995 and titled: "Managing Floodplain Development in Approximate Zone A Areas-A Guide for Obtaining And Developing Base (Hundred-Year) Flood Elevations." 
3.  Notification to Other Agencies. In any proposed alteration or relocation of a watercourse: 
a.  Notify adjacent communities, the California Department of Fish & Game, the California Department of Water Resources, and all other agencies with jurisdiction, and obtain all necessary approvals and permits prior to alteration or relocation; 
b.  Submit evidence of such notifications to the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency; and 
c.  Assure that the flood carrying capacity within the altered or relocated portion of the watercourse is maintained. 
4.  Documentation of Floodplain Development. Obtain and maintain for public inspection and make available as needed the following: 
a.  Certification of compliance with Section 15.64.060(A)(3) (lowest flood elevations); 
b.  Certification of compliance with Section 15.64.060(A)(3)(b) (elevation or flood proofing of nonresidential structures); 
c.  Certification of compliance with Section 15.64.060(A)(3) (wet flood proofing standard); 
d.  Certification of compliance with Section 15.64.060(B) (subdivision standards); and 
e.  Certification of compliance with Section 15.64.060(F) (floodway encroachments). 
5.  Map Determinations. Make interpretations where needed, as to the exact location of the boundaries of the areas of special flood hazard. Where there appears to be a conflict between a mapped boundary and actual field conditions, grade and base flood elevations shall be used to determine the boundaries of the special flood hazard area. The person contesting the location of the boundary shall be given a reasonable opportunity to appeal the interpretation as provided in Section 15.64.070. 
6.  Remedial Action. Take action to remedy violations of this chapter as specified in this section. 
D.  Appeals. A decision of the floodplain administrator may be appealed to the city council by filing a written notice of appeal with the city clerk, with copy to the city attorney, within thirty days of receipt of notice of the decision which is to be appealed. The notice of appeal shall set forth all factual and legal issues, and all factual and legal contentions and legal arguments. The notice of appeal shall be accompanied by a notice of appeal filing fee in an amount to be set by the city council. The city council of the City of Banning shall hear and decide appeals when it is alleged there is an error in any requirement, decision, or determination made by the floodplain administrator in the enforcement or administration of this chapter. A tie vote of the city council shall be regarded as upholding the decision of the floodplain administrator. 
(Code 1965, § 8A-5.) 
15.64.060 - Flood hazard reduction. 
A.  Standards of Construction. In all areas of special flood hazards the following standards are required: 
1.  Anchoring. 
a.  All new construction and substantial improvements shall be adequately anchored to prevent flotation, collapse or lateral movement of the structure resulting from hydrodynamic and hydrostatic loads, including the effects of buoyancy. 
b.  All manufactured homes shall meet the anchoring standards of this subsection. 
2.  Construction Materials and Methods. All new construction and substantial improvement shall be constructed: 
a.  With flood resistant materials as specified in FEMA Technical Bulletin TB 2-93 and utility equipment resistant to flood damage; 
b.  Using methods and practices that minimize flood damage; 
c.  With electrical, heating, ventilation, plumbing and air conditioning equipment and other service facilities that are designed and/or located so as to prevent water from entering or accumulating within the components during conditions of flooding; and if 
d.  Within Zones AH or AO, so that there are adequate drainage paths around structures on slopes to guide flood waters around and away from proposed structures. 
3.  Elevation and Flood Proofing. (See Section 15.64.030 for definitions for "basement," "lowest floor," "new construction," "substantial damage" and "substantial improvement.") 
a.  Residential construction, new or substantial improvement, shall have the lowest flood, including basement: 
1.  In an AO zone, elevated above the highest adjacent grade to a height equal to or exceeding the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM, or elevated at least two feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified. (The State of California recommends that in AO zones without velocity the lowest flood be elevated above the highest adjacent grade to a height exceeding the depth number specified in feet on the FIRM by at least two feet, or elevated at least four feet above the highest adjacent grade if no depth number is specified.) 
ii.  In an A zone, elevated to or above the base flood elevation; said base flood elevation shall be determined by one of the methods in Section 15.64.050(C)(2)(b) of this chapter. (The State of California recommends the lowest floor be elevated at least two feet above the base flood elevation, as determined by the city.) 
iii.  In all other zones, elevated to or above the base flood elevation. (The State of California recommends the lowest flood be elevated at least two feet above the base flood elevation.) 
    Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest flood including basement shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor, and verified by the city's building inspector to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator. 
b.  Nonresidential construction, new or substantial improvement, shall either be elevated to conform with Section 15.64.050 or together with attendant utility and sanitary facilities: 
i.  Be flood proofed below the elevation recommended under subsection (A)(3) of this section so that the structure is watertight with walls substantially impermeable to the passage of water; 
ii.  Have structural components capable of resisting hydrostatic and hydrodynamic loads and effects of buoyancy; and 
iii.  Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect that the standards of subsection (A)(3) of this section are satisfied. Such certification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator. 
c.  All new construction and substantial improvement with fully enclosed areas below the lowest flood (excluding basements) that are usable solely for parking of vehicles, building access or storage, and which are subject to flooding, shall be designed to automatically equalize hydrostatic flood forces on exterior walls by allowing for the entry and exit of floodwater. Designs for meeting this requirement shall follow the guidelines in FEMA Technical Bulletins TB 1-93 and TB 7-93, and must exceed the following minimum criteria: 
i.  Have a minimum of two openings having a total net area of not less than one square inch for every square foot of enclosed area subject to flooding. The bottom of all openings shall be no higher than one foot above grade. Openings may be equipped with screens, louvers, valves or other coverings or devices provided that they permit the automatic entry and exit of floodwater; or 
ii.  Be certified by a registered professional engineer or architect. 
d.  Manufactured homes shall also meet the standards in subsection D of this section. 
B.  Standards for Utilities. 
1.  All new and replacement water supply and sanitary sewage systems shall be designed to minimize or eliminate: 
a.  Infiltration of flood waters into the systems; and 
b.  Discharge from the systems into flood waters. 
2.  On-site waste disposal systems shall be located to avoid impairment to them, or contamination from them during flooding. 
C.  Standards for Subdivisions. 
1.  All preliminary subdivision proposals shall identify the special flood hazard area and the elevation of the base flood. 
2.  All subdivision plans will provide the elevation of proposed structure(s) and pad(s). If the site is filled above the base flood elevation, the lowest flood and pad elevations shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor and provided to the floodplain administrator. 
3.  All subdivision proposals shall be consistent with the need to minimize flood damage. 
4.  All subdivision proposals shall have public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical and water systems located and constructed to minimize flood damage. 
5.  All subdivisions shall provide adequate drainage to reduce exposure to flood hazards. 
D.  Standards for Manufactured Homes. 
1.  All manufactured homes that are placed or substantially improved, within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the city's flood insurance rate map, on sites located: 
a.  Outside of a manufactured home park or subdivision, 
b.  In a new manufactured home park or subdivision, 
c.  In an expansion to an existing manufactured home park or subdivision, or 
d.  In an existing manufactured home park or subdivision on a site upon which a manufactured home has incurred "substantial damage" as the result of a flood, 
    Shall be elevated on a permanent foundation such that the lowest flood of the manufactured home is elevated to or above the base flood elevation. (The State of California recommends at least two feet above the base flood elevation) and that the manufactured home is to be securely fastened to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement. 
2.  All manufactured homes to be placed or substantially improved on sites in an existing manufactured home park or subdivision within Zones A1-30, AH and AE on the city's flood insurance rate map that are not subject to the provisions of subsection D of this section will be securely fastened to an adequately anchored foundation system to resist flotation, collapse, and lateral movement, and be elevated so that either the: 
a.  Lowest flood of the manufactured home is at or above the base flood elevation (the State of California recommends at least two feet above the base flood elevation); or 
b.  Manufactured home chassis is supported by reinforced piers or other foundation elements of at least equivalent strength that are no less than thirty-six inches in height above grade. 
3.  Upon the completion of the structure, the elevation of the lowest flood including basement shall be certified by a registered professional engineer or surveyor, and verified by the city building inspector to be properly elevated. Such certification and verification shall be provided to the floodplain administrator. 
E.  Standards for Recreational Vehicles. All Recreational Vehicles placed on sites within Zones A1-30, AH, and AE on the city's flood insurance rate map will either: 
1.  Be on the site for fewer than one hundred eighty consecutive days, and be fully licensed and ready for highway use - a recreational vehicle is ready for highway use if it is on its wheels or jacking system, is attached to the site only by quick disconnect type utilities and security devices, and has no permanently attached additions, or 
2.  Meet the permit requirements of Section 15.64.050(A) of this chapter and the elevation and anchoring requirements for manufactured homes in Section 15.64.060(D). 
F.  Floodways. Areas located within areas of special flood hazard established in Section 15.64.040(B) are areas designated as floodways. Since the floodway is an extremely hazardous area due to the velocity of flood waters, which carry debris, potential projectiles, and erosion potential, the following provisions apply. 
1.  Prohibit encroachments, including fill, new construction, substantial improvement, and other new development unless certification by a registered professional engineer is provided demonstrating that encroachments shall not result in any increase in [the base] flood elevation during the occurrence of the base flood discharge. 
2.  If subsection (F)(1) of this section is satisfied, all new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development shall comply with all other applicable flood hazard reduction provisions of this section. 
(Code 1965, § 8A-6.) 
15.64.070 - Variances. 
A.  Nature of Variances. 
1.  The issuance of a variance is for floodplain management purposes only. Insurance premium rates are determined by statute according to actuarial risk and will not be modified by the granting of a variance. 
2.  The variance criteria set forth in this section of the chapter are based on the general principle of zoning law that variances pertain to a piece of property and are not personal in nature. A variance may be granted by the floodplain administrator for a parcel of property with physical characteristics so unusual that complying with the requirements of this chapter would create an exceptional hardship to the applicant or the surrounding property owners. The characteristics must be unique to the property and not be shared by adjacent parcels. The unique characteristic must pertain to the land itself, not to the structure, its inhabitants, or the property owners. 
3.  It is the duty of the City of Banning to help protect its citizens from flooding. This need is so compelling and the implications of the cost of insuring a structure built below flood level are so serious that variances from the flood elevation or from other requirements in the flood chapter are quite rare. The long term goal of preventing and reducing flood loss and damage can be met only if variances are strictly limited. Therefore, the variance guidelines provided in this chapter are more detailed and contain multiple provisions that must be met before a variance may be granted. The criteria are designed to screen out those situations in which alternatives other than a variance are more appropriate. 
B.  Variance Appeal Board. In passing upon appeals of requests for variances which have been denied by the floodplain administrator, the city council of the City of Banning shall sit as a variance appeal board to consider all technical evaluations, all relevant factors, standards specified in other sections of this chapter, and: 
1.  Danger that materials may be swept onto other lands to the injury of others; 
2.  Danger to life and property due to flooding or erosion damage; 
3.  Susceptibility of the proposed facility and its contents to flood damage and the effect of such damage on the existing individual owner and future owners of the property; 
4.  Importance of the services provided by the proposed facility to the city; 
5.  Necessity to the facility of a waterfront location, where applicable; 
6.  Availability of alternative locations for the proposed use which are not subject to flooding or erosion damage; 
7.  Compatibility of the proposed use with existing and anticipated development; 
8.  Relationship of the proposed use to the comprehensive plan and floodplain management program for that area; 
9.  Safety of access to the property in time of flood for ordinary and emergency vehicles; 
10.  Expected heights, velocity, duration, rate of rise, and sediment transport of the flood waters expected at the site; and 
11.  Costs of providing governmental services during and after flood conditions, including maintenance and repair of public utilities and facilities such as sewer, gas, electrical, and water system, and streets and bridges. 
C.  Conditions for Variances. 
1.  Generally, variances may be issued by the floodplain administrator for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development to be erected on a lot of one-half acre or less in size contiguous to and surrounded by lots with existing structures constructed below the base flood level, providing that the procedures of Sections 15.64.050 and 15.64.060 of this chapter have been considered fully. As the lot size increases beyond one-half acre, the technical justification required for issuing the variance increases. 
2.  Variances may be issued for the repair or rehabilitation of "historic structures" (as defined in Section 15.64.030 of this chapter) upon a determination that the proposed repair or rehabilitation will not preclude the structure's continued designation as an historic structure and the variance is the minimum necessary to preserve the historic character and design of the structure. 
3.  Variances shall not be issued within any mapped regulatory floodway if any increase in flood levels during the base flood discharge would result. 
4.  Variances shall be issued only upon a determination that the variance is the "minimum necessary" considering the flood hazard, to afford relief. "Minimum necessary" means to afford relief with a minimum of deviation from the requirements of this chapter. For example, in the case of variances to an elevation requirement, this means the City of Banning need not grant permission for the applicant to build at grade, or even to whatever elevation the applicant proposes, but only to that elevation which the city believes will both provide relief and preserve the integrity of the local ordinance. 
5.  Any applicant to whom a variance is granted shall be given written notice over the signature of a city official that: 
a.  The issuance of a variance to construct a structure below the base flood level will result in increased premium rates for flood insurance up to amounts as high as twenty-five dollars for one hundred dollars of insurance coverage; and 
b.  Such construction below the base flood level increases risks to life and property. It is recommended that a copy of the notice shall be recorded by the floodplain administrator in the office of the riverside recorder and shall be recorded in a manner so that it appears in the chain of title of the affected parcel of land. 
6.  The floodplain administrator will maintain a record of all variance actions, including justification for their issuance, and report such variances issued in its biennial report submitted to the Federal Insurance Administration, Federal Emergency Management Agency. 
7.  Variances shall be issued only upon a: 
a.  Showing of good and sufficient cause; 
b.  Determination that failure to grant the variance would result in exceptional "hardship" (as defined in subsection (A)(2) of this section and Section 15.64.030 of this chapter) to the applicant; and 
c.  Determination that the granting of a variance will not result in increased flood heights, additional threats to public safety, or extraordinary public expense, create a nuisance (as defined in Section 15.64.030- see "Public safety or nuisance"), cause fraud or victimization (as defined in Section 15.64.030) of the public, or conflict with existing local laws or ordinances. 
8.  Variances may be issued for new construction, substantial improvement, and other proposed new development necessary for the conduct of a functionally dependent use provided that the provisions of Sections 15.64.060(A) through (F) have been satisfied and that the structure or other development is protected by methods that minimize flood damages during the base flood and does not result in additional threats to public safety and does not create a public nuisance. 
    Upon consideration of the factors of Section 15.64.060(A)(2) and the purposes of this chapter, the City of Banning may attach such conditions to the granting of variances as it deems necessary to further the purposes of this chapter.

Chapter 15.76 - THE WESTERN RIVERSIDE COUNTY TRANSPORTATION UNIFORM MITIGATION FEE[5] 

Footnotes: 
--- (5) --- 
Editor's note- Ord. No. 1514, §§ 1-11, adopted Sept. 11, 2017, repealed the former Ch. 15.76, §§ 15.76.010-15.76.080, and enacted a new Ch. 15.76 as set out herein. The former Ch. 15.76 pertained to similar subject matter and derived from Ord. No. 1412, §§ 1-7, 10, adopted Nov. 24, 2009. 

15.76.010. - Title. 
    This chapter shall be known as the "Western Riverside County Transportation Uniform Mitigation Fee Program Ordinance of 2017" ("Ordinance"). 
(Ord. No. 1514, § 1, 9-11-17) 
15.76.020. - Findings. 
A.  The city is a member agency of the Western Riverside Council of Governments ("WRCOG"), a joint powers agency comprised of the county of Riverside and eighteen cities located in Western Riverside County. Acting in concert, the WRCOG Member Agencies developed a plan whereby the shortfall in funds needed to enlarge the capacity of the Regional System of Highways and Arterials in Western Riverside County (the "Regional System") could be made up in part by a Transportation Uniform Mitigation Fee ("TUMF") on future residential, commercial and industrial development. A map depicting the boundaries of Western Riverside County and the Regional System is attached here as Exhibit "A" and incorporated herein. As a Member Agency of WRCOG and as a TUMF Participating Jurisdiction, the city participated in the preparation of a certain "Western Riverside County Transportation Uniform Fee Nexus Study," dated October 18, 2002 (the "2002 Nexus Study") prepared in compliance with the Mitigation Fee Act (Gov. Code §§ 66000 et seq.) and adopted by the WRCOG Executive Committee. Based on the 2002 Nexus Study, the city adopted and implemented an ordinance, Ordinance 1344, authorizing the city's participation in a TUMF Program. 
B.  WRCOG, with the assistance of TUMF Participating Jurisdictions, has prepared an updated nexus study entitled "Transportation Uniform Mitigation Fee Nexus Study: 2016 Update" ("2016 Nexus Study") pursuant to California Government Code sections 66000 et seq. ("the Mitigation Fee Act"), for the purpose of updating the fees. On July 10, 2017, the WRCOG Executive Committee reviewed the 2016 Nexus Study and TUMF Program and recommended TUMF Participating Jurisdictions amend their applicable TUMF ordinances to reflect changes in the TUMF network and the cost of construction in order to update the TUMF Program. 
C.  Consistent with its previous findings made in the adoption of Ordinance No. 1344, the city council has been informed and advised, and hereby finds, that if the capacity of the regional system is not enlarged and unless development contributes to the cost of improving the regional system, the result will be substantial traffic congestion in all parts of Western Riverside County, with unacceptable levels of service. Furthermore, the failure to mitigate growing traffic impacts on the regional system will substantially impair the ability of public safety services (police and fire) to respond and, thus, adversely affect the public health, safety and welfare. Therefore, continuation of a TUMF Program is essential. 
D.  The city council finds and determines that there is a reasonable and rational relationship between the use of the TUMF and the type of development projects on which the fees are imposed because the fees will be used to construct the transportation improvements that are necessary for the safety, health and welfare of the residential and non-residential users of the development in which the TUMF will be levied. 
E.  The city council finds and determines that there is a reasonable and rational relationship between the need for the improvements to the regional system and the type of development projects on which the TUMF is imposed because it will be necessary for the residential and non-residential users of such projects to have access to the regional system. Such development will benefit from the regional system improvements and the burden of such developments will be mitigated in part by payment of the TUMF. 
F.  The city council finds and determines that the cost estimates set forth in the new 2016 Nexus Study are reasonable cost estimates for constructing the regional system improvements and the facilities that compromise the regional system, and that the amount of the TUMF expected to be generated by new development will not exceed the total fair share cost to such development. 
G.  The fees collected pursuant to this chapter shall be used to help pay for the design, planning, construction of and real acquisition for the regional system improvements and its facilities as identified in the 2016 Nexus Study. The need for the improvements and facilities is related to new development because such development results in additional traffic and creates the demand for the improvements. 
H.  By notice duly given and published, the city council set the time and place for a public hearing on the 2016 Nexus Study and the fees proposed thereunder and at least ten days prior to this hearing, the city council made the 2016 Nexus Study available to the public. 
I.  At the time and place set for the hearing, the city council duly considered data and information provided by the public relative to the cost of the improvements and facilities for which the fees are proposed and all other comments, whether written or oral, submitted prior to the conclusion of the hearing. 
J.  The city council finds that the 2016 Nexus Study proposes a fair and equitable method for distributing a portion of the unfunded costs of improvements and facilities to the regional system. 
K.  The city council hereby adopts the 2016 Nexus Study and its findings. The 2016 Nexus Study is attached and incorporated herein as Exhibit "B." 
L.  The city council hereby adopts this chapter to amend and supersede the provisions of Ordinance No. 1344.

i.  The fees shall be paid at the time a certificate of occupancy is issued for the development project or upon final inspection, whichever comes first (the "payment date"). However this section should not be construed to prevent payment of the fees prior to issuance of an occupancy permit or final inspection. Fees may be paid at the issuance of a building permit, and the fee payment shall be calculated based on the fee in effect at that time, provided the developer tenders the full amount of his/her TUMF obligation. If the developer makes only a partial payment prior to the payment date, the amount of the fee due shall be based on the TUMF fee schedule in place on the payment date. The fees shall be calculated according to fee schedule set forth in the ordinance and the calculation methodology set forth in the Fee Calculation Handbook adopted July 14, 2003, as amended from time to time. 
ii.  The fees required to be paid shall be the fee amounts in effect at the time of payment is due under this chapter, not the date the ordinance is initially adopted. The city shall not enter into a development agreement which freezes future adjustments of the TUMF. 
iii.  If all or part of any development project is sold prior to payment of the fee, the property shall continue to be subject to the requirement for payment of the fee. The obligation to pay the fee shall run with the land and be binding on all the successors in interest to the property. 
iv.  Fees shall not be waived. 
C.  Disposition of Fees. All fees collected hereunder shall be transmitted to the executive director of WRCOG along with a corresponding remittance report by the tenth day of the close of the month for the previous month in which the fees were collected for deposit, investment, accounting and expenditure in accordance with the provisions of this chapter, TUMF administrative plan, and the Mitigation Fee Act. 
D.  Appeals. Appeals shall be filed with WRCOG in accordance with the provisions of the TUMF administrative plan. Appealable issues shall be the application of the fee, application of credits, application of reimbursement, application of the legal action stay and application of exemption. 
E.  Reports to WRCOG. The director of building and safety, or his/her designee, shall prepare and deliver to the executive director of WRCOG, periodic reports as will be established under Section 15.76.070 of this chapter. 
(Ord. No. 1514, § 6, 9-11-17)

    WRCOG is hereby appointed as the administrator of the transportation uniform mitigation fee program. WRCOG is hereby authorized to receive all fees generated from the TUMF within the city, and to invest, account for and expend such fees in accordance with the provisions of this chapter and the Mitigation Fee Act. The detailed administrative procedures concerning the implementation of this chapter shall be contained in the TUMF administrative plan. Furthermore, the TUMF administrator shall use the fee calculation handbook adopted July 14, 2003, as amended from time to time, for the purpose of calculating a developer's TUMF obligation. In addition to detailing the methodology for calculating all TUMF obligations of different categories of new development, the purpose of the fee calculation handbook is to clarify for the TUMF administrator, where necessary, the definition and calculation methodology for uses not clearly defined in the respective TUMF ordinances. 
    WRCOG shall expend only that amount of the funds generated from the TUMF for staff support, audit, administrative expenses, and contract services that are necessary and reasonable to carry out its responsibilities and in no case shall the funds expended for salaries and benefits exceed one percent of the revenue raised by the TUMF program. The TUMF administrative plan further outlines the fiscal responsibilities and limitations of the administrator.

17.08.050 - Accessory structures. 
    Accessory structures in residential zoning districts shall be compatible with the materials and architecture of the primary dwelling of the property. Accessory structures may only be constructed on a lot containing a main dwelling unit. Accessory structures may be built to within five feet of the interior side and rear property lines as long as these structures are not closer than ten feet to any other structure. 
(Zoning Ord. dated 1/31/06, § 9102.03(2)(A).) 
(Ord. No. 1439, § 3, 9-13-11; Ord. No. 1488, § 3.2.b., 6-9-15; Ord. No. 1510, § 3(2), 9-11-17) 
17.08.060 - Day care center design standards. 
A.  Day Care Homes for up to six (6) children are allowed in all residential zones. 
B.  Large day care homes taking care of 7 to 12 children may be located no closer than 500 feet in any direction from an existing large family day care home, measured from property line to property line, except that they may be located no closer than 250 feet measured from property line to property line from any existing large family day care home fronting on a different street. 
C.  Day Care Centers are those uses with more than twelve children, and are considered a specific land use regulated by the City's zoning code. These are permitted in certain residential districts, are a conditional use in other residential districts, and are prohibited in the remaining group of residential districts. In zones where Day Care Centers are permitted or can obtain a Conditional Use Permit, these centers shall adhere to the following standards: 
1.  The facility must conform to all property development standards of the land use district in which it is located. 
2.  Large facilities may not be located within 500 feet of another day care center. 
3.  An outdoor recreation area of 75 square feet per child is required. The outdoor play area shall be located in the rear area. Stationary play equipment shall not be located in the front yard, or in the required side yards. 
4.  A six-foot high solid decorative fence or wall shall be constructed on all property lines with the exception of the front yard. No fences shall be allowed in the front yard. Materials, textures, colors and design of the fence or wall shall be compatible with on-site development and with adjacent properties. All fences or walls shall provide for safety with controlled points of entry. In cases where day care is located on a property larger than one acre, it is excessive to require as much fencing and walls as are indicated above, therefore, the this design standard may be adjusted by the Community Development Director with the approval of the Planning Commission. 
5.  Landscaping of the lot consistent with that prevailing in the neighborhood, or shall be of a higher quality, and must be installed and maintained pursuant to the Landscaping Standards shown in Chapter 17.32 of the City's Zoning Ordinances. 
6.  All on-site parking shall be provided pursuant to the provisions of Parking Standards shown in Chapter 17.28 of the City's Zoning Ordinances. On site vehicle turnaround or separate entrance and exit points, as well as adequate passenger loading spaces, must be provided. 
7.  All on site lighting shall be stationary, directed away from adjacent properties and public rights-of-way, and of an intensity appropriate to the permitted use of the property. 
8.  All on-site signage shall comply with the provisions of the City's Zoning Ordinances. 
9.  The center shall contain a fire extinguisher and smoke detector devices and shall meet all standards established by the City Fire Marshall. 
10.  A center within a residential land use district may operate up to 14 hours a day. 
D.  Large day care homes taking care of 7 to 12 children (as opposed to Day Care Centers taking care of 13 or more children), may be located no closer than 500 fee in any direction from an existing large family day care home, measured from property line to property line, except that they may be located no closer than 250 feet measured from property line to property line from any existing large family day care home fronting on a different street. 
(Zoning Ord. dated 1/31/06, § 9102.03(2)(B).)

    Pursuant to the policies of the General Plan, density transfers are permitted in the R/A/H and RR/H districts, based on the following provisions. 
A.  A property owner may apply the density allowed on a lot, or portion of a lot, designated R/A/H or RR/H which has slopes of 25% or more, to an adjacent lot, or to that portion of the same lot designated R/A or RR having less than 25% slope. 
B.  The density transfer shall only be allowed if that lot, or portion of a lot, from which the density is being taken is dedicated in perpetuity as natural open space, to an organization dedicated to that preservation, and approved by the City Council. 
C.  In no case shall a density transfer result in a total density of more than 150% of the density permitted on the buildable parcel. 
(Zoning Ord. dated 1/31/06, § 9102.03(2)(D).) 
17.08.090 - Golf courses and related facilities standards.

A.  State of the art water conservation techniques shall be incorporated into the design and irrigation of the golf course. Likewise treated effluent shall be used for irrigation where available. Although the City does not have non-potable infrastructure, projects should include provisions for future connections to non-potable water. 
B.  Drainage and storm sewer facilities should be designed with sufficiently sized and properly located storm sewers, drainage ditches, and catch basins so that runoff from rainwater and irrigation water does not at any time flow onto a public road or right-of-way. 
C.  Perimeter walls or fences shall be built in an aesthetically pleasing way, which takes the view into account, while providing safety to the public along public rights-of-way. 
D.  Accessory facilities such as club houses, maintenance buildings, and other structures, shall be designed and located to ensure compatibility and harmony with the golf course setting.

E.  Fees charged for accessory dwelling units. 
1.  Accessory dwelling units shall not be considered new residential uses for the purposes of calculating local agency connection fees or capacity charges for utilities, including water and sewer service. 
a.  For an accessory dwelling unit described in subsection D., the applicant shall not be required to install a new or separate utility connection directly between the accessory dwelling unit and the utility or impose a related connection fee or capacity charge.

PUDs can also provide mixed use development, including a mix of commercial and residential development consistent with Section 17.08.160. 
    The purpose of a PUD is to allow clustered residential subdivisions and small lot subdivisions in zoning districts that allow higher densities: VLDR, LDR, MDR, and HDR. PUDs are prohibited in other zones. PUDs are subject to Design Review. Single family dwellings in PUDs may be either attached or detached. 
A.  Density. The underlying residential land use district shall determine the maximum number of dwelling units allowed in a PUD. Where parcels span more than one zone, the maximum number of dwelling units shall be determined by adding together the allowable density for each zone. Density transfer through the PUD project area is permitted for the promotion of clustering units in those areas suited to development, thus preserving the green space and natural features of the site. 

B.  Lot Size and Site Coverage. PUDs may create lot sizes to accommodate the creation of attached singe family dwelling units or clustered subdivisions. Structures shall not occupy more than forty percent of the gross site area. Smaller lot sizes can be considered on a case-by-case basis; however, smaller lots must demonstrate unique lot orientations (e.g. clustering with open space) and must provide project amenities such as common open spaces (unencumbered by utility easements), parks, recreation facilities, etc. 
C.  Number of Attached Units and Height of Structures. The maximum average number of single family units attached in any manner to form a single structure is six. Attached single family structures shall not exceed three stories or forty-two feet. Detached single family structures shall not exceed two and one-half stories, or thirty-five feet. 
D.  Setbacks. 
1.  Structural Setbacks from the project perimeter boundary 
Front Yard 15 feet Rear yard 15 feet Side Yard 15 feet  
2.  The minimum dwelling unit side structural setback from other dwelling unit structures is fifteen feet, plus one additional foot for each fifteen feet of structure length. 
E.  Open Space. 
1.  All PUDs with twelve or more dwelling units shall provide at least thirty percent of the total property as useable open space for passive and active recreational uses. Useable open space shall not include: 
a.  Rights-of-way; 
b.  Vehicle parking areas; 
c.  Areas adjacent to or between any structures which are less than fifteen feet apart; 
d.  Setbacks; 
e.  Patios and private yards; 
f.  Or slope areas greater than eight percent. 
2.  Useable open space that is encumbered by an underlying utility easement can be included in the open space requirement, but shall not be included in the required park land dedication as required in Banning Municipal Code Chapter 15.68. 
F.  Amenities. All PUDs shall provide recreational amenities within the site such as a: swimming pool; spa; clubhouse; tot lot with play equipment; court game facilities for tennis, basketball or racquetball; improved softball or baseball fields; or day care facilities. The type of amenities shall be approved by the Community Development Director and provided according to the following schedule: 
0 to 10 units 1 amenity 11-50 units 2 amenities 51 to 100 units 3 amenities 101 to 200 units 4 amenities 201 to 300 units 5 amenities Above 300 units one amenity should be added for each 100 additional units or fraction thereof.  
G.  Private Streets. Private streets shall be permitted when there is a homeowner's association established to maintain them. Streets shall be built to standards and specifications no less than those for public works construction. 
H.  Covenants. 
1.  Lots and dwelling units within a PUD may not be sold unless a corporation, homeowner's association, assessment district or other approved appropriate legal entity has been legally formed with the right to assess all those properties which are jointly owned or benefited to operate and maintain all of the mutually available features of the development including, but not limited to, open space, amenities, landscaping or slope maintenance landscaping (which may be on private lots adjacent to street rights-of-way). 
2.  No lot or dwelling unit may be sold unless all approved and required open space, amenities, landscaping and other improvements have been completed, or if completion is assured by a bond or other financing guarantee method approved by the City Engineer and/or City Attorney. 
I.  Fire Code. All parts of any structures shall be within 150 feet of paved access for single story residences, and within 50 feet of paved access for multi-story residential units. 
J.  Additional Standards. In addition to the PUD development requirements, the following specific standards contained in the zoning ordinances shall apply, including but not limited to: 
1.  Day care facilities; 
2.  Guest houses; 
3.  Lighting; 
4.  Minimum room size;

(Ord. No. 1509, § 3, 4-11-17) 
17.08.210 - Applicable regulations. 
    All uses are subject to the pertinent regulations of the Banning Zoning Ordinance, including, but not limited to the administrative procedures of the City and the Community Development Department. 
(Zoning Ord. dated 1/31/06, § 9102.04.) 
Article III. - Development Guidelines-Residential Design 

17.08.220 - Purpose. 
A.  These design guidelines are intended as a reference to help the developer in understanding the City's objectives for high quality residential development which retains its appearance, functionality, and value over time, and which adds to the community rather than detracting from it. The guidelines are a component of, and complement the mandatory land use district development standards in this Zoning Ordinance. 
B.  These design guidelines may be interpreted with some flexibility in their application to specific projects. These design guidelines are broken out into two categories: single family residential and multi-family residential. 
(Zoning Ord. dated 1/31/06, § 9102.05(1).) 
17.08.230 - Applicability. 
A.  The guidelines in this article shall apply to all residential development within the City, including additions, remodelling, relocation, and new construction. 
B.  These design guidelines shall be followed unless there is a compelling reason as to why they cannot be followed. If a guideline is waived by the approving authority, the Mayor and City Council shall be notified. The Mayor or any City Council person may appeal the waiver within 15 days of its approval. 
(Zoning Ord. dated 1/31/06, § 9102.05(2).) 
17.08.240 - Single-family site planning. 
A.  The single family site planning guidelines are intended to create highly functional neighborhoods, and visual variety along local streets. These guidelines encourage the incorporation of natural elements such as hills, mature trees, and streams into the fabric of residential neighborhoods. These guidelines intend to encourage: 
1.  Varied footprints; 
2.  Varied setbacks; 
3.  Varied placement of houses on adjacent lots; 
4.  Slowing vehicular traffic; 
5.  Preserve the natural land forms; 
6.  Prevent stark unbroken walls; 
7.  And uninterrupted straight streets, where the noise and speed of the streets predominate over the quiet and safety and calm of the residences in the neighborhood. 
B.  All single-family subdivision plans which include alternative lot sizes will be evaluated using the guidelines contained in this section, with emphasis on the following criteria: 
1.  The placement and mix of lots; 
2.  The preservation of wildlife habitat including mature trees, wildlife corridors, and natural features such as streams; 
3.  The preservation of views of all natural elements of the landscape including ridgelines, hills, lakes, wetlands, streams, trees, shrubs, and wildlife habitat; 
4.  The varied placement of dwelling units on a lot; 
5.  Provision of amenities such as landscaping, green space, native vegetation, subdivision entrance treatments, and so on; 
6.  The treatment of drainage and runoff from rain; 
7.  Wall and fence treatments; 
8.  And other unique amenities. 
C.  Varied Front Setbacks. The varied placement of homes and garages close to the street or further back from the street, can create more interesting patterns of visible open space. Designers should strive to avoid uniform and monotonous setbacks along any street, and should vary setbacks to enhance the feeling of open space. 
D.  Interruption of Straight Streets. When new streets are created, curved street designs are strongly encouraged over straight street designs. Elements such as knuckles, landscape medians, pavement enhancements should be introduced to limit the length of straight stretches. Streets should be connected and cul-de-sacs eliminated. Rear-loaded garages are encouraged. 
E.  Varied Side Yard Setbacks. The distance between adjoining homes, as well as between homes and fences or walls, should be varied, as this will result in more unique and interesting types of yards, play areas, gardens, and patio areas. 
F.  Attached Dwellings. Attached or clustered dwellings can create larger open areas between structures, and they can be designed to appear either attached or detached. Designers might consider using attached dwellings in certain sections of residential development. 
G.  Lot Orientation. Lots which are located on curves or at corners, can often be oriented in a different direction than lots in the middle of the block. Such lots may be non-rectangular, and may be angled on the street. Structures should be oriented so that a majority of primary living spaces receive direct sunlight during daylight hours. In new developments, structures should be positioned minimize the impact of shadows on adjacent properties and within the project. 
H.  Varied Lot Widths. On narrow lots, a variation of just a few feet in lot width can make a perceptible difference. Making some lots wider than average, and other lots narrower than average, can make the neighborhood more interesting, can allow for different configurations of open space, and can allow placement of different sizes and shapes of homes. 
I.  Varied Garage Placement and Orientation. Lot size permitting, garages can be placed on the front side of the house and can be entered from the front or from the side. Garages can also vary in size, and can be detached or connected to the primary residence, and can be accessed from the front or year yard. 
J.  Zero Lot Line Homes. Planned Unit Developments allow for homes to be placed flush against the side lot lines. Such zero lot line homes are compatible with the creation of sizes and shapes of patios, play areas, gardens, and courts, which could not occur in a traditional center plot layout. 

K.  Straight and Curved Streets. Although long, straight streets are often the most efficient layout, curves can provide more interesting and varied street scenes, and show harmony with the landscape and topography, and integration of a residential neighborhood into its natural surroundings. Whenever significant natural features are encountered in a development, such as hills, rivers, mature trees, chaparrals, wetlands and the like, such features should signal the designer that one or more curves may be beneficial to the street layout. 
L.  Walls. Walls and fences are an important part of the streetscape and should be designed thoughtfully. Walls and fences should have the following characteristics: 
1.  Both sides of all perimeter walls or fences should be architecturally treated. 
2.  Walls should be of smooth stucco finish, or of plaster or of other approved masonry or stonework. They should be designed in a style, materials and color to complement the adjacent dwelling units. 
3.  Additional materials may include tile insets, grillwork and wrought iron. The preferred choice for wrought iron is one inch pickets, at a maximum of six inches on center. 
4.  Decorative block can be used, but should complement the adjacent dwelling unit. 
5.  Chain link fences and barbed wire are not acceptable materials. 
6.  Wood, wrought iron, masonry, vinyl and adobe are acceptable fence/wall materials. 
7.  Decorative masonry walls, including, but not limited to, slump stone and split-face block can be used without a stucco or plaster finish, but must be architecturally treated and complement the adjacent dwelling units. 
8.  All property fencing must be compatible in design and of similar materials. 
M.  Garages. Garages shall be a minimum of four hundred square feet and shall exhibit the following characteristics: 
1.  Garage door setbacks should allow driveway parking that keeps the sidewalk free of vehicles, and passable by pedestrians and cyclists. 
2.  Angled garages may be used on curvilinear streets where they can provide an element of harmony with the flow of the street, and may be used on straight streets where they can break up the monotony of all garage doors being parallel to the street. 
3.  Garages should have a single story mass at the front of the structures to provide an architectural transition in two story massing. 
N.  In-Fill in Existing Neighborhoods. New single-family homes in existing neighborhoods should be integrated into the neighborhoods in characteristics such as scale, building height, architectural style, facade treatment, landscaping, setbacks and other characteristics. In many older neighborhoods, common patterns such as entries facing the street, front porches, and parking at the rear may be continued. 
O.  Setbacks. 
1.  Setbacks of residential projects should be either: 
a.  Equal to the average setback of all residences on both sides of public streets within one hundred feet of the property lines of the new project, or 
b.  Equal to the average of the two immediately adjacent residences. In either case, the new residence may be averaged in a stepping pattern between the setbacks of adjacent residences. 
2.  Architectural Style. Distinctive architectural characteristics of surrounding developments such as materials, roof style and pitch, finished floor heights porches, window and door treatments, fidelity to formal traditional architectural styles, and related elements should be incorporated into new residential development when possible. 
3.  Scale. Building scale and form should relate to the use of the structure as a single-family dwelling. Structures consistent with the existing neighborhood, so as not to overwhelm or dominate the neighborhood. 
4.  Massing. Long uninterrupted exterior walls should be avoided on all structures. All structure walls should have relief to create an interesting blend with landscaping, structures, shadows and light. The articulation of facades and the massing of structures tends to give them richness and scale. Incorporation of varied texture, relief and design elements on building walls can soften the appearance of the residence. 
P.  Grading. Graded slopes should be rounded and contoured to blend with the natural terrain. Significant natural vegetation shall be retained and incorporated into the project. Development should relate to the natural surroundings and minimize grading by following natural contours. Developers should consult with the Community Development Department early in the process to ensure compliance with this guideline. 
(Zoning Ord. dated 1/31/06, § 9102.05(3); Ord. No. 1387, § 4.) 
17.08.250 - Single-family architecture. 
    The focus of development should be on the creation of high quality residential environments. Although there is no particular required architectural style for any of Banning's neighborhoods, architecture should be compatible with surrounding character including harmonious building style, form, size, color, materials, orientation, and roofline. Residences should be compatible with one another, but each should be unique in its own way. 
A.  Facade and Roof Articulation. 
1.  Long uninterrupted exterior walls should be avoided on all structures. All structure walls should have relief to create an interesting blend with landscaping, structures, shadows and light. The articulation of facades and the massing of structures tends to give them richness and scale. Incorporation of varied texture, relief and design elements on building walls can soften the appearance of the residence. 
2.  For sloped roofs, both vertical and horizontal articulation is encouraged. Roof articulation may be achieved by changes in plane of at least two feet and six inches, and through the use of traditional elements such as gables, hips and dormers. Flat roofs are strongly discouraged, and A-frame type roofs are generally simpler and less articulated than what would be considered ideal. 
B.  Varied Structure Design. In tract developments, structures should be designed to create variety and interest. There should be a significant difference in the exterior finish, massing and composition, of adjacent houses. One design should not be repeated more often than every fourth house. 
C.  Attached Dwellings. 
1.  Single family attached dwellings should be designed in a way which projects an image of high quality customized homes. Preferred configurations include treatment as apparently large single family units, or as traditional row houses or town houses. 
2.  Features such as walls should be incorporated to lengthen the horizontal elements of elevations and to reduce the visual impact of garage doors. 
3.  Driveways should be grouped with a separate planting strip to provide maximum usable green space, lawn, and gardening areas. 
4.  Garages must be set back from the street sufficiently to allow driveway parking without the intrusion of cars into the sidewalk, thus blocking the way of cyclists or pedestrians. In addition, garages should have a single story appearance at the front of the building to allow a stepped-back architectural transition for two story structures. 
D.  Scale. Building scale and form should relate to the use of the structure as a single family dwelling. Structures should be built on a human scale, so as not to overwhelm or dominate the neighborhood, or the residents of the immediate dwelling or adjacent dwellings. 
E.  Finish Materials. 
1.  Materials to be avoided include metal or aluminum siding and roofs, reflective materials and finishes, and unfinished concrete block. 
2.  The use of different materials on different planes tends to make the materials appear substantial and integral. Material changes not accompanied by changes in plane also frequently give material an insubstantial or applied quality. 
3.  All structure elements should be architecturally treated. The proper choice and mix of materials on the facades of structures and garage doors, is instrumental in providing an attractive living environment. Materials should be consistently applied and should work harmoniously with adjacent materials. Piecemeal embellishment and frequent changes in materials should be avoided. 
F.  Vents and Downspouts. Gutters, roof flashing, downspouts, vents and other roof features and protrusions should be finished to match the adjacent materials and/ or colors. 
G.  Equipment Screening. All heating and air conditioning equipment, pool equipment, etc., must be located in the side or year yard, and must be screened. The method of screening must be architecturally compatible in terms of materials, color, finish, shape and size. The screening design should blend wit the building design. Where individual equipment is provided, a continuous screen is desirable. Landscaping of sufficient density and height may be used for equipment screening. 
H.  Ancillary Structures. Ancillary structures such as guest houses, accessory dwelling units, barns, storage sheds, cabanas, and the like, should be designed to be architecturally compatible with the main structure through the use of walls, roofs, trellises, fences, wall connections, and/or landscaping. 
I.  Garage Doors. Garage doors provide a major visual element of a home. They should appear to be set into the walls, rather than flush with the exterior wall, and garage door design should be kept simple, clean, and unadorned. 
J.  Lighting Fixtures/Intensity. Strong and harsh lighting has been shown to be a major stressor to wildlife, places excess emphasis on a dwelling, eliminates night time views, and is intrusive to neighbors, and thus is strongly discouraged. All on site lighting shall be stationary, light source shall not be visible, carefully directed away from adjacent properties and public rights-of-way, and of no more than the intensity appropriate to the residential use of the property. 
(Zoning Ord. dated 1/31/06, § 9102.05(4).) 
(Ord. No. 1512, § 6, 10-10-17) 
17.08.260 - Multi-family site planning. 
    Cluster housing and multi-family dwellings tend to create large parking areas and a decrease in private open space due to their higher densities. If not well designed, parking facilities can dominate the site and open spaces may be relegated to left over areas, which are not integrated with the structures or the people who live there. 
    Residential developments surrounded by long high walls, parking lots, and rows of carports along public streets are examples of practices to be avoided. Perimeter parking drives are discouraged because they eliminate so much green space; provide a poor image of a residential development; and often function as barriers between the development and the surrounding community, including other residences, businesses, and the natural environment. 
A.  Building Articulation. In multi family dwellings, building facades should be broken up and articulated to give the appearance of a collection of smaller structures. Long, unbroken facades and box-like forms should be avoided. Each unit should be distinguishable from adjacent units. 
Differentiation of units can be accomplished with the use of varied roof heights, colors, finish materials, balconies, setbacks, and projections which help articulate individual dwelling units or collections of units, as well as by the pattern and rhythm of doors and windows. 
B.  Clustering of Units. The clustering of multi family units should be a standard element of site plan design. Structures which are composed of simple yet varied planes, enhance variety and compatibility in the overall building form. Design techniques to be considered and implemented whenever possible include: 
1.  Staggered and jogged unit planes; 
2.  Varying front setbacks within the same structure; 
3.  The incorporation of varied rooflines and wall lines; 
4.  The use of a variety of orientations to avoid visual monotony. 
C.  Project Entries. Attention should always be given to architectural and landscape treatments of entryways to enhance the overall image of a project. Entry areas should incorporate landscaping, recreational facilities and project directories when possible. 
D.  Entry Drives. Colored and textured paving treatment at entry drives is encouraged, however, stamped concrete is not permitted within public street rights of way. The principal vehicular access into a multi family housing development should be through an entry drive rather than a parking drive. 
E.  On-Site Parking and Drives. Parking may be accommodated in higher density projects through the use of parking drives, parking courts, underground garages, and garages within residential buildings. Developments with long, monotonous parking drives or with large, undivided parking lots should be avoided. When parking can not be provided within residential structures, dispersed parking courts are the desired alternative. Perimeter parking drives should be minimized, and residents often like to have a view of the parking areas which they utilize. 
F.  Parking Courts. Parking courts should be separated from each other by dwelling units or by a landscaped buffer of at least 30 feet in width. Ideally, parking courts should not consist of more than two or three double loaded parking bays adjacent to each other. 
G.  Parking Drives. 
1.  There should be no more than an average of 10 spaces of uninterrupted parking, whether in garages, carports, or open parking areas, although longer rows of parking may be necessary in larger residential developments. 
2.  Each average of 10 spaces of parking should be separated from additional spaces by a substantial landscaped bulb typically not less than 10 feet wide, recreational amenities, open space areas, and project access points. Architectural elements such as trellises, porches, benches, or stairways may extend into these landscaped bulbs. 
H.  Garages. Garages with parking aprons less than twenty feet in length should have automatic garage door openers and or sectional roll up doors. Individual parking garages within residential structures should be enclosed behind garage doors. 
I.  Carports. 
1.  Carports should not be incorporated into exterior project walls, when these walls are adjacent to streets. The ends of each cluster of carports should be landscaped to provide variety and visual stimulation. Carports can be a useful element in providing shading and cooling for automobiles. 
2.  Where carports are utilized, they must follow the same criteria for spatial arrangements as parking courts, as described previously in this chapter. Carports may be incorporated with patio walls, or used to help define public and private open space. 
J.  Pedestrian Access From Parking. Whenever possible, landscape bulbs should align with major building entrances to provide pedestrian access to the building entrance from a parking court or drive. When landscape bulbs are aligned with entrances, they should be at least two car spaces wide and should include a pathway, as well as vertical landscaping and architectural elements such as trees, trellises, sculpture, hedges and the like. 
K.  Open Space. 
1.  Open space should be maximized in all multi-family housing developments. At least 50% of open space should be grassed, landscaped or otherwise vegetated. The placement of benches is encouraged, to help people to make use of and enjoy the space. 
2.  Wildlife corridors should also be considered in a residential development. Native plants and shrubs shall be preserved and incorporated into the development wherever possible. 
3.  The design and orientation of open space areas should take advantage of available sunlight, and should be sheltered from the noise and traffic of adjacent streets or other incompatible uses. Required common open spaces should be conveniently located for the majority of units. Private open spaces should be contiguous to the units they serve and should be screened from public view. Whenever possible, children's play areas should be visible from the units. 
L.  Landscape Areas. 
1.  Good landscaping can help to bring a residential development into greater harmony with its surrounding natural environment. Landscaping can be used to frame, soften, and embellish the quality of the environment; to buffer units from noise or undesirable views; to break up large expanses of parking; and to separate frontage roads within a project from public streets. 
2.  In addition to grass and groundcover, trees and tall shrubs are needed. Trees can provide a vertical design element which enhances visual interest. Trees can also be used to provide shading and climactic cooling of nearby residential units and parking spaces. Entrances to residential developments should when possible be oriented toward the green space, open space and recreational areas of the development. 

M.  Refuse Storage/Disposal. 
1.  Trash bins must be fully enclosed, and block, stone and other masonry enclosures are preferred. Such enclosures shall be softened with landscaping on their most visible sides. Recommended locations for refuse storage bins include inside parking courts or at the end of the parking bays. 
2.  Locations should be conveniently accessible for trash collection and maintenance and should not block access to drives during loading operations. 
N.  Auxiliary Facilities. All auxiliary and support structures within multi-family residential projects such as laundry facilities, recreation buildings and sales/ lese offices should be consistent in architectural design, materials, façade treatments and landscaping, with the rest of the complex. Temporary sales offices should also be compatible with these guidelines. 
O.  Mailboxes. All mailbox locations in multi-family developments must be approved by the US Postal Service. Common mailbox services shall be provided in all multi-family developments. They should be located close to the project entry and near recreational facilities. Their architectural character should be similar in form, materials and color to the surrounding buildings. 
P.  Site Grading. 
1.  Ideally multifamily dwellings should be placed six inches or more above the average grade of the site. Site grading should recognize existing drainage patterns, an d landforms while providing appropriate transition of architectural elements to grade. Grade separations should be minimized as much as possible, as should retaining walls. 
2.  Site grading should provide for an uninterrupted flow of vehicular and pedestrian traffic through the development. The plan shall direct and provide adequate flow of surface run-off to catch basins, while gracefully contouring the land to blend with existing conditions at the boundaries of the site. 
3.  The use of center-swale drainage devices is strongly discouraged. Parking lots may drain into a single concrete swale at the edge of the aisle. Street drainage should be collected in curb gutters. 
Q.  Security. Multi family dwellings should be designed to provide the maximum amount of security for residents and visitors. Landscaping should be planned and maintained to provide views into open space areas. 
R.  Lighting Fixtures/Intensity. 
1.  Strong and harsh lighting has been shown to be a major stressor to wildlife, and thus is strongly discouraged. All on site lighting shall be stationary, carefully directed away from adjacent properties and public rights-of-way, and of no more than the intensity appropriate to the residential use of the property. 
2.  Strong lighting also places excess emphasis on residential developments in a manner which makes them stand apart from other residential developments and other uses, and calls attention to the development in a negative way. Some carefully directed lighting may be used in parking areas for security purposes. Lighting must be directed towards the ground, rather than toward the sky, and overspill into residences must be minimized. 
(Zoning Ord. dated 1/31/06, § 9102.05(5).) 
17.08.270 - Multi-family architecture. 
    The focus of multi-family residential development should be on the creation of high quality residential environments. Although there is no particular required architectural style for any of Banning's neighborhoods or zoning districts, architecture should be compatible with that of the surrounding residences and buildings. Compatibility should include harmonious building style, as well as form, size, scale, color, height, materials, finish orientation, and roofline. 
    Multi-family residences should be compatible with one another, but each should be unique in some way. Multi-family residences are often developed adjacent to single family neighborhoods, and measures should be taken to ensure that the height and bulk of higher density projects do not negatively impact these lower density residential areas. Multi-family architecture should create the appearance of individual units, and should use same the same quality of materials and treatments as single-family homes. Whenever possible, garages are encouraged over the use of carports. 
A.  Facade and Roof Articulation. 
1.  Long uninterrupted exterior walls should be avoided on all structures. All structure walls should have relief to create an interesting blend with landscaping, structures, shadows and light. Extremely long structures are acceptable, if they are appropriately articulated. However structures exceeding 150 feet in length are discouraged. 
2.  Separations, changes in plane and height, and the inclusion of elements such as balconies, porches, arcades, dormers, and cross gables mitigate the barracks like quality of flat wall and roofs of excessive length. Secondary hipped or gabled roofs covering the entire mass of a building are preferable to segments of pitched roof applied at the structure's edge. 
3.  Structures containing three or more attached dwellings in a row should incorporate at least one of the following: 
a.  For each dwelling unit, at least one architectural projection not less than two feet from the wall plane and not less than four feet wide should be provided. Such projections should extend the full height of the single story structures, at least half the height of a two story building, and at least two thirds the height of a three story building. 
b.  Changes in wall plane of at least three feet in depth for at least twelve feet in length for each two units should be provided. 
B.  Scale. 
1.  Building scale and form should relate to the use of the structure as a multi-family dwelling. Structures should be built on a human scale, so as not to overwhelm or dominate the neighborhood, or the residents of the immediate dwelling or adjacent dwellings. 
2.  As multi-family developments are usually taller than one story, their bulk can be imposing on surrounding uses and on single family homes. The scale of such projects should be moderated by the context of their surroundings. 
3.  Structures with more stories should be given additional setback when possible to avoid dominating the character of the neighborhood. Large projects should be broken into groups of structures, and the use of single mega structures for multi-family development shall be avoided. This pertains to developments having residents of any and all income levels. 
C.  Building/Finish Materials. 
1.  Materials selected for multi-family projects should be very durable and require low maintenance. Materials to be avoided include metal or aluminum siding and roofs, reflective materials and finishes, and unfinished concrete block. 
2.  Materials tend to appear substantial and integral when material changes occur at changes in plane. Material changes not accompanied by changes in plane also frequently give material an insubstantial or applied quality. 
3.  All structure elements in multi-family developments should be architecturally treated, and piecemeal embellishment and frequent changes in materials shall be avoided. 
D.  Balconies, Porches, and Patios. 
1.  Common exterior balconies, walkways and corridors which provide access to multiple dwelling units, do not require circulation past adjacent unit windows and entries. Separations in such exterior balconies and corridors can help light to filter down to the lower floors, and can add vibrancy to the exterior ground floor corridors. 
2.  The incorporation of balconies, porches, and patios (whether private or accessible to use by all residents) within multi-family structures is strongly encouraged for both practical and aesthetic value. These elements should be integrated to break up large wall masses, offset floor setbacks, and add human scale to structures. 
3.  Unique private nooks and niches are encouraged for the individual units within these multi-family developments. 
E.  Dwelling Unit Access. 
1.  Whenever possible, individual access should be created for each and every unit. Whenever possible, landscape bulbs should align with major building entrances to provide pedestrian access to the building entrance from a parking court or drive. 
2.  The use of long, monotonous balconies and corridors providing access to five or more units should be avoided. Access points to units should be clustered in groups of four or less. The use of distinctive architectural elements and materials to denote prominent entrances is encouraged. 
F.  Exterior Stairs. 
1.  Projections of stairways which are wide, bold, and simple are encouraged to complement the architectural massing and form of the multi-family structure. The greater the width of the exterior stairways, the easier it will be for residents to move in and out, and for equipment, white goods, household appliances, and furniture, to move in and out of the development. 
2.  Stairways should be of smooth stucco, plaster or block, with accent trim of complimentary colors, stone or tile work. Thin looking, open metal or wood, prefabricated stairs are discouraged as they are generally insufficient for multi-family residences. 
G.  Carports, Garages and Accessory Structures. 
1.  Parking garages within multi-family residential structures should be enclosed behind garage doors. Carports, detached garages, and accessory structures should be designed as an integral part of the architecture of the projects. 
2.  They should be similar in materials, color and detail to the principal structures of the development. Carports may utilize flat roofs but should not project above any exterior walls adjacent to streets. 
3.  Prefabricated metal carports may not be used. When garages are utilized, doors should appear set into walls, rather than flush with the exterior wall. Their design should be simple and unadorned, yet high quality materials should be used such. 
H.  Gutters and Downspouts. 
1.  Gutters, roof flashing, downspouts, vents and other such features and protrusions should be finished to match the adjacent materials and/or colors. Gutters and downspouts should be concealed unless they are designed as a continuous architectural feature. 
2.  Exposed gutters used as architectural features should be colored to match fascia or wall material. Exposed downspouts should be colored to match the surface to which they are attached unless copper is used. Roof vents should be colored to match roofing materials or the dominant trim color of the structure. 
I.  Active and Passive Solar Design. Solar panels should be integrated into the roof design flush with the roof slope, especially on those portions of the roof with eastern, western or southern exposures. Frames should be colored to match roofing materials or the dominant trim color of the structure. Aluminum or similar finishes are strongly discouraged. Any mechanical equipment should be enclosed and completely screened from view. 
J.  Mechanical and Utility Equipment. 
1.  Utility meters and equipment must be placed in locations which are not exposed to view from the street or from the general grounds, and they must be suitably screened or hidden by bushes, hedges or other landscaping, while still remaining accessible. 
2.  All screening devices are to be compatible with the architecture and color of the adjacent structures. All mechanical equipment whether mounted on the roof or ground, must be screened from view. 
K.  Antennas. 
1.  All new units must be pre-wired to accommodate cable reception. All antennas should be placed in attics or building interiors. 
2.  Satellite antennas are specifically prohibited on roofs, and should be considered early in the design process in terms of location and any required screening. 
L.  Walls. Walls and fences are an important part of the streetscape and should be designed thoughtfully. Walls and fences should have the following characteristics: 
1.  Both sides of all perimeter walls or fences should be architecturally treated. 
2.  Walls should be of smooth stucco finish, or of plaster or of other approved masonry or stonework. They should be designed in a style, materials and color to complement the adjacent dwelling units. 
3.  Chain link fences and barbed wire are not acceptable materials. 
4.  Wood, masonry, vinyl and adobe are acceptable fence/wall materials. 
5.  Decorative masonry walls, including, but not limited to, slump stone and split-face block can be used without a stucco or plaster finish, but must be architecturally treated and complement the adjacent dwelling units. 
6.  All property fencing must be compatible in design and of similar materials. 
(Zoning Ord. dated 1/31/06, § 9102.05(6); Ord. No. 1387, § 5.) 
17.08.280 - Multi-family in-fill in single family neighborhood. 
    New multi-family developments should be integrated into existing neighborhoods so that they are compatible with adjacent structures and fit within the context of the existing neighborhood, whether that neighborhood be residential or mixed use. 
A.  Front Yard Setbacks. For new multi-family projects, front yard setbacks should be equal to or greater than the average setbacks for the two adjacent properties. If one or both of the adjacent properties are vacant, then the average shall be calculated on the next adjacent occupied property. 
B.  Architectural Compatibility. New multi-family residential development in existing neighborhoods should incorporate architectural characteristics and maintain the scale of existing structures on the property and surrounding development. This includes window and door detailing, facade decoration, materials, color, roof style and pitch, porches, and other elements. 
C.  Site Design. New multi-family developments should be designed to continue the on-site relationships of the surrounding neighborhood and of the original structures. When it is possible to provide access from adjacent alleys, it is generally advantageous to do so. 
(Zoning Ord. dated 1/31/06, § 9102.05(7).)

3.  All parking lots shall have a continuous curbing at least six inches high and six inches wide around all parking areas and aisle planters. Wheel stops shall not be used in lieu of curbing to protect landscaping, signage structures and walls. 
N.  Parking Adjustment. Concurrent with an application for Design Review and/or Conditional Use Permit and application for a parking adjustment may be approved by the review authority subject to the findings: 
Findings for a Parking Adjustment 
1.  The zoning regulations applicable to the property do not allow a reasonable use comparable to similar developments in the same zoning district; 
2.  The hardship for which the variance is requested is unique to the property area; 
3.  The variance will not alter the character of the area adjacent to the property, will not impair the use of adjacent conforming property, and will not impair the purpose of the regulations of the zoning district in which the property is located; 
4.  Neither present nor anticipated future traffic volumes generated by the use of the site or the sites in the vicinity require strict or literal interpretation and enforcement of the specific regulation; 
5.  The granting of this parking variance will not result in the parking or loading of vehicles in public streets in such a manner as to interfere with the free flow of street traffic; 
6.  The granting of this variance will not create a safety hazard or any other condition inconsistent with the objectives of this Ordinance; and 
7.  The variance will run with the use or uses to which it pertains and shall not run with the site. 
The parking adjustment may include any or all of the following: 
A reduction in number of spaces required, subject to an approved parking study; 
Approval of a limited number of compact spaces; 
Recordation of a reciprocal parking agreement with nearby properties; 
10 percent reduction in spaces required;

(Zoning Ord. dated 1/31/06, § 9107.07.) 
Chapter 17.32 - LANDSCAPING STANDARDS 
Article I. - General Provisions 

17.32.010 - Purpose. 
    The purpose of this chapter is to establish landscaping regulations that are intended to: 
A.  Protect and preserve the natural environment in the City of Banning, and to incorporate green space, vegetation, and shade into the urban landscape. 
B.  Enhance the aesthetic appearance of development in all areas of the City by providing standards for quality, quantity and functional aspects of landscaping and landscape screening. 
C.  Reduce the heat and glare generated by development 
D.  Increase the compatibility between residential land uses and those abutting commercial and industrial land uses. 
E.  Provide privacy within residential developments, and to provide privacy on the perimeter of residential areas from various residential, commercial or other uses outside of the development. 
F.  Protect the public health, safety and welfare by minimizing the impact of all forms of physical and visual pollution, controlling soil erosion, screening incompatible land uses, preserving the integrity of neighborhoods, and enhancing pedestrian, cyclist and vehicular traffic and safety. 
G.  Increase the liveability of the City of Banning for children, adults, and visitors. 
(Zoning Ord. dated 1/31/06, § 9108.01.) 
17.32.020 - Application. 
A.  A concept landscaping plan shall be submitted as part of a planning permit application. The concept plan shall meet the intent of this chapter by exhibiting a generalized design layout which adequately demonstrates the desired landscaping program in terms of location, size/scale, function, theme and other attributes. 
B.  The concept plan shall provide the review authority with a clear understanding of the landscaping program prior to the preparation of a detailed, comprehensive landscaping plan. All landscaping plans must take into account the preservation of natural features including hills, topography, trees, shrubs, wildlife habitat, etc. The landscaping plan should refer to such natural elements, and enhance rather than detract from such elements. 
C.  Landscaping plans shall rely primarily on indigenous plant and tree species which are suitable to the local climate and soil types, rather than relying on foreign or invasive species which often compete with, and displace local species. The use of indigenous plant, shrub and tree types is also important in providing continuity of habitat for wildlife species, including local birds. The use of invasive species which have proven to be detrimental to flora species native to Southern California are strongly discouraged in all landscaping plans. Such species include the tamarisk (or salt cedar tree), and the Russian olive. Likewise many plants and trees from other areas (such as the tropics or the American southeast) have much greater water requirements than native species, and the planting and maintenance of such flora species will undermine the City's goal of water conservation. 
(Zoning Ord. dated 1/31/06, § 9108.02.) 
17.32.030 - General regulations. 
    A comprehensive landscaping plan shall be prepared following approval of the permit application by the review authority, and shall be submitted at the same time as the grading plan and related documents and reports. The landscape and irrigation plans shall be approved by the Community Development Department, and this department may obtain any necessary input from the Public Works Department. Landscaping requirements include the following: 
A.  Designs shall be in harmony with the surrounding environment. 
B.  Landscape design and construction shall emphasize drought-tolerant landscaping whenever and wherever possible. 
C.  A comprehensive landscape and irrigation plan shall include, but not be limited to: 
1.  List of all plants (common and Latin) including trees and shrubs; 
2.  Size of plants; 
3.  Location of plants; 
4.  Irrigation plan for the plants; 
5.  Hardscape; 
6.  Water elements; 
7.  Any other information deemed necessary by the City. 
D.  Planting of trees and shrubs shall comply with the following installation requirements: 
1.  Landscape areas shall include plant material and planting methods which are suitable for the soil of the site. The minimum percentage of plant sizes shall be as follows: 
Trees: 20%, 36 inch box 50%, 24 inch box Shrubs: 100%, 5 gallon Groundcover: 100% coverage within 1 year  
2.  Trees and shrubs shall be planted so that at maturity they do not interfere with service lines, traffic safety sight area, and the basic property rights of adjacent property owners. 
3.  A variety of flowering trees, fragrant trees, and fruit trees, may all be included in the landscaping plan. 
4.  Trees planted near public rights-of-way shall have a limited deep root system and shall be installed so as to prevent physical damage to sidewalks, curbs, gutters and other public improvements. 
5.  Tree grates shall surround trees installed in paved areas or sidewalks. Trees with a deep root system shall be used in such areas. 
F.  Concrete mow strips are required to separate all turf areas from other landscaped areas in the commercial and industrial districts. 
G.  Inorganic groundcover shall be used in combination with live plants, and shall be used as an accent feature. 
H.  All landscaping shall include a water-efficient automatic irrigation system. 
I.  The front yards, and side yards visible from the public right-of-way, of all residential subdivisions shall be landscaped with trees, shrubs and groundcover. At a minimum, each front yard shall include 2 24 inch box trees, and sufficient shrubs and groundcover to provide full coverage within 2 years of installation. 
(Zoning Ord. dated 1/31/06, § 9108.03.) 
17.32.040 - Setback and parkway treatments. 
    Landscape standards for setback and parkway areas shall include, but not be limited to: 

A.  Setback and parkway areas shall utilize uniform street tree plantings with complementary landscape materials. 
B.  Mounding or berming shall be incorporated within the overall design, with landscaped slopes not exceeding a three to one ratio, or four feet in height. A minimum of six feet of landscaping shall be placed on the exterior of perimeter walls and fences. 
C.  Walls and fences should be incorporated into the landscape design, including meandering walls, wall breaks, or openings where the design shall complement the landscaping of the adjacent development. 

D.  All designs shall insure compatibility with established setback and parkway areas, including transitions between landscape types and patterns. 
E.  Street trees shall be 24 inch box specimens or larger. 
(Zoning Ord. dated 1/31/06, § 9108.04.) 
17.32.050 - Installation and maintenance. 
A.  Landscaping shall be permanently maintained by the developer or his/her successors. All required landscaping shall be properly installed, irrigated, and inspected prior to the issuance of a Certificate of Occupancy.

(Zoning Ord. dated 1/31/06, § 9108.05.) 
17.32.060 - Removal or destruction of trees. 
A.  Removal of healthy, shade providing, and aesthetically valuable trees shall be strongly discouraged, and shall be in conformance with the policies and programs of the General Plan. A tree removal and replacement plan shall be required for the removal and replacement of all trees in excess of 50 years of age, unless their removal is required to protect the public health and safety. 
B.  Each tree that is removed in a new subdivision is considered a part of the common wealth of the citizens of Banning, is an important component of the habitat of surrounding wildlife, and is of value to the City. Each identified tree removed shall be replaced with at least one 36 inch box specimen tree, in addition to any other required landscaping. Individual single family residential lots of less than one-half acre and commercial tree farms shall be exempt from this provision. 
(Zoning Ord. dated 1/31/06, § 9108.06.) 
Article II. - Water Conservation 

17.32.070 - Purpose and definitions. 
A.  In order to assure that the City's water resources are not significantly impacted by high water consuming landscape plans, the following standards for water efficiency shall be implemented for all landscaping plans required in this chapter, under Section 17.32.020, Applicability. 
B.  Definitions. 
    Anti-drain valve or check valve means a valve located under a sprinkler head to hold water in the system so it minimizes drainage from the lower elevation sprinkler heads. 
    Application rate means the depth of water applied to a given area, measured in inches per hour. Also known as precipitation rate (sprinklers) or emission rate (drippers/microsprayers) in gallons per hour. 
    Applied water means the portion of water supplied by the irrigation system to the landscaping. 
    Automatic controller means a mechanical or solid-state timer, capable of operating valve stations to set the days and length of time of a water application. 
    Backflow prevention device means a safety device used to prevent pollution or contamination of the water supply due to the reverse flow of water from the irrigation system. 
    Conversion factor (0.62) means a number that converts the maximum applied water allowance from acre-inches per acre per year to gallons per square foot per year. The conversion factor is calculated as follows: 
325,851 gallons/43,560 square feet/12 inches = (0.62) 325,851 gallons = one acre foot 43,560 square feet = one acre 12 inches = one foot  
    To convert gallons per year to 100 cubic feet per year, the common billing unit for water, divide gallons per year by 748. (748 gallons = 100 cubic feet.) 
    Ecological restoration project means a project where the site is intentionally altered to establish a defined, indigenous, historic ecosystem. 
    Effective precipitation or usable rainfall means the portion of total natural precipitation that is used by the plants. 
    Emitter means drip irrigation fittings that deliver water slowly from the system to the soil. 
    Established landscape means the point at which plants in the landscape have developed roots into the soil adjacent to the root ball. 
    Establishment period means the first year after installing the plant in the landscape. 
    Estimated annual applied water use means the portion of the estimated annual total water use that is derived from applied water. The estimated annual applied water use shall not exceed the maximum applied water allowance. 
    Estimated total water use means the annual total amount of water estimated to be needed to keep the plants in the landscaped area healthy. It is based upon such factors as the local evapotranspiration rate, the size of the landscaped area, the types of plants, and the efficiency of the irrigation system. 
    ET adjustment factor means a factor of 0.6 that, when applied to reference evapotranspiration, adjusts for plant factors and irrigation efficiency, two major influences upon the amount of water that needs to be applied to the landscape. A combined plant mix with a site-wide average 0.45 is the basis of the plant factor portion of this calculation. The irrigation efficiency for purposes of the ET adjustment factor is 0.75. Therefore, the ET adjustment factor (0.6) = (0.45/0.75). 
    Evapotranspiration means the quantity of water evaporated from adjacent soil surfaces and transpired by plants during a specific time. 
    Flow rate means the rate at which water flows through pipes and valves (gallons per minute or cubic feet per second). 
    Hydrozone means a portion of the landscaped area having plants with similar water needs that are served by a valve or set of valves with the same schedule. A hydrozone may be irrigated or nonirrigated. For example, a naturalized area planted with native vegetation that will not need supplemental irrigation once established is a nonirrigated hydrozone. 
    Infiltration rate means the rate of water entry into the soil expressed as a depth of water per unit of time (inches per hour). 
    Irrigation efficiency means the measurement of the amount of water beneficially used divided by the amount of water applied. Irrigation efficiency is derived from measurements and estimates of irrigation system characteristics and management practices. The minimum irrigation efficiency for purposes of this chapter is 0.75. Greater irrigation efficiency can be expected from well-designed and maintained systems. 
    Landscape irrigation audit means a process to perform site inspections, evaluate irrigation systems, and develop efficient irrigation schedules. 
    Landscaped area means the entire parcel less the building footprint, driveways, nonirrigated portions of parking lots, hardscapes such as decks and patios, and other nonporous areas. Water features are included in the calculation of the landscaped area. 
    Lateral line means the water delivery pipeline that supplies water to the emitters or sprinklers from the valve. 
    Main line means the pressurized pipeline that delivers water from the water meter to the valve or outlet. 
    Service line means the pressurized pipeline that delivers water from the water source to the water meter. 
    Maximum applied water allowance means for design purposes, the upper limit of annual applied water for the established landscaped area. It is based upon the area's reference evapotranspiration, the ET adjustment factor, and the size of the landscaped area. The estimated applied water use shall not exceed the maximum applied water allowance. 
    Mined-land reclamation projects means any surface mining operation with a reclamation plan approved in accordance with the Surface Mining and Reclamation Act of 1975. 
    Mulch means any material such as gravel, small rocks, pebbles, decorative sand, decomposed granite, bark, straw or other material left loose and applied to the soil surface for the beneficial purpose of reducing evaporation. 
    Operating pressure means the manufacturer's recommended pressure at which a system of sprinklers, bubblers, drippers or microsprayers is designed to operate. 
    Overhead sprinkler irrigation systems means those with high flow rates (pop-ups, impulse sprinklers, rotors, etc.) 
    Overspray means the water which is delivered beyond the landscaped area, wetting pavements, walks, structures, or other non-landscaped areas. 
    Plant factor means a factor that when multiplied by reference evapotranspiration, estimates the amount of water used by plants. For purposes of this chapter, the average plant factor of very low water using plants ranges from 0.01 to 0.10, for low water using plants the range is 0.10 to 0.35, for moderate water using plants the range is 0.35 to 0.60 and for high water using plants, the range is 0.60 to 0.90. 
    Rain sensing device means a system which automatically shuts off the irrigation system when it rains. 
    Record drawing or as-builts means a set of reproducible drawings which show significant changes in the work made during construction which are usually based on drawings marked up in the field and other data furnished by the contractor. 
    Recreational area means areas of active play or recreation such as sports fields, school yards, picnic grounds, or other areas with intense foot traffic. 
    Recreational turfgrass means turfgrass that serves as a playing surface for sports and recreational activities. Athletic fields, golf courses, parks and school playgrounds are all examples of areas hosting recreational turf grass. 
    Recreational turfgrass ET adjustment factor means a factor of 0.82 that, when applied to reference evapotranspiration, adjusts for the additional stress of high traffic on recreational turfgrass and the higher irrigation efficiencies of long range rotary sprinklers. These are the two major influences upon the amount of water that needs to be applied to a recreational landscape. A mixed cool/warm season turfgrass with a seasonal average of 0.7 is the basis of the plant factor portion of this calculation. The irrigation efficiency of long range sprinklers for purposes of the ET adjustment factor is 0.85. Therefore, the ET adjustment factor is 0.82 = 0.7/0.85. 
    Recycled water, reclaimed water or treated sewage effluent water means treated or recycled waste water of a quality suitable for nonpotable uses such as landscape irrigation; not intended for human consumption. 
    Reference evapotranspiration or ETo means a standard measurement of environmental parameters which affect the water use of plants. ETo is given in inches per day, month, or year, and is an estimate of the evapotranspiration of a large field of cool-season grass that is well watered. Reference evapotranspiration is used as a basis of determining the maximum applied water allowances so that regional differences in climate can be accommodated. For purposes of this chapter, the following ETo zone map will be used. (See map attached to the ordinance codified in this chapter.) 
    Rehabilitated landscape means any relandscaping project whose choice of new plant material and/or new irrigation system components is such that the calculation of the site's estimated water use will be significantly changed. The new estimated water use calculation must not exceed the maximum applied water allowance calculated for the site using a 0.6 ET adjustment factor. 
    Runoff means water which is not absorbed by the soil or landscape to which it is applied and flows from the planted area. For example, runoff may result from water that is applied at too great a rate (application rate exceeds infiltration rate), when there is a severe slope or when water is misapplied to hardscapes. 
    Soil moisture sensing device means a device that measures the amount of water in the soil. 
    Soil texture means the classification of soil based on the percentage of sand, silt and clay in the soil. 
    Sprinkler head means a device which sprays water through a nozzle. 
    Static water pressure means the pipeline pressure when water is not flowing. 
    Station means an area served by one valve or by a set of valves that operates simultaneously. 
    Turf means a surface layer of earth containing mowed grass with its roots. Perennial and Annual Ryegrass are cool season grasses. Hybrid and common Bermuda grass, are warm season grasses. 
    Valve means a device used to control the flow of water in the irrigation system. 
    Water conservation concept statement means a one-page checklist and a narrative summary of the project. 
    Water feature means any water applied to the landscape for non-irrigation decorative purposes. Fountains, streams, ponds and lakes are considered water features. Water features use more water than efficiently irrigated turf grass and are assigned a plant factor value of 1.1 for a stationary body of water and 1.2 for a moving body of water.

B. The Annual Maximum Applied Water Allowance 
a. A project's annual maximum applied water allowance shall be calculated using the following formula: 
MAWA = (ETo) (0.6) (LA) (0.62) where: MAWA = Maximum applied water allowance (gallons per year) Eto = Reference evaportranspiration (i.e., 75.0 inches per year) 0.6 = ET adjustment factor LA = Landscaped area (square feet) 0.62 = Conversion factor (to gallons per square foot)  
b. An example calculation of the annual maximum applied water allowance is: 
Project site: Landscape area of fifty thousand square feet in Zone No. 3a of the City ETo Map. 
MAWA = (ETo) (.6) (LA) (0.62) = (75.0 inches) (.6) (50,000 square feet) (.62)  
Maximum applied water allowance = 1,395,000 gallons per year, 1,865 hundred-cubic-feet per year (billing units), 4.28 acre feet/acre per year or 51.4= of water per year. 
C. Estimated Annual Applied Water Use. 
a. The annual estimated applied water use shall not exceed the annual maximum applied water allowance. 
b. A calculation of the estimated annual applied water use shall be submitted with the landscape documentation package. 
c. The estimated annual total water use for each hydrozone is calculated from the following formula: 
EWU (hydrozones) 
(in 100 cubic feet) = (ETo) (PF) (HA) (.62)/748 (IE) EWU (hydrozone) = Estimated water use (gallons per year) Eto = Reference evapotranspiration (i.e., ETo Zone 3a = 75.00 inches per year) PF = Plant factor (see definitions) HA = Hydrozone area (square feet) (.62) = Conversion factor (IE) = Irrigation efficiency (see Section 17.04.070, Definitions) 748 = Conversion to billing units (100 cubic feet)  
D. Estimated Annual Total Water Use. 
A calculation of the estimated annual total hydrozone water use shall be submitted with the landscape documentation package. The estimated annual total water use for the entire landscaped area equals the sum of the estimated annual water use (EWU) of all hydrozones in that landscaped area.

(Zoning Ord. dated 1/31/06, § 9109.11; Ord. No. 1377, § 2) 
(Ord. No. 1419, § 5, 1-26-10; Ord. No. 1424, § 3.7, 7-13-10; Ord. No. 1447, §§ 3-6, 2-14-12; Ord. No. 1487, § 3.2, 4-28-15; Ord. No. 1530, § 4K, 9-25-18) 
17.36.120 - Sign design guidelines. 
A.  General. The following design guidelines shall be consulted prior to developing signs for any project. Unless there is a compelling reason, these design guidelines shall be followed. If a guideline is waived, the mayor and city council shall be notified. An appeal, which does not require a fee, may be filed by the mayor or any council person within fifteen days of the waiver approval. 
1.  Use a brief message: The fewer the words, the more effective the sign. A sign with a brief, succinct message is simpler and faster to read, looks cleaner and is more attractive. 
2.  Avoid hard-to-read, overly intricate typefaces: These typefaces are difficult to read and reduce the sign's ability to communicate. 
3.  Avoid faddish and bizarre typefaces: Such typefaces may look good today, but soon go out of style. The image conveyed may quickly become that of a dated and unfashionable business. 
4.  Sign colors and materials: should be selected to contribute to legibility and design integrity. Even the most carefully thought out sign may be unattractive and a poor communicator because of poor color selection. Day-glo colors must be avoided. 
5.  Use significant contrast between the background and letter or symbol colors: If there is little contrast between the brightness or hue of the message of a sign and its background, it will be difficult to read. 
6.  Avoid too many different colors on a sign: Too many colors overwhelm the basic function of communication. The colors compete with content for the viewer's attention. Limited use of the accent colors can increase legibility, while large areas of competing colors tend to confuse and disturb. 
7.  Place signs to indicate the location of access to a business: Signs should be placed at or near the entrance to a building or site to indicate the most direct access to the business. 
8.  Place signs consistent with the proportions of scale of building elements within the facade: Within a building facade, the sign may be placed in different areas. A particular sign may fit well on a plain wall area, but would overpower the finer scale and proportion of the lower storefront. A sign which is appropriate near the building entry may look tiny and out of place above the ground level. 
9.  Place wall signs to establish rhythm across the facade, scale and proportion where such elements are weak. In many buildings that have a monolithic or plain facade, signs can establish or continue appropriate design rhythm, scale, and proportion. 
10.  Avoid signs with strange shapes: Signs that are unnecessarily narrow or oddly shaped can restrict the legibility of the message. If an unusual shape is not symbolic, it is probably confusing. 
11.  Carefully consider the proportion of letter area to overall sign background area: If letters take up too much sign, they may be harder to read. Large letters are not necessarily more legible than smaller ones. A general rule is that letters should not appear to occupy more than seventy-five percent of the sign panel area. 
12.  Make signs smaller if they are oriented to pedestrians: The pedestrian-oriented sign is usually read from a distance of fifteen to twenty feet; the vehicle-oriented sign is viewed from a much greater distance. The closer a sign's viewing distance, the smaller that sign need be. 
B.  Wall or Fascia Signs. 
1.  Building wall and fascia signs should be compatible with the predominant visual elements of the building. Commercial centers, offices, and other similar facilities are required to be part of a sign program in accordance with the provisions of this chapter. 
2.  Where there is more than one sign, all signs should be complementary to each other in the following ways: 
a.  Type of construction materials (cabinet, sign copy, supports, etc.) 
b.  Letter size and style of copy 
c.  Method used for supporting sign (wall or ground base) 
d.  Configuration of sign area 
e.  Shape to total sign and related components 
3.  The use of graphics consistent with the nature of the product to be advertised is encouraged, i.e., hammer or saw symbol for a hardware store, mortar and pestle for a drug store. 
4.  Direct and indirect lighting methods are allowed provided that they are not harsh or unnecessarily bright. The use of can-type box signs with translucent backlit panels are less desirable. Panels should be opaque if a can-type sign is used and only the lettering should appear to be lighted. The overspill of light should be negligible. 
5.  The use of backlit individually cut letter signs is strongly encouraged. 
6.  The use of permanent sale or come-on signs is prohibited. 
7.  The identification of each building or store's address in six-inch high numbers over the main entry doorway or within ten feet of the main entry is encouraged. 
C.  Monument Signs. 
1.  Monument signs are intended to provide street addresses, and identification for the commercial center development as a whole and for up to three major tenants. 
2.  All tenant signs should be limited in size to the width of the architectural features of the sign and shall be uniform in size and color. 
3.  A minimum of ten percent of the sign area of monument signs for center developments should be devoted to identification of the center or building by address or name. 
4.  Monument signs should be placed perpendicular to approaching vehicular traffic. 
5.  Each monument sign should be located within a planted landscaped area which is of a shape and design that will provide a compatible setting and ground definition to the sign, incorporating the following ratio of landscape area to total sign area: 
a.  Monument: Four square feet of landscaped area for each square foot of sign area (one side only). 
b.  Directory: Two square feet of landscaped area for each square foot of sign area. 
(Zoning Ord. dated 1/31/06, § 9109.12.) 
17.36.130 - Nonconforming signs. 
A.  A legally established sign which fails to conform to this chapter shall be allowed continued use, except that the sign shall not be: 
1.  Structurally altered so as to extend its useful life. 
2.  Expanded, moved, or relocated. 
3.  Re-established after a change in use. 
4.  Re-established after a business has been abandoned for one hundred twenty days or more. 
5.  Re-established after damage or destruction of more than fifty percent. 
B.  Sign copy and sign faces may be changed on nonconforming signs when there is no change in use of the site or when only a portion of a multiple tenant sign is being changed. 
C.  Any non-conforming sign shall be required to be brought into conformance or abated. 
(Zoning Ord. dated 1/31/06, § 9109.13.) 
17.36.140 - Removal of illegal and nonconforming signs. 
A.  The director shall remove or cause the removal of any fixed, permanent sign constructed, placed or maintained in violation of this chapter, after thirty days following the date of mailing of registered or certified written notice to the owner of the sign, if known, at the last known address or to the owner of the property as shown on the latest assessment roll, or to the occupant of the property at the property address. 
B.  The notice shall describe the sign and specify the violation involved, and indicate that the sign will be removed if the violation is not corrected within thirty days. If the owner disagrees with the opinion of the director, the owner may, within the said thirty-day period request a hearing before the planning commission to determine the existence of a violation. 
C.  If salvageable in the opinion of the director, signs removed by the Director pursuant to this chapter shall be stored for a period of sixty days, during which time they may be recovered by the owner upon payment to the city for costs of removal and storage. If not recovered prior to expiration of the sixty-day period, the sign and supporting structures shall be declared abandoned and title thereto shall vest to the city, and the cost of removal shall be billed to the owner or lien placed on the property upon which said sign was erected.

B.  Variances. Variances from these sign ordinances are strongly discouraged. However, where results inconsistent with the general purposes of this ordinance would occur from its strict literal interpretation and enforcement, the planning commission may grant a variance therefrom upon such terms and conditions as it deems necessary. 
C.  Penalties. Each violation of this ordinance or any regulation, order or ruling promulgated or made hereunder, shall be punishable by a fine of not more than two hundred dollars per day, with each calendar day in violation, constituting a separate offense.

However, in the event sign requirements are not provided in the individual specific plans, all signs within the specific plan areas shall conform to the provisions of chapter 17.36. If the land use within the specific plan is not specifically identified in the zoning ordinance, the most appropriate (closely related) use of the area shall apply, as determined by the community development director. 
(Ord. No. 1493, § 3(2), 4-12-16)

17.44.010 - Purpose. 
A.  The purpose of this Chapter is to outline procedures for filing applications, and for processing the various land use permits, subdivision maps, variances and other regulatory review and approval responsibilities of the Community Development Department, the Planning Commission, and of the City Council. This Chapter also provides for the review and processing of development agreements, and amendment to the General Plan and to this Zoning Ordinance. 
B.  The system of regulatory review and permit approval provides a range of sequenced steps and procedures which are correlated to the type(s) of use proposed, the intensity of the use, the appropriateness of the use (and the impact of such use on neighbors, on natural resources, and on city services), for the municipality as a whole, and for the zoning district in particular. 
C.  The Review Authority Table below identifies the full range of land use permit options and applicable final review authority. Appeals of the Director's determinations are to the Planning Commission, and appeals of Planning Commission determinations are to the City Council.

(Zoning Ord. dated 1/31/06, § 9111.01) 
(Ord. No. 1414, § 3(exh. A), 1-26-10; Ord. No. 1420, § 3.1a), 4-13-2010; Ord. No. 1530, § 4M, 9-25-18) 
17.44.020 - Multiple permit applications. 
    Projects requiring multiple applications may file all applications concurrently and pay appropriate fees, as outlined below in Applications and Fees. Processing and environmental review will be concurrent, and final decision on the project shall be made by the highest level of review authority, pursuant to the Review Authority Table. For example, a project requiring Design Review and a Tentative Tract Map shall be reviewed by the Planning Commission, which will make its recommendation to the City Council. The City Council, in this case, would have final authority on both the Design Review and the Tentative Tract Map. 
(Zoning Ord. dated 1/31/06, § 9111.02.) 
17.44.030 - Pre-application conference.

C.  The applicant should inform staff of any future plans, additions, phases, variances, as well as intended or potential changes to any aspect of the project, which relate to the existing or initial application. This will provide staff with a more complete overview of the developer's plans, and with a better idea of the full impact of these plans. Full disclosure at the beginning of the process should eliminate redundancy of effort, as well as confusion, and should help to clarify and streamline the application process. 
D.  Staff should inform the developer or applicant of any other municipal departments, boards or committees which may need (or wish) to review such plans; and if known, should inform the applicant of any other levels of government which the applicant may need to contact (such as Riverside County Health Department).

A.  Requests for permits and other regulatory determinations must be processed fairly, and evenhandedly, and in a way that puts all applicants on an equal footing with one another. Steps in the application process should be clearly laid out, and adhered to by staff as well as by the applicant, so that due process is provided. Both applicants and the public need to have a level of comfort in the process, and a level of confidence that reasonable and predictable outcomes will be achieved. 
B.

If the applicant is not the owner of the property, the applicant shall secure authorization from the owner of the property to process the application, either through the signing of the application by the owner, or a separate letter of authorization. 
(Zoning Ord. dated 1/31/06, § 9112.02.) 
17.48.030 - Fees. 
A.  The Council shall, by resolution, establish a schedule of fees for permits, amendments and other matters pertaining to this Zoning Ordinance. The schedule of fees may be changed or modified by resolution of the Council. Until all applicable fees have been paid in full, review shall not commence on any application. Failure to pay the applicable fees is grounds for denial of the application. 
B.  Requests by an applicant to the Department (which have been agreed to by the Department) for additional maps or photocopies, extra copies of the zoning ordinance, extraordinary staff time, or the like, must all be billed by the Department and paid by the applicant, prior to delivery of such services.

At the time of application, a review of the location, design, configuration, and potential impact of the proposed use shall be conducted by comparing the use to established development standards and design guidelines. 
B.  This review shall determine whether the proposed use should be permitted by weighing the public need for the benefit to be derived from the use, against any negative or undesirable impacts which it may cause. Limits which the Planning Commission might want to impose, could include restrictions on the hours of business operation; restrictions on the number of clients or patients which the business may service at any one time; increased visual and sound barriers; improved technologies or equipment which lessen any noise, light or odor emitted by the business or other use; as well as any other conditions which could help make the use more compatible with the neighborhood in which it is proposed to be located.

Chapter 17.88 - NON-CONFORMING STRUCTURES AND NON-CONFORMING USES 

17.88.010 - Purpose. 
A.  These provisions provide for the orderly termination of non-conforming structures and uses to promote the public health, safety, and general welfare, and to bring these structures and uses into conformity with the goals and policies of the General Plan. The intent of this chapter is to prevent the expansion of nonconforming structures and uses to the maximum extent feasible, to establish the criteria under which they may be continued or possibly expanded, and to provide for the correction or removal of these land use nonconformities in an equitable, reasonable and timely manner. 
B.  Non-conforming structures and uses within the City are generally detrimental to both orderly and complementary development, and the general welfare of citizens and property. Furthermore, it is the intent of this chapter that non-conforming structures and uses shall be eliminated as rapidly as possible without infringing upon the constitutional rights of property owners. 
(Zoning Ord. dated 1/31/06, § 9122.01.) 
17.88.020 - Non-conforming structures. 
    Structures which lawfully existed prior to the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance are legal nonconforming structures, and may continue even though they fail to conform to the present requirements of the land use district in which they are located. Legal non-conforming structures may be maintained as follows: 
A.  Legal non-conforming structures which are damaged up to one-half (1/2) or more of the replacement cost immediately prior to such damage may be restored only if made to conform to all provisions of the Zoning Ordinance. However, any residential structure(s), including multifamily, in a residential land use district destroyed by a catastrophe, including fire and earthquake, may be reconstructed up to the original size, placement, and density. However, reconstruction shall be substantially completed within two (2) years of the damage or destruction. 
B.  Necessary repairs and desired alterations may be made to legal non-conforming residential structures located in a residential land use district. 
C.  Reasonable repairs and alterations may be made to legal non-conforming commercial, institutional, or industrial structures, provided that no structural alterations shall be made which would prolong the life of the supporting members of a structure, such as bearing walls, columns, beams, or girders. Structural elements may be modified or repaired only if the Chief Building Official determines that such modification or repair is immediately necessary to protect the health and safety of the public or occupants of the non-conforming structure, or adjacent property and the cost does not exceed one-half (1/2) of the replacement cost limitations, provided that such retrofitting is strictly limited to compliance with earthquake safety standards. 
D.  Changes to interior partitions or other nonstructural improvements and repairs may be made to a legal non-conforming commercial, institutional, or industrial structure, provided that the cost of the desired improvement or repair shall not exceed one-half (1/2) of the replacement cost of the non-conforming structure over any consecutive five (5) year period. 
E.  The replacement cost shall be determined by the Chief Building Official of the City. 
F.  Any additional development of a parcel with a legal non-conforming structure will require that all new structures be in conformance with this Zoning Ordinance. 
G.  If a structure is permitted but is non-conforming only due to off-street parking or loading standards, expansion of that structure will require that it meet off-street parking or loading standards for the existing structure as well as for the expansion, in conformance with Chapter 17.28, Parking Standards. 
H.  If the use of a non-conforming structure is discontinued for a period of 6 or more consecutive calendar months, the structure shall lose its legal non-conforming status, and shall be removed or altered to conform to the provisions of this Development code. A use of a legal non-conforming structure shall be considered discontinued when any of the following apply: 
1.  The Director has determined, by whatever means, that the intent of the owner to discontinue use of the non-conforming structure is apparent. 
2.  Where characteristic furnishings and equipment associated with the use have been removed and not replaced with equivalent furnishings and equipment during this time, and where normal occupancy and/or use has been discontinued for a period of 6 or more consecutive calendar months. 
3.  Where there are either no business sales receipts or no business purchase receipts available for the 6 month period. 
4.  Where there has been no electrical utility bill paid for the property for the 6 month period. 
(Zoning Ord. dated 1/31/06, § 9122.02.) 
17.88.030 - Non-conforming uses. 
    Non-conforming uses are those which lawfully existed prior to the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance, but which are no longer permitted in the land use district in which they are located. The continuance of legal non-conforming uses are subject to the following: 
A.  Change of ownership, tenancy, or management of a non-conforming use shall not affect its legal non-conforming status, provided that the use and intensity of use does not increase. 
B.  If a non-conforming use is discontinued for a period of six (6) or more consecutive calendar months, it shall lose its legal non-conforming status, and the continued use of the property shall be required to conform with the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance. 
C.  Additional development of any property on which a legal non-conforming use exists shall require that all new uses conform to the provisions of this Zoning Ordinance. 
D.  If a non-conforming use is converted to a conforming use, no non-conforming use may be resumed. 
E.  No non-conforming use may be established or replaced by another non-conforming use, nor may any non-conforming use be expanded or changed, except as provided in this chapter. 
F.  A nonconforming use located in a commercial or industrial zone may be expanded up to but not exceeding 50 percent of the existing floor area provided the expansion conforms to all other requirements of the zone and subject to the approval of a conditional use permit by the planning commission. 
(Zoning Ord. dated 1/31/06, § 9122.03.) 
(Ord. No. 1404, § 4, 3-10-09) 
17.88.040 - Abatement of non-conforming uses. 
    Legal non-conforming uses shall be discontinued within the following specified time limits, from the effective date of this Zoning Ordinance: 
Table 17.88.040 
Abatement Schedule 
1 Non-conforming uses which do not occupy structures 5 years 2 The non-conforming use of a conforming structure within any commercial or industrial land use district 10 years 3 Non-conforming uses of a conforming structure within any residential land use district 15 years  
(Zoning Ord. dated 1/31/06, § 9122.04.) 
17.88.050 - Certificate of occupancy prohibited. 
    When any non-conforming structure or use is no longer permitted pursuant to the provisions of this chapter, no permit for a structure shall thereafter be issued for further continuance, alteration, or expansion. Any permit issued in error shall not be construed as allowing the continuation of the nonconforming structure or use. 
(Zoning Ord. dated 1/31/06, § 9122.05.) 
17.88.060 - Offers of dedication for right-of-way-No nonconformity. 
    When a property owner, upon request by the City, offers dedication for right-of-way which results in the reduction of a dimension of the property below the minimum property development requirements in the Zoning Ordinance, Council shall make a finding that such dedication is for public purposes and the reduction in minimum required dimension shall not in and of itself, create a nonconformity, pursuant to this Zoning Code. 
(Zoning Ord. dated 1/31/06, § 9122.06.) 
17.88.070 - Removal of illegal non-conforming structures and uses. 
    Nothing contained in this chapter shall be construed or implied as to allow for the continuation of illegal non-conforming structures and uses. Said structures and uses shall be removed immediately subject to the provisions of this ordinance regarding the enforcement of provisions, and State Law. 
(Zoning Ord. dated 1/31/06, § 9122.07.) 
17.88.080 - Nonconforming lots. 
    Any lawfully created lot that becomes nonconforming with regard to lot area, lot width, or lot depth may be developed for a structure that would otherwise be allowed in that zone as long as all development standards are met with the exception of lot size or dimension, or a variance is obtained for any standards that cannot be achieved. 
(Ord. No. 1510, § 3(2), 9-11-17) 
Chapter 17.92 - PLANNED UNIT DEVELOPMENTS 

17.92.010 - Purpose. 
    Planned Unit Development permits allow greater flexibility in design in integrated developments than is possible through the strict application of zoning district regulations, and encourage the design of well-planned facilities which offer a variety of land uses through creative and innovative planning, including but not limited to the following types of development: 
A.  Residential Development. Residential developments, which may include a variety of housing types and site plans, accessible open (green spaces) or common recreational areas and facilities, and other features of substantial benefit to a viable and balanced community. 
B.  Residential/Commercial Development. Mixed residential/commercial developments that would permit but not be limited to apartments, convenience shopping facilities, professional office, commercial, recreational facilities, or other compatible land uses grouped in a well-designed and coordinated site development. 
C.  Industrial/Commercial Development. Well-designed and controlled groupings of research, service and/or light industrial/commercial uses within an area containing visual and operational amenities, and features, such as selective occupancies, setbacks, landscaping and bulk and building material controls. 
(Zoning Ord. dated 1/31/06, § 9123.01.) 
17.92.020 - Design criteria and considerations. 
A.  In administering the provisions of this chapter, the Community Development Department and the Planning Commission shall take into consideration the extent to which the proposed Planned Unit Development (PUD) generally promotes the purposes of this chapter. It is intended that this chapter be applied to developments capable of achieving the distinct environmental and developmental characteristics and benefits intended by the Planned Unit Development criteria set forth in this chapter. 
B.  The PUD shall observe the following design criteria: 
1.  The overall plan shall be comprehensive, and include all land, buildings, landscaping and their interrelationships. 
2.  The plan shall provide for adequate open space, circulation, off-street parking, recreational facilities and other pertinent amenities as related to the intended use and intensity of development. Buildings, structures and facilities in the parcel shall be well integrated, and oriented to the topographic and natural landscape features of the site, including wildlife passage corridors, when possible. 
3.  The proposed development shall be compatible with existing and planned land uses and with circulation patterns on adjoining properties. It shall not constitute a disruptive element to the neighborhood or community. 
4.  The internal street system should not be a dominant feature in the overall design; rather it should be designed for the efficient and safe flow of vehicles without creating a disruptive influence on the activity and function of any common areas and facilities. 
5.  Common areas and recreational facilities s shall be located so as to be readily accessible to the occupants of the PUD and shall be well related to any common open spaces provided. 
6.  Architectural unity and harmony should be achieved so far as practicable within the development, as well as with historical and other desirable characteristics of the immediate neighborhood, the broader community, and environmental features such as wetlands, trees, other vegetation, and wildlife habitat. 
(Zoning Ord. dated 1/31/06, § 9123.02.) 
17.92.030 - Development standards. 
    In addition to the general provisions of this ordinance and the requirements of the underlying zones, unless modified herein, a PUD shall comply with the following standards: 
A.  Design standards. The PUD project shall be designed to promote more economical and efficient use of the land, to provide a higher level of urban amenities, and to preserve the natural scenic qualities of open spaces. Overall standards for open spaces, circulation, off-street parking and other design criteria should be incorporated to create a harmonious, integrated project of such high quality as to justify exceptions to the regulations that pertain to the zoning district affecting the proposed project. 
B.  Density standards. The density standards of the zone in which the property is located shall apply to residential uses. The total number of dwelling units permitted on a residential portion of planned development shall be computed by multiplying the gross acreage of the site by the permitted density factor. 
C.  Minimum Lot Size. Residential lot size in a Planned Unit Development may be reduced below the minimum standards required by the zoning ordinance. However, as a prerequisite, the developer shall demonstrate that there is a reasonable relationship between the proposed lot size and the usable and accessible open area within the total development. When the required minimum lot area is reduced below the standards set forth in any residential zone, the additional amount of open space provided (above the minimum requirements of the zone) shall be equal to or greater than the sum of all reductions of the required minimum lot size. 
D.  Yards. 
1.  Front Yards. Front yard setback compatible with the existing or potential development adjacent and/or opposite from existing development shall be required to provide for an orderly and uniform transition along the streetscape to preserve, protect, and enhance the properties adjacent to the proposed planned development. The front yard of the proposed Planned Unit Development shall not be less than that of the developed lots, and shall not be less than the minimum requirements of the zoning district in which they are located. Where this is not the case, front yard setbacks shall be shown on the development plan and shall be subject to approval as shown or modified by the Planning Commission. 
2.  Side and rear yards. The side and rear yards for each lot shall be shown on the development plan and shall be subject to approval, as shown, or as modified, by the Planning Commission. 
E.  Development Standards. Development standards for building height, landscaping, lot coverage, types of structures, access and signs, shall meet the requirements of the underlying zones. 
F.  Parking. Parking requirements for each land use shall be consistent with Chapter 17.28, Parking Requirements. 
(Zoning Ord. dated 1/31/06, § 9123.03.) 
17.92.040 - Open spaces, common areas and facilities. 
    Common open spaces shall comprise not less than thirty percent (30%) of the gross site area. Common open space shall be that portion of the gross site area developed for recreational use (such as swimming pool, tennis court, golf course, children's playground, picnic area), and designated for the use and enjoyment of all the occupants within the development, but shall not include streets, highways or other vehicular rights-of-way. 
A.  The topographic constraints of said open space shall be such that at least fifty percent (50%) thereof shall be comprised of level land, or land of moderate slopes not exceeding ten percent (10%) grade. No grading slope or area exceeding a ten percent (10%) grade shall be counted as open space. 
B.  The defined streambed of any water course shall not be counted as open space. 
C.  A declaration of covenants, conditions and restrictions relating to the repair, maintenance and management of the open spaces and common areas and facilities, signed and acknowledged by those parties having any record title to the land to be developed, and enforceable by the City shall be recorded. Such declaration shall provide that an assessment for the purposes of care, maintenance and improvement of the open spaces, common area and facilities upon any lot shall be a lien upon the lot and shall establish a method for making the claim and foreclosure, including power of sale. 
D.  Common open space shall be left in its natural attractive, unique or scenic state, unless landscaped in accordance with an approved landscaping plan. Preservation of scenic landscape features such as watercourses, rock outcroppings, hillsides, sensitive land areas, existing vegetation, wildlife, unique topographic features and views shall be encouraged. Open spaces shall be integrated into the overall design of the project. 
E.  All improvements, located within the common open space, such as landscaping, parks, recreational facilities, travel ways, and parking area, shall be maintained in a safe condition and a state of good repair. 
F.  Any failure to maintain such improvements located within the common areas shall be declared to be unlawful and a public nuisance endangering the health, safety and general welfare of the public and a determent to the surrounding community. 
G.  In addition to any other remedy provided by law for the abatement, removal or correction of such public nuisance, the City, after giving proper notice, may cause the necessary work of maintenance or repair to be done, and the cost thereof shall be assessed against the development property owners and the City may record and collect this assessment in the same manner as property taxes are recorded and collected.

3.  Educational, cultural and institutional uses are also permitted in PUDs which are located in residential zoning districts, and are not subject to the above ten percent maximum. 
B.  Industrial and Commercial Zone Districts. 
1.  All uses permitted in industrial or commercial zones, provided that the juxtaposition of industrial uses with commercial uses is compatible and complementary. 
2.  Residential uses are permitted, provided that the residential use is either above or behind the primary commercial or industrial use, and that separate access is provided. 
(Zoning Ord. dated 1/31/06, § 9123.06.) 
17.92.070 - Authority. 
    Upon compliance by the applicant with the procedures set forth in this chapter and Chapter 17.48, Applications and Fees, the Community Development Department may, as provided herein and upon approval by the Planning Commission, issue in any zoning district a Planned Unit Development Permit designating an area for Planned Unit Development and establishing conditions, standards and requirements for such development pursuant to this chapter.

Chapter 17.104 - TECHNICAL STAFF REVIEW 

17.104.010 - Purpose. 
A.  The purpose of Technical Staff Review is to provide a means and method of administrative review of development projects involving permitted land uses, prior to and as a condition of the issuance of building permits; except those uses listed below. The Director may require review of other projects, such as multi-use projects, phased projects, projects requiring permits from multiple agencies or authorities, or projects without recent local precedent, if the complexity of the project requires additional review. 
B.  Technical Staff Review shall ensure that the design and improvements for the construction of all new or expansion of existing uses permitted by zoning, comply with all applicable City guidelines, standards, codes, regulations and ordinances; are consistent with the City's General Plan and any applicable Specific or Redevelopment Plans; are not injurious to the public health, safety, and welfare; and are not detrimental to surrounding properties, use or improvements. 
(Zoning Ord. dated 1/31/06, § 9126.01.) 
17.104.020 - Projects subject to technical staff review. 
    The construction of all new, or expansion of existing, commercial, industrial and multiple family residential uses listed as "permitted uses" by zoning, shall be subject to Technical Staff Review procedures, except those listed below.

    The following list of projects are exempt from Technical Staff Review: 
A.  Construction of a single-family residence on a legal, existing lot of record. 
B.  The first alteration or expansion of an existing permitted use which results in no more than a 25% or 750 square foot increase, whichever is less, in the floor area of the original permitted use. All subsequent expansion of the existing permitted use shall require Technical Staff Review. 
C.  Interior or exterior remodeling such as partitions, plumbing and or electrical conveyances, HVAC systems, insulation, re-roofing, windows, doors, siding, or similar remodeling, which does not increase the floor area of the permitted use. 
D.  Demolition and/or removal of individual structures, unless the Director considers the structures to be of historic value, or of architectural or cultural interest and significance to the community. Such a structure does not need to rise to the level of being a Historic Landmark, but needs to be considered a distinctive element of the community, and in some sense an asset to the common wealth of a neighborhood or of the municipality as a whole. In cases where a reasonable argument can be made for historic, architectural or cultural significance, the Director shall refer the demolition request to the Planning Commission, which shall hold a public hearing and based upon research and upon comments from the public, determine whether such actions as demolition delay, or preservation of the structure, or some sort of rehabilitation, may be in the best interests of the community. 
E.  Construction and/or replacement of permitted accessory uses and/or structures, limited to satellite dishes, antennas, fences, walls, swimming pools, porches, balconies, cabanas, decks, patio covers, carports, signs or new face copy, landscaping, and similar features. Other regulations and restrictions on these items elsewhere in the City's Zoning Ordinance shall still apply. 
F.  Improvement of parking areas involving less than ten (10) parking spaces. 
G.  Building permits not reviewed hereunder shall be subject to such other review as may be required by the Chief Building Official or by the Chief Building Official's designee.

B.  Any application required by this chapter shall be accompanied by copies of site plans, diagrams, photographs, materials and other information required by the Technical Staff Review Committee. 
(Zoning Ord. dated 1/31/06, § 9126.04.) 
17.104.050 - Technical staff review procedure.

The reviewer shall provide a written recommendation to the Director outlining all of the items on the site plan which must be added, modified or deleted to comply with the City's codes. 
B.  No later than thirty (30) days following the date of the complete Technical Staff Review Application, members of the Committee will review their respective department's recommendation concerning the site plan or other permit application with the applicant, at which time all concerns of all departments will be reviewed. The Committee may reject a site plan and direct that it be resubmitted on the basis that it is incomplete or out of compliance with the City Codes. 
(Zoning Ord. dated 1/31/06, § 9126.05.)

    These provisions shall ensure the following: 
A.

B.  That granting the Variance is necessary for the preservation and enjoyment of a substantial property right possessed by other property in the same vicinity and land use district and denied to the property for which the Variance is sought; 
C.  That granting the Variance will not be materially detrimental to the public health, safety, or welfare, or injurious to the property or improvements in such vicinity and land use district in which the property is located; 
D.  That granting the Variance does not constitute a special privilege inconsistent with the limitations upon other properties (not including non-conforming properties) in the vicinity and land use district in which such property is located; 
E.  That granting the Variance does not allow a use or activity which is not otherwise expressly authorized by the regulations governing the subject parcel; and
